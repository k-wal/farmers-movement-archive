Tamil Nadu government has announced that the state will be under lockdown for two weeks between May 10 and May 24, to contain the Covid virus spread.It had however allowed continuous process industries to operate. Hyundai, which operates one of the largest auto factories in the state will go in for its annual maintenance shutdown for a week starting from Monday. “Our scheduled annual maintenance shutdown activities will take place between May 10 and May 15,” a Hyundai spokesperson said. This means only those involved in maintenance work will come to the factory and no production will happen during this period. In the case of Daimler, the factory in Oragadam is already shut, may reopen on Wednesday while country’s second largest truck and bus maker Ashok Leyland will take a call on reopening its factories in Ennore and Hosur on Wednesday. Its factories are also shut to avoid inventory pile up. TVS Motor Company did not share details on if its factories will open. While sources in two wheeler maker Yamaha said its plants will continue production from Monday, it may opt for a stoppage of production next week as there has been significant inventory build up and almost all big sales markets are shut due to local lockdowns.Mobile phone parts maker Salcomp has already shut down its plant for two weeks since Saturday. “We voluntarily shut down the plant on Saturday as the virus spread is severe. Besides, nearly 8000 people come and go and many of them are from towns and villages from other parts of Tamil Nadu. The early shutdown call helped them reach their home base ahead of the lockdown,” said Sasikumar Gendham, MD of Salcomp Manufacturing India. Foxconn,which makes Apple and Xiaomi phones will continue to operate its plants, but with strict Covid protocols in place, its spokesperson said. Cement makers too are operating their factories. “Our factories will function during the lockdown period,” said AV Dharmakrishnan, MD of Ramco Cements. The IT sector which has moved most of its employees on WFH mode will continue to operate like how it did last week. The TN government lockdown notification allows tech companies to operate on WFH mode for its employees and some mission critical employees may visit offices with prior permission from the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/factories-in-tn-get-ready-for-lockdown-some-have-trimmed-production-already/articleshow/82506663.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli
---||Kolkata||Eid shopping lacks lustre even with special market timings||Kolkata: The pandemic has hit Eid preparations for the second time in a row, dealing an economical blow and leaving traditional shopping hubs deserted. Malls have been shut for over a week as part of restrictions to curb the spread of infection, but the government has allowed special permission to New Market traders and others in the vicinity to open for two hours in the evening to cater to Eid shoppers. However, the response has been lukewarm. Even neighbourhood shops selling apparel, footwear and accessories have not received a good response. “Eid shopping peaks in the last 10 days of Ramzan. People have last-minute shopping, like buying clothes for family members and domestic helps, footwear, vermicelli, dry fruits, spices and other ingredients. But this year, the enthusiasm is missing. People are only buying basics. The business has been hit very hard for the second year in a row,” said Asadullah Rahman, who owns a footwear shop on Rabindra Sarani. The government has granted special permission to traders in New Market and other hubs in the vicinity to open shops between 5pm and 7pm for Eid shoppers. But there have been few customers. “Firstly, people don’t seem to be in the mood for big celebrations this year. Secondly, the 5pm-7pm period is the time when Muslims prepare for iftar, break their fast and pray. Traditionally, Eid shopping is done between 7pm and 11pm,” said Mohammad Ashfaque, who owns an apparel shop in New Market. The intensity with which the second Covid wave has hit and claimed lives has prompted the community to take certain safety measures for the greater good. Eid prayers on Red Road, where over 2 lakh devotees from across the city and suburbs gather, have been cancelled this year too. Many community members have also decided not to wear new clothes or have big celebrations, keeping the grief of others in mind. Many community members said the sadness and personal grief of friends, acquaintances and fellow citizens have made them stay away from celebrations. “So many people have lost their dear ones to the pandemic. Others are struggling to get a hospital bed or oxygen. This is the time to stand by them instead of celebrating,” said Noor-uz-ZamanAhmed, a businessman from central Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/eid-shopping-lacks-lustre-even-with-spl-mkt-timings/articleshow/82506866.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Long Sunday queues, low vaccination numbers||AHMEDABAD: Though more walk-in centres for vaccination have been opened in the city, the number of those who got the jabs on Sunday was only 50% of the number vaccinated on Saturday. People in the eastern part of the city endured hardships, having to queue up from 4am to get the shots. On Sunday, only 12,654 people were vaccinated; the number for Saturday was 23,265. Meanwhile, the AMC has decided to open one more drive-through vaccination centre. The site will be Drive-in Cinema. It will serve only those who are above 45 and have comorbidities. A government employee, who did not want to be identified, said that he along with his wife and their two sons had gone to the urban centre at Nikol at 3am. At about 8.30am, a woman from the AMC told them that the vaccination will be given only at Mangal Pandey Hall. He said that when he reached the hall, a long queue had already formed and he could not get the vaccine. He said that the AMC should ensure adequate supply of vaccines at walk-in centres. He said that those in the age group of 18 to 44 were not even given tokens. Another citizen, Rajesh Chauhan, also had a bad experience in Nikol as he was not given the vaccine though he had waited for two hours. “I was told that those in the age group of 18 to 44 have to come with prior appointment,” he said. On Sunday, of the 12,654 persons vaccinated, 7,552 were in the age group of 18 to 44. Only 3,458 persons above 45 were vaccinated despite the fact that at least seven sites in the city offer the walk-in service. About 1,213 people above 60 were given the jabs. Officials said the low number on a Sunday suggested that the centres had run out of vaccines. They said it also showed that the AMC does not have adequate supplies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/long-sunday-queues-low-vaccination-numbers/articleshow/82506918.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: All Nimtolla furnaces reserved for Covid cremation to clear backlog||KOLKATA: In a bid to cremate a huge backlog of Covid bodies, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) on Sunday shut Nimtolla electric crematorium for non-Covid bodies. The KMC has kept only four wooden pyres for non-Covid bodies, however, very few could avail of this facility considering the queue and cost involved in such a type of cremation. “We have kept all 10 furnaces for cremation of Covid victims to clear the backlog. As and when the backlog is cleared, we shall open the gates for non-Covid bodies,” said a KMC official. But, on record, the KMC brass has attributed the closure of the crematorium to maintenance of furnaces. At present, non-Covid bodies may be taken to Kashi Mitra Ghat, adjacent to Nimtolla and Ramakrishna Mahasamadhi Ghat at Cossipore. A section of the KMC health department officials conceded that the decision to shut Nimtolla temporarily for non-Covid bodies may lead to a heavy rush at Keoratala crematorium and subsequent harassment for residents of large parts of north Kolkata, Salt Lake and the northern fringes. A KMC senior official expressed hope that with the entire crematorium operational, the Covid-body backlog may be cleared by Tuesday night. “We are hoping to open the gates for the non-Covid bodies on Wednesday,” the official said. A KMC source at Nimtolla crematorium said the civic body had earmarked four electric furnaces at the old complex for cremation of Covid victims. However, in recent times this facility is considered grossly inadequate since going by official figures, KMC needs to arrange for cremation of around 90 bodies at the electric crematorium and 10 bodies at the wooden pyres every day. However, a KMC health department official said the actual number of Covid cremation at Nimtolla was much higher. “Every day, no less than 175 Covid bodies are gathering at the crematorium. With our best efforts to utilize the four electric furnaces 24x7, we can cremate only 80 bodies a day,” the official said. Besides, one of the four furnaces recently developed a snag, which further led to a backlog. The queue for Covid cremation at Dhapa, too, grew on Sunday after one of the three furnaces developed a minor snag. The KMC tried to send some bodies to Siriti and Garia crematoriums, but by Sunday evening, the queue at Dhapa had become a reason for concern to the civic authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/all-nimtolla-furnaces-reserved-for-covid-cremation-to-clear-backlog/articleshow/82506931.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Body kept for 17 hours in flat, 12 hours in morgue during crematorium hunt||KOLKATA: The body of an 85-year-old Covid patient who died at home lay in her Salt Lake flat for 17 hours as civic officials claimed they struggled to find a crematorium slot. Prodded by politicians and a section of the media, the body was eventually removed from the flat, but preserved at a morgue for around 12 hours as authorities claimed they would try to cremate her at a Khardah crematorium in the early hours of Monday. The incident highlighted the plight of relatives of Covid victims and the mounting pressure on crematoriums in the city where there is a queue of Covid bodies every hour. Geeta Kumar, a resident of Karunamoyee Abasan, died around 6pm on Saturday and family members — an 80-year-old brother, his wife (78) and their differently abled son (45), and all suffering from Covid — called a relative, who is their family doctor, home. The doctor wrote a death certificate and, while he was leaving in a PPE suit around 8pm, neighbours came to know of the death. “The family was stressed out and had no clue what to do. We first called the local police, who asked us to contact the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation and gave us an official’s number. The official didn’t respond. Around midnight, we managed to get the number of the municipal commissioner, who asked us to send him a copy of the death certificate and the woman’s Covid-positive,” said Manas Das, a neighbour. None in the family has a smartphone and a neighbour finally asked one of them to hold out the certificate, which he photographed and sent to the commissioner, who promised to take prompt action. “But even in the morning none came. We contacted the officials again to which we were told all crematoriums were full and so they were not removing the body. By then, it had started decomposing. Finally, after repeated requests, the officials removed the body around 11am on Sunday,” said Das. A civic official TOI spoke to said they had been trying to remove the body since they had been notified, but couldn’t find a spot at any crematorium. “The Nimtolla crematorium wasn’t accepting new bodies, the one at Dhapa turned us down saying their furnace was under repairs. We were left with two small crowded crematoriums in Khardah and Panihati. We sent two bodies to Khardah on Saturday night, but on Sunday, every crematorium refused us,” the official said. Subjected to pressure from locals, as well as politicians, the civic officials removed the body just before noon, but with all crematoriums still full, they kept it at a government hospital morgue in Khardah till midnight. “We have booked a slot and officials have asked us to bring the body after 12.30am on Monday,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/body-kept-for-17-hrs-in-flat-12-hrs-in-morgue-during-crematorium-hunt/articleshow/82506958.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 3rd doctor held in remdesivir racket||AHMEDABAD: Sola police have arrested a doctor from Jamnagar in connection with the illegal sale of six vials of remdesivir. Three doctors have been arrested so far in the case. The Jamnagar doctor was arrested on Saturday. Two doctors from Surat and a nurse from a private hospital in Anandnagar in Ahmedabad had been arrested on Friday. Police had nabbed a man from Sarkhej in connection with the scam on Tuesday. The third doctor has been identified as Dharmesh Baldania, who has completed his MBBS course from GG Hospital in Jamnagar and was studying MD (radiology) there. “He was posted in the Covid wards and accessed remdesivir injections which he sold to another accused, a Surat-based doctor named Kirti Dave, for Rs 8,500,” said inspector J P Jadeja of Sola police. Earlier, the cops had arrested Milan Sutaria in Surat, who worked as a medical officer at a hospital run by the Surat Municipal Corporation. Dave, the other arrested doctor, worked with a private firm in Surat. Sola police also arrested Ruhi Pathan, a resident of Juhapura, who worked as a nurse. A police source said, “Sutaria and Dave supplied four injections to Jay Shah, a resident of Sarkhej, who was caught with six vials near Kargil petrol pump in Sola on Tuesday.” Pathan gave Shah the other two vials, the source said. “Dave had obtained the remdesivir injections from Baldania for Rs 8,500. He then sold them to Sutaria for Rs 9,500,” said Jadeja. “Sutaria sold the four injections to Shah for Rs 12,000.” Jadeja said that Shah had contacted Sutaria through his friend in Gandhidham, Kutch. “Meanwhile, Pathan, who had earlier sold eight injections to Shah, gave him two injections for Rs 3,300,” said Jadeja. “Shah got her number somehow and contacted her directly for the remdesivir injections. When Shah was arrested, he had the six vials given by the three accused.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3rd-doc-held-in-remdesivir-racket/articleshow/82506979.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal: Rise in active cases slows down, fresh cases still high||KOLKATA: Despite the rise in fresh cases, the rise in number of active cases in the state has slowed down in the past few days. Against 19,441 fresh cases on Sunday, Bengal recorded 863 new active cases. The downswing, health experts said, is due to the high discharge rate in the past few days. However, the new cases reported on Sunday is the highest so far. But what doctors see as a positive sign is that the exponential rise in fresh cases that began from April has now slowed down. Till the last week of April, new cases were rising by around 1,000 on an average per day. They, however, cautioned it was too early to say whether we have reached the peak and infection rate would slow down. “There’s no doubt that the growth in number of fresh cases is marginal and there is a slight increase in the doubling time of the positive cases. But it is too early to say if the curve is flattening,” said community medicine specialist Sanjib Bandyopadhyay of Beliaghata ID Hospital. For seven consecutive days, the number of fresh cases had remained around the 17,000 mark before jumping to 18,102 on May 5 from 17,639 the previous day, an increase of 463. In fact, the rise on Sunday was only by a single digit, five, when the state reported 19,441 cases against 19,436 on Saturday. “It is a good trend. But it has to hold for at least the next 10 days while tests increase. Only then can we conclude we have achieved a plateau. But there should be no laxity in maintaining Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said public health specialist Anirban Dalui. Since the past four days, the state has been testing between 60,000 and 63,000 samples. Even till the second week of April, it was testing between 40,000 to 45,000 samples. Despite the ramp up, doctors said we are still not testing enough. “If we don’t jack up the test numbers significantly, the number of positive cases will remain stagnant or rise marginally. A portion of the test numbers could be repeat tests on positive patients in hospital. We are missing out on patients who are mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic. We cannot afford to miss out on these if we are to contain the spread of the infection fast,” said paediatric intensivist Prabhas Prasun Giri, associate professor at Institute of Child Health. Doctors are also wary of the increasing number of rapid antigen tests. Of the 63,095 tests conducted in the past 24 hours, about 21,000 were rapid tests. Health officials said this was due to pressure on RT-PCR laboratories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rise-in-active-cases-slows-down-fresh-cases-still-high/articleshow/82507011.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

On Saturday cops arrested two persons from a shop in the Ellisbridge area of city. According to the city crime branch officers, they got an input on Saturday that two men working with a medical equipment firm near Town Hall in Ellisbridge have been charging exorbitantly for medical oxygen. One of the crime branch cops posed as customer and demanded an oxygen cylinder of 10litres and 47litres capacity respectively. The duo identified as, Jasmin Bundela, 29, resident of Shahpur Chakla and Sagar Shukla, 24, a resident of Vasna, told the cop that they will sell cylinders of 10 litres of oxygen for Rs15,000 and 47 litres for Rs 28,000. The cop went to their shop and when they were receiving the cylinders, other police personnel nabbed the accused red-handed. The two accused told cops that they got the oxygen regulators which they were supposed to sell at Rs 5,500 to the needy persons, from a man named Kaushal Jani from Kalupur. Crime branch cops seized two oxygen cylinders and four oxygen regulators from the duo and booked them under charges of negligent use of explosive substance, cheating and criminal conspiracy along with essential commodities act and disaster management act. The crime branch had earlier on Friday nabbed three men for black marketing of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/overcharging-for-oxygen-2-nabbed/articleshow/82507012.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal buys Covaxin directly from manufacturer; 1 lakh doses land in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The first consignment of the Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin, procured by the Bengal government directly from manufacturer Bharat Biotech landed in Kolkata early on Sunday morning. With the 1 lakh doses of the vaccine arriving in the city, the state might get a boost for the phase-III trial of inoculating people in the 18-44 age group. More vaccine vials are expected to reach Kolkata on Monday. “The 1 lakh Covaxin doses which arrived on Sunday was procured directly by the Bengal government from the manufacturers. We will be getting more vaccines on Monday — a portion of which will be Bengal’s own procurement and a portion from the government of India channel,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar. According to sources in the state health department, 35,000 vials of Covishield purchased directly from Serum Institute of India by the state government will be shipped from Pune on Monday and will land in Kolkata airport in the afternoon. Along with this, another consignment of 39,530 vials of Covishield from the government of India channel will arrive on the same aircraft. “There is a growing demand for vaccines from people in the 18-44 age bracket. We have started procuring vaccine for this priority group and should be able to launch the phase-III drive soon,” said a health department source. Officials said the Bengal government is in the process of procuring more vaccines to ensure steady supply so that the phase-III drive does not come to an abrupt halt due to non-availability of supply. In a communication in the third week of May, the central government had told the state that the vaccine supplied from the Centre should be utilized only for vaccinating those in the 45-plus age group. The Centre had added that the state could procure vaccine for the rest on its own. “Because of the supply crisis, I feel we could sub-categorize this 18-44 group into people who need it the most and those who don’t. For example, people who need to go out regularly for work and economic activities, and essential services, like media persons, hawkers or public transport vehicle drivers, could be given priority,” said community medicine specialist Sanjib Bandyopadhyay of ID Hospital. The supply crisis has retarded the inoculation drive that had picked up speed where close to 4 lakh doses had been administered on several days through March and the early part of April, and above 3,000 sessions were conducted in a day. But as the supply kept dropping, the government scaled down its drive. For several weeks now, the number of daily vaccination sessions has remained around 1,500 on an average. “On Sunday, 558 inoculation sessions were conducted across the state where a little above 8,000 doses could be administered till 5pm,” said director health services Ajay Chakraborty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-buys-covaxin-directly-from-manufacturer-1l-doses-land-in-city/articleshow/82507035.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

On Sunday, 50 people living in Rajkot city and hailing from Kherdi village on Ahmedabad highway had to return disappointed as stocks got over at the primary health centre of the village. These people had registered themselves on the CoWin application and booked slots, but were told there were no vaccines when they reached the health centre. “We rebooked another slot at health centre of Navagam village, but there too vaccines were not available,” said Ashok Patel, a native of Kherdi village. Patel had gone with his entire family to the health centre. “Our entire morning was wasted,” he said. In Rajkot city too, the situation is no different. At Shiv Shakti colony in ward 10, people queued up outside the government primary school from 7 am to get the token. The centre opened three hours later to give out the tokens. Once 200 jabs, 100 for 45 years and above and the rest for 18 to 44 years are administered, the remaining people have to go again the next day. “For the last eight days I have been visiting this centre, but there is no planning at all. The paid facilities too are not getting the vaccine stock otherwise I could have gone there,” Dilip Basiya, who is in construction business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/test-of-citizens-patience-first-at-many-rajkot-vaccine-centres/articleshow/82507151.cms||---

Vasik Ahmed Shaikh, the man who had to deal with the irritable simian guest, said he received no help either from government departments or private agencies. The monkey left the house after a five-hour reign. The monkey had taken over the second floor of Shaikh’s house. Shaikh said that on Sunday, at about 9am, 15 to 20 monkeys sauntered into the area. The monkey that was left behind chased away anybody that approached it, so all attempts to drive it away failed. Shaikh said that he called several government departments, including the forest department, but little assistance was offered. “I then called the police control room and the cops gave me the numbers of animal rescuers,” he said. “But these people did not respond.” Shaikh said that finally some forest officials came to the area and informed him they can trap the monkey only if it was injured or if it had hurt anyone. Shaikh said that he was puzzled and rendered helpless by the criteria to trap the intruding monkey. Animal experts contended that the monkey was perhaps waiting for its group to return so that it could rejoin its friends and family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/monkey-checks-in-stays-for-5-hours/articleshow/82507152.cms||---

Jadeja had been harbouring a grudge against the hospital since April 16 when his father Dileepsinh died few days after doctors there found that there was no need to hospitalize him.Jayesh Chavda, the hospital administrator, lodged a complaint against two two Malviyanagar police station. “On April 9, Jadeja brought his father Dileepsinh for a medical check-up at the hospital where Dr Viraj Gajipara examined him. He found nothing wrong clinically and sent him home. However, Dileepsinh died on April 16 at home. This led Jadeja to believe that his father died due to doctor's negligence,” Chavda said in his complaint.On Saturday night, Jadeja and Jethwa, who were both drunk, went to the hospital and started manhandling the staff and ransacking parked vehicles. “The entire brawl was captured in the CCTV footage. We have arrested both the accused and are probing the case,” police said.Police also at least six cases including those of rioting, Arms Act and bootlegging have been lodged against them earlier.They were booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code including 336 (act of endangering life or personal safety of others), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/two-history-sheeters-held-for-ransacking-covid-hospital/articleshow/82507211.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata police scout for quarantine units||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Police has begun scouting for guest houses and hotels that can be used for setting up beds for quarantine. The cops want to use these facilities to primarily send sick cops to isolation units. Sources said that though the initial target was to set up as many as a thousand beds, the targets have been revised given “practical constraints and the fact that not many facilities are still available.” According to Lalbazar, all these quarantine centres are to be run by the different wings of Kolkata Police. “We had managed to set up several such localized quarantine centres during the first wave. Necessary instructions have been passed to revive and augment them,” said an officer at Lalbazar. Sources said that last year, at the time of crisis, the Eden Gardens facility had come as a major boost for the force. “Given almost all stadiums are now functioning as hospitals, what we are facing as a major challenge is to get an area big enough to accommodate a large number of our sick men,” explained an officer. The force now has over 320 positive cases in the second wave. While 4300-odd police personnel got infected in the first wave, total death in force stands at 25. Sources said establishing these quarantine centres have become necessary after it was noticed that colleagues in barracks and family members of cops are getting affected in larger numbers in this second wave. The cops also want to reserve some portion of these beds for commoners, especially the elderly living in slum areas. One of the first to be off the blocks is the Behala division which reopened its quarantine centre at Taratala. The facility can handle at least six cases and the target now is to ramp up this facility to 20. “The top brass has asked everyone to ensure that barracks are sanitized and treated as single entities, different from police stations so as to ensure that those reporting to work from their homes do not carry the virus to those residing at the barracks,” explained an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-scout-for-quarantine-units/articleshow/82507262.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Those arrested were Sanjay Harniya (28), an LLB degree holder who started working as a doctor, and his friend Jignesh Taviya (23) who was assisting him as compounder at a clinic in Sanali village of Vinchhiya taluka. Both were booked under Medical Practitioners' Act 1963. Police seized medicines, glucose bottles, oximeters and other material worth Rs 81,000 from the clinic. “We had received a specific tip-off that the duo was practising medicine without degrees,” police said. During questioning, it was revealed that Harniya was earlier working with a well-known pharmacy shop in Rajkot city from where he learnt about medicine prescription. He started the clinic about a year-and-a-half ago along with his friend Taviya in his native Sanali village. “Since villagers knew that both had no medical degrees, they were not consulting them. But people from nearby villages did frequent the clinic for consultation,” sources said. Sources also said that Sanjay was also treating Covid-19 positive patients and prescribing medicines as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/llb-bcom-grads-turn-quacks-for-quick-bucks/articleshow/82507279.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Kutch cylinder units restart as liquid oxygen supply resumes||AHMEDABAD: Oxygen cylinder manufacturing plants in Kutch district have resumed operations with liquid oxygen being made available to them. The oxygen cylinder makers had to temporarily shut production for the want of liquid oxygen amid the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases and the consequent spike in the demand for the lifesaving gas from hospitals. Liquid oxygen is a raw material used in the process of making seamless cylinders that store medical-grade oxygen. As an input, liquid oxygen is used to generate high temperature for making bottoms and necks of empty cylinders. “Both the units in Kandla SEZ have resumed operations and they are making oxygen cylinders,” confirmed Dr Amiya Chandra, zonal development commissioner, Kandla Special Economic Zone (KASEZ). KASEZ houses the plants of two leading seamless cylinder makers, Everest Kanto Cylinder and Rama Cylinders. There is one more plant operated by Rama Cylinders at Bhimsar in Anjar. “This unit is also functional now,” said a source privy to the information. These units could resume operations with liquid oxygen being made available through different resources, including imports, arrangement from other states, and procurement from local suppliers within Gujarat, said sources aware of the matter. “The government provided liquid oxygen imported from Saudi Arabia, while our local supplier also resumed the supply. Hence, we could restart producing oxygen cylinders,” said one of top cylinder manufacturers in the Kandla SEZ. A consignment of liquid oxygen was also arranged from another state for one of the units in Kutch, said sources aware of the matter. The local authorities are also monitoring the supply of liquid oxygen being made available to these units, added sources. Oxygen cylinder manufacturers had been forced to stop production at their plants for a few days as they were unable to procure liquid oxygen for running their plants. These plants could not be supplied the required liquid oxygen as local suppliers were providing all their supplies to hospitals to save human lives amid the fierce second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/kutch-cylinder-units-restart-as-liquid-oxygen-supply-resumes/articleshow/82507285.cms||Kalpesh Damor

The centre is likely to open on Tuesday. The authorities also plan to take up more off-site vaccination camps in gated communities in New Town following huge demands. The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) also plans to set up more safe homes through tie-ups with hospitals in Salt Lake and Rajarhat area. The authorities are in touch with a number of hospitals for implementing this project, civic officials said. A six-bedded isolation facility was opened at Duttabad’s Bagpara area on Sunday. The NKDA is now operating one walk-in RT PCR testing centre at Eco Park’s gate No. 1 ticket counter in association with a private healthcare organization where about 100 tests are being conducted daily. The second testing centre is expected to open at the New Town mela ground. “As for the off-site vaccination camps, camps have already been held at Uniworld City and Rosedale complex. Several requests from housing societies are pending which will be taken subject to availability of vaccines and number of registrations and we will also try to hold off-site vaccination camp to administer the second doses of vaccine in Uniworld City and Rosedale,” said an official. The NKDA has set up a Covid war room at its headquarters, with teams dedicated to the job of managing Covid-related issues in the township and tackling the pandemic in a coordinated manner. Separate teams have been formed to look into the issues of vaccination, Covid testing, cremation of the Covid victims, providing free meals for senior citizens who are infected, looking into social distancing in markets through miking and drones, sanitisation, home call for supporting isolated Covid positive patients and coordinating with the safe houses. Each of the cells has an internal Whatsapp group among the team members and a ‘Covid Cells-In-Charge’ Whatsapp group to assist in their functioning. The authorities are also compiling a list of workers at construction sites in New Town and Sector V to bring them under the inoculation umbrella at the earliest. “This exercise is expected to be completed by next week. We will be waiting for government instructions and availability of vaccines for deciding the dates for holding vaccination camps for the construction workers near their workplace,” said an official. Meanwhile, the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) is receiving reports of over 500 daily new Covid cases as the civic authorities are also planning to turn the local clubs in Salt Lake and Rajarhat area into Covid safe houses. Last year, a number of clubs in Rajarhat and Duttabad had been used as safe houses for mild or asymptomatic Covid patients. The BMC civic workers are getting inoculated and the authorities are intensifying its sanitisation drive. The BMC is conducting two RT PCR testing centers, one in Salt Lake and another in Rajarhat and vaccination camps are being held at the civic body-run Matri Sadan hospitals and urban primary health centers as per availability of vaccine vials, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nkda-to-ramp-up-vax-and-testing-sites-bmc-plans-more-safe-houses/articleshow/82507297.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The priest, Kamlesh Labadiya, had poisoned his son Ankit (21) and daughter Krupali (22) before attempting to end his own life. While Anikt died on April 3, Labadiya succumbed on April 4. On Saturday night, Rajkot Taluka police also arrested Dileep Korat, a factory owner living in Rajkot’s Udaynagar, who was booked after Labadiya named in him in the suicide note. Korat, 46, was on the run since April 2. Labadiya, a resident of Shivam Park in Nana Mava area of Rajkot, had sunk to heavy depression after being allegedly cheated by Korat and Rajesh Vora, a lawyer, whom he had sold his house for Rs 1.29 crore. Labadiya fed Ankit and Krupali poison-laced water saying that it was a medicine that would protect them from Covid-19 infection. However, his wife Jayshree, who was busy with some other work, did not consume it. Labadiya’s elder brother Kanji had lodged a complaint against Korat and Vora under various sections of Indian Penal Code including 306 (abetment of suicide), 406 (criminal breach of trust), and 120B (criminal conspiracy) among others. “Korat and Vora had paid Rs 20.51 lakh to Labadiya and the remaining amount was to be paid after signing of the sale deed. But the duo reportedly told him that they have paid him Rs 61 lakh which was to be given in cash. My brother was afraid that he wouldn’t get the amount and so, decided to kill his whole family and end his life by suicide,” his brother had said in his police complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/priests-22-year-old-daughter-too-succumbs/articleshow/82507302.cms||---

According to official records,the number of forest fires has reduced from 1,276 in 2017-18 to 753 in 2019-20. Government sources say that the discernible reduction in instances of forest fires is a result of adopting a scientific approach in both dousing and prevention of forest fires in the state. The state forest department has adopted a multi-pronged strategy to contain instances of forest fires. To begin with, the department has divided huge chunks of grasslands in forests into smaller parts with a gap of no grass in between. Machines are used to cut down grass in such a way that in the caseof a fire, only a patch of grass gets burnt down and the fire does not spread to other areas of the forest. Another method that is being used by the forest department setting off controlled fires within forest areas to burn down unwanted plants like weeds and other unproductive shrubs. A section of the forest is isolated and set on fire in a controlled manner to remove unwanted plants form the forest. The government informed in the assembly that all forest staff have been registered with the Forest Survey of India Fire Alert System. Staff get alerts of fires on their mobile phones. Apart from these measures, forest staff have been asked to regularly patrol areas which are vulnerable to fires, the government informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/marked-reduction-in-forest-fires-in-state/articleshow/82507310.cms||---

They were worried because there was no one to look after their children — aged six and nine years — who had tested negative as their their relatives were also Covid-19 positive. Just then, the Maher NGO, willingly accepted to take care of the children till their parents were discharged from the hospital. Like the Barne couple, many other families were able to recover from Covid-19 while their children were being looked after by NGOs in the city. Sister Lucy Kurien, who founded the Maher NGO, said, “We have been looking after children and adults for several years and this was the time to extend our efforts and help those in dire need.”The NGO does not charge any money for the children they look after. They ensure the children get their meals and also keep them entertained by conducting activities such as art classes, among others.Another couple, Sandhya and Nimish Tiwari, who are construction workers at a site in Pimple Gurav, were also infected with Covid in mid-April. With no relatives in Pune and a five-year-old daughter that tested negative, the couple had to be admitted to a civic hospital as their oxygen saturation levels had gone down to 80. The mother said, “I was more worried about my child. Although I was fine in the first two days, I had to be admitted later. My husband was admitted immediately after testing positive, which was around three days before me. The social worker in the area suggested that I keep my daughter at an NGO nearby, which looked after children. As I knew the social worker for a few years, I took the risk. My daughter was taken care of very well.”Ashwini Rathi, the social worker who works in Wakad and Sanghvi areas for a collective of NGOs in the city, said the children were suffering as many parents were not in a position to keep them at home. “We have spread awareness of our work in the vastis and settlements across the city to make use of the NGO facilities, which have come to the rescue of these parents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ngos-look-after-kids-as-their-parents-recover-from-covid/articleshow/82507320.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Kolkata||Kolkata clubs turn into Covid care facilities for patients in need||KOLKATA: Multiple clubs in Kolkata have turned their premises into safe homes and isolation centres with 24 x 7 medical oxygen facility and round-the-clock medics at work, in a bid to support the city’s healthcare system that is struggling to cope up with the rising number of Covid patients, many of whom are dying in want of medical oxygen and a hospital bed. The transformations of the clubs into Covid care facilities came following a May 3 advisory by the Department of Health and Family Welfare, West Bengal Government, pleading for community help in setting up community-based isolation centres with basic oxygen support and various premises. At Atlanta Club on the Golf Club Road, the organisers are set to inaugurate a nine-bedded Covid care facility at the concrete mandap where they organise Durga puja every year. “Seeing the city gasping for breath, we couldn’t sit back and do nothing. Hence, we have set up this Covid care facility with dedicated oxygen supply where patients in urgent need can come and get basic medication till the time they get a bed,” said Rajiv Hariharan, a senior functionary of the club. Hariharan added the club also cooks meals for Covid patients daily at the club premises and has set up a team of volunteers who deliver food as well as oxygen cylinders to patients in need. At Taltala Sporting Association in Thakurpukur — that is known for running football coaching camps for men and women and basketball and karate training centres — the club functionaries in association with Quarantined Student Youth and Network, a body of students working for Covid patients in the city, have set up an isolation centre at the ground floor of their club premises. Efforts were also being made to set up tents outside the club and accommodate more patients but considering the nor’westers and frequent rain during this time of the year, the plan was scrapped. “We are just doing our bit and have set up a 10-bedded isolation unit here. But the entire facility is mostly managed by students of the Quarantined Student Youth and Network. We feel proud to be part of the initiative and able to offer a space to them,” said Dilip Banerjee, the club president Also at Fartabad in Kamalgazi, a Covid-19 relief facility has come up at a two-storeyed club Kandarpapur Welfare Society with a joint effort of students, social workers and a bunch of Tollywood actors like Parambrata Chattopadhyay, Rwitobroto Mukherjee, Surangana Bandyopadhyay, Riddhi Sen and singer-composer Anupam Roy under the banner of Bangla Sanskriti Mancha “The centre opened for patients on Saturday and has been running full since then. We are admitting patients only on the basis of doctor’s prescription and state health department registration and are notifying the patients that it’s a facility where they can stay only for a day before being shifted to a hospital. We are also facilitating the patient relatives in their quest for a bed while the patient gets interim relief at our centre,” said Tanmoy Ghosh, one of the primary organisers of the isolation centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-clubs-turn-into-covid-care-facilities-for-patients-in-need/articleshow/82507321.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Apart from that, 400 food packets are distributed every day to doctors, paramedical staff, needy people like destitutes and relatives of Covid patients. Along with that, as many as 272 employees who work with dead body vans were given around 500 PPE kits, hand gloves, masks by these philanthropists on Sunday so that they would not catch the deadly virus infection. On this occasion, Dani said, “In the times of Covid-19 pandemic, this was a humble attempt to help the frontline warriors and others involved in the work of helping Covid patients.” Last year also, Dani started community kitchens for migrant workers and others who were affected by the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ppe-kits-food-packets-distributed/articleshow/82507327.cms||---
---||Goa||In Lavinio’s death, GFA has lost a strong pillar: Alemao||Panaji: Goan football lost its pillar, notably in the north, with the death of Goa Football Association (GFA) vice president Lavinio Rebello late on Saturday. Rebello served GFA for almost two decades in various capacities. From a Bardez zone executive committee member in 2002, he rose to become the treasurer and then vice-president for multiple terms.  Just like in football, Rebello, 54, was on course to make a comeback of his own after battling Covid-19 for the last 15 days in three hospitals. Just when things seemed fine, his health deteriorated all of a sudden last night.  He is survived by his mother, who he often liked to speak about, and two sisters. The funeral was held at St Michael’s Church, Anjuna, on Sunday. At the village level, Rebello served as a sarpanch and was the current panch member of Anjuna-Caissua panchayat. Rebello’s contribution to Goan football has been immense.  “Very saddened and shocked by the sad demise of my dear friend Lavinio Rebello. We lost a strong pillar of GFA. My condolences to his family,” said GFA president Churchill Alemao. Rebello had turned 54 last month and was overseeing the conduct of the Goa Professional League at Duler Football Stadium in Mapusa. It was not uncommon to see him pick up the microphone and make announcements. He always remained humble. Rebello had a major influence in north Goa and played crucial roles during elections. His handpicked men almost always won and his backing was important for any president hopeful of wining votes, particularly in Bardez. He was also vociferous when fighting for a good cause. Whether it was better facilities for players or struggling inter-village clubs, he was in the forefront.  The physical education teacher at St Mary’s HS, Mapusa touched the lives of many youngsters, many of whom took to social media platforms to express their gratitude. “Saddened to hear about the passing away of GFA Vice-President Mr Lavinio Rebello. Your contribution to Goan football will be fondly remembered. I pray for his family to have strength in this hour of grief. May his soul Rest in peace,” Mapusa MLA Joshua De Souza said in a tweet.  Rebello’s contribution to football went beyond the state’s boundaries. He was deputy chairman of the All India Football Federation’s futsal and beach football committee and planned to give futsal a boost by conducting courses and tournaments, until Covid-19 cases surged.  Rebello was instrumental in getting sponsorships for the Goa Women’s League, First Division League and kept himself busy at the stadium when GFA got an artificial turf for the first time at Duler.  Football associations across the country condoled Rebello’s demise. Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Sikkim, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Lakshadweep, Daman and Karnataka have all remembered his contribution.  The Goa Olympic Association, Goa Table Tennis Association, Goa Squash Association, Goa Badminton Association, Goa Volleyball Association, Goa Basketball Association and Goa Boxing Association sent messages of its own.  “It’s hard to find people like Lavinio who remained committed to Goan football and worked selflessly for many years,” said Goa’s first Arjuna Award winner and Goa Football Development Council chairman Brahmanand Shankhwalkar. “He was GFDC member and had a big role to play. Whenever we have our meetings or watch a match at Duler, it won’t be the same. Lavinio will be missed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-lavinios-death-gfa-has-lost-a-strong-pillar-alemao/articleshow/82507326.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 22-year-old daughter held for killing man in Anandapur||Kolkata: A 22-year-old woman was arrested on Saturday for allegedly killing her father at Chowbhaga Majhipara in Anandapur. The woman, Moumita Majhi, was angry as her marriage was called off after her father, Bapi, had misbehaved with her would-be in-laws. On November 2 last year, she found that her father, who was alone at home, was in physical discomfort. She took the chance and smothered her father to death. The victim’s wife Susama found him lying on the floor. Cops took him to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital where he was declared brought dead. This was the second instance in the recent past in the city where a daughter murdered her father. The first case was reported from Tangra where a woman had set her father ablaze at Chandpal Ghat in March this year. The Chowbhaga case had not progressed much with the victim’s family accepting it as a natural death. The autopsy surgeon of NRS Hospital stated “the death was due to the effects of manual strangulation — the injuries were ante-mortem in nature and the manner was homicidal.” After the elections ended on April 10, the top brass of police asked all divisional DCs to pursue all postmortem reports and ensure all cases were accounted for. In keeping with the post-mortem report, Anadapur police on April 24 registered a murder FIR pertaining to the death of Bapi. The woman was questioned for 72 hours and she broke down, confessing that she had killed her father. “Preliminary enquiry revealed that he was having a chest pain. He took some food, believing that the pain was due to acidity. He was taking rest at home while his wife and son went out for work. her daughter was alone at home. We questioned the daughter who admitted to the crime,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/22-yr-old-daughter-held-for-killing-man-in-anandapur/articleshow/82507353.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kolkata||2 city youths in Kolkata join war against ‘fake forwards’||KOLKATA: Two youths of the city, who are now associated with an advertising agency, have started a fight against fake forwards on social media, which are on the rise in recent times. That is simply the use of backward key — sending back the message to the sender with a question mark. The use of a backward key is intended to create suspicion about the content so that a person can send this back to the one who had forwarded this fake message to another person. The duo, Mayur Verma and Rwitayan Mukherjee made a short film on how dangerous a fake forward can be. The film showed a riotous mob almost lynching a woman who is pleading for her innocence when a kid came with a reverse arrow in his hands to force the mob ponder over the authenticity of the forward. The film went viral and people have slowly started questioning the authenticity of a forward — often a lie in the garb of a news. “Disturbed by the ill-effects of fake forwards, we had been working on this idea for more than three years, looking for the right brand partner to take the message to maximum people,” said Verma, a creative head with an advertising agency.  “With widespread awareness and mass adoption, the Back Button can keep the spread of fake forwards under check,” said Mukherjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-city-youths-join-war-against-fake-forwards/articleshow/82507380.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The installation is being carried out by a team from the supplying company, he said. The project will cost Rs4.10 crore and is aimed at easing the oxygen requirements of hospitals in rural Pune to a large extent. “Each plant/unit can generate 100 jumbo cylinders in 24 hours; these hospitals would get oxygen on time. Currently, they have different requirements and are supplied by private agencies,” the district’s additional civil surgeon Nitin Bilolikar told TOI on Sunday. The district administration is also in the process of activating private plants in industrial zones. Dr B B Gadve, tehsil health officer of the Khed, said, “The rural hospital at Chandoli has 45 oxygen beds and needs 25-30 jumbo oxygen cylinders per day. The concentrator will meet that need; we will have a surplus.” A senior ZP health official said, “Several dedicated Covid health centres (DCHCs) couldn’t get the required oxygen supply recently. Considering a potential third wave, expected in August, keeping the health infrastructure in a ready state is of paramount importance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sub-district-rural-hospitals-get-medical-grade-concentrators/articleshow/82507383.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Doctors in complexes help residents tide over Covid crisis||KOLKATA: In several housing complexes across the city, Covid teams have been formed and they are acting like 24-hour helplines to the affected families. Most of these teams have multiple doctors who are also the residents of these complexes. Even in the dead of the night when there is any emergency, they are at the forefront, arranging beds or oxygen cylinders so that the patients can get primary treatment and the trauma can be eased. The numbers of the doctors, who are the key members of these Covid teams, have been shared with all the flat owners of the respective complexes. They can call to be added to the groups that have been created for Covid patients or their families.  At any given time of the day, there is a doctor along with other team members who are monitoring the group for any emergency. Routine check-ups via video calls are also being arranged and all the requirements of the patients — from consultations with doctors at hospitals, medicines to oxygen support and food — are being arranged. Residents said that even when there is a sheer crisis of hospital beds all around, the proactive role of the doctors made it easy for them to handle the situation. There are four doctors in the crisis management team of South City Residency. All of them are associated with different leading hospitals of the city. They are following a roster to help out the team. “They are just a call away and are helping out with each patient. The crises are not snowballing into a panic because of their presence,” said Manoj Gupta, president of the complex. Doctors like cardiac surgeon Pradip Narayan, doctor of medicine Ranabir Choudhury and Subir Basak are helping out the complex tide over the crisis. “From organising the vaccine camp to a patient developing complications at night, these three doctors are a call away with a smile,” said Sudeep Ganguly, convenor of the welfare association of the complex. More than 70 doctors reside at Urbana and they are being led by two doctors, Archana Sinha and Debkishore Gupta, in helping Covid patients get hospitalised or get on with their home treatment. “Sinha is the president of the complex and that makes it better for us,” said S Ramani Iyer, secretary. In the Covid management team at Udita, there are 14 people who are assisted by 10 resident doctors. They have trained security and housekeeping staff too. “Our doctors wish to share the credit with each of us,” said president D Nath. Two of the seven doctors at Siddha Pines are doing Covid duty without a break. Of them, Devraj Pal is continuously attending to Covid patients in the wee hours of a day voluntarily, said president Manav Mehera.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/doctors-in-complexes-help-residents-tide-over-cov-crisis/articleshow/82507392.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Delhi||Declare judicial staff frontline workers, give Rs 1cr to kin: PIL in Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Referring to the recent deaths of two judicial officers of the subordinate judiciary, a public interest litigation (PIL) has urged Delhi high court to declare them frontline workers and pay Rs 1 crore to their families ex gratia. The PIL, filed by advocate Tanvir Ahmed Mir, also sought a direction for collating details of all those staffers of the subordinate judiciary and Delhi high court who might have died due to Covid-19 while performing their duty and payment of an ex gratia not less than Rs 50 lakh to their kin. “The petitioner and his associate lawyers are deeply anguished at the fact of a number of judicial officers, court staff members and officials of the registry, along with their family members, most unfortunately losing their lives due to the current pandemic of Covid-19, especially in its second wave post March 2021,” the PIL stated. It further argued that a considerable number of officers were undergoing a “harrowing experience” of not being able to meet the expenses of the medical treatment. “Also a number of officers and their immediate relatives most unfortunately have lost their lives as well,” the petition added. The PIL further stated that the right from April 2020, the subordinate judiciary and court staff had risked their lives for the livelihood of their family members and gone to court premises, “organised the filings and achieved the target of complete coordination between the general public at large, the lawyers community as well as the judicial community”. It added, “A number of court staff members as well as judicial officers got infected but nevertheless attended the court hearings, facilitating the same for the benefit of the general public at large.” Therefore, the petition, among other things, urged the high court to hold that K Venugopal, family court judge, Saket district courts, and Kamran Khan, metropolitan magistrate, Dwarka district courts lost their lives in the line of duty as frontline warriors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/declare-judicial-staff-frontline-workers-give-rs-1cr-to-kin-pil-in-hc/articleshow/82507393.cms||---

She said that she tied up with dancer Avirup Sengupta’s NGO, Prayas, and she is getting food delivered at the doorsteps of positive patients who are in home isolation. “As many families are affected, there is none to step out for shopping or to cook food. We are supplying cooked food twice to around 40 people at their houses. Avirup proposed the idea and I readily accepted to do something during this crisis period,” she said. “We started it in the places like Garia, Patuli and the areas around Bypass in southern parts of the city. Still I find many people are not wearing masks. I will post a video and urge them to wear it,” she added. The actor is talking to two city hospitals so that vaccination can be done for around 100 specially-abled people for free. “I will bear the cost partly. There are long queues in front of the vaccination centres. So, disabled people find it difficult for them to stand in queues to be inoculated,” she said. Avirup said they are providing some medicines to the Covid positive patients and thanked a social worker Piyali Dutta for her aid to their initiative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/actor-lends-helping-hand-to-cov-patients/articleshow/82507404.cms||---

This initiative has been successful in Punjab. On Sunday, the service started from 11am and till late evening, around 18 patients availed of the service. “To get this service, people are required to bring an authorized doctor’s prescription recommending the need for oxygen, along with Aadhar card. The sewa is on a first-come-first-serve basis and it will cost nothing,” said Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, general secretary of the Gurdwara Behala and chairman of IHA Foundation. As of now, the organizers are planning to operate the service between 9am and 9pm. “We will extend the timings as per requirement. We are also mulling mobile services as part of our future endeavours,” said Ahluwalia. According to the system now put in place, once the patient arrives, doctors and medical support staff check their oxygen levels and other critical levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/oxygen-langar-at-gurdwara-behala/articleshow/82507448.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Pune||Seven booked for damaging vehicles||Pune: The police have registered a case against seven persons, including a woman, for damaging two four-wheelers and two bikes. The vehicles were damaged at Harpalenagar in Phursungi late on Friday night. A four-wheeler and a motorcycle belonged to the woman, who lodged an FIR relating to the incident on Saturday morning. The police said that one of the suspects owns a pet dog that recently bit the complainant’s relative. The complainant decided to take up the matter with the suspects and this led to an argument on Friday afternoon. Later, the suspects damaged the vehicles parked in front of the complainant’s house around 10.45pm. Sub-inspector RS Dhaware of the Hadapsar police station said, “A few days ago, the relative came to meet the complainant. The dog owner had then left the pet off leash and the dog bit the relative. This led to an argument between them. We are also verifying the dog bite claim.” “The complainant’s neighbours did not take the argument kindly. They picked sharp weapons and damaged the vehicles parked on the road in the locality to teach the complainant a lesson,” he said. The police have registered a case of rioting and mischief under the Indian Penal Code against the seven persons. The police have also invoked provisions of the Indian Arms Act against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/seven-booked-for-damaging-vehicles/articleshow/82507451.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Oxygen supply still 29% short of daily demand||NEW DELHI: Delhi received 499 metric tonnes of medical oxygen on Saturday, which is around 71% of the national capital’s demand. The supply still remained short by 201 MT. According to the oxygen bulletin released by Delhi government, the number of SOS calls received from hospitals, nursing homes and other healthcare facilities have come down to four calls on Saturday — a huge drop from 50-60 SOS calls a few days back. All the four calls were addressed by sending liquid medical oxygen tankers by the emergency team of the government. These four hospitals have 1,271 beds linked with oxygen supply and a total of 15.5 MT oxygen was supplied to them. The bulletin stated that over the last seven days, the city has received an average of 533 tonnes of oxygen, which is just 76% of the demand that has also been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court. While the number of SOS calls have gone down, Delhi has received oxygen more than its projected demand only on one occasion when 730 MT oxygen was provided to the city. AAP functionaries have demanded that instead of making ad hoc arrangements after adverse remarks by the high court and Supreme Court, the Centre should provide medical oxygen of Delhi’s quota from reliable and steady sources. Battling an oxygen shortage crisis like many other states, against the demand of 700 MT Delhi received 488 MT oxygen on Friday, 577 MT on Thursday and 730 MT on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/oxygen-supply-still-29-short-of-daily-demand/articleshow/82507458.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: RTO caps siren usage for ambulance drivers||PUNE: The Regional Transport Office (RTO), Pune has issued a stern warning to ambulance drivers against using sirens during the late evening and night hours, when there is little to no traffic on the streets. The RTO officials, reacting to multiple complaints by people living in residential areas, have said that ambulance drivers could see hefty fines and even suspension of their licences if they switched their sirens on unnecessarily when there was no traffic. “There have been complaints from several people pertaining to the issue. The present conditions are not good and people are getting mentally disturbed due to the surge in cases. The complainants have claimed that children and senior citizens, especially, get scared and disturbed, and are unable to sleep the entire night as many have been psychologically affected by the second wave,” an RTO official told TOI. Officials said information pertaining to the same had been passed on to all ambulance drivers and transporters involved in the business. “The ambulance drivers have to take note that if the roads are clear with little to no traffic, they shouldn’t switch on the sirens. They should avoid doing the same if they are passing through a residential area, especially during the late evening hours. Action in the form of suspension of driving licences or fines will be taken as per the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act if they are found to be unnecessarily blaring their sirens. People shouldn’t be disturbed in anyway,” the official pointed out. Ambulance drivers, however, were not amused. “Even during the night, there are people on the streets and also police check points. We have to alert them that we have a patient with us so that they can clear the road if there is a need. We are doing an extremely important job without caring about our well-being. Slapping fines and suspending our licences during this time is highly insensitive,” a driver told TOI, requesting anonymity. Some residents said the sound of sirens had become scary and disturbing. “It is more of a mental stress than anything else. From morning until the late evening hours, one can hear the sirens of so many ambulances these days. However, in the late night hours, when traffic is less, the ambulance drivers should refrain from blaring their sirens until it is extremely urgent. My parents, who are old, tend to get scared each time they hear sirens these days,” Fatimanagar resident Rohit Tulpule said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rto-to-suspend-licences-fine-ambulance-drivers-blaring-sirens-unnecessarily/articleshow/82507473.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Goa||Coastal body asks for all CZMP resolutions||Panaji: The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) has directed the directorate of panchayats and the directorate of municipal administration to direct village panchayats and municipalities to submit a resolution taken by them on the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan 2011. Some panchayats in Bardez, Bicholim, Pernem and Tiswadi and municipalities are yet to submit their resolutions to the GCZMA. The government meanwhile has completed compiling the objections and suggestions to the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) submitted by village panchayats. It will now be placed before the GCZMA to decide on the further course of action. Objections and suggestions related to khazan lands will be sent to the water resource department (WRD) while objections pertaining to fishing zones will be sent to the fisheries department, an officer said. Recently, the high court of Bombay at Goa disposed of cases questioning the public hearing conducted by the North Goa collector for finalising the draft CZMP after petitioners agreed to file appropriate proceedings before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) at New Delhi. In March, the high court had restrained government respondents from proceeding further on the basis of the minutes of the hearing on March 7, 2021, for a period of three weeks or until further orders, whichever was earlier. The court had passed the interim order and observed that the PIL ought to have been filed before the NGT. They were hearing the petitioners as the western zone bench of the tribunal at Pune has not been functional. The March 7 public hearing had been shunned by people. They called it a farce as the government had restricted the number of registrations citing Covid protocols and each speaker was allotted just five minutes. Amidst angry protests inside and outside the venues, and with a huge posse of police personnel guarding it, the state government claimed to have successfully concluded the hearings. There was utter chaos as hundreds of people came out against the CZMP demanding wider consultation, even as the coastal zone management authority carried out the exercise at Panaji and Margao through the district collectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/coastal-body-asks-for-all-czmp-resolutions/articleshow/82507477.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: BJP leader Rakesh Singh aide arrested from Lucknow||Kolkata: Days after the detective department had submitted their chargesheet in the high profile cocaine case that saw several BJP leaders being arrested in March this year, cops have arrested Amrit Raj alias Narayan, a close aide of BJP leader Rakesh Singh, from Lucknow on Saturday. According to the police, Raj had played a key role in the entire conspiracy where the accused planted cocaine in the car of the model Pamela Goswami in keeping with the order from Singh. “We were on the lookout for Raj who had been on the run for long. He has been arrested from the UP capital and produced in a local court there. We are bringing him to Kolkata on transit remand. His name is included in our chargesheet. Preliminary investigations reveal that he had fled to Nepal after the incident. He had returned to India about a week or 10 days ago,” said joint CP (crime), Murlidhar Sharma. Sources said that Raj’s role in the case was crucial. “He had met Pamela in the car at New Alipore. As instructed, he had hidden the cocaine in the car of Goswami and then ensured that local cops were tipped off. He had finally escaped from the spot in a two-wheeler that was pre-arranged for him,” said an investigating officer. While Singh has been made a key conspirator in the case another BJP leader Pamela has been discharged from the case. “We found that she was wrongly dragged in the case with ulterior motives. Her friend and security guard, who were inside the car on the day of their arrest, have been discharged as we found no evidence against them,” said joint Sharma. In all, eight persons, including the senior BJP leader, have been charged under different sections of the special NDPS (drugs act) and under sections 21 (b), 27A, 29, 30 and 58 (2). Pamela had been claiming from day one that she was “framed” as instructed by Singh. Cops have also approached the court to send the CCTV footage that was recovered from the residence of Singh to the CFSL forensic experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rakesh-singh-aide-arrested-from-lucknow/articleshow/82507479.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Senior inspector Bhaskar Jadhav of the Talegaon Dabhade police, citing preliminary investigation, told TOI, “The man may have ended his life out of frustration caused by the ailment for which he was undergoing treatment since May 1. He used a telephone wire.” Jadhav said the hospital authorities told the police that on Sunday morning, the patient, who was placed in the ICU, went inside the nearby storeroom and locked himself from the inside. “When the ICU staff noticed it, they started calling him but there was no response. They immediately alerted the police. By the time the police reached the hospital, the ICU staff had broken open the door and found the man hanging from the pipe with a telephone wire around his neck,” Jadhav added. He said, “The police team which went to the hospital had to wear PPE kits as they had to complete the required formalities. The hospital authorities told us that the man was under treatment since May 1 and he had started recovering. We have registered a case of accidental death for now and are investigating.” Meanwhile, the Talegaon Dabhade police on Friday night had registered a case against the authorities of the same hospital for not handing over the body of a patient as his relatives could not pay the bill. “We have registered a case under section 297 (trespassing on burial places) of the Indian Penal Code.

---||Delhi||Dairies to be linked with cremation grounds for using cow dung logs||NEW DELHI: The municipal corporations are linking major gaushalas and dairy colonies with the crematoria in the city so that logs made of cow dung-stubble mixture can be used to reduce heavy dependence on wood for cremations. Delhi has an estimated 2.5 lakh cattle and the demand for wood has skyrocketed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, forcing the civic bodies to seek assistance from the forest department and neighbouring states to source wood. The corporations have also been contacting the agencies undertaking infrastructure projects to use chopped trees to meet the sudden increase in demand for pyre wood in the past three weeks due to Covid deaths. The first manufacturing unit under the Gau-Parali project was launched by North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash in Shahbad Dairy on Sunday. Each unit that generates logs made up of cattle dung, parali (stubble) and wood straw costs Rs 60,000, an official said. According an order issued by the corporation’s public health department, the veterinary and horticulture departments will help NGOs collect cow and buffalo dung from dairy colonies and agro waste such as twigs, leaves, tree pruning residues. The most of the civic cremation grounds are run by NGOs and self-help groups. “The NGOs running the cremation grounds will procure the dung cakes or bricks in place of fire wood at no profit-no loss basis. The cost of the machine that produces these fuel bricks/logs is Rs 60,000 and the same can be bought by NGOs,” the order stated. The mayor said the first unit had been operationalised at Sector 26 in Rohini and the logs would be used in the local crematorium. “Each machine can daily produce up to 300-400kg of fuel logs or blocks. We plan to add such units to all major cremation grounds under us and link them to gaushalas. It will benefit farmers and also protect the environment,” said Jai Prakash. East Delhi Municipal Corporation had approved the use of such logs for cremations after facing wood shortage a few weeks ago. A senior official said the north corporation’s public health department and the associated committees had been getting suggestions from public representatives and members of the deliberative wing to this effect. “The promotion of use of parali will motivate the farmers to not burn it but sell it to cremation grounds,” the order stated. A resolution for supplementing wood fuel was passed by the corporation just a few months ago but experts had raised concern about the low calorific value of such logs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dairies-to-be-linked-with-cremation-grounds-for-using-cow-dung-logs/articleshow/82507510.cms||Paras Singh
---||Pune||Smaller hospitals in Pune resume full operations as supply of O2 improves||PUNE: Small and medium-sized Covid hospitals in the city have started admitting new patients in their intensive care unit (ICUs) now that the supply of medical oxygen has stabilized significantly in the past week. Most of these hospitals — dependent on supply of oxygen cylinders on a regular basis — had stopped taking fresh admissions last month owing to uncertainty over receiving an uninterrupted supply of cylinders from their distributors/refillers. The unprecedented oxygen crisis had badly affected patient-care services after the district’s daily requirement had far surpassed the daily production capacity in the wake of a sharp spike in cases that had peaked in April. “Small and medium-sized Covid hospitals have started taking new admissions, mainly in their ICUs, as the supply of medical oxygen has improved significantly,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India (HBI) — the association of small and medium sized hospitals in Pune. Covid patients undergoing care at ICUs need to have high oxygen support, which cannot be put on hold or interrupted even momentarily. “That was the reason the smaller hospitals had stopped taking new admission as there was uncertainty over getting the required supply on a regular basis,” Patil said. Supply improved after the district authorities, in addition to procuring a huge number of new oxygen cylinders, started implementing measures to stop wastage through leakages. Further, the daily cases have also been decreasing slowly over the past week. Currently, more than 60,000 Covid patients with mild illness are undergoing home-isolation care in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), and quite a few of them might require hospitalisation, should their condition worsen. “Hence, although daily cases have started decreasing, there are many inquiries mainly for ICU beds,” surgeon Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director, Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, said. Big private hubs like DMH had come under massive strain when small/medium sized hospitals had stopped taking new admissions last month for a want of medical oxygen. “Now that the small and medium-sized hospitals have started taking admissions in ICUs, this will reduce the burden on big hospitals,” said orthopaedic surgeon Ramesh Ranka, medical director, Ranka hospital. Consumption of medical oxygen in the Pune district has gone above 400 metric tonnes, as against its full daily production capacity of 350 metric tonnes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/smaller-hospitals-resume-ops-in-full-swing-as-oxygen-supply-improves/articleshow/82507538.cms||Umesh Isalkar

A May 7 fire audit data in the weekly review meeting conducted by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, said of a total of 738 government and private hospitals in Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad, the three cantonments, and rural areas, the fire audit of 606 has been completed, while 132 hospitals have yet to comply. The data showed that most hospitals that have yet to comply with the audit are from the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits, where 58 such hospitals, of the 133 are pending audit. The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) commissioner Suhas Diwse who is looking after the fire audit in the region said that the number has improved since May 7, and now only 50-odd hospitals are awaiting the audit which will be done within next 2-3 days. He added, “The report will be sent to the higher authorities, and the hospitals which are found to be non-compliant will be given a specific time to follow the necessary fire audit guidelines.” PMC’s fire brigade department chief Prashant Ranpise said earlier last month when there were a few fire incidents in Mumbai, they had carried out the inspection of the government and private hospitals and found that around 61 hospitals were not following the fire guidelines. “There were a few government hospitals as well in the 61 hospitals. But, after the PMRDA’a inclusion, we have been told to look into more minute details of the hospitals for overall compliance. The work is under progress,” he said. PCMC’s fire brigade department chief Kiran Gawade said they have done auditing of all the 133 hospitals in the civic limits by Sunday. The online uploading of the data is underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-100-hospitals-in-pune-dist-still-to-complete-fire-audit/articleshow/82507550.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Delhi||Bursting at seams, burial grounds are fast becoming out of bounds in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The Covid section of the ITO Ferozshah Kotla Qabristan — the biggest burial ground in the city — is almost full and many families seeking space in this facility are now being asked to look for other sites. The Shastri Park burial ground, too, is no longer accepting Covid bodies citing shortage of space. The management at ITO site has asked the administration to allow the site near Millennium Park to be used for this purpose. Mohammad Shamim, a supervisor at Jadid Qabristan Ahle Islam, who oversees the Covid-protocol burials at the site, said a few bodies that had been coming recently were adjusted by removing the bushes and at the rear end of the Covid section. “We are asking most of the families to take the bodies to Shastri Park Buland Masjid site or Mangolpuri, but we have been told that bodies are not being accepted there also,” he added. Shamim said around 1,500 bodies had been buried in the five bigha Covid section so far, while 4 acre-site near Millennium Park was currently locked. The management committee has also sought the intervention of Waqf Board for the allotment of more land. An official said a part of the ITO burial ground was reserved for Covid-protocol burials last year. “Last year, around 435 were laid to rest at this site,” the official added. The Shastri Park facility in-charge, Suleman Ali, said that the site spread over an acre does not have any space left for more bodies. “We have already accommodated four times the number of Covid bodies that were initially supposed to be buried here. So, we are diverting the bodies to other sites now,” he added. Last year, the civic bodies had reserved Covid-designated burial spaces in Kotla, Mangolpuri, Mulla Colony, Shastri Park and Madanpur Khadar. Abdul Rehman, who manages Madanpur Khadar facility on behalf of Kalam Welfare Society, said when the Covid bodies were brought in June last year, locals had started stone-pelting, following which the burials had stopped. The funeral reports from the local bodies showed that both the Buland Masjid Shastri Park and the Mulla Colony sites had not been receiving a single body now. On Thursday and Friday, the ITO burial ground witnessed the burials of 3 bodies each day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bursting-at-seams-burial-grounds-are-fast-becoming-out-of-bounds/articleshow/82507554.cms||Paras Singh
---||Ranchi||2 J’khand districts take help of ‘quacks’ to fight Covid||Ranchi: In a first for the state and perhaps in the country, two tribal-dominated districts in Jharkhand roped in "quacks" as their first line of defence in the fight against the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic which is wreaking havoc in the state. Jamtara and Khunti district authorities said the move was taken up to resolve in part the lack of qualified health workers to tackle the surging cases of Covid infections and considering the faith of the villagers in these traditional healers, often referred to "doctors", rather than qualified medical personnel whenever they face medical and health issues. In Jamtara, the district officials conducted a survey and called about 400 vaids, hakims and ojhas on Sunday for an orientation programme on how to identify Covid symptoms and their roles in helping the villagers. Speaking to TOI, Jamtara deputy commissioner Faiz Aq Ahmed Mumtaz said, “The villagers depend mostly on the quacks for their health needs due to various reasons. Hence, we thought to first sensitise such non-medical persons, who serve as the first point of contact in villages, on Covid-related do's and don'ts. The idea is to utilize them constructively so that we can identify patients on time before they turned critical.” On the new role of these traditional healers, Mumtaz said, "We are teaching them to identify Covid symptoms among the villagers and in case of critical conditions, they have to inform nodal persons in the area for immediate medical help. We are also asking them to create awareness among the villagers on appropriate Covid behaviour, both in public and in home isolation, to prevent the infection. Putting stress on the vaccination drive, Mumtaz also said, "Community mobilisation for the drive in rural areas is important as the hesitancy among the villagers towards the vaccine is high. If they (vaids/hakims/ojhas) create awareness, the villagers will listen. So, they have an added responsibility of motivating the villagers to take the shots." Mumtaz, however, clarified that the traditional healers are not allowed to distribute or prescribe any medicines or kits except for allowing them to carry pulse oximeters and provide simple vitamins in cases of need. He added, "We have formed WhatsApp groups of the healers at the block levels and tagged them with trained health workers and practitioners to keep a regular tab and educate them with vital information. We will also distribute the oximeters to them soon." A similar initiative is underway in Khunti district, too, located around 40km from Ranchi. In the district, about 200 quacks have been identified and being trained, officials said. A Khunti district health official said, “We are training them on the guidelines of home isolation. We are also providing them simple medical and Covid preventive kits like pulse oximeters, food charts, for distribution among people in isolation by tagging them with block officials.” He added that the first phase training was held two days ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/2-jkhand-districts-take-help-of-quacks-to-fight-covid/articleshow/82507559.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||CM plans 2-day meet with MPs, MLAs from today||RANCHI: Chief minister Hemant Soren has planned a two-day virtual meeting from Monday with all the MPs and MLAs to discuss and invite suggestions from them on tackling the ongoing pandemic, a statement by the CMO said on Sunday. On Monday, Hemant will meet the MLAs and MPs of Santhal Pargana and Palamu commissionaries and the legislators of Kolhan and North Chota Nagpur commisionaries the next day. “The meeting is expected to begin from 11:30am,” the statement said. “Majority of these four commissionaries include rural districts which need urgent attention in order to curb the virus spread. Besides the infrastructural challenges, the most challenging issue currently facing these districts is the proper collection of Covid-related data to ascertain the extent of the spread. There is also the challenge of ensuring a high vaccination rate since many in those areas are hesitant to take the jab. The MLAs and MPs can play a pivotal role in encouraging Covid appropriate behaviour among the villagers. Also, their inputs regarding the availability of medical services in their respective constituencies and the implementation of those services will help us in managing the pandemic,” an official said. This will be the third time in less than a month when the CM is seeking suggestions from those outside the bureaucratic and government set-up for solving Covid crisis, even though several MLAs and MPs, including BJP’s Dhanwar MLA Babulal Marandi, Godda MP Nishikant Dubey and Congress’s Mahagama MLA Dipika Pandey Singh, among others, had recently written to him with their demands and suggestions for managing the pandemic. On April 17, Hemant had first convened an all-party meeting where everyone called for enforcement of restrictions to break the transmission chain. While his party, JMM, had sought a complete lockdown, the tribal party’s ally – Congress – was opposed to it. Five days later, the state government announced a partial lockdown (known as the health safety week), which is currently in force, and will remain so till May 13. Last week, the CM held similar virtual meetings with representatives of over 4,000 panchayats in Jharkhand, following which he issued an order for the reinstallation of quarantine centres for the effective management of incoming migrants and to break the virus chain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cm-plans-2-day-meet-with-mps-mlas-from-today/articleshow/82507565.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Sisodia has asked the health department to conduct an inquiry into the matter and submit a report by Monday evening, they said. The corporation’s mayor, Jai Prakash, had on Saturday said that at least 23 patients left the hospital between April 19 and May 6 without informing the medical facility. Sisodia said it is very shocking that a large number of Covid-19 patients have gone “missing” from the hospital, a source said. The deputy chief minister also said that this can not only prove dangerous for the patients themselves, but is also a setback to the efforts of the government, which has imposed a lockdown to check the spread of the disease, the source said. Hindu Rao is the largest civic hospital in the national capital. The hospital has 250 beds reserved for coronavirus patients and according to the Delhi Corona app, all beds are currently occupied.

The sky was heavily overcast in the morning and there was brisk rain in some parts of the state as was forecast by the Panaji centre earlier. A trough or wind discontinuity persisting at a height of 0.9 km from the west Madhya Pradesh to Karnataka coast across interior Karnataka is likely to yield some rain till May 13. “Rainfall activity is very likely to continue over Goa. The distribution may vary based on the system’s intensity and proximity to Goa,” Rahul M, scientist, IMD, Panaji said. The rain activity is likely to be isolated and most likely one or two places may receive rain or thunder showers and may be accompanied by lighting over both districts. On Saturday the maximum temperature had risen slightly by just over a degree above normal to 35 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature also rose by 1.4 degrees to 27.8. But rainfall recorded in the last 24 hours till Sunday morning at 8.30am was 0.4 mm in Panaji and a trace in Mormugao.

---||Pune||Pune: District receives over 60,000 Covishield, 2,000 Covaxin doses||PUNE: The district received over 60,000 Covishield doses and 2,480 Covaxin doses late on Saturday night, providing a much-needed breather to continue with the vaccination drive for the 18-44 and 45-plus age group. The vaccine shortage, which had affected vaccination for the 45-plus age group last week due to unavailability of doses will once again resume from Monday across the designated vaccination sites in the district. As many as 111 sites will offer vaccination to 45-plus beneficiaries on Monday in areas under Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). Of the total, 101 will offer Covishield, while 10 sites will offer Covaxin doses. In areas under Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), three sites will offer the second dose Covaxin only. For the 18-44 age group, PCMC has assigned eight vaccination sites, of which three will offer Covishield, while five will offer Covaxin. For the 18-44 age group, PMC has offered six vaccination sites, of which two will offer Covishield, while the rest will offer Covaxin. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), health services, Pune circle, told TOI, “We have received 39,110 Covishield doses and 2,480 Covaxin doses from the centre, which will be used to vaccinate the 45-plus age group. The 23,200 Covishield doses sent by the state will be used for the vaccination of the 18-44 age group.” According to Deshmukh, the fresh stock will provide a breather for the next 2-3 days of vaccination. The vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group had commenced from May 1 despite limited availability of doses across a handful of vaccination sites. The vaccination drive could be continuing at full capacity, if the number of doses available is higher. Deshmukh said that the unavailability of doses had resulted in the closure of vaccination sites on various occasions in the past. “We are hoping to get another consignment of doses on Tuesday, which will allow smooth vaccination for this week,” he said. Meanwhile, on Sunday, as many as 6,067 beneficiaries were vaccinated across the district. In the PMC and PCMC limits, the vaccination drive was underway only for the 18-44 age group, while in Pune rural areas a few sites offered vaccines to citizens in the 45-plus age category as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-receives-over-60000-covishield-2k-covaxin-doses/articleshow/82507620.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Pune||Collector orders shots in Pune rural only via Co-WIN||PUNE: District collector Rajesh Deshmukh on Sunday issued an order directing officials of all vaccination centres in Pune rural to ensure that only those beneficiaries who have enrolled through the Co-Win app are given the shots. No offline vaccination will be conducted in these areas , he said. The collector has also told vaccination centre authorities to draw a border within a 100-metre periphery of the site, wherein only enrolled beneficiaries will be allowed to enter. The move is aimed at reducing the crowd at vaccination sites especially after the inoculation drive was thrown open to the 18-44 years age group people from May 1. A shortage of vaccine has affected the drive and the number of sites operating on a given day varies in proportion to the number of vaccine doses allotted to Pune rural areas. On Sunday, only 24 of the 200-odd vaccine sites across the 13 tehsils were operating. The collector’s order also specifies that 70% of the total doses received by a site be utilized for beneficiaries due for their second vaccine dose and the remaining 30% for first dose recipients. The order also specified that doses received from the Centre should be used for those above 45 age category, while those from the state shall be used for the 18-44 age category. The collector said no vaccination drive will be conducted at the gram panchayat level. It will continue at the primary health centre and at the sub-centre depending on the availability of the doses. — Piyush Bhusari||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/collector-orders-shots-in-pune-rural-only-via-co-win/articleshow/82507645.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Delhi||Weddings at home or court: Season a washout for traders in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Under the more stringent lockdown guidelines issued on Sunday, no wedding function will be permitted at public places, banquet halls or hotels. A gathering of maximum 20 people has been permitted for weddings at courts or home. While no DJ sound system, tents or catering services will be allowed, the movement of people attending the scaled-down functions will be allowed on producing a soft or hard copy of the invitation card. According to Banquet hall owners and traders associated with the wedding industry, two consecutive seasons have now been washed out and they are staring at large-scale losses. Many demand some relief in the form of GST or other fixed charges. The auspicious period started on April 20 and will end around Akshay Tritya falling on May 14. Referring to the advance payments made for the period, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority curfew extension order stated, “Owners of marriage halls, banquet halls, hotels, DJ sound systems, catering and other services will have to either return the advance amount... or they will have to mutually agree to organise the marriage at a later date.” Kapil Nagpal, who operates four banquet halls and is the president of the Community Welfare and Banquet Association (west zone), said the industry was already devastated last year. “Most halls operate on rented premises and many have left the business,” he added. The association has demanded economic support from the government through relaxations on rentals, GST and fixed electricity charges. “We are still getting fixed monthly bills of Rs 50,000 and more due to heavy load requirement,” he said. Other support services have also been badly impacted. Bimal Jain, who heads the Delhi Wedding and Greeting Cards Manufacturers Association, said no significant trade had taken place this season. “The e-cards have taken over. During the entire lockdown year, the restrictions have been imposed on weddings while political rallies had been allowed,” Jain said. Rajesh Saini, who runs Devraj Band in northeast Delhi, said many of his workers had left for their villages. “There were anyway very few weddings and a few orders around Akhsay Tritya will now be cancelled. How do we feed our families?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/weddings-at-home-or-court-season-a-washout-for-traders/articleshow/82507646.cms||Paras Singh
---||Delhi||Compassion on wheels: Delhi Police ‘Covivan’ to help seniors||NEW DELHI: Covivan will help senior citizens deal with their Covid-related woes. Launched by the south Delhi police on Sunday, the initiative comprises a dedicated helpline and a special vehicle that will be used only to assist the elderly people in need. Senior citizens can call the helpline — 011-26241076/26241077 — for getting medicines and essentials as well as going for vaccination during the lockdown. The initiative has been started on pilot basis in Greater Kailash and will be operational in other parts of South district based on the feedback. “Due to a surge in Covid-19 cases, senior citizens are facing problems in getting household items and doing other essential work. Keeping in view their safety and security, we have started this helpline. This vehicle has been donated for use during the pandemic by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers,” DCP (south) Atul Thakur said. According to Thakur, once a call is received, the on-duty cop will rush to the address along with the area beat officer. The beat officers and residents welfare associations have spread the word about Covivan, said Thakur. Meanwhile, the Jeevan Rakshak scheme of Delhi Police to coordinate plasma donations is gathering pace with 160 donors, including 71 police personnel, having registered till now, DCP Chinmoy Biswal said. However, on scrutiny, only 23 people — 16 police personnel — have been found fit for plasma donation, he added. A total of 1,144 prospective recipients have enrolled to get plasma, out of whom 12 are police personnel, Biswal said. Delhi Police also held a webinar to facilitate 20 donors for their efforts. Many of these donors even showed their willingness to donate plasma again. Constable Sunil from North district has already donated plasma twice, Biswal added. The initiative was launched on April 24 by police commissioner S N Shrivastava to create an interface between plasma donors and needy recipients after due authentication. A Google form has been created and the people in need of plasma will register their requests through a designated link available on the official website of Delhi Police in the name of “donate plasma-save lives”. This databank of donors and recipients is centrally maintained by Delhi Police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/compassion-on-wheels-police-covivan-to-help-seniors/articleshow/82507644.cms||---

Most daily wage workers do not have access to the internet. “I asked my son to register for our domestic help, when he was registering himself, as she does not have access to the internet and doesn’t know how to to go about the registration process. She requested that we do it for her and I think everyone should do the same,” said Fatimanagar resident Shilpi Thakur. Due to vaccine shortage and to avoid crowding at vaccination centres, registration on the CoWIN app has been made mandatory for inoculation, since May 1. The management of some housing societies have also registered their security staff to ensure that they have access to the vaccine. “Even when our society was declared a micro containment zone, all the residents were indoors, but the security guards were coming in contact with delivery agents and other personnel who came from outside. They have always been more exposed while residents have had the option to stay indoors. On May 1 itself, we started trying to register them but failed to book a slot. We kept trying with the help of some residents who had better technological know-how and successfully booked a slot for the security guards, who took their vaccines last week,” said a member of a multi-wing housing society in NIBM area. Radhika Sharma, from Aundh, said, “My maid is not educated, so she did not have any idea as to how to avail the vaccine. She thought she can get it like any other shot by walking into a clinic and paying for it. After we explained to her that she needs to register for it, she was stressed, and asked us for help.” Sheetal Pawar, resident of Kothrud, said, “I helped my cook and domestic help to register for the vaccine as it is our responsibility.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-help-domestic-workers-guards-register-for-vaccination/articleshow/82507666.cms||---
---||Pune||Crippling costs for fungal infection care start chorus for free treatment in Maharashtra||PUNE: Medical experts and health activists have urged state government to support Covid-19 patients increasingly being diagnosed with the life-threatening fungal infection called mucormycosis or black fungus by offering them free treatment under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MPJAY), the state public health insurance scheme. The current treatment package for mucormycosis under the scheme offers Rs 40,000. The treatment involves expensive drugs for a minimum of 10 days and, in some advanced cases, may run into weeks or even months. The long drawn treatment costs run into sums between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 30 lakh. “Most big hospitals in Maharashtra have one or two cases under treatment. The cost is beyond reach for many patients,” maxillofacial surgeon J B Garde said. Patients' relatives are forced to mortgage their belongings and borrow money as the cost of injections alone runs into Rs 25,000 per day, he said. “The state government should immediately step up to support such patients by offering them free treatment cover under MPJAY. It will help many seek proper care for mucormycosis. Families are crumbling under the huge treatment cost the disease incurs,” Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India, said. A dedicated mucormycosis cell at state-run medical colleges attached hospitals or tertiary care centres will bring in data of patients from a district under one roof. “Since mucormycosis often needs multi-speciality treatment, state-run medical college attached hospitals like B J Medical College-Sassoon hospital in Pune can play a vital role in identifying them. This will also help in channelising care to patients at designated private hospitals empanelled under MPJAY,” Patil said. Health activist Abhijit More stressed on strengthening medical colleges to offer care for mucormycosis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crippling-costs-for-fungal-infection-care-start-chorus-for-free-treatment/articleshow/82507698.cms||Umesh Isalkar

With the saline water breaching the bundhs of Kolyabandh and Vorchabandh at Mahalwada, the livelihood of these 40 families is now on the line. Canacona mamlatdar, Vimod Dalal, along with officials visited the two sites and inspected the spots where saline water had entered the fields. The team also took stock of the drinking water wells nearby as the breach of these bandhs also affects these wells. Sunil Painginkar, a local told TOI that these local families would earlier maintain these bundhs themselves as they used to raise two crops yearly for their sustenance. These bandhs are at least 60 years old and are registered with the government, he added. “In between for sometime, some of these families stopped raising two crops every year and so the burden of maintenance fell on the remaining few families. Now all these families after realising that water in their wells is getting contaminated and have shown interest in venturing again into cultivating these fields with two crops,” said a local. Now with the help of the mamlatdar’s office, the agriculture department and water resource department villagers are hoping to get the issue resolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/galgibaga-bundh-breach-saline-water-enters-paddy-fields/articleshow/82507708.cms||Albert Fernandes

A police team, led by senior inspector Padmakar Ghanwat of the the local crime branch, seized one vial of tocilizumab and six vials of remdesivir from Dattatreya Londhe (35), Aditya Wagh (25) and Amol Munde (25). “Londhe and Wagh were taken into custody from Daund, while Munde was arrested from Vashi,” Ghanwat told TOI. Ghanwat said the suspects were trying to sell tocilizumab for Rs1.5 lakh and remdesivir for Rs25,000, per vial, to the relatives of patients undergoing treatment for Covid-19 in Daund. “We have also recovered Rs52,000, a car and a scooter from the trio,” Ghanwat said. Tocilizumab is an imported injection, which costs over Rs45,000 in India. Ghanwat said prima facie probe revealed that Munde had procured the vials from New Mumbai with the help of a person related to a pharmacy. “We will arrest that person soon,” Ghanwat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/three-held-for-selling-key-drugs-illegally/articleshow/82507721.cms||---
---||Pune||Loiterers offer odd excuses just to escape police action||Pune: From claiming that they have stepped out of the house in search of remdesivir to stating that they are craving mangoes, people caught by cops for unnecessary travel during the weekend curfew offer different, sometimes even weird, excuses.Cops posted at various spots across the city to prevent people from loitering said that knowing whether a person had a genuine need or not has become a tough task.“The excuses are in plenty and centered around issues people are facing. Some people say that they are searching for medicines while some say that they are looking for beds or on the way to a crematorium. Under such situation, it is difficult to ascertain whether they are lying or not. There have been cases in which people have pasted stickers of some essential service on their vehicle, even when actually they have no connection to the same,” senior inspector Jairam Paigude, traffic division, of the Pune police, told TOI.Another officer said that last week he had a couple of cases in which the men said they were out to buy mangoes. “They said that a family member was craving mangoes, hence they were out to buy them. These were two different cases but with the same excuse. One afternoon we came across a man claiming that he was out to buy milk. Upon further enquiry, he finally accepted that he had stepped out of his home just to get over his boredom,” said the officer.Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said that in the last three days, the cops had caught close to 13,000 people for unnecessarily moving around the city. “On May 6, 3429 people were caught while on May 7, the police caught 4972 people. On May 8, 4478 people were intercepted. One can see that a lot of people are getting out despite knowing the regulations of weekend curfew,” said the officer.According to the officer, in most cases, those caught said they were out to buy medicines but either they didn’t have a prescription, or they didn’t know the name of the medicine they were out to buy. A lot of them claim that they are out to get medicines for a headache,” an officer from the Pimpri Chinchwad police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/loiterers-offer-odd-excuses-just-to-escape-police-action/articleshow/82507748.cms||Joy Sengupta

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday announced that apart from the restrictions already in place, the Delhi Metro services will also be suspended during the extended lockdown. “The current lockdown was to end at 5am tomorrow (May 10), but now this is being extended to next Monday (May 17), 5am, and will be more stringent. Starting tomorrow, the Metro services will also stop operating. Our effort is that the more stringent the lockdown is, the more rapidly we will be able to conquer Covid,” Kejriwal said during a digital press conference. Following the announcement of the revised guidelines for restricting the spread of Covid-19, Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications) of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), said, “The Delhi Metro services on all its lines shall also remain suspended for passenger or essential services from May 10 till 5am of May 17.” DMRC has been operating trains with lower frequency for the last three weeks and only those who are exempted from the lockdown restrictions were being allowed to travel on production of valid identity cards. When the lockdown first came into effect, DMRC started operating trains at a frequency of 30 minutes during the morning and evening peak hours and at a frequency of one hour during the off-peak period. However, this frequency was found inadequate despite the much reduced passenger traffic and DMRC very soon started operating trains at a frequency of 15 minutes. According to sources, the ridership of Delhi Metro has been growing ever since it had reopened its services in a graded manner after 169 days on September 7, 2020. The services were gradually increased to include all its corridors and went back to usual timings from September 12 with restrictions in place that required every alternate seat to be left empty and a distance of one foot between standing passengers. According to sources, the Metro’s passenger journeys ranged between 15 and 20 lakh a day before the fresh lockdown was imposed. The average passenger journey between April 20 and May 8, however, has been just 2.3 lakh. Other modes of transport, such as public transport buses, autos, taxis and e-rickshaws, will continue to ply with existing restrictions in place, such as 50% seating capacity in buses and two passengers in para-transits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metro-halted-in-its-tracks-nuptial-plans-in-knots/articleshow/82507767.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Delhi||Delhi: Jailed activist Natasha Narwal’s father dies of Covid||NEW DELHI: Pinjra Tod activist Natasha Narwal’s father, Mahavir, died of Covid-19 on Sunday. The news came on a day when members of the civil society were planning a “Twitter Storm” for the activist’s release so that she could take care of her ailing father. Natasha was arrested in May 2020 for allegedly being part of a premeditated conspiracy in the Northeast Delhi riots in February. She was booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Members of student collective Pinjra Tod had come out with a statement demanding that their fellow member be immediately released as her father was admitted in the ICU. Mahavir had spoken to TOI last year about how he had last been able to meet his daughter in June 2020. “The physical meeting has started only recently, but it is getting difficult to find a slot…The charges are all arbitrary. I know my daughter well,” he had said. In a video made last year by the organisation, Karwan e Mohabbat, Mahavir had said: “Suppose my daughter has to stay in jail for a really long time and there comes a time that she is not able to see me. I am growing old; maybe, I won’t get to see her. These kinds of thoughts come to my mind…We just console ourselves by saying good things. That is why her brother keeps her room tidy. Whenever she comes back, she should find her room in good shape.” Ayesha Kidwai, a JNU professor and former JNUTA president, wrote on her Facebook page that “he (Mahavir) passed on just now, never giving up hope that his daughter (a former JNU student) would get bail in the next hearing, never giving up his belief in the justness of her cause and the injustice of her incarceration”. A statement by Pinjra Tod read: “Lost…comrade, father, friend, fellow traveller. He passed away two hours ago due to Covid-related complications. This is an immense loss for us and the larger community as for Natasha. He was a rock for many of us, voice of sanity in the din, calmly and coolly raising his firm voice.” It added that Natasha’s bail petition to visit her father in the hospital was to be heard on Monday morning. “Mahavir campaigned hard to prove the innocence of Natasha who was incarcerated for a peaceful participation in the protest against the Citizenship Amendment Bill. He himself has been imprisoned for his participation in protest during the emergency period.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jailed-activist-narwals-father-dies-of-covid/articleshow/82507794.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Panel finds 200 illegal buildings in Devarayamjal||HYDERABAD: The four-member IAS officers’ committee, which is inquiring into alleged encroachments on Sitaramaswamy temple land in Devarayamjal on the outskirts of the city, has found over 200 illegal constructions on the parcel of land. Except for a few constructions, a majority of these did not have permission from Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority. The inquiry, led by panchayat raj secretary M Raghunandan Rao, revealed that these constructions mainly godowns and buildings were constructed in the name of farm houses and agriculture activity, but given on huge rentals for commercial purposes and towards godown space to big companies. The IAS officers’ committee had started the inquiry following orders from the state government to look into allegations of former minister Eatala Rajender, his close aides and others having encroached upon Rs 1,000 crore worth of endowment land. Another fact that came to light during the inquiry was that local civic body, Thumkunta municipality, has been levying property tax only on 100-odd illegal constructions and getting nearly Rs 3 crore revenue. Notices are being served on all illegal constructions. Also, municipal officials too might face action for failing to demolish illegal constructions and also not levying property tax on all unauthorised structures. The inquiry committee is looking into the issue of how many of these illegal constructions and extent of land was under the possession of former minister Eatala Rajender or his family members, close aides and benamis. “The inquiry is going on in full swing. It has completed almost all the field work and would submit its report soon to the government,” a source close to the committee said. The state government had constituted the four-member IAS officers’ committee to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into the encroachments of Sitarama swamy endowment land in Devarayamjal in Shamirpet mandal on the outskirts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/panel-finds-200-illegal-bldgs-in-devarayamjal/articleshow/82507787.cms||Roushan Ali

India has recorded more than 2.4 lakh Covid deaths, according to the latest Union health ministry data. In an attempt to ease the pain of families of deceased employees, several organisations are offering benefits like a one-time compassionate payment, financial sponsorship for education of their children and an employment opportunity to the spouses. The number of Covid casualties at individual firms is, however, not known as regulations mandate listed companies to disclose the deaths of key managerial personnel only. J Sagar Associates, a leading law firm in India, said that as the count of Covid deaths is spiraling by the minute, companies are stepping forward to provide bereavement support to grieving families. “Apart from taking responsibility for children’s education and continuing disbursement of an employee’s full salary up to two years, companies are covering hospitalisation, funeral and vaccination expenses,” said Minu Dwivedi, a partner at J Sagar Associates. Many companies have expanded their group term insurance to include Covid protection for their employees. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is offering an insurance cover of Rs 23 lakh, or an amount equivalent to six times of an employee’s annual compensation, whichever is higher, to his/her family in the event of the person’s death due to Covid. TCS employs close to 5 lakh people — the largest employer of software professionals in the country (more than 70% of those are based in India). Read AlsoCovid-19: More women falling prey to infection in second waveData from the health department show that number of women getting infected with Covid-19 has gone up during the second wave of infections. At present, women account for 38.5 per cent of total infections in the state, a number which was at around 34 per cent in July last year. On the national scale,Muthoot Finance, India’s largest gold loan NBFC, has decided to pay the next 24 months’ salary to the spouse or mother of a deceased employee if s/he had completed three years of service. For employees whose total period of service is less than three years, the payout will be for the next 12 months.

In addition to the shortage, the treatment for this invasiveICICI Lombard, the country’s leading private non-life insurer, will grant employment to the deceased staff’s spouse if the latter has suitable education qualifications and fits the available role. Among other support endeavours, it will also offer terminal benefits (like provident fund and gratuity) to the family of the deceased employee. This would be done even if s/he had not completed the designated period required to get the gratuity. Companies have extended the group term insurance to include Covid financial protection for distributors and third-party packaging units’ people too. “The second wave has affected many of our employees, partners and their families across India,” said Tata Consumer Products MD Sunil D’Souza. “We have covered all frontline employees, including partner workforce in sales and manufacturing through specific medical assistance, hospitalisations and insurance programmes,” D’Souza added. Last week, Kotak Mahindra Bank revealed it lost 17 employees to Covid in fiscal 2021 and another 17 last month. “What we lost in the (last fiscal), we have lost in April 2021 alone,” said Uday Kotak, MD of India’s third-largest private sector bank. K Raheja Corp, leading commercial and residential property developer, is offering a term cover equal to one-year gross salary to family members in the event of any employee succumbing to Covid. “While nothing can replace the loss of a loved one, we endeavour to assist in improving financial security with term insurance,” said the company’s HR chief Urvi Aradhya. In a LinkedIn post, glassware brand Borosil, which lost four employees to Covid, had said it will sponsor the education of their children up to graduation in India. HCL Technologies is offering Rs 30-lakh insurance, Rs 7-lakh employees deposit linked insurance and an amount equal to the annual salary of the deceased professional to the family members, as TOI reported in its Saturday edition.

The civic body also issued a show-cause notice to the operator for action over alleged breach of contract, asking why criminal action should not be initiated against the firm and why it should not be blacklisted over “acts bringing disrepute” to the PCMC and “causing harassment” of patients. The auto-cluster DCH, started in August 2020 for the free treatment of Covid-19 patients, had recently hit the headlines following the arrest of two of its doctors, among a total of four medicos, on the charge of demanding Rs 1 lakh to transfer a Covid patient from a private hospital to the DCH. However, the operator told TOI it could not be blamed for the acts of a few individuals and was considering taking the legal route to challenge the PCMC’s action. On Saturday, Pimpri Chinchwad police had written to Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil about alleged corruption and irregularities in the DCH. The police had warned that if proper action was not taken, law-and-order problems could arise. In its order, the PCMC has said that all staff members of the auto-cluster DCH will continue to work under its administration and their salaries will be paid by the civic body. Patil said the PCMC has taken over the facility under the powers of The Epidemic Act Of India 1897 and the Disaster Management Act 2005. Additional commissioner Ulhas Jagtap has been appointed chief coordinating officer of the facility. When contacted, Amol Holkunde, chief executive officer (CEO), Sparsh Hospital, told TOI, “This is a really unfortunate decision by the PCMC. We have been taking care of the Covid patients for the past nine months at the minimum rate. We all have been blamed for the actions of a few individuals in the facility. In fact, the allegations on remdesivir being sold to outsiders are totally baseless and we have produced proof regarding it.” Holkunde said they are thinking of taking the legal route to challenge the PCMC’s action. The police sent its letter to Patil on the basis of a case of extortion and cheating in which three doctors were arrested. The letter stated that the doctors took money from the relatives of the patients to get them beds in the DCH. The letter said the doctors may have taken money from many more patients. It warned that during the current pandemic, there could be a law-and-order problem if the patients and their relatives at the DCH continue to face “harassment”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/post-bribery-row-pcmc-takes-over-chinchwad-covid-facility/articleshow/82507802.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The lockdown, which will end at 5am on May 24, has been imposed to break the chain of cases in the state. ACP Ajay Pal Lamba said since lockdown is in place from Monday, additional forces have been deployed in the city to ensure rules are followed. “Every police station has been given additional police forces so that they can be present at every nook and cranny of the city,” said Lamba, who appealed to citizens to follow the new guidelines and cooperate with police. “The new rules are for your safety. In case any citizen faces any problems, they can approach our personnel for help,” said Lamba. At present, police have set up checkposts at 378 places in the city. Out of all the penalties, 2,279 have come from violating social distancing norms. “It is unfortunate that at a time when cases are making new records every passing day, people continue to flout the norms endangering the lives of others,” said a policeman. It has also collected Rs 47,800 from 239 persons for spitting in public areas. The only respite is that none of the persons has been penalised for drinking in a public place. The institutional quarantine at a housing complex in Bagrana for those loitering in the city without any reason has failed to detain a single person in the last three days. The measure to stop the unwanted movement, which started on May 3, saw the detention of 123 persons on May 4. “Since 123 persons have been put under the quarantine, it has sent a clear message of our zero-tolerance policy for those violating Covid protocols,” said Lamba. The persons who were put in quarantine were sent home after they tested negative. Positive cases have been kept in isolation. Over 1,900 people have been put under institutional quarantine across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2900-persons-fined-for-violating-covid-protocol/articleshow/82507834.cms||---

Tending to her loving in-laws, taking care of her two teenage kids in the absence of her husband, and doing her teaching job at a private school, Kumud’s days were hectic, but she was happy.Her husband who worked in Ranchi not only allowed her to take important decisions in the family, but counted on her.She never expected that Covid would be so cruel to her, leaving a vast vacuum in her life. First she lost both her in-laws to Covid and then her father who lived a few quarters away within a space of 10 days in last October. As she was beginning to pick up pieces, now her husband fell victim to it.“My whole family has been devastated. To see my in-laws and father going away in the space of 10 days and now my husband…I don’t have words to say what I have gone through. My husband fighting for life before my eyes and I was there standing, unable to do anything…Covid destroyed us, left nothing,” said Kumud incoherently, crying more inside her sobs.“Whatever best medical facility required was arranged. Even as I was under lot of mental turmoil, I was not letting him know. But everything was slipping out of hand. In the case of my father-in-law, I had arranged plasma therapy, but we could not save him,” she said.When her in-laws tested positive last year, she told her husband not to come fearing the situation and assured him she would handle the crisis. Rajiv came to join his family on Holi. Last month, he was admitted to a hospital for a neuro problem.“After recovery, we had gone there for a follow up on April 13. Possibly, that’s where he got Covid. Tell me, is 53 an age to go? Both my kids are still in college, all liabilities are there,” she said as her words slurred.“Rajiv had immense faith in me and gave all the freedom. Whatever education I got, it’s because of him. He was a positive man, used to encourage me a lot. He is still with me. Only thing is that he is not visible. If Covid were not there, we could have done many things together, for children, family, and society. Today, I see him in everything. If the gate opens, I feel he is coming. He was a good man because he got right values from his parents,” she said.Rajiv was the only son, and wanted Kumud to stay in Jaipur to look after his parents. “Till the end, I devoted myself to their well-being. They had old-age problems for the past 4-5 years. I used to take care of them. It’s hard to think that they are not there.”Reminiscing her father-in-law’s last words, she said, “When he was in ICU, he told me, beta dhyan rakhna. There is less oxygen in the air. You have to live with this.” He was professor in psychology In Rajasthan University. “That’s why I tell my students to plant trees,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-both-in-laws-father-now-kumud-loses-hubby-to-covid/articleshow/82507837.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

Though Rajender was stripped of his health portfolio and later dropped from the state cabinet, he is yet to resign from TRS and as an MLA. The government has ordered inquiries against his involvement in alleged grabbing of assigned and endowment land. “It is not advisable to play politics when people are dying due to Covid-19. The treatment of coronavirus should be included in Aarogyasri. The government should focus on checking the spread of Covid-19 and extending effective treatment to patients. Lives of people should be saved,” he said. The former minister said it was deplorable that attempts were being made to link him with Putta Madhu in the murder case of an advocate couple.  “This is nothing short of back-stabbing me,” he said and added people would teach them a lesson at an appropriate time. Earlier in the day, elected representatives of some local bodies, including MPPs, sarpanches, upa-sarpanches, MPTCs, PACS chairpersons and vice-chairmen among other leaders from Huzurabad assembly constituency, extended their support to Rajender. In another development, the government on Sunday transferred a RDO, MPDOs, tahsildar and three circle inspectors working in Jammikunta, Kamlapur, Veenavanka and Huzurabad in the Huzurabad assembly constituency, represented by Eatala Rajender.

They have also asked the central bank to allow corporates and high net worth individuals to invest in troubled loans through the securities issued by ARCs. The Association of ARCs in India recently responded to the RBI’s call for suggestions to overhaul their structure in the country. ARCs were created under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (SARFAESI), 2002, which allowed lenders to seize assets. The role of ARCs reduced after the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, which enabled banks to sell the defaulting business to a new promoter. To prevent defaulters from buying back their companies at a discount, Section 29A was incorporated. This blacklisted defaulting promoters. After the IBC Act, the RBI had asked ARCs to stick to the principles of its Section 29 and not sell loans to promoters even outside the bankruptcy process. According to the ARC association, the SARFAESI Act allows them to sell assets to the borrower or the promoter group of companies. “Hence, following the spirit of Section 29A of IBC would be contradictory to the provision of SARFAESI Act,” it said in a note. Another request from the ARCs is that they be allowed to pick up equity in bankrupt companies as a ‘resolution applicant’ in IBC cases. In the bidding for RCom, the RBI had rejected the winning bid by UV ARC, stating that the SARFAESI law disqualifies them from holding equity in a company. In a note to members, the association said it has sought a level playing field with the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARC), which is proposed to be set up by public sector banks, and which will be backed with some form of government guarantee. “Government has announced the formation of new ARC/asset management company to takeover non-performing assets (NPAs) from different banks to clean up their books and work on resolving those NPAs. We request that special regulatory dispensation/benefit if any given to proposed ARC should apply to all existing ARCs and level playing field from regulatory perspective be given to all existing ARCs,” the association said. ARCs raise money for buying bad loans by selling security receipts (SRs) that entitle investors a share of the recovery proceeds. To ensure that they retain skin in the game, the RBI has asked ARCs to invest at least 15% in the SRs they issue. ARCs have asked for this minimum investment to be brought down to 2.5% in cases where the bank selling the bad loan is not the investor. Other suggestions include a request to be classified as non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), which will enable ARCs to borrow from banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bad-loan-cos-seek-level-playing-field/articleshow/82507871.cms||Mayur Shetty

Before he knew it, Covid had made a resurgence and Glatti himself was infected. Many students like him misread the lull in the pandemic and came back for their studies and research — only to find themselves stranded. After three weeks of isolation in his Hauz Khas apartment, Laurent recovered with the “help of friends who sent me groceries and delivered food”. Currently, he is in Uttarakhand “to let my lungs recover”. He is not planning to return to Germany soon. “I think the lockdown may go on for a month, so I will have some time for research,” he said. For his research on the history of heritage conservation in India, he needs materials at the National Archives for his studies. When Yogeshwar Joshi left Mumbai, hit by a high number of Covid cases, on April 1, he thought he would be able to carry out his MPhil research in Delhi in more salubrious environs. “Mumbai is now better than Delhi in this regard,” he shrugged. “I thought my research on Buddhist meditation would be easy because Delhi has numerous institutes on the practice of mindfulness, but everything is shut now.” In his Kamla Nagar paying guest room, he conceded he “never felt things in Delhi would turn this bad”. He said, “I have Covid symptoms but haven’t found a place for an RT-PCR test. I will sit out for a couple of weeks, recover and then head home.” Also stranded thousands of kilometres from home is Victor, a student at Kirori Mal College. He wasn’t able to go home during the lockdown last year and not this year either. Home for him is Africa. “During the first wave, there were no international flights. Besides, under my scholarship, the Indian government is responsible for my flight ticket, but there was no communication on this,” said Victor. “And I couldn’t afford the evacuation flight ticket.” With the Covid graph flattening by December 2020, Victor and his African friends thought it was a return to normalcy. It proved erroneous. “I am now more than worried. I have received frequent calls from home about my situation and what I am planning,” said the final year graduation student. “The best I can do is remain indoors 24/7 waiting for the next available flight home. Since I am almost done with studies, I am sure the government will book me a seat.” Divyansh Bhatt is also ruing the day he returned to Delhi in mid-March after leaving for his native Pithoragarh in February. “I came back because I felt the situation had improved. I wasn’t able to focus on studies at home. I also needed access to the university library and study for NEET,” said Bhatt. Bhatt has tested positive and is ensconced in his South Extension PG. “I need a negative RT-PCR test result before I can travel home,” he said. Some students, however, think lingering on in Delhi is the safest bet. At St Stephens’ College, some students are still living in the hostel. “Our only problem is that the college canteen is not fully functional,” said one hosteler. “Food deliveries are only occasionally allowed and the dhaba food is very bland.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/taken-by-surprise-by-covid-wave-scholars-left-stranded/articleshow/82507945.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

However, in April, selling by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) was to some extent cushioned by buying from mutual funds (MFs). This also made April the second consecutive month of net buying by domestic equity fund managers. These fund managers see long-term opportunities in the market while, at the same time, an increasing number of fintechs are bringing in new MF investors, boosting the flows, industry experts said. Official data showed that between April and the first week of May, FPIs have net sold shares worth nearly Rs 15,600 crore, while mutual funds recorded a net buying of almost Rs 10,300 crore. Foreign funds turned net sellers after continuing to be on the buying side for six months on the trot, starting last October. Between October and March, FPIs had net infused nearly Rs 2 lakh crore into equities, which included a net buying worth Rs 55,741 crore in the first three months of 2021. However, MFs were net sellers in stocks for 10 consecutive months till February this year, official data showed. If fears of Covid persist among overseas investors, then further redemptions cannot be ruled out, according to Morningstar India associate director & manager (research) Himanshu Srivastava. “The nervousness among FPIs with regards to the second wave of the pandemic in India was visible in the flow numbers for this week.” On the MF front, investment by equity fund managers is expected to continue in the coming months as multiple fintech players are entering this space, bringing in more users in this segment, Invest19 founder & CEO Kaushlendra Singh Sengar said. In addition, according to Bajaj Capital chief research officer Alok Aggarwala, the current bullish stance would continue as valuations moderate somewhat post-FY21 earnings and the consolidation provides investors with an opportunity to accumulate stocks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mfs-stock-buys-cushion-selling-by-foreign-funds/articleshow/82507957.cms||---

---||Delhi||Weather quirk takes Delhi by storm, provides cooling effect||New Delhi: The capital saw a sudden change in weather on Sunday, with overcast skies quickly taking over from what was earlier a sunny morning. By late afternoon, parts of Delhi started receiving a downpour, with isolated locations even recording a hailstorm. The IMD has forecast Monday to have overcast skies as well, however, rain is less likely to occur, officials said. Sunday’s showers — accompanied by gusty winds touching 40 km/hr — brought a cooling effect, with the minimum dropping to 23.2 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal for this time of the season. At Mungeshpur and Lodhi Road, the minimum dropped to 22.6 degrees Celsius, the lowest in the city. A Met official said such a change in weather was fairly normal for this time of the year, with pre-monsoon rain generally occurring in northern India, owing to high temperatures. “With high temperatures and clear skies, low pressure is created, which can bring about a quick, but short spell of rain. More rain is expected later in the week,” said a met official. Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, received ‘trace’ rainfall by 5.30pm, the same as Ayanagar and Gurgaon. Lodhi Road, meanwhile, recorded 0.6mm of rainfall. Met officials said the first spell of rain impacted Gurugram and parts of south and west Delhi, gradually moving to central, east and north Delhi by late evening. IMD’s seven-day forecast states overcast skies and gusty winds may be seen on Monday and Tuesday, with a spell of rain returning from Wednesday until Saturday. The maximum temperature was recorded at 39.4 degrees Celsius on Sunday — one degree above normal. It is forecast to reach 41 degrees C by Tuesday, before dropping to around 37 degrees by Thursday owing to rain. Delhi’s air quality was recorded in the ‘moderate’ category with a reading of 166 on the Air Quality Index (AQI) by 4pm. It had dropped to 148 (moderate) by 7pm and agencies forecast further improvement till Monday, due to an increase in wind speed and pollutants settling down post-rain. “Isolated thunderstorms with gusty winds are likely for Tuesday and Wednesday. AQI is forecast to stay in the ‘moderate’ category for the next three days,” said SAFAR, a forecasting government body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/weather-quirk-takes-delhi-by-storm-provides-cooling-effect/articleshow/82507995.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||‘Give financial aid, not clothes this Ramzan’||HYDERABAD: The Congress has advised the TRS government to extend Rs 10,000 as financial assistance to the poor Muslim families instead of a Ramzan gift packs which just has few pairs of clothes. The TRS government has been distributing Ramzan gift packs to poor Muslim families. The government also distributes clothes every year on the occasion of Bathukamma and Christmas. Telangana Congress minority cell city president Sameer Waliullah said keeping in view the economic condition and market situation due to the pandemic and the night curfew, which is in its third week, it is advisable to give financial assistance to the poor. “The pandemic, night curfew and other restrictions brought in by the government have shattered the economy badly and mainly affected daily wage labourers and the salaried class. The state government should avoid symbolic gestures of giving Ramzan gift packs and help the affected people by either giving them cash or directly depositing the amount into their bank accounts,” Sameer said. “Scores of people have lost their jobs and livelihoods due to the pandemic. Thousands of traders, wholesalers, retailers, shopkeepers and even small push cart vendors have been badly hit by the pandemic,” Sameer added. “The TRS government led by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao should come out with a relief package that aids even the middle and lower segment of traders and businessmen and give exemptions in taxes among other reliefs,” he suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/give-financial-aid-not-clothes-this-ramzan/articleshow/82508025.cms||---
---||Delhi||3 men arrested for selling Covid-19 injections in black||New Delhi: Delhi Police made multiple arrests through Saturday and Sunday in connection with black marketing of Covid-related equipment. Three people, including staffers of ESI Hospital in Faridabad, have been arrested for alleged black marketing of Tocilizumab injection and seized three vials from the accused. According to DCP (southeast) R P Meena, the accused have been identified as Utkrisht, Manish and Raghuvir. Police received a tipoff about one of the suspects selling Tocilizumab injection at an exorbitant price. A team swung into action and made a call to the phone number posing as a customer. “A decoy client was deployed to buy a vial from the alleged accused. After bargaining, the person was ready to sell one vial of the injection for Rs 2.9 lakh,” said the DCP. The cop was called to Laxmi Nagar for the delivery of the injection and the accused were arrested. Evidence regarding sale/purchase of the injection was found in the accused’s mobile phone, police said. Manish told cops that he had received the injection from Raghuvir, who works at ESI Hospital, Faridabad. He used to steal the vials and sell the government supply of drugs/injections to Manish. Manish then supplied these injections to Utkrisht, who further sold them in black to earn a huge profit. Meanwhile, a welder was arrested for allegedly selling oxygen cylinders in black and two cylinders have been seized, said Meena. The accused has been identified as Mohammed Irfan. In this case, too, a decoy client was sent to a Gautampuri firm from where the accused was arrested. He told police that he worked as a welder for the Pragati Maidan project. Another man, identified as Abdul, was arrested by Subhash Place police for allegedly selling empty oxygen cylinders for Rs 15,000 each. Three cylinders were seized from him, additional DCP Guriqbal Sidhu said. In the Barakhamba Road area, a man who duped people on the pretext of supplying oxygen cylinders was arrested. Pawan Kumar used to post advertisements on various social media platforms in the name of Jain Oxygen Agency, Faridabad, Haryana, with fake mobile numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-men-arrested-for-selling-covid-19-injections-in-black/articleshow/82508026.cms||---

---||Nagpur||47 homeless tested, only 4 +ve but not isolated or treated for 4 days||Nagpur: During the week when district’s average Covid-19 test positivity rate (TPR) was 23.32%, only four out of 47 homeless people tested positive for novel coronavirus, for a TPR of 8.51%. Cases in the district have reduced by half in the last eight days. With testing and cases dclining since beginning of May, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) decided to do RT-PCR test on homeless people, vendors, hawkers and mass testing of people visiting flat schemes and housing societies to identify any hidden cluster of cases. The drive was also meant to maintain high number of testing. Accordingly, the NMC Dharampeth Zone led by assistant commissioner Prakash Warhade and zonal officer Dindayal Tembhekar, in-charge of solid waste management department, on May 5 collected swab samples of 47 homeless people at three locations — in front of Hanuman mandir at Ram Nagar, Meetha Neem Dargah and Yeshwant stadium. The officials of solid waste management department of NMC Dharmpeth Zone got the results on Sunday. A 12-year-old girl and three men (55, 65 and 70 years) tested positive while remaining came negative. The number of cases and TPR has started to decline in the district with beginning of May. TPR of first week was 23.32% in the district. At the same time, TPR among a section of homeless people came 8.51%. Trying to gauge the reason, infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde told TOI that second wave has started to recede in the district and, therefore, very few homeless people might have tested positive. The results of 47 homeless people were released by AIIMS laboratory in the afternoon on May 6. The health department (medical) at NMC Dharampeth Zone receives results and daily list of positive cases the next day. The department is supposed to monitor isolation of patients and contact tracing and testing. It was only after TOI calls to few officials, a team started searching for the four persons. “The 12-year-old girl was traced to Yeshwant stadium. People there said she left along with her parents to Akola a couple of days ago. Search is going on for remaining three persons,” an official said. On Sunday, the cases in the district dropped to 3,104 which were lowest in a day after 39 days. The number of cases has come down by half in eight days, which is a rapid decline. Cases were 6,576 on May 1. The district saw 6,544 patients recovering on Sunday. Recoveries are more than new cases in last 10 days. The recovery has surged to 86%. For many months, it had been lower than average of state and country. On Sunday, India’s recovery rate was 82.1% and state’s 86.4%. Deaths too declined on Sunday to 73. There were 81 fatalities on Saturday. The number of active cases also dropped to 54,732. There were 1,610 vacant beds in the city on Sunday evening, of which 1,436 were with oxygen supply, 171 in ICU and three with ventilators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/47-homeless-tested-only-4-ve-but-not-isolated-or-treated-for-4-days/articleshow/82508057.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The incident came to light after neighbours noticed that his body was left in the house by the family members, who feared that they may contract the infection, and informed authorities. The 48-year-old man tested positive two days ago and had been staying away from other members of the family. Villagers told authorities he was deeply upset with the Covid- 19 situation outside, felt embarrassed and thought it was a stigma. Ironically, the family, who were approached by some villagers gave them a shock by saying they would perform last rites only after being provided personal protection equipment (PPE) kits. The last rites of the man were performed after PPE kits were given and family members completed last rites at their farmland. In a shining example of humanity in Nagarkurnool district, Nagulapalli village sarpanch Ventaka Swamy took the responsibility of performing the last rites of a Covid-19 patient. None of the villagers came forward to help.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/48-yr-old-covid-patient-kills-self-in-narayanpet/articleshow/82508098.cms||---

The incident took place in Pathra Thanda under Samba panchayat in Bayyaram mandal on Sunday. The victim, Dharamsoth Sunitha, had written a four-page suicide note before hanging herself at her residence. Sunitha is said to have fallen in love with Malothu Shiva, her classmate. After initially asking her to marry him, it was alleged that he changed his attitude towards her, started acting disinterested and was avoiding her. Upon getting to know about her relationship with Shiva, her parents got in touch with Shiva, but the latter rejected their pleas and approached police. It was alleged that even at the police station, the SI did not respond to Sunitha’s appeals and registered a case against her father. Vexed over the series of events, she took the extreme step. Villagers held a protest on the Illandu-Bayyaram highway following which a probe has been ordered. Shiva and his parents are absconding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rejected-by-lover-21-yr-old-girl-commits-suicide-boy-on-the-run/articleshow/82508096.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna
---||Nagpur||Covid orphans: Cops warn of jail terms, Rs1L fine for adoptions without due process||Nagpur: Any person sympathetically taking part in adoption of orphans, whether the parents died due to Covid or otherwise, may face serious legal implications if the norms are not followed. Any adoption without a court order is bracketed as a ‘crime’ under at least three different laws. The latest advisory has been issued by the Maharashtra State Child Protection Society, operating under the women and child development department, alerting against participating in any adoption through messages seeking support or shelter for Covid orphans. The society has also released three helpline numbers (1098, 8308992222 and 7400015518 for Maharashtra) where citizens can alert the department regarding situations where any child or a minor may need help after both or either of the parents perish due to Covid or any other reason. In all adoption cases, all the legal formalities have to be followed as per the guidelines of Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA). In case the formalities are not followed and a minor is adopted without due legal process, an offence can registered under Indian Penal Code (IPC) for kidnapping, which may lead to prison term extending to seven years and fine. Under the same IPC, the provision of ‘trafficking’ under section 370 is also attracted, under which the penalties are even stricter. If it is found the illegal adoption was made to perpetrate some exploitation, the jail term may be 10 years and also extend to life imprisonment. District child protection officer Mushtaq Pathan said any adoption without following the CARA guidelines, and in absence of court order, may lead to breach of IPC and Juvenile Justice Act (Children in need of Care and protection). “Sections 80 and 81 of the Juvenile Justice Act would be invoked against illegal adoptions. Under section 80, there is a fine of at least Rs1 lakh and also jail term extending to three years. Under section 81, there is fine Rs1 lakh and also imprisonment which may extend to five years,” he said. The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, also makes such illegal adoption a crime by imposing imprisonment of up to three years and fine of around Rs1 lakh if the norms under the Juvenile Justice Act are not followed. Nagpur city police crime branch has acted upon a gang involved in selling minors to childless parents. The gang was charged under stringent sections of IPC including 370, informed DCP, Crime, Gajanan Rajmane. City police chief Amitesh Kumar too appealed to people to be aware and not get lured by such messages on social media to help Covid orphans by adopting them without following the mandated guidelines and protocols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-orphans-cops-warn-of-jail-terms-rs1l-fine-for-adoptions-without-due-process/articleshow/82508103.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: NGOs, families demand government directive on storing bodies||HYDERABAD: With no facilities to store mortal remains of patients who succumbed to Covid-19, families of victims and non-governmental organisations (NGO) helping people cremate their loved ones, demanded the state government to come up with guidelines to preserve dead bodies overnight. The groups said that as mortal remains of Covid-19 patients are not being handed over to families to take home, many are struggling to make arrangements to store the dead body overnight and are unable to bear the cost of ambulance or freezer box charges. Going for night cremation is also not an option for families as Hindu crematoriums are closed by 7pm. “We tried to get my brother-in-law cremated at night but no crematorium was available. We had no option except to pay thousands of rupees and store the body,” said a person, whose 45-year-old relative succumbed to Covid-19 about a week ago. The same was the case with the family of a school teacher who died on Saturday. While no one had objection in cremating the deceased at night, they were forced to shell out Rs 30,000 to store the body overnight. The NGOs have appealed to the state government to come with a solution to the problem as many are forced to pay anywhere around Rs 16,000 to Rs 30,000 to store mortal remains of Covid-19 body overnight in a freezer box inside the ambulance. “In the last one week, I received at least ten calls from families asking about cremation and where to store dead body overnight. How difficult is it for the state to provide a space to keep these bodies or allow night cremations?” asked Sai Teja from the Feed the Needy NGO, adding that the state should come up with guidelines on how to store mortal remains of Covid-19 patients overnight and allow night cremations. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation officials, meanwhile, said that crematoriums have all facilities to dispose Covid-19 bodies. “Crematoriums are closed during the night as Hindus don’t prefer to cremate after sunset,” said V Mamatha, Zonal Commissioner (Kukatpally).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ngos-families-demand-govt-directive-on-storing-bodies/articleshow/82508124.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Guest workers are in no man’s land all over again||Thirty-five-year-old Zahir Hussein wears a nervous look as he waits at the Coimbatore railway junction on Saturday morning. The news of Tamil Nadu going into complete lockdown for a fortnight from Monday brought back the trauma of last year when he was left without an income almost overnight and had no way of going back home. "My family is in Jharkhand and no matter how bad the situation is I want to be with them. It’s much better than suffering here alone and always worrying about your family," said the daily wager who works as a load man in Coimbatore. After returning home on a special train, he came back to the city for work in November hoping that the worst was over. It’s been a little over a year since the country woke up to the dire straits of guest workers, who took to the streets, flooded train stations and bus terminuses and walked miles on highways, as it went into a lockdown to control the spread of the coronavirus. As Tamil Nadu goes into a lockdown again, the scenes of exodus are back. Though there is no government order to stop work at factory units and construction sites, the fear among the workers is palpable. Raj Kishore Kumar, working at a foundry in Karumatampatti in Coimbatore, doesn’t want to take a chance like last time and get stuck. "My cousins and I have decided not to return until the situation is better. What will we do if the government prohibits industries from functioning and how will our employer help us if his business is not going well," says the 26-year-old from Bihar. The lack of a government support system was laid bare last year. The Shramik trains, temporary camps and rations from the government came weeks after workers were seen desperately fighting for survival. This led to a shift in the minds of the majority of the working class who are now hesitant to work in other states. Last April, Gourav Singh of Adhaura village of Bihar’s Kaimur district and 30 others struggled to return home from the automobile hub of Sriperumbudur. "Those days haunt me. Others like me have become insecure about moving out of our state," says Gourav, who decided against returning to Tamil Nadu after working for eight years, opting instead for a job closer home in Haryana. "My new job pays less, but my family is at peace that I work close to my native district," he says. According to industrialists, Coimbatore had about 1.5 lakh guest workers before March 2020. Of which about 80% had returned post lockdown. In the past month, about 10% of them returned to their native place out of panic when the lockdown in Maharashtra and Delhi were put in place. The situation is the same in Tirupur. Now about 60,000 workers are remaining, but that number is likely to dwindle as groups have been leaving the city in the past two days. Rough estimates show Tamil Nadu has nearly 30 lakh guest workers, but there is no official data. Last April, the labour department had developed an exclusive portal to keep track of the workers in TN, a first-of-its-kind in the country to keep track of workforce from other states and aimed to help them avail the welfare programmes as per the Building and Other Construction Workers Act 1996, Inter-State Migrant Workmen (regulation of employment and condition of service) Act 1979 and other labour laws. Data of more than 4.5 lakh workers were registered on the portal. But this portal has not been updated for the past four to five months. This is both because digital literacy among workers is poor and because without the state’s stringent rules employers have been lax in registering their workforce. Guest workers, says economist and political critic J Jeyarajan, are treated like "use and throw" material by the state and Union governments. "They are the vital cog for a state like Tamil Nadu, which is the country’s second biggest economy in the country. It cannot afford to ignore the welfare of the workforce if it wants the economy to revive," he says. In October 2020, the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation had announced the launch of a portal to register inter-state migrants and bring them under the One Nation One Ration Card scheme, but it is yet to go live. TNCSC commissioner Sajjan Singh R Chavan on Saturday told TOI that guest workers can avail ration from PDS shops in their area by producing necessary documents under the One Nation One Ration Card. But in reality, few workers are aware of the initiative. A welfare measure brought in without raising awareness about it means nothing, say experts. Without any lockdown protocol or assurances from the government, some workers and a section of employers are trying to create a supportive ecosystem so that work is not hampered and the workers have a safety net. Construction body Credai and Federation of Coimbatore Industrial Association are among the groups trying to convince workers to stay back as the state government has allowed industries and essential services to function. These bodies are assuring food and accommodation. "As we have been giving continuous work to them, not many of them have left in recent times. We are hopeful that the workers listen to us and stay back," says J James. Raja Shanmugam, president of Tirupur Exporters Association says, "Now that the European market is reviving and we are getting orders we cannot afford to lose them. We must act prudently to manage the situation." At the construction sites around Chennai, the promise of a steady income is working for some workers. "Nearly 80% of the guest workers came back to work by February. The employers have promised to take care of our needs as they suffered when work stopped last time," says a manpower supplier. For some workers who are staying back it is also because of a lack of other avenues. "Going home is not an option for us. We returned to work and after deciding to see through the storm. We will look after each other," says Mohammed Habib from Bihar’s Purnia district, who with 16 others came back to Chennai four months ago, all the while hoping their income is worth the risk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/guest-workers-are-in-no-mans-land-all-over-again/articleshow/82508136.cms||---
---||Udaipur||Rajasthan: State-aided shelter homes on verge of closure as funds dry up||UDAIPUR: The authorities are getting stricter with voluntary organisations and state-aided shelter homes to ensure compliance with Covid protocol at these places, while, on the other hand, these centres are on the verge of dysfunction since they have not received the annual budget for the financial year April 2020-March 2021. There are some 100 state-aided open shelter homes and children’s shelter homes across Rajasthan, which function on 90 per cent aid from the state government and 10 per cent self contribution under the Integrated Child Protection Scheme. The department of child rights is responsible for the budget allocation and district offices had been directed to disburse budget. While the open shelter homes are entitled to receive Rs 5 lakh and children’s homes Rs 10 lakh on yearly basis, it has been a complete year that these centres have been functioning without the government support. The norms provide for half yearly disbursement of budget so that centres can function properly but except Udaipur, no other districts have disbursed budget to these homes in their respective places. In Udaipur too, instead of complete payment, merely fifty per cent of the entitlement has been released which is a meagre amount and not enough to meet the daily requirement of the children living in these centres. “We have to provide food, clothing and shelter to the inmates. We have to pay the building rent, electricity and water bills. Big centres on goodwill arrange ration and other essentials on credit but every centre is not capable to run this way,” said manager of a shelter home in Rajsamand. As per admission norms, open shelters can keep 25 inmates while children’s homes have the capacity for 50 persons. Most of the homes across the state are presently running above 80 per cent capacity. The district legal service authorities at districts have been inspecting shelter homes frequently and reporting anomalies like lack of sanitisers, masks, oximeters and other necessary kits but they do not ask the reason why the amenities are not being provided, said another social worker. The rules demand 8 staff for open shelter homes and 14 for shelter homes but due to financial constraints, centres are not able to pay timely salaries to their staff. “We had received similar complaints from shelter homes. The commission intervened and directed the department of child rights to ask district level offices to disburse pending payments at the earliest so that inmates do not have to suffer. A virtual meeting is scheduled next week and we will look into this problem,” Shailendra Pandya, member of the Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/state-aided-shelter-homes-on-verge-of-closure-as-funds-dry-up/articleshow/82508138.cms||---

Not only did she find the school’s infrastructure impressive, but the entire process was also way smoother than she had expected — what with social distancing and other Covid-appropriate behaviour being strictly enforced. With 90s’ Bollywood songs playing softly in the background, Rai’s frayed nerves gradually eased. Rai was not the only one gushing, though. Several citizens took to the social media to shower praise on Delhi government schools over the vaccination arrangements, prompting AAP MLA Raghav Chadha to post a video of one such institute. This not a shopping mall, not a corporate office, not a luxury hotel - but a Delhi Government school which is tempo… https://t.co/Eb6QN074Vu— Raghav Chadha (@raghav_chadha) 1620407238000The staff at these centres have also come for special compliments. Rai, who got her jab on Friday at SBV School in Surajmal Vihar, said the school was very neat and clean and the instructions were easy to follow: “There was no confusion about waiting or observation rooms and how and where to queue up. It was a breeze,” she said. Ritika Bhatia, a communications professional, visited a government school in west Delhi’s Kirti Nagar with her brother-in-law after cancelling her appointment at a private hospital. “Many people told me that hospitals were very crowded and it was taking a lot of time to get the vaccination done. So, I decided to go to a government school, instead. Everything there was in order and people were double-masking.” Ambedkar University student Tanya Sharma had a similar experience to narrate. “Except for the trouble in finding the centre, which was located at GGSSS/GBSSS Badarpur No.1, I was pleasantly surprised that everyone was following all norms. The teachers, who were doubling up as vaccination staff, were cordial and guided us at every step. The ventilation was good and the entire process didn’t take much time,” Sharma said. On Sunday, Delhi government said in a statement: “Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been working on a mission mode to get all Delhiites vaccinated. One of the issues we foresaw was that people were apprehensive about going to hospitals to get vaccinated. That is why we decided to use our government schools as vaccination centres as they have really good infrastructure.” It added: “People are surprised to see this because when many of them were in government schools, the infrastructure was really bad. It is the first time they are getting to experience the dramatic changes made by the Kejriwal government in government schools and we are very happy that this is encouraging more people to get vaccinated.” Senior AAP functionary Atishi said Delhi had received around 43 lakh doses for people above 45 years, healthcare workers and frontline workers and 5.5 lakh vaccines for those between 18 and 45 years. She said vaccination was the only way to stop the spread of Covid. “We believe that we can vaccinate the entire population in three months. Hence, we hope that the Central government will increase stocks and supply them to Delhi government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jab-we-met-govt-schools-steal-hearts-with-vax-preparedness/articleshow/82508148.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Like 1st wave, CFR of Satranjipura, Gandhibagh zones high in 2nd one too||Nagpur: The most affected zones in first wave, Satranjipura and Gandhibagh, also have the highest Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR) in the second wave of the pandemic too. Late testing and lack of accessibility to medical services are major reasons, say officials of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). The city is witnessing second wave from the third week of February. Cases were on the rise since beginning of March. Deaths started to surge from third week of March, and cases and deaths were at the peak in April. CFR of city was 0.79% (474 deaths as against 59,724 cases) in March. CFR of Satranjipura zone was 1.32% in March, highest among all ten zones. Lakadganj zone was on second place with CFR of 1.23% followed by Ashi Nagar zone 1.12% and Gandhibagh zone 1.10%. Most of the localities in these zones are of economically weaker sections. CFR of remaining six zones was less than 1%. The city’s CFR increased to 1.04% in April with 1,222 fatalities and 1,17,246 cases. CFR of Satranjipura zone was 1.59%, the highest among all ten zones. Ashi Nagar zone was second with 1.33% followed by Gandhibagh zone 1.29%, Nehru Nagar zone 1.1%, Lakadganj zone 1.07%, Dhantoli zone 1.08% and Dharampeth zone 1.03%. When it comes to number of cases and deaths, Satranjipura and Gandhibagh zones have fewer cases compared to other zones. In initial months of the pandemic, from April to July last year, cases were highest from these two zones. NMC had undertaken mass contract tracing, quarantine and testing. It resulted in fewer deaths. After beginning of unlocking period, cases and deaths increased in these zones. The same trend continued during the peak in August and September last year. Since October last year, these two zones saw fewer cases and deaths. In February, lowest 262 cases were from Satranjipura zone. Officials from these two zones told TOI, “Late testing was one of the main reasons behind high CFR. Many localities in these zones are old, congested and economically weak families stay here. Non-availability of beds in government-run Covid hospitals affected these two zones.” The officials added drive of Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) is being undertaken in Satranjipura zone. “Initially, people were hesitant for testing but are now cooperating,” they said. Considering high CFR in these two zones, NMC’s death analysis has recommended community-based RAT testing to rule out hidden cluster of cases in these zones. Caseload is high in Laxmi Nagar and Dharampeth zones, which comprise many posh areas but CFR is low probably due to easy accessibility to medical care.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/like-1st-wave-cfr-of-satranjipura-gandhibagh-zones-high-in-2nd-one-too/articleshow/82508169.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Ajmer||Covid-19: Rural belts of Ajmer division report big spike in positive cases over last 7 days||AJMER: The rural belts of all the four districts under Ajmer division are sitting on a time bomb as the number of cases are spiralling at a rapid pace. With complete lockdown from May 10, the administration has directed all police stations to make efforts to shut down the villages completely. Unfortunately, in the tribal belt of Bhilwara and Chittorgarh, villagers are going to ‘tantriks’ for treatment rather than approaching hospitals. When their condition becomes critical, they rush to hospitals for aid. The administration is trying all methods to make the villagers understand that should they have fever or seasonal infection, they should approach the closest hospital. AjmerIn Ajmer, more deaths have been recorded in last five days from villages of Beawar, Kishangarh, Kekeri and Nasirabad. More than a thousand patients succumbed to the infection in the last one year, while in the last 72 hours, 70 deaths were recorded from rural regions. Out of every 100 samples, 38% are positive in Ajmer, out of these too 35.12% are recorded from rural areas. Sources said in Gagwana, Balupura and Daurai villages people have reported fever and cold. “We are sending teams to villages to provide relief,” said an official. An isolation ward is also reserved in JLN Hospital for doctors and medical staff and their relatives if they get infected while treating patients. BhilwaraNearly 7,000 Covid patients were reported from Bhilwara district in the first seven days of this month. At present, there are more than 3,000 active cases in the district. Last year, the district was a hotspot and became a role model to curb infection. This time the recovery rate is 62%. Unfortunately, the cases in villages of Bhilwara increased in the first week of May. According to official data, there were more than 4,000 patients from rural belt of the district. “Many people in villages here have reported symptoms like vomiting, diarrhoea, cold and flu,” said an official source. The official added that teams of doctors are going to every village to control the situation,” added a source. The major problem in Bhilwara is that infected people, instead of approaching hospitals are visiting ‘Bhopas’ and tantriks to be treated. “When their situation worsens they rush to the hospitals in critical condition, by then sometimes it is too late,” said an official. He added that most of the villages in Bhilwara are in remote areas and tribal belts and the people here prefer going to tantriks. NagaurIn nearby Nagaur district the condition is comparatively better but still cases in rural regions are increasing. There are around 1,700 active cases in Nagaur while more than 15,000 positive patients have been detected and over 12,000 patients have recovered. But in villages of Makrana, Didwana, Ladnu and Parbatsar most of those infected are not approaching hospitals. TonkIn Kanwarwas village of Tonk district there most residents reported having fever and cold. Sarpanch Manju wrote directly to the health minister and a team of doctors reached the village to treat patients. Similar cases have been reported from Chandpura, Salgiyawas, Banediya and nearby villages where there are large number of patients of seasonal fever. Doctors are directing villagers to remain quarantined for a week and the Sarpanch and officials have appealed to all to cancel weddings. Over 600 weddings were cancelled with the help of district administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/rural-belts-of-ajmer-division-report-big-spike-in-ve-cases-over-last-7-days/articleshow/82508185.cms||---

But the Kariba weed destroys water bodies and will gradually lead to drying up of these lakes if not tackled effectively and in time,” says Dr Kishor Mankar, conservator of forests (CF), Gadchiroli. Mankar, who was posted in Tadoba two years ago, had observed thick mats of Kariba weed in a portion of Irai dam near Mohurli. In Gadchiroli too, some water bodies are infested by salvinia molesta. Dr SH Patil, chairman, Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board (MSBB), says, “The weed is a double-edged sword. Though Kariba can be used as satisfactory mulch for crops, there is no doubt that it destroys aquatic biodiversity.” Forester Rundan Katkar working in Central Chanda said on the Chandrapur-Nagpur highway, the Ghodpeth lake shows no water but only Kariba weed. The plant has also infested Zarpat river and Junona lake near Chandrapur. “Its infestation has led to migratory birds on these water bodies declining by over 50%,” Katkar said. According to biodiversity expert Dr Mankar the plant originated in southeast Brazil and was probably exported as part of the ornamental and pet industry to be used in aquaria and garden ponds. From there, it might have escaped or was deliberately released into the wild. In Kerala, it has become an established danger occupying large areas of open water causing navigational problems. “The H2S generated in the decaying weed mass in the water is destructive. It also causes a reduction in stored water of reservoirs, and over the long term leads to gradual drying up of natural and man-made water bodies. This is a serious matter which needs to be tackled on war-footing before it becomes another menace like water hyacinth or Congress grass,” said Mankar. The official said increasing infestation of Kariba weed is impeding access to water bodies, ponds, and lakes and fishermen feel helpless as they can’t catch fish as nets get entangled in these aquatic weeds and boats can’t move freely. Mankar said the thick mat of weeds prevents light penetration in the water killing primary producers like algae and zooplanktons, which are a major food of fishes. It also lowers nutrients in the water and makes the water acidic. “The decomposition of biomass and its settlement decrease the depth and gradually lead to the death of water bodies. The other disadvantages include loss of recreation value due to lack of water sports or boating for tourists, loss of livelihood to traditional fishermen, reduction in indigenous plant and animal biodiversity,” he said. Mankar called for controlling the spread at initial stage, when the infestation is on a smaller scale. “If we don’t prevent its spread, in future it may become alarming and difficult to tackle. It needs to be mechanically removed otherwise it might infest most of our freshwater water bodies like dams, mama talao, village ponds etc,” he added. VANISHING WATER BODIES * Salvinia molesta, commonly known as Kariba weed, after it infested a large portion of Kariba lake between Zimbabwe and Zambia * It is an aquatic fern, native to southeast Brazil, and is a free-floating plant that does not attach to the soil, but instead remains buoyant on the surface of a body of water * Plants are removed by machine or harvesting equipment and by hand, which is only suitable for small infestations * Harvesting equipment can also encounter difficulties, as it cannot remove all of the infestation * Large infestations covering a wide area may also pose a problem to migratory birds||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kariba-weed-wreaks-havoc-on-water-bodies-in-region/articleshow/82508139.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Leaves of those jawans and officers who were already at home have been exteded. They have been directed to remain in their homes. Similarly, BSF, Army and the Air Force have sealed their premises and banned outside movement. Apart from this, BSF companies who are returning after the elections from West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are being quarantined prior to sending them on duty. District administration is arranging separate buildings for them. The good news is that 99% personnel of armed and paramilitary forces have been given both doses of Covid-19 vaccine. The remaining jawans and officers who are on leave will be given the second dose when they come back. BSF Rajasthan Frontier IG Pankaj Ghumar said that those BSF companies returning from election duties are being kept in an isolation centre as a preventive measure. After 14 days they will be sent on duty at the Indo-Pak border. Besides this, Covid-19 guidelines are being followed at the BSF border outposts. The personnel have been directed to perform their duty maintaining social distance, sanitising their hands at regular intervals, wearing masks and washing hands. IG Pankaj Ghumar said that on Friday a virtual conference of all commandants and DIG of the Rajasthan Frontier was held in which directions were given to prevent infection. He said that there is no shortage of medicines and all resources to stop the infection are available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/armed-forces-take-preventive-steps-to-stop-virus-spread/articleshow/82508203.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Vaccinate disabled people at home or separate centres’||New Delhi: After Delhi government announced vaccination for journalists at their offices, people with disabilities have demanded that they be vaccinated at home or at separate facilities. Disabled rights activist Abha Khetarpal said she was infected with Covid-19 when she went to get vaccinated. “The centre was very crowded. Because of it, my mother also got Covid and she couldn’t take her second dose,” said Khetrapal. “The best would be to provide the vaccination at home as many with severe disabilities cannot go and get themselves vaccinated. Moreover, being vulnerable and with low immunity, they are at the risk of getting infected because of the huge crowd,” she added. Satendra Singh, teacher at University College of Medical Sciences and disabled activist, suggest that old age homes or homes for disabled people may be used. “If arrangements can be made at schools, why not at these homes? A recent US study in New England Journal of Medicine reveals that those with intellectual disabilities were 2.5 times more likely to contract Covid-19, about 2.7 times more likely to be hospitalised and 5.9 times more likely to die than the general population. I have read that even in Pakistan, they vaccinated 80+ at their homes,” added Singh. Even a petition has been filed in Delhi High Court demanding preferential treatment for persons with disabilities. The court has sought response from the central and Delhi governments. The petition, filed by Mohd Faizal Nawaz and Meenu Mani, seeks vaccination of people with disabilities at institutions for abandoned and destitute persons with disabilities as well as at mental health institutions and psychiatric nursing homes. Even Manjir Gupta, who runs NGO Protection of the Rights of Differently Abled Children, highlights how it is difficult for people with intellectual disability to stand in the queue to get the vaccine. “I have 18 such students in the 18+ category for vaccination. It is difficult to make them wait in queues as most of them suffer from anxiety and behaviour disorders,” said Gupta. As per a study published in the Lancet journal shows John Hopkins Disability Health Research Centre created a Covid-19 vaccine prioritisation dashboard for people with disabilities in collaboration with Centre for Dignity in Healthcare for People with Disabilities. This tool compiles vaccine prioritisation information from all 50 US states, district of Columbia and five other US territories and weekly publish them on public health websites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vaccinate-disabled-people-at-home-or-separate-centres/articleshow/82508208.cms||Shradha Chettri

They said that the family of the deceased couldn’t keep the body at home and could not afford to hire an ambulance to store the mortal remains. “We had to store the body in an ambulance in its inbuilt freezer box overnight. The lady who died has two school-going kids—class 1 and class 4—and her husband is mentally disturbed. As thhe husband and kids also tested positive, no relative or friend came forward to help them,” said Sai Teja from the NGO, who stepped in to help the family.

ASI Himmat Singh from Hathipole police station on Sunday received information about an ailing couple in Chamanpura colony. The cop was told that an old man and his wife were unwell. None from the neighborhood helped them since they feared they could be infected. The ASI called 108 ambulance and asked the driver to take the old man to hospital. But the driver said the address was at a narrow lane where the vehicle cannot enter. After learning about it, the ASI went himself to the couple's home and was shocked to see their condition. “They were lying on a bed. The old man had not eaten properly for days and was too weak. He wasn’t wearing clothes properly. Tea and food was lying near the bed . I took his clothes from the woman and dressed him up before carrying him in a stretcher to the ambulance,” Singh said. The cop also asked the neighbors to help him, but most refused claiming that the old man could be suffering from Covid since he was ill for many days. “We should be careful, but not be scared of the pandemic and try to help needy people around us to get them hospitalised if someone was not able to go by themselves,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/udaipur-cop-helps-ailing-patient-to-get-hospital/articleshow/82508223.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Udaipur||Rajasthan: Ancient undersea site to turn into tourist spot||UDAIPUR: Some 80 crore years ago, this place had been a sea. Remnants found here called stromatolites are known as impression of one of the earliest forms of life on earth. Stromatolites consumed carbon dioxide from the then CO2 rich atmosphere and gave out oxygen that enriched the atmosphere with life sustaining oxygen. Bojunda Stromatolite Fossil Park near Chittorgarh is an exposure within the massive Bhagwanpura Limestone of the Vindhyan age. In 1976, the Geological Survey of India had included the site among the lists of National Geological Monuments and there are 12 such geoheritage sites in Rajasthan. Since then, this site had been lying forgotten, but thanks to the initiative taken by the Department of Mines and Geology in joint association with the Chittorgarh district administration, a geopark is proposed to be developed at this forgotten site. A team of experts and authorities including Pradeep Agarwal, additional director, mines and geology and collector Tarachand Meena and others visited the site recently. Meena ordered to complete the mapping of the area and directed for a proposal of geopark in 12 hectare area here. “The Bojunda geopark has great potential to become a popular destination for tourists in the Mewar Circuit, but it needs to be promoted suitably by the state and Union ministries of tourism. Because of its favourable location and a welcome variation from a routine tourist site, this destination would be a welcome ‘satellite site’ for the visiting tourists and students,” Prof P S Ranawat, a geoheritage expert and advisor, said. Ranawat has submitted a developmental plan under Phase 1 that includes boundary wall, gateway and a parking area. “An Interpretation Centre having a hall and a small office room for indoor museum and audio-visual display and wall mounted images and floor-placed 3-D models about the various geodiversity of this district is proposed. A TV or a big screen display system and about 50-seat facility for viewing video clips will also be present in this IC. Display facility will showcase representative samples of georesources of Chittorgarh, viz. limestones, sandstones, shales, clays, red ochre. Charts of georesources of the area, industries based on them (smelter, cement plants, gang-saws) their impact on economy and society should be installed,” Ranawat said. What are stromatolites?Stromatolites are structures produced by blue-green algae, which through their filaments, attract and bond carbonate particles forming a mat. They are mostly columnar structures at right angles to the horizontal carbonate rocks resulting from the combination of life activity and sediment trapping and binding ability of algal assemblages and preying bacteria.  They form generally in intratidal (shallow water) regime where tides bring floating sedimentary material continuously and make it flow through carbonate particles. The Vindhyan group of rocks of India is one of the largest and thickest sedimentary rock sequence in the world, which was deposited in an intra-cratonic basin, it is composed mostly of shallow marine deposits. It is believed to have recorded a substantial portion of past 1,000 million years of earth history and hence contain valuable information on the evolution of the atmosphere (CO2-rich to O2-rich), climate, and life on our planet (unicellular marine life).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/ancient-undersea-site-to-turn-into-tourist-spot/articleshow/82508268.cms||---

I got one luckily at Katol. I went there and took the vaccine,” said Raut. Hundreds of techno savvy youths like him are getting vaccinated from nearby village centers by booking slots online using the high speed internet and other IT related tricks. Youths in other cities are also following the same mantra. “It’s always better to register using the CoWin website instead of app or Arogya Setu platform,” said IT professional Chetan Kalambe, who got his registration done in a village PHC in his district and got vaccinated too. “There are different search options. You can search by pin code and also by district. Select the district-wise option so that you can get the list of all centers in your district. Possibilities of vacant slot in rural areas are more,” said Amol Thodge, who not only registered a slot for himself, but for all his relatives staying in different districts of Vidarbha. “I even registered my maid servant and her husband. We must help people who don’t know how online registration is done,” he said. There are select centers in rural Vidarbha for vaccination of 18-44 age group. Due to low internet speed, and lack of knowledge of online process, youths in villages hardly register online for the jabs. Online registration is the only option available for this age group. As slots remain vacant, city youths book them and get vaccines. This has invited local people’s wrath at many places. The recent incidenrt is in Saoner where locals created scene after watching almost all from Nagpur in the vaccine queue. “As per government of India rules, a citizen can register at any center in the country. Off line registration is not possible in case of 18-44 age group. So, we can’t stop anyone coming with proper online registration,” said a senior official from the PHC in Saoner. It’s not a rule but people should prefer their nearby center, he appealed. Travelling is allowed for vaccination if someone shows the vaccine registration SMS or print-out of the same. Hence, youths are taking it as an opportunity to travel nearby which was stopped since more than a month due to lockdown. “I understand this is creating problem for the village youths who are expected to book slot at their respective centers. They can always book online. But, there are problems regarding net connectivity and speed issues in villages,” said Mujahid Sheikh from Akola, who also got vaccine in a PHC in Akot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-youths-travelling-nearby-villages-to-get-vaccines/articleshow/82508309.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

In his complaint, Dr Dahiya alleged that they indulged in propaganda suggesting that people should not seek treatment from doctors, using insulting language towards doctors and intentionally and deliberately violating directions for the treatment of Covid-19 affected patients. He urged the police commissioner to conduct a high-level inquiry into the issue and said a criminal case should be registered against the accused. Dahiya was the first senior IMA functionary who directly attacked Prime Minster Narendra Modi and called him a “failed PM” in a hard-hitting statement issued over a fortnight. He accused the PM of emerging as a ‘super spreader’ by holding big political rallies in poll-bound states and even allowing Kumbh Mela during such a serious situation. Submitting video clips of Baba Ramdev with his complaint, Dahiya alleged that he advised Covid patients to not go to hospitals for treatment but cure their symptoms themselves by following his advice. “He gave advice to Covid-19 patients against the directions issued by the Government of India for treatment of Covid patients and in that way pushed patients towards their deathbeds without any treatment from hospitals. By doing so, he has clearly violated the directions issued by the government regarding the code of conduct and other orders passed by authorities and in that way is liable to be punished under the provision of Disaster Management Act of 2005 and Epidemic Disease Act of 1897,” IMA national VP has said. He said in an interview with a news channel, Ramdev used defamatory language towards doctors of government and private hospitals by saying that they use Remdesivir and antibiotic injections to treat Covid-19 patients, which leads to the death of the patients. “With his false statements, Ramdev has created panic in the public and due to that, patients would not feel like coming to the hospitals for their treatment and accused created a problem for the government to overcome the situation,” he added.In his complaint, Dr Dahiya alleged, “He and Balkrishna claimed to treat Covid patients without any authority, even without having any licence or professional degree and in that way, violated the law of the land and sold their illegal product of medicine by stating that it is useful for treatment of Covid-19 and in that way committed cheating with public and extortion (of) the money from the public.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/indian-medical-association-vice-president-complains-to-police-against-ramdev-over-covid-claims/articleshow/82508335.cms||---

Parking contractors claim that with the rise in the Covid-19 cases in April, the demand for parking had reduced by 60%, and after the lockdown from April 19, became nil. They argue that the situation will persist and they won’t be able to bear the burden alone. Jagdamba Singh, a parking contractor with South Delhi Municipal Corporation said talks are going on to approach the civic body soon and make them aware about the losses. “Despite re-opening of lockdown last year, business didn’t revive till October. And as soon as the new financial year began, the situation worsened,” he said. Another parking contractor said that looking at the existing circumstances, it doesn’t seem like the situation is going to get better soon. “Now is not the right time to approach municipal authorities as everyone is struggling to save their loved ones. As soon as the offices are opened, we will take up the matter,” said the contractor. A senior SDMC official, however, said that they have not received any intimation from contractors regarding relief. The East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor said that things were working fine till April mid and even the parking lots were going full. “I don’t think the contractors suffered losses this year except for the past 15 days. I hope the situation will get better in sometime. We gave them relief last year, but things have been different this time,” he said. In total, the SDMC has 133 surface parking lots, north corporation has 103 and EDMC around 70, which are being managed and operated by parking contractors through tenders. Last year, the SDMC and north corporation had given 100% remission for licensing fees till June. From June 8 to September, around 75% concession was allowed in case of residential and market area parking lots. For offices, commercial complexes and industrial areas, 67% relief in payment of parking fees between June 8- July 31 and 50% From August 1 to September 30 was given.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/civic-bodies-may-lose-parking-revenue-again/articleshow/82508311.cms||Vibha Sharma

Along with the jewellery, the accused also took away the digital video recorder (DVR) containing the CCTV footage. According to Chandanagar police, the incident happened at Rehan Jewellers in Tara Nagar, Chandanagar. As per the complaint lodged by shop owner, Syed Parveen, at 9.30 am on Sunday, she went to the shop and realised that unknown offenders broke the shutter lock and gained entry into the jewellery store. “The offenders stole 15 tola gold, 15 kilo silver and Rs 3.5 lakh cash,” the complainant alleged. According to Miyapur ACP S Krishna Prasad, Parveen kept Rs 3.5 lakh cash in the cash chest at the shop to pay for a land deal. “There are two entrances to the shop and the offenders broke the shutter lock at the rear entrance and gained entry,” the ACP said. Though the offenders escaped with the DVR after committing jewellery theft, police verified nearby CCTV camera footage and noticed that two suspects were directly involved in the offense. A case was registered under sections 457 and 380 of the Indian Penal Code. A man hunt was launched to nab the offenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/property-worth-rs-20l-stolen-in-chandanagar/articleshow/82508346.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Traders suffer huge losses as weddings get cancelled in Jaipur||JAIPUR: Kundan Lal, a sherwani merchant from Jaipur, had expected a good run for business this wedding season, for which he ordered the artisans to make hundreds of the product in advance. Around 250 advance bookings were made and raw material worth more than Rs 1.5 crore was already purchased for the expected rush during the wedding season, all of which was ruined after the announcement of lockdown. Frustrated with the situation, Kundan said, “Most of the weddings are now cancelled. I haven’t calculated the losses else I will be more depressed. Last lockdown hit all of us hard and we were expecting some kind of recovery this time. But with sudden curbs placed in lockdown with just 11 members, most people have cancelled, especially the middle class and upper economical background. Other orders were not completed because we were not allowed to open stores. No one wants to do a wedding in just 11 people.” Most of the traders in the market are facing a similar situation with many shopkeepers struggling to pay their staff their salaries for next few months. Chandra Prakash Rana, owner of three shops selling wedding lehengas, said that hundreds of orders he received could not be completed and he had to face the wrath of his customers. “Most of the weddings are cancelled and our customers haven’t come to receive their orders. In curfew times, overnight decision came for the curbs and we didn’t get enough time to stitch the blouses or prepare the lehengas. Many customers even abused us for not delivering bridal dresses on time which we understand. But now weddings are cancelled as if a women is wearing Rs 50,000 lehenga wouldn’t she want a proper photographer,” said Rana. People from lower economic background are finding it useful that the restrictions are imposed as now they are able to complete the ceremony without any expense.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/traders-suffer-huge-losses-as-weddings-get-cancelled/articleshow/82508350.cms||---

Three other colleagues — Sanjay Gondale, Sujit Kavle and Gyandeep Gajbhiye — also join around the same time. In a less than an hour, there is call from the NMC, and the four are ready in PPE kits to bring a Covid dead to the ghat (burning ground). In a quick order, the body is put on the pyre and soon consigned to flames. Ranghari or any of his colleagues discard the PPE suit and send a ‘done’ report on their mobile to NMC and wait for another call. This goes on till late till 10pm at times. The four mechanically burn body after body as grieving relatives watch. As Covid toll has reduced these days, Ranghari is able to reach home by 9 to 9:30 in the evening. “The call can be to reach the deceased’s home or hospital. On Sunday, the first call was from a private hospital near Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). The deceased must be over 60 years old,” says Ranghari. By 8pm, the team had cremated 6 bodies and closed for the day in some time. In case the patient has died at home, the job starts with covering the body with a protective plastic sheet, he says. “The morbid nature of the job leaves us stressed indeed. Yet I continue to remain a teetotaller. None in the team has felt the need of any vices like alcohol to ward off the gloom,” he says. The numbers have come down. In April, we had handled as much as 17 bodies in a single day, said Ranghari, who is in the health department of NMC drawing a little over Rs16,700 a month. The 48-year-old father of two became permanent employee only less than a month before Covid struck last year. Till then, he was on daily wages doing odd jobs in the civic body’s hospitals. Since the first wave, he has been put on crematorium duty by the NMC. “I chose not to count the dead. Instead, I and my team pray that the spate of deaths should end. Yet, if asked, we may have handled round 1,000 bodies since last year,” he says. “We do get emotional on seeing the grieving kin. Some incidents may never be forgotten,” he says. Last year, we had brought the body of a 22-year-old girl. She was supposed to go to a hospital in Mumbai for some treatment, but missed the train. She went back GMCH where she was consulting a doctor and got admitted and died in a day. Her story left us heartbroken. I can go on narrating many such stories” he says. Ranghari says he started the job of handling the bodies with a strong heart, yet in the initial days he was worried about spreading the infection to his family members. Eventually, I realized that I am perfectly safe in the PPE kit. “I only touch the meals after sanitizing the hand,” he says. Ranghari starts his day with a heavy breakfast and prefer not to bring a tiffin box, but shares a bite from other’s lunch as they break for a mid-day meal at around 1:30pm at the lawn in the crematorium itself. My son has recently completed engineering and daughter is pursuing a nursing course, he adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/on-duty-with-dead-cremating-bodies-but-keeping-hopes-alive/articleshow/82508353.cms||Shishir Arya

Currently, more than 1 lakh government teachers are conducting a door-to-door survey to to prepare a list of people suffering from fever or Covid symptoms. Narayan Singh Sisodia, spokesperson of Rajasthan Rajasthan Shikshak Evam Panchayati Raj Karamchari Sangh said, “This is a discrimination to employees of a profession, who from day one has been helping others and supporting the government in the fight against Covid. There is a need to vaccinate all government teachers. This is such an unjust behavior of the government who have completely ignored us.” Siddharth Mahajan, secretary of medical, health and family welfare, could not be contacted. Former education minister and BJP MLA from Ajmer Vasudev Devnani said this was sheer ignorance of the government towards teachers. “When lakhs of teachers are working day and night for the government, why aren’t the government teachers given any priority? This is injustice towards them and state government should make their stance clear whether they care about the teachers or not,” said Devnani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-teachers-not-included-in-list-of-covid-warriors/articleshow/82508380.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana agriculture department draws plan to increase cultivation||HYDERABAD: The state agriculture department has stated that this rainy season an additional 28 lakh acres will be brought under cultivation. According to the plan of the department, a total of 1.62 crore acres will be brought under cultivation as against 1.34 crore acres last season. The department has made it clear there is no need to follow regulated farming formula this time around as paddy cultivation should be brought down. According to the plan, the cultivation of cotton and red gram will increase. “Many irrigation projects are filled with water along with the Kaleswaram project. Also we are anticipating good rains which will help us achieve the target cultivated area,” officials said. The extent of cotton to be grown is expected to increase by 20 lakh acres, compared to 60 lakh acres last year. Paddy is generally the highest grown crop in the state during the rainy season and instructions were given to seed companies to supply BT cotton seeds from June second week onwards. The agriculture department also suggested reducing paddy cultivation by 5 lakh acres compared to last year’s 53 lakh acres. The plan aims to increase red gram cultivation by 13 lakh acres, thereby ensuring it is cultivated in 24 lakh acres as against 11 lakh acres grown last year. Maize, grown in 2.25 lakh acres last year, would be maintained at the around the same level at 2.29 lakh acres this year. “The second wave of Covid-19 has not seemed to impact the rural areas much and by the time the agriculture season begins, we hope to see a drop in the number of cases,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/agri-dept-draws-plan-to-increase-cultivation/articleshow/82508387.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Nagpur||DRDO’s anti-Covid drug 2-DG could boost recovery: Experts||Nagpur: Prominent physicians from the city have hailed the latest anti-Covid therapeutic 2-deoxy-D-glucose or 2-DG drug from Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) as a much-needed development in the country whose health infrastructure is buckling under the second wave of the pandemic. According to clinical trail results, the drug is effective in reducing hospitalization period by hastening recovery and oxygen dependency. Calling it a proud moment for India, the physicians are keen to test the drug on their patients as it is likely to reach local pharmacy markets soon. Developed by DRDO’s internal lab, Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS) in collaboration with Dr Reddy’s Laboratory, 2-DG has got the approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for emergency use. Unlike other drugs coming from across the shores, 2-DG was developed and tested in Indian conditions, and the trials took place across 17 hospitals in the country. Experts like Dr Nikhil Balankhe, Dr Jay Deshmukh and Dr Kamal Bhutada said chances are the drug will be a success as it came through trials on local population. The DRDO has also claimed their oral powder 2-DG is more effective in faster symptomatic cure than standard care. Experts feel the drug, which would be available in sachets from next week, could be an alternative to high-priced drugs, many of which are often in short-supply in Nagpur market too. Dr Kamal Bhutada, director of ICU, Care Hospital, said the scientists have replaced two hydroxyl molecules with that of hydrogen in developing DRDO’s drug. “It is a non-functional glucose. The molecule of this drug will enter the Covid cell whose uptake of glucose would be more and kill it in the process,” said Bhutada and added, “This present study was earlier used in the anti-cancer and tumor therapies whose trials are still on.” “Studies showed the drug to be having less side-effects on liver and kidney,” he said and added that being a local product it would be cheaper too. Dr Jay Deshmukh, senior physician of Sunflower Hospital, said as per research the drug reduced oxygen requirement and an early discharge is envisaged. “A proud moment for India and it should be an important drug in the armamentarium of treating doctors. The drug enters the virally infected cells of human beings and probably does not allow the virus to multiply,” he said. “2-DG is taken by the glucose transporters of the cell. So, the cells with higher glucose uptake will also have a higher uptake of 2-DG which will likely to hamper the growth of the affected cells of the Covid patients,” he said. “It’s an adjunct therapy today to assist the principle therapy, but tomorrow it may turn into a principle therapy after success,” said Dr Deshmukh. Dr Nikhil Balankhe, physician at Viveka Multispecialty Hospital, said the drug stops the viral replication. “The drug is designed to reduce the generation of the ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) by inhibiting production of glucose in affected cells. When it happens, the virus gets no energy and it dies,” he said. “Tested in Indian condition, this drug could match the local population’s need, unlike the foreign-made ones which are tested in different conditions. This drug may have some influence on cardiac functioning,” he said.  Indian-made Baricitinib costs only Rs419 Nagpur: As against the imported version of the anti-Covid therapeutic Bariticinib whose each tablet costs around Rs3,000. A strip contains seven tablet. Its local counterpart is priced at Rs419 for 14 tablets. Manufactured by Natco Pharma, locally manufactured Bariticinib tablets have now reached the Nagpur market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/drdos-anti-covid-drug-2-dg-could-boost-recovery-experts/articleshow/82508385.cms||Soumitra Bose

Since 2000, Maharashtra has been recruiting teachers in schools on probation for three years as Shikshan Sevaks or assistant teachers. However, these teachers get no other benefit of being a government employee while on probation but do all the mandated work. Vaibhav Phatangare, a coordinator of the Association of Assistant Teachers, said, “All assistant teachers on probation and permanent, were given Covid duties. They get Rs 6,000 per month as salary and only 12 days as leave a year. There have been so many cases where the teacher had to pay lakhs of rupees on treatment of Covid causing financial stress. It is important that the assistant teachers at least get medical benefits extended to other teachers. At least five shikshak sevaks we know have died. ” Mohini Kumbhar, wife of Anil Kumbhar, a Shikshan Sevak in Ratnagiri who died of Covid-19, has a one-month-old son. “I was at my mother’s house when he got a message on his cellphone that he has been assigned Covid duty. He left on April 5. He contracted the virus and passed away on April 17,” Mohini said. “My husband’s salary was the sole source of income in the house. My child is just barely a month old,” she said. Jagannath Khatal lost his assistant teacher son to Covid-19. Sunil was in Parbhani as the school was in a remote area with little online connectivity. A teacher close to Khatal said that they would make regular visits to groups of students so that they remain connected to the academic world and it must be during one of these travels that he contracted the virus. Khatal said his son was admitted to a private hospital in Yeola. “When his condition started deteriorating, the hospital staff told us to move him to a government hospital. We begged them to treat him but they did not. So we moved him to a government facility. He was talking until almost one hour prior to his death,” Khatal said. Gajanan Thackeray, a shikshan sevak, said he contracted the virus when on Covid duties. “Post Covid-19, I developed many complications including the fungus. I have already spent about Rs 5 lakh from my pocket and our salary is Rs 6,000 per month. There should be some health insurance benefits for us too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/4k-asst-teachers-on-covid-duties-send-sos-to-govt/articleshow/82514032.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Nagpur||No jab for 45-plus today, drive to be hit 7th time in 10 days||Nagpur: After resuming Covid-19 vaccination of 45-plus people on Sunday, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) would halt the drive on Monday for want of doses. For the first time, three centres of 18-44 years age group will remain shut on Monday due to shortage of doses. Vaccination of 45-plus along with healthcare workers (HCW) and frontline workers (FLW) resumed on Sunday after the civic body received 14,000 doses of Covishield from the state government on Saturday . On Sunday, 11,896 people from 45-plus age group, HCWs and FLWs took the jab. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said there would be no vaccination of 45-plus on Monday. “It will resume whenever doses arrive,” he said. It would be for the 7th time in last 10 days when inoculation of 45-plus will be badly affected. Many people are due for second dose. Two Covaxin centres at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) remained closed for third consecutive day as doses were not available. Lack of doses also compelled the NMC to postpone drive-in vaccination at three centres for 60-plus people. Vaccination of 18-44 years age group was conducted at nine centres on Sunday. Three centres — Gupta Community Hall at Bajeria, Virungula Centre at Jai Hind Society at Manish Nagar and Dr Ambedkar Hospital at Indora — were added on Sunday. These centres will administer Covaxin. Earlier, three centres each were administering Covishield and Covaxin. Three centres for Covishield — Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya, Isolation and Pachpaoli hospitals — will remain closed on Monday as the NMC has exhausted 6,000 doses supplied by government for 18-44 years age group on May 1. Remaining six centres will continue as government supplied 6,000 doses of Covaxin couple of days ago. Many in the 18-44 age group are complaining about not getting online appointment. The NMC is unable to increase centres and cover more people due to shortage of doses. Vaccination of 45-plus as well as 18-44 years continued in rural areas having sufficient stock. Inoculation of 45-plus could not happen on Sunday in Chandrapur district which ran out of doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-jab-for-45-plus-today-drive-to-be-hit-7th-time-in-10-days/articleshow/82508416.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Delhi||Fastest fingers first not enough to get vax slot: Those in 18-44 age group find it difficult to get vaccination appointments on Co-Win||NEW DELHI: For nearly 10 days, Avi Kathpalia has been spending hours in front of his laptop trying to book a vaccination slot for himself and his sister. Peering over the Co-Win website, the public policy professional complains how difficult it is to find a slot to get the anti-Covid jabs. “I spend around three hours every day just refreshing the website as the app is not responding well. The problem is that even when we find vacant slots, there is this whole process of typing out the captcha. Often the captcha is not clear and you make a mistake there. By the time you get done with that, the slots are already over,” he stated. Kathpalia added that “the system is not ideal, especially for those who don’t have access to high-speed internet or smartphones”. Vaishnavi Mangal, a JNU MPhil scholar, has a similar tale to tell. “There are only slots for those who are 45 or above. For others, the slots are filled in no time.” Many have been forced to book appointments in neighbouring cities, such as Noida and Gurgaon. Christina George, a content writer, claimed that she registered on Co-Win on April 28, but hadn’t found a slot yet. “I have also been looking for appointments at all sub-districts, including Gurgaon and Noida. At times, the colour code is yellow, which means some slots are open, but when you click on it, you find everything booked. I seem to be out of luck despite checking the website thrice a day,” she rued. For some, the perseverance has paid dividends. Tanushree Bhasin, a photographer, got a slot for early Sunday after spending hours on the website. Many like her have joined Telegram messaging groups where updates about open slots are given. “It took me a few days to even get the OTP. After that problem got resolved, I still had to spend hours to get a slot booked.” She questioned the need for a website in the first place. “It is presumed that people have access to the internet or know how to use a website like this. I do not think many have the time or ability to do this.” Gargi Ajay Upadhyay, an illustrator, and her cousins have been checking the website regularly for updates. Upadhyay said the website was wracked by glitches and “this medium does not seem efficient in reaching out to those who need it the most”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fastest-fingers-first-not-enough-to-get-vax-slot-those-in-18-44-age-group-find-it-difficult-to-get-vaccination-appointments-on-co-win/articleshow/82508435.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

The release is expected to continue till next month, during which 3.5 TMC to 4 TMC water is likely to be discharged. However, the irrigation department said that the ongoing release would not affect Pune’s water supply. Adequate water stock required for fulfilling city’s needs till the end of July had been reserved, the department added. At present, the four dams hold 11.9 TMC (41%) water stock collectively, which is around one TMC more than last year’s storage at this time. Two major dams — Panshet and Varsagaon hold around 5 TMC water each. The Temghar dam has 0.45 TMC water, while Khadakwasla’s stock is at 0.47 TMC on Monday. Officials in the state irrigation department said that the water release from Khadakwasla for summer crops had started last week. “This is the second time in the summer that water is being released for irrigation. The water is flowing into the Mutha canal and further to the rural parts. The rotation is expected to continue till the first week of June,” PK Shelar, sub-divisional engineer at the irrigation department, said. Another official said that the water stock required for the city till July-end had been reserved. “However, the civic body should utilize water judiciously to avoid any shortage issues at the end of summer”. The city is drawing around 1.4 TMC to 1.5 TMC water every month from Khadakwasla. Going by the consumption, the city will require around 4.5 TMC water till July-end.

---||Chandigarh||No means no, simple phrase men find difficult to understand: HP HC junks bail plea by rape accused||Shimla: Dismissing a bail petition filed by a man accused of a minor’s rape, the Himachal Pradesh high court has observed that the simplest of phrases, “no means no”, had become the most difficult for some men to understand. The court said no does not mean yes, it does not mean the girl is shy, it does not mean the girl is asking a man to convince her, and it does not mean he has to keep pursuing her. Court said the word no doesn’t need any explanation or justification. “It ends there, and the man has to stop. Be that as it may, the victim, in this case, said no to the accused when he started touching her, but he continued. It nowhere implies consent, or zeal and desire to explore and feel each other in romantic love,” observed Justice Anoop Chitkara in a recent judgment decided on May 5. Counsel for the accused argued that the survivor said in her statement under Section 164 of CrPC that she was a friend of the accused, and her taking lift in his vehicle proved that the friendship was cordial, resultantly, the sexual intercourse, if any, took place with active consent and without any force on her by the accused. Counsel stated that thus, the conduct of the victim would entitle the accused to grant of bail. On the contrary, additional advocate general for the state drew attention to the petition wherein the allegations were that the police were trying to save the actual culprits. Court pointed out that the scientific evidence pointed to the presence of blood and semen on the survivor’s innerwear. It also stated that no physical injuries were found on her body. Referring to the survivor’s statement, court said she had said no to sex with the accused, but the accused told her not to cry or he would force himself upon her. “In such circumstances of threat and coercion in a secluded area, the victim was forced to cooperate with the accused, which explains the absence of physical injuries on her body, and the presence of semen, indicating unprotected sex,” it added. Court said neither the absence of resistance nor unwilling submission implied consent in any language. “She explicitly said no to the accused, but he did not stop. When the curriculum does not include proper sex education, children raised by such societies fail women time and again,” it said. Court said counsels for the parties had also made several other arguments. “Still, given that this court is not inclined to grant bail, on the reasons mentioned above, discussion of the same will be an exercise in futility. Any detailed analysis of the evidence may prejudice the case of the prosecution or the accused,” it said. Court said given above, in the facts and circumstances peculiar to this case, at this stage, the petitioner failed to make out a case for bail. It dismissed the petition with liberty to file a new bail application in case of changed circumstance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-means-no-simple-phrase-men-find-difficult-to-understand-hp-hc-junks-bail-plea-by-rape-accused/articleshow/82508462.cms||Anand Bodh

The specially abled persons are facing a lot of problems in getting vaccinated. I have raised this issue with the secretary that how will blind and mentally challenged persons and persons with severe disability will be able to go to the vaccination centres,” said Goyal. “I have suggested to the government that special vaccination camps should be organised in special schools and rehabilitation centres for them. They cannot go to the crowded general centres as they are already immunocompromised. Hence, they should be protected,” he added. Goyal has also written to the state human rights commission and Rajasthan state legal services authority (RSLSA) raising the issue. There are around 17 lakh persons with disability (PWDs) in the state. “When during elections, the election commission arranges wheelchairs and vehicles for them, then why can’t they have similar arrangement for them for the vaccination,” added Goyal. WFH employees can helps spread awareness Chief secretary Niranajan Arya on Sunday said the services of employees working from home can also be taken for spreading awareness about Covid protocol and publicity of CM Chiranjeevi Health Insurance scheme. He said services of such employees can be availed in Covid management through subdivision-level and village-level core groups. “They can spread awareness about Covid discipline among people through optimum use of social media and public address systems. They should also ensure that no person infected with Covid remains deprived of treatment due to lack of information and resources,” said Arya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/special-arrangements-needed-to-vaccinate-specially-challenged/articleshow/82508501.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||SIT free to complete probe before HC deadline of 6 months: Govt||Chandigarh: The Punjab government has clarified that the new special investigation team (SIT) constituted by the state government on the Punjab and Haryana high court’s directions to probe the Kotkapura police firing case of 2015 is not barred by the court to complete the probe earlier, even within two months, if possible. The state government spokesperson said on Sunday that the six-month time frame for the new SIT to conclude the investigation was set by the high court. The high court order of April 9 reads, “The investigation of these FIRs shall be concluded as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a period of six months from the date of the constitution of SIT.” The spokesperson said that this high court direction has been simply reproduced in the SIT re-constitution notification issued by the state government, which has been specifically barred from interfering in any manner. Therefore, the period of six months is an upper limit which has been imposed by the high court, said the spokesperson while reacting to the criticism of the state government on the six-month deadline. He said the intent of the state government had been misread and misconstrued by certain elements motivated by vested political interests. The spokesperson said the state government was committed to ensure a fair investigation into the incident to ensure justice for the innocent and punishment for the guilty, therefore, it had set up the new SIT instead of merely contesting the court’s decision to quash the earlier SIT probe. The new SIT headed by ADGP L K Yadav has already conducted its first meeting virtually on May 8, a day after it was constituted. It has started the process of investigation by summoning the case file and other relevant records from the Faridkot court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sit-free-to-complete-probe-before-hc-deadline-of-6-months-govt/articleshow/82508506.cms||---

---||Delhi||Centre chose image over Indian lives: Sisodia||New Delhi: In a scathing attack on the Centre, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia alleged that many young lives could have been saved from the deadly second wave of Covid in the country, if the central government had vaccinated its own people instead of exporting vaccines to other countries for ‘image management’. “Since the start of this second wave in March, we have lost a cumulative of one lakh people in India due to Covid-19. But our central government is busy in exporting 6.5 crore doses of vaccines to 93 nations, so they can continue to maintain their image, so the world can appreciate the central government while it continues to pay lip service to its own people, its own citizens,” Sisodia said, citing a newspaper report. “It is important to help nations in this crisis, and it is required, but not at the expense of our own people,” he said addressing a digital press conference. The deputy CM said that countries like US, Canada, France, etc also followed international treaties, but did not cut vaccine doses from their own stock and prioritised their citizens. He said Delhi has ensured individuals above 60 years got inoculated and scaled up the drive when vaccination was opened for everyone above the age of 45 years. “However, when it was time for our youth to get vaccinated, Delhi government opened centres all across the capital but the central government administered only 5.5 lakh vaccines for the youth. 5.5 lakh vaccine for our youth and 6.5 crore vaccine for other nations,” he said. Sisodia claimed that upon doing further research following newspaper reports, he found out that 60% of the nations where vaccines were exported have not reported many Covid cases. “In fact, 88 of these 93 nations have not reported many deaths and therefore do not see fatality rate as a big challenge,” he alleged. “As we begin vaccination drives for people above 18 years of age, many people are sitting in front of their screens for 24 hours to book an online appointment slot for themselves and their family to get vaccinated,” he said. Delhi BJP President Adesh Gupta claimed Sisodia’s statement is false and misleading and said the central government has not allowed export of vaccine after March 2021 when pandemic re-erupted in several parts of India. “The vaccination campaign in India started in January 2021 and never faced shortage due to exports to meet international needs,” Gupta said. “India helped world when pandemic slowed in India and today the world is helping India by sending vaccines and medical apparatus,” Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-chose-image-over-indian-lives-sisodia/articleshow/82508505.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Among private hospitals too only 10% of the O2 beds are available. On the other hand, the Covid scenario is worsening. Coimbatore district, which was third in the state in terms of daily Covid cases, has now become second, next only to Chennai.On Sunday last, Coimbatore reported 1,441 cases. but the spike has been so sharp that it has started reporting more than 2,000 cases daily in the following days only to touch the new high of 2,500 cases this Sunday.The active cases in the district stand at 11,731, while the total cases reported so far was 94,931. As many as 1,705 people were discharged from various hospitals on Sunday.Deaths are also slowly rising, though the death rate appears to be very low compared to the state average. While Chengalpet which saw lesser Covid cases than Coimbatore report twice the number of deaths, Coimbatore reported nine deaths on Sunday.Though the death rate is less compared to other districts, epidemiologists say there was no reason to be complacent as the Covid deaths could be under-reported. One district cannot buck the statewide or nationwide trend without any plausible explanation, they point out, urging for a thorough audit of the hospital deaths that occurred over the past few weeks.As far as the spike in cases is concerned, the rise is mainly seen in urban areas.A few weeks ago, localities within the city corporation accounted for 60% of the Covid cases. But now the Covid spread seems to be increased in the city which accounts for 70% of the total cases.Even outside the city, it’s the suburban areas abutting the corporation limits like Sulur, Thudiyalur and Madurakkarai that have reported more cases than rural areas. Rural areas account for only 20% of the total cases in the district.Meanwhile, vaccination has come to a standstill with a meagre 69 people getting the shots on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/daily-caseload-touches-new-high-of-2509-in-district/articleshow/82508517.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: State-run agency to allocate 65% of life-saving Covid medicines||JAIPUR: An order was issued that Remdesivir injections, Tocilizumab and other drugs will be distributed to private and government hospitals through state-run Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation Limited (RMSCL) in order to curb black-marketing and hoarding of injections and medicines.  Now a day later the state government issued a fresh order stating that 65% of the drugs will be distributed by the state-run agency and 35% of the medicines will be distributed by private distributors. “This created a bit of confusion because earlier an order was issued by the drug controller that the government will distribute all the drugs to the hospitals. However, RMSCL, the procurement agency, issued an order stating that 65 per cent of drugs will be distributed by the agency and 35 per cent will be distributed by the private distributors. So, this created confusion. Later, the drug controller issued a fresh order in compliance with RMSCL’s order,” said an official. “The government’s procurement agency procures drugs in bulk. Hence, the companies sell drugs to RMSCL at low rates. However, when the companies sell the drugs in the market, they do it at higher prices. It was also decided through the order that the drugs will be lifted at the rate approved by RMSCL which is much lower than the rate fixed by the distributors.” “So, the gap has to be either borne by the companies or RMSCL. This created a lot of confusion among the distributors. The situation is likely to become normal by Monday,” the official added. On Saturday, RMSCL supplied more than 28,170 Remdesivir injections in different districts of the state. The central government on Saturday approved allocation of 2.48 lakh vials of Remdesivir injections to Rajasthan up to May 16. A total of 340 Tocilizumab injections were also distributed in the state for critically ill patients. Health minister Raghu Sharma on Sunday said that order has been issued by the state government to procure 30,950 oxygen concentrators. Of the total, 635 oxygen concentrators have been received so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-run-agency-to-allocate-65-of-life-saving-covid-meds/articleshow/82508532.cms||---

How will he get enough oxygen?’’ he asks in the video. He then goes on to suggest people methods to improve oxygen levels in their blood through certain breathing techniques but blames the health department for insisting on wearing masks. “When you wear a mask, you will be inhaling carbon dioxide which we had exhaled and trapped inside the mask,” Baskar says.However, the video has not gone well with many.

The association said as lockdown is to be implemented from Monday, they fear that many of them would have to sell off their vehicles as they are running into losses. The letter said the transporters had been suffering huge losses since the pandemic hit the country and the situation continued to worsen as they were not earning enough profits to even pay the installments of their vehicles. Jaipur Transport Operators’ Association president Anil Arora said, “For over a year, we have been incurring losses. On a daily basis, there is a loss of approximately Rs 100 crore for transporters. The situation has become so bad that even during lockdown, where there is no restriction on movement of heavy vehicles, we might have to stop all operations as it was becoming difficult to sustain. This will adversely affect other services also. Our point is that if there is no change in the price of oil in the international market, then why are we being charged such heavy tax in Rajasthan?” The transporters claimed that now customers prefer trucks from other states as they are charging less for transportation because fuel prices are cheaper in Punjab and Haryana. Fuel pump owners are already facing losses due to the high VAT imposed on petrol and diesel in Rajasthan as compared to neighbouring states. While there is 36% VAT on diesel, the same tax is 26% on petrol. Some of the fuel pumps on highways have shut down permanently and the stakeholders said it will take a decade to recover from the losses sustained due to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/transporters-write-to-union-min-cm-about-high-fuel-price/articleshow/82508547.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||People rush to stock up on essentials||Coimbatore: People crowded grocery shops, vegetable and fish markets, and ATMs by flouting Covid-19 precautionary measures on Sunday to buy and stock things ahead of the total lockdown, which would come into effect from Monday, despite the government making it clear that the shops selling essentials items would be allowed to function for limited hours during the period. This irresponsible behaviour from the public comes at a time when the daily spike in Covid-19 cases is touching new highs and many battling for their lives.It was to contain the virus that the state government announced full lockdown from May 10 to 24. To ensure supply of essential commodities to the citizens, the government had permitted grocery shops, confectionaries and fish and meat shops to function from 6am to noon. As such there was no reason for people to resort to panic buying.Hospitals would be functioning round the clock during the period, when medicines, milk supply and other essential services wouldn’t be affected. However, movement of people would be restricted.Ukkadam fish market, chicken and mutton shops were crowded on the day. Earlier, the fish and meat shops were not allowed to function on Sundays. “Our business was severely affected in the past few weeks. And in a welcome move the government has now allowed us to function every day during the total lockdown till 12pm. We will follow the covid-19 norms,” said a fish seller.Grocery shops on Range Gowder Street also drew large crowds in the morning and evening. Large crowds also thronged the Uzhavar Sandhai at Singanallur and on Cowley Brown Road. The scene wasn’t any different at TK market and Sukrawarpet market.City bus stands also witnessed a heavy rush for the second consecutive day, with people hurrying to get back to their hometowns before the complete lockdown kicks in. Most of the government mofussil buses to Madurai, Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Kanyakumari, Thoothukudi, Trichy and Karur districts were plying fully packed with many passengers travelling on footboards.The scene was chaotic at the Tasmac outlets in the district, as several hundreds of people made a beeline for liquor bottles to be used during the lockdown period, when the sops would remain closed. ATM centres also recorded a large crowd on the day as many preferred to keep enough cash in hand, as they didn’t want to step out of their houses to withdraw money during the lockdown period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/people-rush-to-stock-up-on-essentials/articleshow/82508549.cms||---
---||Delhi||CM: Direct vax firms to give Delhi 60 lakh doses every month till July||New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has written to Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, urging him to direct vaccine manufacturers to increase their supply to 60 lakh doses per month so that all eligible citizens of Delhi can be vaccinated by July. In the letter sent on Sunday, Kejriwal has also requested that a uniform price should be fixed for vaccines supplied to the Centre, state governments and private hospitals and that states be allowed to develop their separate apps keeping in view glitches reported in the Co-Win application. “Delhi has around 92 lakh people in the 18-45 age group. I urge you to direct Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech to increase their monthly supplies to Delhi to 60 lakh doses per month during May to July 2021,” Kejriwal has written. The chief minister has said there are 57 lakh people in the 45+ age group and they will need 1.14 crore doses, out of which Delhi has received 43 lakh and an additional 71 lakh doses are required to inoculate this section. “To complete it in three months, we would need 23 lakh doses per month from the GoI channel during the three months of May to July.” Both groups put together, Delhi needs 83 lakh doses per month to vaccinate everyone above 18 years in the next three months, he added. “As the third Covid wave is also anticipated soon, we want to complete vaccination of all people in Delhi within three months,” he has pointed out. “We have already developed the infrastructure required. We are already vaccinating roughly 1 lakh people every day. We are increasing this capacity to roughly 3 lakh per day in the next few days. Therefore, we will have the capacity to administer 90 lakh doses per month,” he said. Kejriwal has also requested the Union minister that glitches in the Co-Win app are leading to most people spending valuable time for getting registered or booking vaccine appointments. He has written that many people are also not tech-savvy enough to be able to register themselves. He has written that as the vaccination is expanded for those in the 18-44 age group, such glitches should not be allowed to deprive people of vaccination. “Hence, I request you to allow states to develop their separate apps or develop mechanisms other than apps to manage vaccinations in their states,” he has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-direct-vax-firms-to-give-delhi-60-lakh-doses-every-month-till-july/articleshow/82508558.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Chandigarh||After Bengal, farmers to take on BJP in UP||Bathinda: Undeterred by the surge in Covid cases, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has decided to turn towards Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, taking their fight to BJP bastions. The morcha decided to take the plunge in these two states after getting positive results in West Bengal and UP Panchayat polls, said senior morcha member Dr Darshan Pal on Sunday. Dr Pal is president of Krantikari Kisan Union, Punjab, which is part of 32 Punjab farm groups. Farmers have been sitting on the borders of Delhi for the last five and a half months, demanding repeal of the contentious farm laws and constitution of a law for legal guarantee of minimum support price (MSP) on all crops. Dr Pal, in an online session at Sanyukt Kisan Morcha’s social media platform, Kisan Ekta Morcha, on Sunday claimed, “The ‘Punish BJP-Defeat BJP’ slogan adopted in West Bengal now will be taken to UP and Uttarakhand with more focus in UP where BJP has started seeing its decline in panchayat polls. The model of social boycott of BJP and its allies, apart from boycott of the products and various services being provided by two corporate houses considered close to BJP top bosses, being successfully used in Punjab and Haryana, will be taken to UP and everyone will see encouraging results of this campaign in the 2022 assembly elections.” He said that a strong campaign would be launched in UP against BJP and its allies, where programmes of the saffron party would be boycotted and its leaders would be shown black flags. Dr Pal claimed that farmers now have a strong presence in the five states of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, UP and Uttarakhand, apart from Delhi, and this stronghold would be used politically in UP. Earlier, UP-based senior farm leader Rakesh Tikait also stated that the next stop of farmers would be UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/after-bengal-farmers-to-take-on-bjp-in-up/articleshow/82508586.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Jaipur||No takers for flowers in Rajasthan amid pandemic||JAIPUR: The pandemic has adversely affected flower business in the state. With most weddings cancelled due to curfew, flower growers as well as sellers have suffered heavy losses. Many farmers have to dump their produce as the cost of transportation is higher than the produce itself. At present government has allowed few street vendors to operate which has become the main source of sale in the market till 11 am. Due to the cancellation of weddings or a cap introduced by the government on the number of guests, the bulk orders of flowers are cancelled. Whatever is being sold is on below half rate. President of flower market association at Chandi Ki Taksaal in Jaipur Chuttan Lal Saini said, “The roses and marigold that were sold for Rs100 per kilogram is sold for Rs 30 per kilogram. Lilian was sold for Rs 500 and above per bundle is sold for Rs 100. The massive downfall of rates has destroyed us. We were expecting some form of profit this year but the situation is such that there is not enough that it is not enough to sustain.” Wedding is the biggest market for most of these flowers. Farmers have to be satisfied by recurring just cost of production but many were not even that fortunate. Vivek Gagrani, a flower farmer in Bhilwara, said, “The cost of packing and transportation is around Rs 5 per rose but we are getting only Rs 1 per rose. Hence, we have to dump our flowers in a pit or feed them to animals. This curfew is causing us immense problems financially.” Taking a hit with the last lockdown, some farmers were smart this time and didn’t depend on just one crop. Navin Kumar, a marigold producer at Alwar told TOI that expecting that pandemic will last longer he grew vegetables as well instead of just relying on flowers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-takers-for-flowers-amid-pandemic/articleshow/82508587.cms||---

The survey is being conducted by the education department among all the aided, unaided, private management schools across Maharashtra. The schools have been told to give accurate and clear opinions about internal assessments. Deputy secretary in the school education department Rajendra Pawar said, “The proposal to assess the SSC students will be presented to the education department by the state board, state education commissioner and also the State Council of Education Research and Training. Views from experts as well as the schools on how ready they are for internal assessment are being sought in order to take a decision on the same.”Students are confused about their assessments as well as admissions. Almost 20 days have passed by and yet the education department has not been able to announce the formula for assessments. Aditya Tare, a Std X student, said, “If we are informed about the assessment or the entrance exam whatever the government is planning, then it will be easier to prepare. We have relaxed after the cancellation of the exam. So we need to gear up if we need to prepare for the assessments and the education department must announce it soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-wants-internal-marks-plan-for-assessment-of-ssc-students/articleshow/82508588.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Chandigarh||Hisar mind behind DRDO’s Covid starver||Hisar: DRDO’s new drug that cures Covid two to three days quicker comes by the efforts of a former Haryana Agricultural University student from this town. Sudhir Chandna is additional director in Defence Research and Development Organisation. The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has approved the medicine for emergency use, while Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, as collaborator, will bring it to the market in a week to 10 days, for cost price. Asked how the drug works, Sudhir Chandna told TOI: "To say it briefly, it snatches the bread of Covid-19 virus, starving it to death." Sudhir Chandna said DRDO scientist Anant Bhatt was his partner in research and chairman G Satheesh Reddy his principal supporter. When he got all the studies about the virus in April 2020, he sent the research proposal the same month and started tests in Hyderabad. In May 2020, the drug controller approved the clinical trial, and the Phase-2 trials continued till October. In November 2020, Phase-3 trials were approved and went on from December to April. On May 1, the drug was approved for emergency use. Dr Reddy’s Labs is engaged in its production. The existing treatment is combined with this 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) drug, which helps a patient recover two to three days in advance. The Covid-19 virus grows in the body cells, so it undergoes some metabolic changes. This drug enters the infected cells and snatches the virus’ source of energy, which stunts its growth and it lets go of the cells. The DRDO scientist studied in several cities of Haryana. Sudhir’s father, J D Chandna, has been a district and sessions judge in Haryana, known for fast-track court and many important verdicts. Sudhir was born in his ancestral house of Rampura locality near the Hisar railway station in October 1967. After his birth, his father made it to the Haryana Judicial Service, and his job took Sudhir to schools in Bhiwani, Bahadurgarh, Panipat, Karnal, and Hansi. He did BSc from Chandigarh’s DAV College in 1985 and MSc in microbiology from HAU in the year 1987-89. During PhD in 1990, he entered the DRDO as a scientist. He has served in Gwalior from 1991 to 1993 and then the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied sSciences (INMAS), Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hisar-mind-behind-drdos-covid-starver/articleshow/82508593.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Unlike Nagpur, Covid-19 cases not reducing in other Vidarbha districts||NAGPUR: While Nagpur, which used to account for more than 50% of the Covid-19 cases and deaths in Vidarbha region, is showing significant drop in new cases since last 4-5 days, districts like Amravati, Wardha, Chandrapur, Yavatmal, and Buldhana are still not showing any such signs. Cases are, in fact, growing in Amravati division despite the longer lockdown. Local authorities have introduced even stricter restrictions in all five districts of Amravati division and Wardha from Sunday. But doctors say that strict restrictions, border sealing, bans, stoppages are of no use any more, as the virus has spread everywhere. The tehsil-wise bifurcation of data coming from all 11 districts of Vidarbha from May 1 onwards shows that more cases are coming from rural parts. For example, Chandrapur city reported 325 cases on May 8 while the rural parts of the district reported 835 cases. On May 9, Yavatmal district reported 1,032 new cases with district headquarters (Yavatmal city) reporting 105, and others from rural areas of the district. Akola also has similar statistics. Out of 22 deaths reported on May 8 in Akola, 17 were from rural parts of the district. “In view of the increasing prevalence of Covid-19 in the rural areas of the district, we have decided to take village-specific measures to control the situation through immediate planning. Strict implementation of lockdown will be ensured,” said Akola district collector Jitendra Papalkar. Similar strict restrictions, with even essential shops not allowed, have been imposed in Yavatmal, Buldhana, Washim, and Amravati too. As cases are more in rural parts of Vidarbha, Nagpur guardian minister Nitin Raut directed authorities to ensure curbs on all unnecessary travel from other districts to Nagpur and seal borders of the city. However, such strict sealing of borders or stricter restrictions are not going to be effective now, said Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease specialist. “When the virus is everywhere, will such restrictions be really effective? We are in May 2021 and not May 2020. Border sealing, RT-PCR before travel are no more relevant,” he said. Travel restrictions will create major problems for patients and may increase unreported deaths, said Dr Anand Thatte, from Akola. “If city borders are sealed, villagers will find it difficult to take their patients to district headquarters. Taking travel pass from police system is a difficult and time taking task. Due to this, many cases and even deaths may happen in rural parts of Vidarbha,” he said. The Covid Task Force of Maharashtra has advised strict lockdown until May 31 to control rural spread. “But, travel ban is not part of task force advice. Patients must be allowed to travel to cities from villages, otherwise there will be chaotic situation,” said a senior task force member from Nagpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unlike-nagpur-covid-19-cases-not-reducing-in-other-vid-districts/articleshow/82508545.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Last year, it was the lockdown, and this year it seems to be heading the same way. Swimming pools are mostly in clubs, hotels and societies. They are not income generation for the owners as much, but freelance instructors who use these pools that have been suffering heavy losses during peak season,” Karishma Shah, who runs a swimming academy in the city, said. Swimmer Ashwini Yadav believes that pools are safer than gyms or salons when it comes to following social distancing protocols. “Unlike gymming or most other forms of working out, swimming is an individual, no-contact sport. Chlorinated water kills germs so there is no danger in going into the pool even if there are other swimmers. However, it is important to keep one’s distance,” she said. Instructor Rajesh Mohite said,“After this summer is over, the season will begin from September. Hopefully, this year the local government will consider opening the pools so we can get back to work,” he said. Guruprasad Shivekar, another instructor, said he has joined his family’s catering business. “We had to let go of our staff last year. There is some income through deliveries. The government should issue strict SOPs and allow opening of pools in the city,” he added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/swimming-instructors-wade-through-losses/articleshow/82508621.cms||---
---||Trichy||Vegetable prices double in Trichy||Trichy: Vegetable prices have doubled at Gandhi market in Trichy for the last two days due to the acute shortage of supply and high demand. The price of tomato, which was Rs 10/kg on Friday, went up to Rs 20 on Sunday morning. Same is the case with carrots, which was sold for Rs 40/kg. Similarly, the price of other vegetables such as cabbage, cauliflower, brinjal, ladies finger and beans too doubled. Raising concern over the increased price of vegetables, N Kumarasamy, a resident of Palakkarai, said he came to the market to buy vegetables for at least a week owing to the lockdown that begins on Monday. But I was not able to get vegetables for two days given the high price. If this is the scenario before lockdown, we are concerned about the upcoming days when lockdowns are going to be even more stringent, he said. Owing to the increasing Covid-19 cases, the state government has decided to impose weekend lockdown from last week. When it was widely expected that there would be a complete shutdown this weekend like the previous week, relaxation on Saturday came as surprise. “Markets were not prepared for the relaxation, which led to acute shortage of supply. There was high demand as people started thronging markets to stock vegetables for the complete lockdown. This has led to prices of vegetables going up,” said N Kannadasan, a trader at the Gandhi market. We had cancelled vegetables supply this weekend assuming that it would be lockdown. However, insiders from the market termed the price rise temporary, which was triggered by the surprise relaxation of the lockdown norms. Farmers had started growing vegetables a few months ago anticipating weddings and the demand from hotels and hostels.. All these vegetables will come to the market, which will bring down the prices, said S Karthikeyan, a vegetable seller.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/vegetable-prices-double-in-trichy/articleshow/82508622.cms||Sampath Kumar

This is the second consecutive month this year, after March, that the groundwater table has depleted in Hyderabad. Alarm bells are already ringing in Marredpally and Saidabad, which are among the worst-hit areas with a depleted groundwater table. Based on data being collected by the Ground Water Department (GWD) from different piezometers installed in 16 mandals in Hyderabad district and across the city, on an average, the groundwater table has depleted by as much as 1.13 meters below to ground level (BGL). Marredpally in Secunderabad, a rocky area, has seen deep groundwater table depletion. Here, the recorded ground water table in the April, was 2.40 meters below the ground. Next is Saidabad, followed Marredpally, which stood in second position, in ground water consumption. “In Saidabad, there has been a depletion of 2.40 meters below the ground,” the GWD report said. Apart from these two areas, the largest commercial network areas in the city—Ameerpet (1.75meters bgl) and Khairatabad (1.76 bgl)—have also seen a large depletion in the ground water table. With real estate business picking back up, previous halted construction activity is now being conducted at a brisk pace. This could be a cause for the ground water consumption, a GWD official opined. With the number of Covid-19 cases also rising daily, and the second wave hitting the state in March and April, the official added that this could also be an added strain to the groundwater table, with hospitals working overtime to save people. Predictive models indicate that the ground water table may hit rock bottom in the next couple of months in the city, and citizens are likely to face an acute shortage of water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/as-temperatures-soar-ground-water-levels-sink-to-new-depths-in-city/articleshow/82508626.cms||Sunil Mungara

Police have also seized the weapon and three vehicles used in the crime. Khadiala Sainian village resident Manpreet Kaur’s bullet-ridden body was found at Sikri Adda on April 22. “Two special teams were constituted to crack the case. While SP (investigation) Ravinder Pal Singh Sandhu headed the first team, DSP (rural) Gurpreet Singh led the other team. They camped in Mogaand Ferozepur districts for five days and arrested the accused on May 7,” said Hoshiarpur SSP Navjot Singh Mahal. Manpreet was living at her in-laws' house in Khadiala Sainian after marrying Pawandeep Singh. She had filed for divorce and wanted to return to her parents, which was not acceptable to her younger brother Harpreet Singh and he planned her murder, the officer said. Apart from Harpreet, a resident of Takhtupura village in Ferozepur, police also arrested his accomplice and friend Iqbal Singh, who is already booked in a mining case, of Daulewal village in Moga. Harpreet told his interrogators that he had done a recce of the murder spot a day before the crime in an Innova. On the day of the murder, he and Iqbal had reached the spot in a Scorpio. “Iqbal drove the vehicle while Harpreet hid in the back seat. To avoid suspicion, they snatched a mobile from a person to make a WhatsApp call to Manpreet. Iqbal asked Manpreet to accompany him in his car as he had something important to say. As soon as she took the back seat, Harpreet strangled her with a scarf while Iqbal kept driving. When she fell unconscious, Harpreet pulled her out of the vehicle near Sikri Adda and pumped nine bullets into her from a .32 bore revolver. Both the men fled after dumping the body on the roadside,” Mahal added. The third vehicle used in the crime was a Fortuner, used by the accused to follow Manpreet a month ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/man-kills-sister-8-years-after-she-married-a-man-of-her-own-choice/articleshow/82508668.cms||---

On Saturday, the parliamentary board appointed two observers, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Bhupendra Yadav, for electing the leader of the opposition. Both Prasad and Yadav will hold meetings with the legislators and ask for their individual preferences. “After they voice their preferences, the observers will convey that to the parliamentary board, which will take the decision,” said a senior leader. A few names, including national vice-president Mukul Roy, Suvendu Adhikari and Manoj Tigga, are doing the rounds. “The name of Santipur MLA Jagannath Sarkar can also be considered,” said a Bengal leader. “If Roy is chosen as the leader of the opposition, he might need to renounce the organizational position. None of the leaders in BJP has held a ministerial post (leader of the opposition enjoys ministerial post) and organizational post simultaneously. In 2019, Debasree Chowdhury had to renounce the position of general secretary of the state unit after she became a minister. Samik Bhattacharya had to renounce the position of general secretary after he was elected from Basirhat Dakshin constituency. The organizational position was given to Dilip Ghosh after that,” another senior Bengal BJP leader said. However, an exception was made in the case of Bengal BJP president Ghosh, who retained the state chief’s position along with being leader of BJP legislators in the assembly after the 2016 assembly polls.

---||Nagpur||Constipation, diarrhoea & heartburn cause for worry||NAGPUR: Prolonged lockdown, work from home (WFH) and sedentary lifestyle for months is now taking toll on the gastrointestinal health of people. Various surveys done on national level state that at least 58% of people who worked from home during the lockdown have gained excessive weight. Doctors say they are coming across a high number of patients with abdominal problems, especially during the second lockdown. Gastroenterologist Dr Piyush Marudwar said lockdown has led to different problems like gastroesophageal reflux disease — stomach acid flowing back into esophagus causing burning sensation in chest or stomach, sour regurgitation excessive belching etc. “Most common reason for this is sedentary and immobile lifestyle which lockdown has brought for the people. Also, as most of the people are at home, intake of fatty food has also increased,” he said. People are trying out new dishes — often unhealthy — and also are consuming various homemade formulas in the name of raising their immunity. As a result, the overall intake of food and calories has increased and physical activities have declined to a vast extent, said the doctor. Gastroenterologist and hepatologist Dr Amit Agrawal said post-Covid patients are coming with acidity and Covid pancreatitis. “Due to heavy medication during Covid-19 treatment, people are suffering from these problems. Many of them are coming with vascular complications due to blood clots in intestines,” he said. Dr Agrawal also noted that cases of pancreatitis due to excessive liquor consumption have gone down during lockdown. “Liquor is not easily accessible during this period. Parties are not happening due to physical distancing and drinking pattern has changed. Due to this, alcohol-triggered pancreatitis cases are down,” he said. “Covid can directly damage the gastrointestinal tract and liver. This has been proved in autopsy and biopsy studies. A recent study conducted in China also showed that 23% of all Covid patients have some or other gastrointestinal issues,” said Dr Marudwar. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, loss of appetite are common symptoms present in Covid patients, particularly in those having severe impact. The study has also shown that those suffering from gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting may have worse clinical outcomes than those with respiratory symptoms. Covid vaccine can be taken by all patients with pre-existing liver and gastrointestinal problems, said the doctors.

---||India||Imran in Saudi, Riyadh says will work to improve India-Pak ties||ISLAMABAD: Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud on Sunday said that Riyadh would work to encourage reduction in tension between Pakistan and India. The Saudi FM’s remarks came amid Pakistan PM Imran Khan's three-day visit to Saudi Arabia in an effort to reset relations following tensions between the long-time allies over a number of issues in recent years. "On the Pakistan-India relationship, I really want to commend what has been achieved recently of a calming of tensions and a ceasefire. This is an excellent step in the right direction," the Saudi FM said during an interview aired live on state-run Pakistan TV and radio. "We will work to encourage the process and make sure that the tensions continue to be reduced between the two nations," Prince Faisal said. Against the backdrop of growing closeness between Riyadh and Delhi, the FM hoped that his country can help everybody work towards reduction of tensions. "From our perspective," the minister said, "the focus on building prosperity for the people of one’s nation should be the key emphasis of all policies." Relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia had suffered several setbacks in recent years. Last year, Pakistan had accused the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a bloc of 57 Muslim-majority countries led by Saudi Arabia, of inaction over New Delhi’s decision to strip Indian-administered Kashmir of its special status in August 2019. With Kashmir being a key policy issue for Pakistan, the country's foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had threatened to hold a rival meeting that would bypass the OIC – a move perceived as a challenge to Saudi Arabia’s leadership role in the Muslim world. Riyadh, however, responded by withdrawing $1bn of a $3bn interest-free loan that it had extended to Pakistan in 2018, at a time when Islamabad was suffering dire economic conditions. Prior to that, tensions were high over Pakistan’s refusal to send its troops to fight in the Saudi-led coalition’s war against Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen in 2015.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/saudi-to-step-in-for-better-india-pakistan-ties/articleshow/82508760.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The team, led by MHA additional secretary Govind Mohan, had arrived in Kolkata on May 6 and met Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay at Nabanna the same day before starting their state tour. They had visited parts of Bhatpara in North 24 Parganas and Falta, Satgachhia and Nodakhali in South and North 24 Parganas and also Birbhum on Saturday following reports of arson. The team on Sunday talked to some villagers in Dhaniakhali, where houses had been torched, and noted their grievances. On Friday, BJP MP Locket Chatterjee had visited Dhaniakhali to meet the local administration. Outside the BDO’s office, boombs were burst allegedly by a section of Trinamool Congress workers. Chatterjee had instantly called up the Union home minister’s office to complain about the incident. She further complained that many BJP workers, under attack by Trinamool goons, were on the run. At Lokbati village, Md Ismail tod the visiting team that he was away from home as he had allegedly been beaten up and threatened with murder by Trinamool workers. He said he had worked for BJP during elections. Ismail claimed that several other BJP workers too had fled due to threats and their houses had been vandalised. The central team visited six houses in Lokbati and Madan Mohantala. The members refused to share their views with media. Trinamool described the central team’s tour as a “political visit”. Trinamool MLA and Dhaniakhali block president Ramendu Singha Ray said: “The visit was biased because they only visited houses of BJP workers. BJP workers killed a Trinamool supporter a few days ago and beat up several of our workers, but the team did not speak to any Trinamool worker who was assaulted.” Hooghly district magistrate Deepap Priya said: “No meeting was held with the central team officials. They informed me through mail for security arrangements and it was arranged accordingly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mha-team-scans-post-poll-violence-in-hooghly-dist/articleshow/82508792.cms||Falguni Banerjee
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘No proper food & accommodation’, nurses at Covid hospital go on flash strike||MUMBAI: Nearly 200 nurses working at the Nesco jumbo Covid hospital in Goregaon went on a flash strike on Sunday to protest their living conditions. They resumed work at 3pm after a written assurance from the facility head that their demands will be considered.  Nurses, who had gathered at the hospital around 9am, said it was their last resort as their complaints about lack of facilities in their accommodation were never taken seriously. Nurses working at Nesco have been staying at a Mhada building in Goregaon for the past year. What triggered the strike was a decision to shift them to a school in Dindoshi, which they said was neither well connected nor near any eateries. They have also been complaining about being cramped in smaller buses that take them home from the Covid centre.  A nurse who has been working for a year at Nesco, said, “The Mhada accommodation is not great either, but Dindoshi would be worse. Six to ten of us share a 1BHK flat. We were not provided cupboards or anything for storage. We’ve been tolerating everything but there is a limit,” the nurse said, adding that they were being given step-motherly treatment. “Doctors are put up in hotels. We are not demanding that, but we have right to a good accommodation too,” she said, adding that at least 10 have contracted Covid in the recent times.  Another added that nurses have been complaining about the lack of high-protein food. “We have made several complaints with the contractor but to no avail. There are no eggs or wholesome meals that are served. So, we heavily depend on eateries around us to order a good meal. The school in Dindoshi has no such facilities, which will be difficult for those who return from late-night shifts at 2am to 3am,” she added. Most nurses staying there are residents of Dhule, Ratnagiri, Nandurbar, Beed, Ahmednagar among other districts.  Dean Dr Neelam Andrade said that matters of food and lodging are looked after by the local ward official. “However, we will look into their problems and fix them,” she said.

In a circular last week, the Directorate of Health Services underlined the urgent requirement for MBBS doctors at different hospitals due to the ongoing pandemic. The state urged doctors who completed their internship or are expected to till June 30 to apply for the bond service. Nearly 2,500 MBBS doctors were eligible for bond service this year. Around 1,050 had applied in April in the first round. The public health department now needs around 3,000 doctors at different locations, said Dr TP Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education & Research, to which candidates have to apply. “With 1,079 doctors applying till Sunday, we have over 2,100 doctors now, who will be posted at different places based on requirement,” he said. Allotment letters will be uploaded online from Monday. Doctors are expected to join within seven days of the order. Not joining in the stipulated period will attract penal action. With the NEET-PG postponed till August 31, those aspiring to do MD/MS are also required to apply for bond service till they secure a seat. Candidates can ignore the bond clause by paying Rs 10 lakh. Dr Vitthal Salve, a health activist, said the state also needs to rope in doctors who have not honoured their bond service in the past. There is a huge backlog which can be cleared now, he said, given the requirement both in municipal corporations and rural health centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/1k-more-mbbs-docs-heed-maharashtras-call-for-bond-service/articleshow/82508855.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Nagpur||Mind your belly fat, it poses major challenge in Covid treatment, recovery||NAGPUR: Identified as a comorbidity, obesity has turned out to be a major challenge in Covid treatment, especially in the second wave. Obese patients take more time to recovery as their body movement gets restricted while they also need higher ventilation pressure. Doctors said the younger population, which has put on belly fat in last one year, too is at as much risk as an obese person. As compared to patients having proportionate body mass index (BMI) but a potbelly, those with a lean tummy recovered faster from Covid. Ahead of the third wave, doctors said people still have time to improve their fitness and physique to protect themselves from getting severe Covid. Read AlsoDiet changes to keep diabetes in checkDr Imran Noor Mohammed, critical care specialist, said lung capacity goes down due to abdomen pressure. “Lungs remain compressed because of fat on chest and abdomen. The way lungs must work becomes difficult. Obese patients also need bipap for a longer time and higher requirement of ventilator. The inflammatory markers too are high due to body fat. If the abdomen is flat, the recovery is fast,” he said. As lung expansion, a crucial activity in Covid, becomes cumbersome among obese patients, a lot depends on physiotherapy en route to recovery. Read AlsoEven after Covid recovery, seniors may face heart risksPatients infected with Covid-19 — mainly those above 50 and those with co-morbidities — may be at higher risk of heart disorders, prompting doctors to advise proper monitoring of blood parameters during the infection and even after recovery. Doctors say it is more common among high-risk groups like“Prone position is also not possible for many obese patients. These are logistic challenge while treatment hurdles are related to size of oxygen masks, which is often not available,” Dr Mohammad said adding that even lean obesity is harmful in Covid scenario. Kingsways Hospital Covid incharge Dr Harshvardhan Bora said obesity was a risk factor at a younger age even in the first wave. “Since people are mostly at home during the lockdown, many have put on weight. Lack of exercise only adds to the woes. Obese patients don’t respond early to the treatment as they need higher ventilator pressure. Even otherwise obstructive sleep apnea keeps oxygen saturation level low among this group,” he said.

A good health diet and exercise regimen along with vaccination is key to fight the third wave if at all it comes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mind-your-belly-fat-it-poses-major-challenge-in-covid-treatment-recovery/articleshow/82508884.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Chandigarh||PAU experts advise farmers to grow PR varieties of paddy||Crop TalkIn view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, experts at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana have urged farmers to purchase quality and improved seed from research stations, seed farms, Krishi Vigyan Kendras and farm advisory service centres, located in their respective districts. During the PAU live programme organised last week, they also emphasised on sowing early maturing rice varieties and adopting ‘tar-wattar direct seeded rice (DSR) technique’. Rice expert Buta Singh Dhillon suggested that farmers sow early maturing, high yielding varieties, ‘PR’ strains, which consume less water and give better yield. Talking about nursery raising techniques, he advised farmers to follow PAU recommendations for management of weeds and to tackle iron and zinc deficiencies. Farmers should read the PAU package of practices or contact university experts from time to time, he said. Head, department of agronomy, PAU College of Agriculture, Makhan Singh Bhullar elaborated on the “tar-wattar direct seeded rice (DSR) technique,” and said that it leads to efficient weed management besides doing away with iron deficiency. “The university has brought out literature (in Punjabi) on this technology with focus on Dos and Don’ts. It is being published in English as well as Hindi languages,” he said. Ravinder Bahlooria said that farmers can purchase quality seed of Punjab Basmati 7 (4 kg for Rs 300); PR 129, PR 128, PR 127, PR 126, PR 124, PR 122, PR 121, PR 114 and HKR 47 (8 kg for Rs 350 and 24 kg for Rs 1,050); Pusa Basmati 1121 and Pusa Basmati 1509 (8 kg for Rs 500 and 24 kg for Rs 1,500). Agriweather India Meteorological Department (IMD) has not forecast any significant change in maximum temperature during the next 48 hours over most parts of northwest India. A gradual fall by 2-4 degrees Celsius has been predicted during subsequent three days.

---||Mumbai||Vax between waves lowers BEST infections over 80%||MUMBAI: The second wave of Covid-19 has shown minimal impact on BEST employees and the recovery rate over the past nine months has remained over 90%, said BEST officials on Sunday. The BEST experience can serve as a test case of the gains from vaccination for large organisations struggling to overcome the impact of the pandemic. During the first wave, 2,800 BEST staff members, mainly drivers and conductors, were infected by the coronavirus till November. More than 100 patients died in hospital while others recovered and were discharged. In the second wave, there have been 422 cases so far. “If you compare the first wave with the second one, the latter witnessed a little over 400 cases. We ensured maximum vaccinations, with 80% of our staff receiving the first dose of vaccines and 50% having received the second dose,” BEST chief medical officer Anil Kumar Singal said. Statistics show that in July cases had peaked at 767 positive patients while in August and September, the cases numbered 457 and 476 respectively. In the past two months, cases had declined and there were 422 Covid patients with a recovery rate of over 95%. “The impact of the second wave was less because 40,000 employees scrupulously followed Covid-appropriate behaviour and their participation in the vaccination drive was phenomenal. The administration has also declared special paid leave to employees living with co-morbidities and to those who came in contact with Covid patients. This ensured minimum spread of infection among workers,” Singal said. Several other measures were incorporated, including boosting immunity with over two lakh strips of multivitamin pills, Covid testing camps for early diagnosis, and timely arrangement of beds at Covid centres for optimum treatment. “The health of infected employees was monitored twice daily by five-minute telephonic talk and transfer to higher centres was made if needed. We supplied remdesivir injections on time to hospitals where our staffers were admitted and provided financial assistance for special tests conducted on employees,” he said. BEST has been appreciated and acknowledged in the bulletin of the International Labour Organisation, Geneva, for sustained work for its employees in the pandemic. Dr Singal spoke on the international platform of ILO on the work done by BEST to expedite recovery and minimise spread of infection among staff, especially drivers and conductors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-between-waves-lowers-best-infections-over-80/articleshow/82508888.cms||Somit Sen

After officials in TATR got the information, they deployed forest personnel who kept close watch on the movement of the tiger. After it became clear that the tiger was not going to recover on its own, they took up a rescue operation on Sunday afternoon with the help of wildlife veterinary officer Dr Ravikant Khobragade. Field director, TATR, Jitendra Ramgaonkar, told TOI that the tiger was tranquillized and captured for detailed physical examination. On close examination it was discovered that the tiger had injury marks on both the hind limbs and was unable to move around properly. Ramgaonkar claimed that the tiger was paralytic in hind limbs apparently due to internal injury. As there is no x-ray facility available to examine wild animals in Chandrapur, the tiger was shifted to Gorewada rescue centre in Nagpur for further treatment later in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/injured-tadoba-tiger-shifted-to-gorewada/articleshow/82508894.cms||Mazhar Ali

During a review meeting at the divisional commissioner’s office, Raut had raised the issue of additional quota for Tocilizumab injections. Raut expressed satisfaction over the present availability of oxygen, but stressed on ensuring a steady supply to prevent shortage. Central government has allotted 800 vials of Tocilizumab to Maharashtra, from which Nagpur had received 73 injections on April 29. Later, another 105 were allotted to the district on May 5. Around 170 metric tonne oxygen was being brought to the district on Sunday and nearly 72 MT of oxygen was distributed among the hospitals. The district also received 3,322 Remdesivir vials, which were distributed among the Covid hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/increase-toci-quota-for-nagpur-raut-urges-state-govt/articleshow/82508903.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||Gifting breath of life: Indians in US send 3,800 oxygen concentrators||MUMBAI: US-based Indian doctors and philanthropic groups have joined hands with Parel’s Tata Memorial Hospital to tackle the surge in demand for medical oxygen. On Sunday, 3,800 oxygen concentrato-rs landed at Mumbai and Delhi airports from the US where the devices travelled to nearly 40 hospitals in 15 states. Another batch of 1,500 oxygen concentrators is likely to arrive soon. Dr Rajendra Badwe, director of Tata Memorial Centre (TMC), said the diaspora has arranged over 5,000 oxygen concentrators in record 10 days. These, he said, will help decongest ICUs and oxygen beds and support patients waiting for a hospital bed. The devices would be distributed to over 200 hospitals in the National Cancer Grid (NCG) and other state and civic facilities treating Covid patients, he said. In Mumbai, KEM, Sion and JJ hospitals will get the devices. The idea started with a California-based humanitarian organization, Community Partners International, offering to donate 73 new oxygen concentrators. It followed with Gitika Srivastava and Dr Naresh Ramarajan, Boston-based founders of Navya, TMC’s online opinion service, proposing to send the devices to TMC. The first lot of 100 concentrators were sent from San Francisco to a TMC centre in Assam via Delhi, said Badwe, adding that this led to Air India partnering with TMC to carry more supplies. Simultaneously, in New York, another set of doctors at the New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medicine mobilised support to send 100 concentrators. Thereafter, the New York Presbyterian Hospital donated $2 million to procure 2,800 oxygen concentrators that FedEx agreed to fly. “Since the flight has a capacity of 81,000kg, we didn’t want a single inch to go empty. So on, May 1, groups there initiated a campaign and raised Rs 18 crore,” said Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi, deputy director of epidemiology. The FedEx cargo plane with 81,000kg of medical equipment, including 3,400 portable oxygen concentrators, nasal cannulas, voltage converters, 3 lakh N95 masks landed in Mumbai on Sunday. An AI flight reached Delhi later with 400 oxygen concentrators. Dr C S Pramesh, director, of Tata Memorial Hospital said, “We are collecting requests for equipment and consumables from hospitals across the NCG and mapping the current incidence of infections to determine where the greatest needs are.” The disbursement will be sent to centres in Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Assam and West Bengal among other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/gifting-breath-of-life-indians-in-us-send-3800-o2-concentrators/articleshow/82508910.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Doc among 4 held for Rem black marketing||Yavatmal: Four persons, including a doctor, were arrested by local crime branch (LCB) sleuths from Kalamb town on charges of black marketing of Remdesivir drug, used in treatment of Covid patients. The LCB has recovered nine Remdesivir vials from the accused. According police sources, Yavatmal superintendent of police Dilip Patil Bhujbal received a tip off about Remdesivir vials being sold at Kalamb at exorbitant prices. Accordingly, a special team under API Amol Puri was sent to Kalamb on Saturday. The team sent a decoy customer to a medical shop for enquiring about availability of Remdesivir. The shop assistant Savan Arun Pawar (35) agreed to supply 3 vials of Remdesivir for Rs36,000 and asked the customer to meet him near the flyover and handed over the injections. Waiting cops immediately took Savan into custody. On interrogation, Savan told the cops that he got the injections from Dr Akshay Thundalwar (25). Following this revelation, the cops took Dr Thundalwar into custody. During questioning, Dr Thundalwar named one Saurabh Mogarkar, who worked as male nurse at a Covid centre in Yavatmal, as the supplier of Remdesivir vials. The team picked up Mogarkar also. Information provided by Mogarkar led the cops to one Bilkisbano Mohamed Iqbal Ansari (57). When another decoy customer was sent to Ansari for procuring 12 Remdesivir injections, she agreed to provide 6 vials immediately and the remaining quantity the next day. Ansari too was arrested soon after she handed over 6 vials. Police suspect that the injections are pinched from Nagpur by a relative of Bilkisbano and brought to Yavatmal to sell it at higher prices. Further investigation is in progress. The foursome have been booked under sections 420, 188 and 34 of IPC and other relevant sections of Drug Price Control Act, 2013, Essential Commodities Act, 1955, and other laws in force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doc-among-4-held-for-rem-black-marketing/articleshow/82508912.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM to private practitioners: Play role of ‘Majha Doctor’ to nip Covid in bud||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday, talking about the projected third wave during an online interaction with over 700 private medical practitioners in the city, said they could play a crucial role during the pandemic by becoming ‘Majha Doctor’ (my doctor) for the people. He said they could help stem the spread of the coronavirus at the primary stage. He said that as patients generally approach their family physicians during the early phase of any illness, general practitioners should closely monitor them to ensure that hospital beds are not unnecessarily occupied by asymptomatic patients, which would allow those with serious complications to get the required hospital treatment. Thackeray praised the contribution of the medical fraternity in combating Covid-19 and asked doctors to prepare themselves for the projected third wave. The chief minister appealed to private practitioners in the city to guide people approaching them for treatment of minor or major ailments. He asked them to become ‘Majha Doctor’ for patients who are at home and to closely monitor them. It was the second online meeting organised by Thackeray in a week and also had the state task force doctors in attendance. Considering the shortfall of doctors, Thackeray appealed to private practitioners to register their names to serve in Covid care centres and jumbo centres as society needed their service. Thackeray spoke about the efforts made by the state to upgrade infrastructure and said the government had come up with short-term and long-term plans to become self-reliant in generating medical oxygen. He said the state currently produced 1,270 metric tons of medical oxygen while the increased demand was 1,700 metric tons. Thackeray said there should be a uniform treatment protocol for Covid in the state. Some doctors suggested that the state should encourage the involvement of ayurvedic and homeopathic practitioners in the initiative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cm-to-pvt-practitioners-play-role-of-majha-doctor-to-nip-covid-in-bud/articleshow/82508917.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Nagpur||Ytl hosp ransacked over body goof-up||Yavatmal: Irate relatives of a deceased Covid patient ransacked a hospital here on Sunday alleging that the hospital administration handed them over wrong body and cremated the right one in the absence of family members. The hospital, however, refuted the charge saying the relatives forcibly took away body of another Covid deceased kept in a body bag, in violation protocol. According to Lalit, son of Arun Gajbhiye, a resident of Patipura, his father was admitted to Dr Mahesh Shah’s Dedicated Covid Care Centre on Arni Road seven days ago. He died late on Saturday. On being informed, the relatives brought an ambulance to take Gajbhiye’s body for performing last rites. Lalit claimed that Dr Shah handed them body of someone else. The goof-up came to light at the crematorium. The kin were baffled to see wrong body in the body bag. They brought the body back to Shah hospital only to find that Gajbhiye’s body had already been cremated by government agencies. Tempers ran high and the relatives started smashing furniture and other valuables in the hospital. Awadhootwadi police rushed to the spot and pacified the unruly mob. He said as per protocol, body of Covid deceased cannot be handed over to the relatives and it is cremated by government agencies. Gajbhiye’s body was already cremated by the time his relatives returned to the hospital with Arni patient’s body, he said. Body of the Arni patient was also handed over to the agencies for performing last rites, Dr Shah told TOI. Dr Shah said he admits even critical patients on humanitarian grounds, but is being targeted by the relatives unfairly. “Now, I must close the Covid centre,” he said, adding the damage to the hospital is to the tune of Rs15 lakh. He also threatened to lodge FIR against Gajbhiye’s relatives. Earlier on April 27, relatives of a deceased Covid woman from Shivni village in Ghatanji tehsil had ransacked Shah hospital alleging that the patient had died due to negligence of the hospital staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ytl-hosp-ransacked-over-body-goof-up/articleshow/82508938.cms||---

The death toll now stands at 5,665. Active cases in the state, meanwhile, crossed the two-lakh mark to reach 2,00,189. Jaipur reported 55 deaths, the highest-ever for a single day in any city. On May 1, the city had seen 54 fatalities, which was the previous highest in 24 hours. As the number of cases has grown over the past fortnight, hospitals in the city and other parts of the state have started discharging patients within seven days to make room for those with severe or very severe symptoms. Some smaller Covid care centres are still refusing to admit fresh cases due to shortage of oxygen supply. Jaipur also saw a dip in daily infections, reporting 3,402 cases. But the number of active cases in the city rose to 49,115. Majority of the private and government hospitals in the city are full and have stopped taking fresh admissions. RUHS is filled to capacity while other private hospitals have no vacant beds. There must be no patient gasping outside emergency wards: Minister tells hospitals“In order to ensure that patients with severe symptoms get oxygen and ICU beds, we have started discharging patients in six to seven days. These are patients who were admitted with severe symptoms and have taken five-day dosage of Remdesivir and other medicines and, now, have very mild symptoms,” said Dr Ajeet Singh, superintendent, RUHS. Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas continued his inspection of private hospitals and visited one on JLN Marg along with chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr Narrotam Sharma. He urged private hospitals not to refuse patients. “If a patient is gasping outside your emergency ward or inside his vehicle in the parking lot, it is the responsibility of the hospital. The government is trying its level best to provide all the resources. This is a pandemic situation and everyone should together face it and defeat it,” he said.

---||Chandigarh||Bizmen lend hand to authorities in clearing curfew passes backlog||Ludhiana: In wake of new set of instructions regarding lockdown issued on Friday by district administration, under which factory owners, their managers and employees — except for workers — are supposed to carry curfew passes issued by General Manager of District Industries Centre (GMDIC), thousands of passes were applied by the businessmen, choking the online system and leading to huge backlog. According to sources about 11,000 passes were applied till Saturday afternoon and number rose to more than double today. But with timely intervention of business associations, including Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA), and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the problem was solved and more than 22,000 applications for passes were processed. This was made possible by business associations by rendering services of about 25 computer operators from their side to scrutinise the applications. D S Chawla, president of UCPMA, said “Despite the government stating that workers do not require passes, a large number of factory owners had applied passes for their workers as well, choking the system. It was not possible for the authorities to handle these applications immediately given the huge demand. So, all the major business associations extended a helping hand to the GMDIC to help in processing of the applications at the earliest.” Chawla also added, “The situation has now returned to normal. Industrialists are ready to help our government and district administration in any way possible to combat Covid-19.” According to Rahul Ahuja, former chairman of CII Punjab chapter, “It is our appeal to the industrialists to not to put the burden on the pass generation system and officials by applying passes for their workers, who come and go to factories on foot or on bicycle. Identity card issued by factories is sufficient for their movement and same has been notified by the district administration in its orders issued on May 7. The curfew pass issued by GMDIC, which can be applied online, is required only for the industry owners, managers and employees moving in vehicles during curfew hours.” According to Abhinav Sehgal, joint secretary of Ludhiana Business Forums, “We are thankful to fellow industrialists for extending help in generating the passes for industry owners before Monday, which is the next working day, to enable moving from our factories during curfew hours.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bizmen-lend-hand-to-authorities-in-clearing-curfew-passes-backlog/articleshow/82508947.cms||Mohit Behl

A daily wager, Mahatre, wife and two children, were staring into an abyss of helplessness as they tried to arrange for medicines. “Already there is no work, and the meagre savings are used for meals. Testing Covid positive only added to my worries given the high cost of medicines,” he said. At this crucial juncture, Nagpur Citizens Forum (NCF) – a city-based NGO – came to his aid and provided Mahatre the medicines prescribed by the doctor, free of cost.NCF has come to the aid of poor Covid patients hit hard by the pandemic, by setting up a medicine bank and providing free medicines. NCF’s medicine bank was officially launched on Wednesday.The project aims to reach out to poor patients in the city, especially slums, who cannot afford costly Covid medicines. The drugs are procured with the help of donations and individual sponsors, who are encouraged to contribute medicines rather than cash, said group member Abhijit Jha.The entire 14-day course of medicines for a Covid-19 patient costs around Rs2,500. “Due to financial difficulties and poor conditions, many people avoid taking expensive drugs,” he said.The forum members conducted a small survey on this in various neighbourhoods of the city. The survey involved relatives of positive people, medical store owners, and some doctors. The survey found that the health of many patients was deteriorating as they could not take the anti-viral drug Favipiravir, causing the patient’s health to deteriorate. That is why NCF took up the issue and started working without relying on the administration, said Jha.The initiative was launched by distributing medicine kits to five beneficiary families. Pratik Bairagi, Abhijeet Singh Chandel, Abhijeet Jha, Gajendrasingh Lohia, Amit Bandurkar and Vaibhav Shinde Patil were present.In the first phase, medicines worth Rs1 lakh will be distributed. A medicine kit has been prepared for this, which includes a 14-day dose of Favipiravir, paracetamol, Ivermectin, Limcee, Azithromycin, Zinc, D3 Risk, Alex Cough Syrup, masks and sanitizer.Bairagi, a member of NCF and head of the drug donation drive, accused Nagpur Municipal Corporation of failing to provide free medicines to patients. Many patients are reluctant to buy drugs because they are expensive, he said.Two days ago, NCF had appealed to donors in the city for help. Many philanthropists responded positively. Abhijeet Singh Chandel, head of the campaign, said that some of them contributed to the project in the form of medicines and some in the form of financial assistance.NCF has appealed to poor and needy patients in the city to contact Bairagi on 7720076560 and Abhijeet Singh Chandel on 9730015177 to avail benefits of this initiative. Beneficiaries will be selected on the basis of Covid positive report, Aadhaar card and doctor’s prescription at the testing centre of Nagpur Municipal Corporation. The kits will be handed over to their relatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-ngo-launches-medicine-bank-for-poor-covid-patients/articleshow/82508962.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Strangers reach out to Covid-hit with free home-cooked meals||Between dicing an assortment of vegetables with her mother and rushing over to the gas stove to stir the kadhi, Rashmi Bakshi is bustling about the kitchen doing what she loves most— making home-cooked meals for people. The 55-year-old couldn’t find the will to continue with her catering business after losing her father to Covid-19 last year. “I couldn’t even see him one last time before he passed away,” she says. When the second wave of coronavirus hit the country and entire families were being quarantined, Bakshi thought of doing something in her late father’s memory. She began dishing out tiffins for Covid-hit families free of cost. Like Bakshi, dozens of do-gooders have put their personal struggles aside and stepped up to cook and serve hot meals, whether to quarantined families, frontline workers or street dwellers. Bakshi —who makes six lunch tiffins and an equal number of dinner tiffins — feels she could have done much more if she had assistance from her staff that are unable to travel right now because of the lockdown. Her daughter takes requests on social media a day in advance to check if patients have any food preferences. “At times, meal requests can go up to 20 a day,” said Jogeshwari resident Swati Singh who also pays food delivery men out of her own pocket. Singh recollected an instance when she and her family were about to sit for dinner and a quarantined patient called up with a request for a meal. “I couldn’t say no even if it meant rolling out rotis at top speed,” says the 42-year-old software engineer, who juggles work-from-home and domestic chores along with cooking meals for Covid patients. With her husband lending a helping hand, Singh, “always donning a mask and gloves as hygiene is crucial”, serves everything from upma, poha or daliya for breakfast to rice, rotis, dal, vegetables, salad and raita for lunch and dinner. Some good Samaritans like actor Tara Deshpande have been doing rounds of the streets for weeks now to serve packets of home-cooked meals to pavement dwellers. Deshpande has also served meals to senior citizens living alone and single women struggling with finances. “A few people asked if they could donate but I’m not accepting money,” she says. “For me, it is important that food goes to people who really need it and so I verify every request for food that comes in.” In the starry radius of Oshiwara and Lokhandwala, cooks Rajesh and Roshan have been watching videos on the share market to keep themselves entertained while they prepare extra helpings of khichdi or sandwiches. The meals are sent to quarantined families in the neighbourhood at no cost by the duo’s employers Rohit Raj, Omkar Tamhan and social media star Bhuvan Bam— bachelors who not only share an apartment but also admittedly poor culinary skills. “We heard stories of a mother and son surviving on bread and jam in isolation,” says Raj, recalling disheartening instances that not only prompted a self-privilege check but also moved the trio into action. A majority of people benefitting from their initiative have been senior citizens. The demand for home-cooked meals across the country prompted a chef to start collating contacts of delivery kitchens, home chefs and restaurants on a live spreadsheet. The list kept growing and in less than a week, the portal covidmealsforindia.com was born. The portal is a ready reckoner of 1,600 meal providers across 52 cities. Pointing out that the number of infections in the 2020 lockdown weren’t as many as they are today, chef Saransh Goila, who founded the idea says, “While last year, your friends or neighbours could have helped you with meals, this time strangers have had to step in.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-strangers-reach-out-to-covid-hit-with-free-home-cooked-meals/articleshow/82509015.cms||Nitasha Natu

It, however, managed to retain 4,144 sqft of the 6,781 sqft land that it was asked to surrender to help ease congestion and traffic woes in the area. BEST was recently asked by the suburban collector to hand over 6,781sqft (nearly 50%) of its plot for the project. However, after a series of discussions and objection by senior BEST committee member Sunil Ganacharya, it succeeded in retaining a part of this plot and will now have to hand over only 2,637sqft. The bus station is on government land admeasuring 14,865 sqft which has been taken by BEST on lease. “We were asked by the government to hand over 6,781sqft to the BMC. But after our discussion with the BMC officials, the latter agreed to take just 2,637sqft for the road project,” said Ganacharya. BEST committee chairman Ashish Chemburkar said congestion was a major issue outside Goregaon station. “Since it was necessary, we had to part with some area for the project. But we still have space for bus stops and parking of buses,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-best-to-give-2637sqft-of-its-goregaon-plot-for-rd-widening/articleshow/82509086.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Covid-19: Key anti-fungal drug scarcity new concern||HYDERABAD: Acute shortage of anti-fungal injection ‘amphotericin’ and other anti-fungal medicines used to treat mucormycosis, a life-threatening infection that follows Covid-19 in roughly 30% diabetics, is now adding to difficulties of patients. In addition to the shortage, the treatment for this invasive fungal infection is a costly affair requiring Rs 15,000-Rs 20,000 per day for a period of 2-3 weeks, further straining the finances of recovered patients. Covid-19 recovered patients developing mucormycosis infection has become more problematic than Covid-19 itself, say doctors. “Currently, the non-availability of amphotericin injection, which is the primary medication used is a big issue. While some capsules and other treatments are also used following the primary treatment, those too are in short supply and very difficult to get. As per suppliers, the manufacturing company is having a shortage of ingredients, which are imported from the US, and with the ban on flights there is no respite expected soon,” said Dr Koka Rambabu, senior consultant ENT surgeon, Apollo Hospitals. Read AlsoIndore: Black fungus cases on rise in Covid-recovered patientsThe district has been witnessing a rise in cases of Mucormycosis, a fungal infection, also known as black fungus affecting nose, ear and brain to an extent to damage it, in patients recovering from Covid-19 in the last one-and-a-half month amidst the second wave. The shortage of the injections has also led to black marketing, suppliers marking up the price three times. “Since the infection has become very rampant and the primary treatment is with this injection — lyposomal amphotericin D —the injection is available at more than thee times its cost. This injection costs around Rs 2,500 per vial and a patient requires at least 10 vials. With the situation worsening now, sellers are exploiting patients by selling an injection for as much as Rs 7,500. Other medicines which are used after the injections too are now being sold at a marked up price,” said Dr Manish Gupta, resident medical officer, Government ENT Hospital Koti, where over 40 cases were seen in the last one and half months.

Bathinda has the capacity of 211 level-III beds in the district and at present 214 patients are admitted, with Adesh University having made extra arrangements for three patients. On the other hand, the district has over 200 beds at level-II vacant. Authorities are worried that if more patients in serious condition turn up, they would have to turn them away. Punjab financer minister Manpreet Singh Badal held a meeting with district authorities asking them to make earnest efforts to enhance the capacity at level-III. The fatality rate is not coming down as in the past nine days 148 persons died, with 17 losing life on Sunday. Of the 211 level-III beds, only 10 are at a government facility at AIIMS, and 201 are in private hospitals. The district health authorities are waiting for AIIMS capacity to go up and also for proposal of 100-bed hospital at HMEL Refinery at Rama, nearly 30km from Bathinda. Civil surgeon of Bathinda, Dr Tejwant Singh Dhillon confirmed, “The district has completely exhausted level-III beds. The problem is compounding as the patients are coming to hospitals quite late, if they report early on we would be able to help more.” He, however, did not say anything about enhancing capacity at district hospital and other state government facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-level-iii-beds-left-in-bathinda/articleshow/82509116.cms||Neel Kamal

A total of 34,888 patients are in home isolation, 2,382 (severe cases) in hospitals and 153 in district Covid care centres (mild cases). “We cannot say the cases are going down at this time. But, there is stability in the caseload and we are expecting the cases to go down after May 15. People are still required to stay at home. People who have symptoms and still not tested positive should stay in isolation for 10 days. They should treat themselves as Covid-positive unless proven otherwise,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon. Meanwhile, 95 people were sent to institutional quarantine facilities on Sunday. So far, 13,46,719 people have been put under surveillance in the city.

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC shoots down IAF’s objection to tower near Thane base||MUMBAI: Bombay high court has rejected objections of the Indian Air Force (IAF), on grounds of security and safety, to development of a proposed 24-storeyed building in Thane near its base, but outside a 100-metre restricted radius. The HC held that the restriction was contrary to notifications of 2007 and 2010, under the Works of Defence Act that made only 100-metre radius a no development zone (NDZ) from the station’s parameter. The 2007 notification restricted development in areas within 100 metres from Air Force Station, Thane. In January 2010, the Centre issued another notification under the Defence Act to continue restriction on constructions within 100 metres of the IAF Station at Thane. These notifications still hold the field, said a bench of Justices R D Dhanuka and V G Bisht. The HC said notifications “unarguably prevail” over correspondence seeking NOC. The HC set aside a 2018 refusal by the IAF and a 2019 condition imposed by Thane Municipal Corporation for a NOC from the defence ministry while granting permission for a 24-storey project by Runwal Constructions at Kolshet Road, Thane. The plot falls partly (16%) within the 100-metre NDZ, and the remaining 8.8 acres (84%) outside the NDZ, and requires only permissions under the development plan and development control regulations, said the HC. Builder’s counsel Pravin Samdani and advocate Saket Mone had challenged the objections raised by IAF and its insistence on the NOC. They said the 750-metre restriction was unjustified as the proposed project is about 500 metres from the helipad. The MoD and Air Force Station, through advocates Y R Mishra and NR Bubna, said the plot falls within 500 meters of the Air Force Station where a helipad for all classes of helicopters has VVIP movements and does rescue missions in natural calamities. Hence, no construction within 750 metres of take-off flight path ought to be permitted. However, since the Thane Air Force heliport is yet to be registered with civil aviation ministry, the HC said it didn’t agree the Air Force could invoke Aircraft Act to restrict the construction. On the builder’s plea for compensation under the scheme for acquisition under the Defence Act for portion of land within 100 metre buffer zone, the HC directed the MoD to consider such payout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-shoots-down-iafs-objection-to-tower-near-thane-base/articleshow/82509140.cms||Swati Deshpande

Goa health secretary Ravi Dhawan said that oxygen cylinders are sent whenever hospitals in Sindhudurg require. “Time and again we have been helping Sindhudurg district with certain oxygen cylinders.

At present, women account for 38.5 per cent of total infections in the state, a number which was at around 34 per cent in July last year. On the national scale, women account for 36 per cent of the infections, slightly better than Telangana’s count. “We have been keenly observing our ICU admissions and the female patient load certainly has increased, but the percentage of deaths is similar, at 50 per cent among both males and females,” said associate professor at Nizamabad Government General Hospital, Dr Kiran Madala. “Earlier ICU admission of female patient was about 33 per cent, which has increased to 39 per cent now. The death percentage being same is a worry. One reason for this is women are generally admitted late and the focus of families may not be the same on them as is for male members, especially in rural areas,” the Dr Madala said.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Experts said that the higher percentage of females being affected is also an indication that virus has changed behaviour. “Women generally follow Covid-19 protocols and don’t go outside as much as men but women from younger age groups are more vulnerable now,” said ASCI professor, Dr Subodh Kandamuthan.

---||Chandigarh||Haryana has buffer stock of 20 MT oxygen: Govt||Chandigarh: A day after it claimed to have started door-to-door supply of medical oxygen for Covid patients in home isolation, Haryana government, on Sunday, said the state has a buffer stock of 10MT oxygen for emergency use as the state stock has reached 262MT. The buffer stock has now gone up to 20MT and deputy commissioners have been directed to create 20 to 50 beds in their civil hospitals with provision of oxygen. As of now, more than 12,000 patients among 1.16 lakh active cases are on oxygen and ventilator support in Covid hospitals across the state. Many of them are in Gurgaon, Faridabad, Rohtak and Hisar districts. Just 10 days ago, providing oxygen had emerged as a major challenge for health authorities. This was attributed to alleged miscalculation of requirement by officials involved in procurement and supply of oxygen, who calculated a requirement of 60MT against 300MT calculated by IDSP, which is involved in Covid management. Till Saturday, Haryana had received a stock of 252MT, which was allocated to districts across the state. Maximum of 46MT was given to Gurgaon followed by 34MT to Faridabad and 21 MT to Rohtak for medical colleges and hospitals. Besides, the state government has also increased allocation in remaining districts to 20% to 25% of the stocks supplied so far. Supply of oxygen has been a major challenge for the state government in the wake of the Covid surge. Deaths have been reported largely due to non- availability of oxygen in private hospitals of Rewari, Faridabad and Hisar. Many SoS calls for oxygen have been received from desperate kin of critical patients. Sources said setting up of oxygen plants in six districts, increased allocation to the state government and augmentation of oxygen supply from steel plants of Bokaro through air lifting of tankers have worked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-has-buffer-stock-of-20-mt-oxygen-govt/articleshow/82509189.cms||Manvir Saini

Due to huge demand, the stock in many shops is sold out. Denizens are forced to check multiple shops to get these medicines. “I was trying to get multivitamin tablets for a couple of days, but the stock is not available anywhere. Despite keeping a tab on the availability of stock through an app or calling them multiple times, I did not succeed in getting these tablets,” said M Bhaskar, a private employee. Several shops have put out no stock boards for common medicines such as fever medication, gargle solution, and pulse oximeters. The same is the case even with those outlets offering home delivery option for medicines. When TOI contacted some medical shops in the city, a few said that anticoagulants and multivitamin tablets are not available. Denizens even took to Twitter to raise the issue and took a dig at the government for claiming that there is no scarcity — be it medicines, oxygen, hospital beds, among others. “In Hyderabad, routine COVID medicines like Dolo, antibiotics, zincovit, and vitamin D are in short supply, read, black market,” read a tweet from Bhanu Rao S, with handle @SBhanojee.

---||Goa||Have sufficient oxygen to meet current needs: Goa Health secretary||PANAJI: Health secretary Ravi Dhawan on Sunday said that there is no shortage of oxygen in the state. “Oxygen is sufficient to meet our current demand. Initially, Goa was allocated 11 tonne per day by the government of India, which was enhanced to 21 tonne and then to 26 tonne per day. Then we have capacity within the state among three suppliers,” he told reporters. Dhawan said patients in Covid care centres don’t require oxygen as their vitals are stable and added that facilities like the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee stadium have a dedicated ambulance to shift patients whose condition shows signs of deteriorating. Ninety-nine oxygen concentrators will be installed on Sunday at the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee stadium, the health secretary said. Goa medical college dean and head of Covid hospitals in the state, Dr S M Bandekar appealed to people to seek medical treatment early, especially those with comorbidities, saying little could be done if patients present very late. He said those with the slightest fever must be considered Covid until proven otherwise. “Any fever during the pandemic has to be a Covid fever,” Bandekar said, adding that one must test for Covid and seek medical attention immediately. “Once a person reaches into the oxygen dependent stage you require a lot of things and then nobody knows whether you will come out of it and then there’s no point blaming the system. Once there’s massive lung damage, repair work is very very slow and doubtful,” the GMC dean said. Director of health services Dr Jose D’Sa said that after meetings with expert physicians, intensivists and consultants, the government has taken a decision to give everybody who is tested medication. “Every patient who comes for testing is given five tablets of Ivermectin and 10 of doxycyline and paracetamol once they give their swab sample,” he said, adding that pulse oximeters are given once the patient tests positive. Dhawan said no orders have been given to the government testing facilities about not testing people wanting to travel out of Goa. However, he said that the government is giving priority to those who are symptomatic. When asked about the big variation in testing privately in Goa and other states and whether the government would lower the cost of testing in private labs, Dhawan said, “Most facilities are charging not more than Rs 1,000 for RT-PCR and RAT has been capped at Rs 580. So far, we have not received any demand, but we are open to looking into this aspect,” the health secretary said. When questioned about fully vaccinated people being allowed entry into Goa and whether they couldn’t carry Covid into Goa, Dhawan said he is waiting for final orders from the government. Bandekar said there are “remote chances” of those who have received both doses of the vaccine to be carriers in Goa. “The notification is still not out. Why we want it is because that way at least we will know who is frankly positive and can isolate them. Carriers cannot be identified,” he said, adding that two vaccine doses increases one’s immunity to such an extent that people “won’t be having that virus in you”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/have-sufficient-o2-to-meet-current-needs-health-secy/articleshow/82509216.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||CBSE launches app for psycho-social well-being of students||Ludhiana: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has launched a new mobile application, ‘Dost for Life’, for the psycho-social well-being of students during the Covid-19 pandemic. The app has been designed for students of Classes IX to XII and can be used for counselling from May 10. The app is available on the Google Play Store and will cater to students and parents from CBSE-affiliated schools in different geographies across the world. A Class X student who is now pursuing XI provisional from DAV School, Shreya, said, “This is really a great step and will help students.” Her mother Shikha, who claimed that the students were not counselled properly since the lockdown, hoped that the app will bridge that gap. The new application will host several features such as counselling sessions, expert advice, suggestive course guide after Class XII, tips on mental well-being, Covid-19-related protocol and audio-visual messages. The counselling sessions will cater to both students and parents. The live counselling sessions will be conducted free of cost, thrice a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday by the trained counsellors and principals. This year there are 83 volunteers, out of which 66 are in India and 17 located in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Nepal, Oman, Kuwait, Japan and the USA. Students and parents can select their own time slot between 9.30am and 1.30pm or 1.30pm and 5.30pm and connect through a chat box according to their convenience. Dost for Life will also include educational material on social, emotional and behavioural issues such as exam anxiety, internet addiction disorder, depression, specific learning disability, substance use disorder, aggression and life skills to sensitise students and masses. This can be accessed at the website cbse.gov.in and the YouTube channel of CBSE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cbse-launches-app-for-psycho-social-well-being-of-students/articleshow/82509243.cms||Mehak Jain
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ACB initiates 3 ‘discreet’ inquiries into complaints against Param Bir Singh||MUMBAI: The anti-corruption bureau (ACB) has initiated three discreet inquiries against former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh based on separate complaints filed by two police officers and two alleged bookies. The complaints by assistant police inspector Anup Dange, inspector Bhimrao Ghadge, and Sonu Jalan and Ketan Tanna pertain to serious corruption charges levelled against Singh between 2017 and 2020. A discreet inquiry is a preliminary probe in which the ACB attempts to corroborate the complaint against the public servant. The inquiry report is forwarded to the department where the public servant works, seeking a sanction to further proceed into investigation. “It’s a confidential inquiry which cannot be shared, but in this case, the home department had forwarded us these three complaints. We are in the process of recording the statements of the complainants,” said an ACB officer. According to the ACB manual, the officer said, a discreet inquiry has to be completed within three months. Based on the findings, either an open inquiry can be ordered, an FIR registered or the probe may be closed if the allegations turn out to be baseless. In his complaint, Dange had alleged that in 2019 Singh pressured him to not take action against an influential person who was arrested for manhandling a policeman. He claimed that Singh suspended him in July 2020, and later his aide demanded Rs 2 crore for revoking his suspension. He was reinstated in March this year. Last week, Ghadge of Kalyan police station lodged an FIR against Singh and 32 other officers claiming that though he had strong documentary evidence in a cheating case against some Kalyan-Dombivli civic officials, Singh misused his official position and submitted a closure report. Ghadge also alleged that Singh as Thane city police commissioner had amassed assets by settling financial and land disputes and extorted money from builders and transport lobbies. Last week, Jalan and Tanna complained that Singh, and his two subordinates—police inspectors Pradeep Sharma and Rajkumar Kothmire—had falsely arrested them in a cricket-betting case and extorted Rs 5 crore from them in 2018, when Singh was Thane police chief. Earlier, the state home department had ordered two internal inquiries against Singh for providing misleading information related to the Ambani car bomb scare case and Dange’s allegations. Director general of police Sanjay Pandey was to conduct the inquiries, but recused himself after Singh alleged that he had allegedly offered to mediate between him and the state government. Now, a three-member committee headed by a senior IAS officer is conducting these two inquiries against Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-acb-initiates-3-discreet-inquiries-into-complaints-against-param-bir/articleshow/82509245.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Construction workers in 18-44 age group to get vaccine from today||Chandigarh: The Punjab government would start administering Covid-19 vaccine to all construction workers and their family members in the 18-44 age group from Monday. Health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the health department had received one lakh doses of vaccine for the age group and it had been decided to cover construction workers and their family members in the first phase. The Punjab government has placed an order of 30 lakh doses with the Serum Institute of India and has been informed that the allocation would be 4.29 lakh doses for the 18-44 age group for May. Of the 4.29 lakh doses, the government has received one lakh doses so far. Sidhu said an expert committee had recommended that increased doses be sought in partnership with the private sector and other sources for allocation of available doses in May. Individuals with co-morbidities are at the highest risk of severe disease and, hence, 70% doses will be allocated to this group in the next phase. He said the list of comorbidities included obesity (BMI>30), disabilities like spinal cord injury and multiple co-morbidities. The minister said people in certain professions had greater interaction with other individuals and were at highest risk of infection and transmission, so 30% vaccine doses had been allocated to this group. The three professions included for May include government employees, construction workers, teachers and other staff at government and private educational establishments. Revealing the strategy used for allocating vaccines in districts, Sidhu said districts had been ranked based on population-based incidence, mortality and density into three zones — A, B and C — in order of priority, which have been allocated 50%, 30% and 20% vaccine doses. Within these zones, the expert committee had recommended that vaccination be limited to major urban centres, while vaccine supplies were severely constrained and allocation had been made proportionate to the population of major urban areas of zones A and B. For zone C, they recommended an equal distribution of doses across each district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/construction-workers-in-18-44-age-group-to-get-vaccine-from-today/articleshow/82509254.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: PM Cares ventilators lying idle for want of repairs, lack of staff||HYDERABAD: A shipment of ventilators allocated to Telangana under the PM Cares fund are lying unused across medical colleges and hospitals for various reasons. For instance, at Mahabubnagar Government Hospital, 30 ventilators are lying unused due to a lack of speciality staff who can operate them. Similar is the case at Nizamabad Medical College where 20 ventilators are unused as the oxygen plant does not have supportive oxygen for the ventilators’ functioning. “These ventilators can at least be reshuffled to hospitals where there is a need and adequate infrastructure. Less recruitments, no funds with superintendents for small repairs, no biomedical engineering recruitments and negligence by higher authorities is leading to loss of lives,” said a source from the hospital. In fact, some ventilators supplied are of poor quality, said doctors. “In many cases either manpower is not available, oxygen capacity is not there or there is need for small repairs — either the sensor is not working or the monitor is not working. We have represented these issues many times to the government but they were not taken up. There is a need to have a separate biomedical engineering wing which can take up repairs and regular maintenance as ventilators and other equipment also remain idle many times for want of minor repairs. Like Tamil Nadu where the task was assigned to the Anna University’s biomedical engineering department, we can do it here at Osmania University’s medical engineering department,” said Dr Mahesh Dr Mahesh Kumar, president, Healthcare Reforms Doctors Association (HRDA). At the Gandhi Hospital too a few ventilators are lying unused for want of minor repairs reportedly. While the hospital denied that PM Cares ventilators were lying idle, Dr Sashidhar Reddy, president Junior Doctors Association (JUDA) Gandhi unit said, “Although we had put most of ventilators to use at Gandhi, a few are not of good quality. We are facing a lot of issues with them as they don’t work most of the time. Few which are not working are kept aside.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pm-cares-ventilators-lying-idle-for-want-of-repairs-lack-of-staff/articleshow/82509248.cms||Amrita Didyala

After 1pm, the police questioned the pedestrians and chased away the crowd in some places. Some people refrained themselves from moving out after 1pm. Vendors from rural areas came to sell vegetables, mangoes and other items at the Bicholim market, where people were seen shopping in a disciplined manner. While customers at most grocery shops maintained social distance, people crowded at liquor shops, where the patrolling police had to intervene. The fish market was also open, but with very few vendors and even fewer buyers. At many places goods carrier rickshaws were seen selling fish, fruits and vegetables. At Sakhali, the market was open till noon, while other activities closed after 1pm. At some places, police were compelled to disperse the crowd. Locals from areas bordering Dodamarg are demanding increase in security at the checkpost. People have also asked the police to keep a watch on interior areas from where the people enter Goa, avoiding the check. In the later half of the day, chief minister Pramod Sawant took a review meeting of the first day of the curfew. He urged the public to not panic, abide by the rules and be careful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bicholim-market-sees-big-rush-on-day-1-of-curfew/articleshow/82509282.cms||---

Now, with lockdown being imposed, things have only got more uncertain for those dreaming of an MBBS seat. The government had started free residential training for interested students a few years ago due to fewer government school students from Tamil Nadu clearing NEET. It was shifted to online mode last year due to the pandemic. A private firm was hired for providing NEET coaching on the E-Box platform and online training began in November last year for those slated to appear for the test this year. Presently, there are 486 students undergoing training, but the number was more than 600 including students from government-aided schools. “Many students from the aided schools didn’t show interest as 10.5% horizontal reservation for students from government schools in MBBS admission is not applicable for them,” said officials at Trichy district chief education office. But keeping the existing students focused on training has been challenging for teachers, especially after the schools were closed last month. While schools reopened for students of class XII by January end of this year, they were being prepared for the board examinations. It was also helping the teachers to give necessary instructions in person. But the closure has come as a setback as students could not be monitored, said a government school teacher. “Since all the 486 students are not showing interest in the training, we have narrowed down the focus to 76 students,” said M Joan of Arc, coordinator for free NEET coaching in Trichy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/shut-schools-hit-free-neet-coaching-hard/articleshow/82513948.cms||Sampath Kumar

On May 3, the state general administration department, headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, issued a notification delegating powers of a civil court to the single-member committee and also asked the public works department to take possession of over 4,000 sq ft area on the second floor of the old secretariat building and convert 1,000 sq ft into a court room and office for the Chandiwal committee. The committee, comprising retired HC judge Kailash Chandiwal, was set up on March 30 to conduct a judicial inquiry into Singh’s allegations against Deshmukh made in a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20. A day after his unceremonious transfer from the post of Mumbai police commissioner to DG, state Home Guards, Singh wrote to Thackeray alleging that Deshmukh had asked arrested API Sachin Waze and other police officers to mobilise Rs 100 crore per month from 1,750 bars, restaurants, hotels and other establishments. Opposition leader in the legislative council Pravin Darekar claimed that the government delegated the judicial powers to the committee only after the opposition made a noise about it. “Now we hope that the committee will initiate a probe fairly and complete it as early as possible.” Opposition leader in the state assembly Devendra Fadnavis had earlier termed the probe an eyewash as the committee was not given powers under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952. tnn New neighbours, see P 4||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-panel-probing-deshmukh-gets-powers-of-civil-court/articleshow/82509317.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: No proof steam kills virus, say doctors after boy burns self||HYDERABAD: Taking steam inhalation is a popular home remedy for common cold, cough and upper respiratory tract infections, but there is no sound scientific evidence to prove that taking steam can kill coronavirus infection, say doctors. In one instance, as a boy suffering from Covid-19 got severe burn injuries as he accidentally spilled hot water while trying to take steam. “The common misconception about steam inhalation that it can kill Covid-19 virus led to a crisis for the family of a nine-year-old boy,” said Dr Anjul Dayal, senior paediatrician and paediatric intensivist, at Continental Hospitals in Gachibowli. He added that the boy had sustained around 25% severe burns in the lower limb region. The boy was admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and collagen dressing was done on an immediate basis and he was treated for Covid-19 through IV medications. “Considering the young age of the child, vacuum dressing was applied for faster healing for the wounds. The child will require a few more hospital visits for the dressing and will require a skin grafting later, but at present, his life is out of danger,” he added. The doctor said that if steam is given to a child, it should be done under the supervision of elders and with all the precautions to prevent spillage of hot water which can cause devastating burns. City pulmonologists made it clear that steam inhalation is not of much use to the majority of the population as it cannot kill the coronavirus. “People are assuming that the steam is going to kill the virus, but that’s not going to happen as the nose can regulate temperature. The heat is not going to reach and kill the virus,” said Mohammad Nawaz S, consultant pulmonologist at KIMS, Secunderabad. He said that it is, however, helpful to people with nose block, allergies, among others. “Steam inhalation is beneficial to some,” he added. The doctor said that it is not generally advised to Covid-19patients or as a precautionary measure against Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-proof-steam-kills-virus-say-docs-after-boy-burns-self/articleshow/82509323.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The services at the call centre will commence from Monday and cover the entire taluka. The team led by Sattari mamlatdar Dasharath Gawas and Valpoi community health center medical officer, Dr Abhijeet Wadkar conducted a training on Sunday for volunteers who registered to man the call centre. Gawas told TOI, “The volunteers will call patients randomly and inquire about their health and will also assist them depending on their problem.” He said the volunteers will inform patients about the medication as instructed by their doctor. The Sattari mamlatdar also said that the disaster management team would soon provide a phone number so that patients under home isolation could also call the centre. He said that if the volunteers find that any patient has major health problems or low oxygen levels, they will pass on the message to the doctor at the call centre and will further assist by making arrangements at the Valpoi CHC, district hospital or Goa Medical College. “Given a rise in Covid cases in Sattari taluka, it is essential to monitor patients under home isolation. A doctor who will be a nodal officer at the call centre will take updates from the volunteers and act accordingly,” Gawas said. The volunteers will work in two shifts, from 7am to 2pm and from 2pm to 9pm. The disaster management team has also appealed to others to register as volunteers. Currently there are 809 active cases under the jurisdiction of the Valpoi health center.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/call-centre-set-up-at-sattari-to-assist-home-isolated/articleshow/82509333.cms||---

Despite more than 50 deaths in Saturday’s Kabul explosion, the remaining minority families now can’t even flee to India. Gurdwara Kartae Parwan president Gurnam Singh told TOI over telephone from Kabul on Sunday: “The blast revived our memories of the March 2020 suicide bombing that killed 25 Sikhs and triggered the first migration from Afghanistan. Covid in Delhi has forced 15 to 20 of those families to return.” He said: “People in Delhi are dying for want of oxygen so we have dropped our plans of moving to India for now but hoping to go back once the situation improves.” Only 50-odd Sikh and Hindus families remain in Afghanistan, in Kabul mostly, and they went into a huddle on Saturday. On March 25, 2020, a suicide bomber of Islamic State terror organisation exploded himself in one of Kabul’s oldest gurdwaras, Har Rai Sahib, killing 25 Sikhs, women and children, included, and a second bomb went off during cremations. Fortunately, it took no life. Kabul Hindu-Sikh Society president Ram Saran Bhasin said: “Since US president Joe Biden has started to withdraw his troops from Afghanistan, the Taliban have increased their attacks on the government establishments, and the minorities are their next target.” Bhasin, who once had a photo studio in Kabul, said only the Almighty can protect the Hindus in Afganistan now. “The Hindu and Sikh families cannot survive if they do not shift to India, but the pandemic is making it impossible to go there. We are caught between the devil and the deep sea — choice is to die at the hands of terrorists in Kabul or Covid in Delhi,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/delhi-disease-or-kabul-death-afghan-hindus-sikhs-must-choose/articleshow/82509341.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Sources said the positivity rate in many wards of Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation(GWMC) and Greater Khammam Municipal Corporation (GKMC) has doubled ever since the polls concluded. Many newly-elected corporators could not take oath in person and did the same digitally as they had tested positive.

Alleging that Rane and Sawant were trying to profit from the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Congress demanded that Rane take moral responsibility and resign immediately. “It is not only the administrative errors, but the mass corruption by the BJP government l that has resulted in the Covid emergency in Goa.

He said that Goa’s positivity rate, which is the highest in the country, and mortality rate are a direct outcome of the many “bad and irresponsible decisions” taken by the BJP government, which ignored all indications and warnings of a second wave. Parrikar would have controlled the situation long ago and not allowed it to go out of hand, he said. D’Souza said that Goa is spiralling out of control and chief minister Pramod Sawant and the health minister Vishwajeet Rane need to act “expeditiously and effectively” to bring down the massive death toll and Covid caseload. “This leadership decided to turn a blind eye and was busy fighting elections,” D’Souza said. “It allowed an unchecked influx of people and put all the sacrifices we Goans had made for over one year to waste.” NCP has questioned the state’s preparations for the third wave.  “The solution to pandemic is not a lockdown. We should see that all those eligible are vaccinated on a war footing. The government should also focus on widespread testing, reducing the cost of testing, and the speed at which test reports are given,” NCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/parrikar-would-have-controlled-2nd-wave-ncp/articleshow/82509395.cms||---

However, Ramesh said that he could only help the patient due to the efforts of Bollywood actor Sonu Sood who has been instrumental in helping many, both during the first and second wave of the pandemic. “The credit (for the effort) has to go to Sonu Sood who responded to my plea at the right time and helped arrange Tocilizumab-400 MG injection,” Ramesh told TOI. A few days back, the family of the patient had approached Mehar Ramesh through his volunteers and sought help to get Tocilizumab injection as they could not afford it at the high prices of around Rs 5 lakh to Rs 6 lakh in the black market. “I immediately recalled Sonu Sood’s services which he was rendering to the people in need during this crisis and contacted him over the phone, said Mehar Ramesh. “Sood responded quickly to my plea and arranged the Tocilizumab injection. He brought this injection from Dubai at its original cost of Rs 40,000. On Saturday, the injection arrived at RGIA Airport and then handed over to the doctors’ team, who advised it for the patient,” Ramesh said. “Keeping in view the injection itself is very expensive and even it is not available easily in the market due to shortage, I have shot the entire process, including right from arrival of injection at Hyderabad airport and till reached to the hospital and administering it to the patient concerned, in the mobile phone,” Mehar Ramesh added. The patient has since recovered and family members have expressed their happiness gratitude to Ramesh. “My aim to save the life of a person in need was fulfilled,” a happy Ramesh shared with TOI. The Tollywood director has also organised blood donation camps and donated blood to those in need during the pandemic. He has also arranged plasma for a few Covid-19 patients too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/twood-director-comes-to-aid-of-covid-patient-credits-sonu-sood-for-efforts/articleshow/82509399.cms||Sunil Mungara

Based on a complaint lodged by the woman’s father, the police have pressed charges of abetment and cruelty against her husband and in-laws. The woman worked as an HR executive with a private company. Her father has said her husband used to thrash her after getting inebriated. He has also complained that her in-laws would taunt her over being childless. On May 5, the victim’s husband, a driver, called her father to their home and showed him a selfie of the woman and her friends. This sparked a heated dispute between the couple. Later, both sides landed at Vikhroli police station where a female police officer counselled the couple. She advised the victim’s father to take her home with him for a few days. On May 7, the victim left her maternal home on the pretext of going to work. Before ending her life, she sent text messages to her father and brother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-27-yr-old-ends-life-over-selfie-hubby-booked-for-abetment/articleshow/82509403.cms||---

---||Noida||Now, a local address rider: UP vaccines only for UP residents||NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: UP’s NCR districts will start vaccinating people in the 18-44 age bracket from Monday, 10 days after the national rollout of inoculations for this this large population group, but with a local address rider and a very conservative daily target – less than 6,000, Noida and Ghaziabad taken together. The vaccinations have been ringfenced for only UP residents at all government session sites, which they have been asked to ascertain by the National Health Mission (UP) from address proof documents like Aadhaar card, passport, driving licence, ration card and voter card. The central government puts no such regional restriction on vaccinations and neither does the Co-WIN portal that is mandatory for registrations and lets people select slots on the basis of pin codes. A letter issued by the director of the National Health Mission (NHM) stated that districts that started vaccinations for the 18-44 age group from May 1 have informed the state government that people from other states had registered for vaccinations because of which UP residents were not getting the jabs. “It is to be clarified that the purchase of vaccines for citizens of the age group of 18 to 44 years is being done by the state government itself. So, with the vaccine purchased by the state government, only citizens of the state should be inoculated. Therefore, before vaccinating any individual, it should be ensured that the beneficiary who has come to a government Covid vaccination centre is a citizen of Uttar Pradesh. No vaccination of residents of other states should be done at government Covid vaccination centres,” stated the order issued by NHM director Aparna Upadhyay. While the intention is to ensure people living in UP got access to vaccines, the rule could end up blocking many residents of Noida and Ghaziabad from getting a shot because both districts – particularly Noida, which is an industrial and corporate centre – have a large population of migrants from Delhi and other parts of India with ID documents made in their home towns and only rent agreements as local address proof. As soon as the slots opened up, appointments up to next Saturday (May 15) were all booked. Assuming there will be people among those who got slots who won’t have a local ID, the slots will be wasted and vaccine doses in the daily quota would lie unused because the vaccinations are to be done strictly on the basis of appointments and no walk-ins are allowed for the 18-44 group. For now, all vaccinations in this category will be with Covishield. Ghaziabad has set a modest daily target of vaccinating 3,100 people and Noida (Gautam Budh Nagar) just 2,800. In both districts, 16 government centres have been set up. The local address rule is not applicable to private centres but very few private centres are vaccinating this age group. Three hospital chains – Apollo, Max and Fortis – had on May 1 announced they would vaccinate people in this age group but at limited centres across regions where they have a presence. Meanwhile, residents who took Covaxin as their first dose are struggling to get the second dose in Noida. “I got my mother vaccinated in the second week of March. But I am unable to find a Covaxin centre for her. I am talking to private hospitals to find out if they can give the second dose to my mother,” said Shekhar Sharma, a resident of Sector 56. Officials said appointments for vaccinations after May 15 would be opened up only after getting fresh supplies. “By then, we are hoping to get Covaxin doses too. We are talking to senior officials in Lucknow and will start distributing Covaxin as soon as we get the vials,” said an official involved in the immunisation programme in Noida. For the 45+ population, vaccinations will continue as before and there is no local address rider. The health department in Noida, meanwhile, is in the process of setting up a booth to vaccinate media personnel in line with the directives of the state government.

The meeting was held in virtual mode,” GSPCB chairman Ganesh Shetgaonkar told TOI. The meeting was convened to discuss the possibilities of enhancing oxygen production from the existing Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA)-based nitrogen gas producing plants. The Central Pollution Control Board has directed state pollution control boards across the country to coordinate and furnish details of PSA-based nitrogen manufacturing units willing to convert to manufacturing medical oxygen to meet the immediate needs of increased demand due to the second wave in the country. As per the information obtained from the GSPCB, one industry from Zuarinagar said that they have placed an order for importing a new oxygen generation plant of capacity 40LPM, that can fill 30 cylinders of 7Nm3. The new plant will be received and commissioned before May 28. After receiving the new plant, it will be installed at a hospital suggested by the district administration depending on the oxygen requirements. The plant will be installed as part of CSR activity and no financial support is requested. Another industry representative said that their unit has an oxygen plant of 1,500Nm3/hr capacity. The industry is supplying three tonne of oxygen to the state’s hospitals as and when sought by the government. During the meeting, an industry representative from Corlim said that they have placed order for importing a 10Nm3 /hr oxygen gas generation plant and it is expected to be commissioned before May 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nitrogen-makers-to-install-o2-plants-at-few-hosps-in-state/articleshow/82509408.cms||---

The right arm of the statue was broken and the pieces were found nearby. A group of AIADMK men led by former minister Vellamandi N Natarajan staged a protest near the statue demanding the arrest of the miscreants. Later in the day, former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswamy demanded action against the miscreants. The statue was erected in 1995. AIADMK sources said they lodged a complaint with the Gandhi market police. Police are checking the CCTV footage in the area. AMMK general secretary T T V Dhinakaran also condemned the incident. While demanding action against those responsible for the incident, Dhinakaran recalled the attack on Amma canteens in some parts of the state soon after the DMK came to power. “The government should take the responsibility to stop such incidents,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/mgr-statue-vandalised-in-trichy-aiadmk-protests/articleshow/82509417.cms||---

Meanwhile, AKTU authorities said that the pandemic has hit the evaluation work hard with manpower involved in the scanning of answer copies getting Covid infected. Even if the varsity paces up all its evaluation work it will not be in a position to declare the results before June first week. “At least the varsity should declare results of the final year students as we have to apply for various competitive examinations and for a job in which the final semester mark sheet is a must,” said BTech student Reet Singh. Another student said, “Our academic session is already delayed by around three months and the delay in declaration of result means derailment of the entire academic session,” said a BTech student Shivam Gupta. AKTU spokesperson Asheesh Mishra said, “Covid has hit the evaluation as many examiners got infected.

---||Lucknow||Rising up to tackle crisis with a robust response||By: Ratan Mani Lal Uttar Pradesh has been hit hard by the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to a worldwide focus on the state and its people. Like the rest of the world, including many developed countries, the state too saw people suffering. But a mix of steady leadership and health related policies formulated by the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, are quickly bringing relief to the state’s 24 crore citizens. The Chief Minister, just a week after recovering from Covid-19, spent Saturday morning travelling to Moradabad district to check on hospitals, patients in home isolation and ensuring whether they were being given adequate treatment and medicines by the authorities. Even while suffering from mild symptoms of Covid-19, the Chief Minister regularly held meeting with Team-9, formed by the Uttar Pradesh government to deal with the pandemic’s second wave, and issued daily directions to combat the spread of the virus. He also interacted with experts from the healthcare sector and industrialists, all of those who offered their support. As a result of his quick thinking, Uttar Pradesh has now become the first state to float a global tender to procure Covid-19 vaccines, specifying it wants 40 million doses within six months. His robust initiatives have been aided by the confidence which the people of Uttar Pradesh have in his incorruptible personality. While the panchayat elections are being blamed for the ruthless surge of Covid-19 in the state, detractors have closed their eyes to the fact that it was in the compliance of the Allahabad high court’s order that the UP government had to go ahead with the panchayat election despite the Covid scare. The elections were due in December 2020 itself and the high court directed the state to complete the elections by April 30, 2021. Consequently, the only alternative left with the administration was to go ahead with the election with required precautions. In municipal wards and gram panchayats, community surveillance committees and district surveillance committees were made. To check the pandemic spread, lockdown was not an option as the state understands that a substantial population is dependent on daily wages and a lockdown would have hit them hard. It was a Catch-22 situation which required a deft solution. To ensure availability of personnel, the state government announced that all health workers, including doctors, paramedical staff, housekeeping staff, sanitation workers, accredited social health activists (Asha) and aanganwadi workers will be given an additional 25% of their salary or honorarium for their Covid duty days. Also, the kin of any worker succumbing to Covid worker would be given Rs 50 lakh as ex-gratia relief. No compromises have been made in the pace of aggressive testing and treatment and as a result, the number of new cases of Covid-19 have continued to decline while the recoveries shot up. Meanwhile, many condescending adjectives have been used to describe Yogi Adityanath but so far, he has put his head down and gracefully continued working relentlessly and unwavering in his resolve to fix the crises at hand and serve the state. While people closest to him tell me that several people have pitched ‘image management techniques’ to him, he has discarded the ideas and has requested everyone to let the work speak. Empathy, like good communication, can soften a hard message, engender identification and mobilise support around a common aim. As Theodore Roosevelt observed a century ago: “Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care.” The common aim today is to be united in the face of crisis. For now, the major task at hand for the UP Government is to speed up vaccination in the state and deliver to its citizens. UP has so far vaccinated only 13.5 million people, against its total population of 230 million. Yogi may not get everything right. But in a crisis, he steps up to the occasion. When challenged, he responds. (The writer is a senior journalist.

The state also got 7.03 lakh doses of Covishield that could help sustain the drive for just three more days. On Sunday, vaccination tu-rnout in Mumbai dropped by 67% due to shortage of doses. For those in 18-44 age group, there is some news to cheer. Maharashtra received the second consignment of 3.5 lakh Covishield doses on Sunday that it had procured from Serum Institute of India. Prior to this batch, Serum had supplied 3 lakh doses to kickstart the drive on May 1, while Bharat Biotech had given 4.79 lakh Covaxin doses. Serum Institute is believed to have assured the state of 13.5 lakh doses in May. State immunisation officer Dr Dilip Patil said while the new stocks would mean the 18-44 vaccination drive will continue at its current pace for some time, there are concerns about the unavailability of Covaxin. “Whatever doses have come will be used only to administer second doses,” he said. In Mumbai, vaccination saw a major dip with only 19,631 people getting the shots, a 67% dip compared to Saturday. All major centres, including Nesco jumbo centre in Goregaon and BKC in Bandra were shut for want of doses. BMC’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said vaccination for 45 years and above would start post noon on Monday as the centres have to first collect the doses from the central depot in Kanjurmarg. For 18-44 group, the number of centres has been increased from eight to 10 with Dindoshi Hall in Malad and Rajasthan Seva Sangh in Evershine Nagaras the new additions. Trying to allay vaccine shortage fears, guardian minister of Mumbai suburban Aaditya Thackeray, while speak-ing to a Marathi news channel, said, “The state is speaking to Adar Poonawala (CEO of Serum Institute), about making vaccines available. As soon as the doses are received, it will be distributed in an equitable manner. Apna time aayega.” Meanwhile, day one of the drive-in vaccination at Worli’s NSCI parking lot for senior citizens saw a good response with 150 people taking the jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/only-36000-covaxin-doses-for-maharashtra-citys-turnout-dips-by-67/articleshow/82509442.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Lucknow||Healthy lifestyle helps 90-year-old beat Covid-19||LUCKNOW: There’s a silver lining in times of gloom. A 90-year-old resident of the city has triumphed over Covid-19 with the help of doctors and along his sheer will power and self-confidence. On April 22, nonagenarian Bhagawati Prasad Pandey, a resident of Rajajipuram, tested Corona positive. At one time, his oxygen saturation level had reached 78. He was put on oxygen support and was in home isolation under the treatment of a local physician. Pandey, who had been living a disciplined lifestyle, which is also the secret of his long and healthy life, had no comorbid condition. His family members said “he rarely takes ill.” However, Pandey developed fever, loss of appetite and weakness on April 20. “He could not even walk, hence we had to lift him till the car to take him to the diagnostic centre for Covid testing. On our request, the sample was taken while he was sitting in the car,” said Sanjeev Pandey, his son. After he tested positive, his family was more concerned about his health because of his age. His blood oxygen level also started dropping. However, despite best efforts made by the family, he did not get a bed in any of the Covid hospitals, said a member. “As a result, we managed an oxygen cylinder with a friend’s help at home and arranged a support system on his bedside. After two days, his condition started improving,” said Sanjeev. Although he was running a high temperature until May 5, his oxygen saturation stabilized. Finally, he tested negative on May 7. "The first thing he asked for, after turning negative, was Dahi Jalebi — a favourite of many Lucknowites,” said Sanjeev. He said that daily yoga and a disciplined diet that consisted of fruits, juice and buttermilk with a positive attitude helped him in speedy recovery. Two other members of the family of seven had also tested positive but they were asymptomatic. Even after arranging oxygen, and refilling it as per the standard set by the state government, “We had to spend nearly Rs 30,000 in different tests and medicine. Since his health was not stable for 48 hours, I asked my brother to sit by his side to track oxygen and monitor temperature every two hours. And, I was in constant touch with doctors and doing outside work like refilling of the oxygen cylinder and making sure that drugs are available,” added Sanjeev. “There was a scarcity of fabiflu tablets. We had to purchase in black for Rs 5,000 to give him,” he further added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/healthy-lifestyle-helps-90-yr-old-beat-covid-19/articleshow/82509447.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Big scale up needed to meet jab target||LUCKNOW: The district administration and health authorities will have to scale up daily Covid-19 vaccinations to an average of 25,000 per day to meet the daunting task of inoculating the entire adult population with at least one dose in four months. The Allahabad high court had, on Friday, directed the state government to vaccinate the entire population in next 3-4 months. The court had also asked the state government to file a detailed report on how it proposes to expedite the purchase of vaccines from global market. According to data accessed by TOI from the office of the the chief medical officer (CMO), health authorities have administered 6.3 lakh doses from the start of the mass immunisation drive against Covid-19 in 111 days from January 16 till May 8 with an average of 5,705 inoculations daily. About 4.5 lakh beneficiaries have received at least one dose after the launch of the drive so far. Of these, nearly 1.8 lakh have completed two-dose course given 4-8 weeks apart and can be said to have been immunised and about 2.7 lakh have taken one shot. As per district administration estimates based on voter and Aadhaar registrations, Lucknow’s adult population is about 36 lakh. This means that so far only 5% of the population has been immunised with two doses and overall, 12.5% of the population has received at least one shot. In other words, 31.5 lakh people (87.5% of the population) have not received even a single dose so far. Experts said that on considering that nearly 10% of the population is not fit for vaccination, nearly 28 lakh people will be required to be vaccinated in next 120 days. This target can be achieved if daily 23,000 people are given the jab. And if we take out holidays and off days, the target will be to inoculate about 25,000 daily, they added. “Since two doses are required for full immunisation and these are given in a gap of 4-8 weeks, immunising all will be practically impossible in this period,” said a senior SGPGIMS professor. Currently, the health department is running vaccination at 84 government sites. An average 10,000 people were vaccinated daily on weekdays in May. The pace has slowed down because private centres have stopped vaccination from May 1 due to procurement issues. While DM Abhishek Prakash and CMO Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar refused to comment on the issue, a senior health officer said, “Vaccination depends on availability of vaccine, number of registration slots and health condition of beneficiaries and manpower. The high court must also consider these factors. It is very difficult to achieve this target in four months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/big-scale-up-needed-to-meet-jab-target/articleshow/82509464.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Madurai||Social science gets a leg-up in Periyar univ VC selection||Trichy: At a time when vice-chancellors of nine of the 10 arts and science universities in Tamil Nadu belong to the science discipline, Periyar University in Salem has offered some hope for candidates with social science background this time. In its notification seeking applications from prospective VC candidates, the university has for the first time asked candidates to mention if they had conceived any social indulgence scheme and were part of its implementation in their respective institutions. Experts point out that most candidates from social science discipline would have been part of extension activities and outreach programmes during their academic career. However, they have limited opportunities in conducting national and international conferences or publishing research papers with high impact factor and citation index which are the forte of those in the science discipline. “Most of the recent VC selection processes in the state focused on the academic credentials of candidates which are heavily loaded in favour of those from the science stream,” said a candidate. S Subbiah, former vice-chancellor of Alagappa University who is convener of the vice-chancellor search committee of Periyar University, said teaching, research and extension activities are important domains of higher education and a VC candidate is expected to have enough expertise in all the three. “We found that VC candidates were not asked about their contribution towards extension activities during their academic career in the recent VC selection process in the state. Therefore, we decided to include it in the selection of VC for Periyar University,” he said. This will enable more academicians from social science disciplines to vie with those from science disciplines for the VC post. Most public universities in the state are run by vice-chancellors from either science or engineering discipline. Of the 10 arts and science universities in the state, five are headed by those from the engineering stream and four from science. Alagappa University is the only exception where the VC belongs to a social science discipline. “There is a problem with the selection process which doesn’t offer a level-playing field for candidates from science and social science background,” said a former vice chancellor. He said vice-chancellorship is a noble stature and there should be nominations and not applications. Merit list should be based on submissions and not interviews.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/social-science-gets-a-leg-up-in-periyar-univ-vc-selection/articleshow/82509475.cms||Sampath Kumar

Though Dussehri is set to hit the market by May-end and the mango belt of Malihabad registering a good crop this year, the growers fear the absence of buyers due to Covid curfew in the city. President of the All-India Mango Growers Association, Insram Ali, told TOI that the weather has remained conducive for the mango crop till now. “Favourable temperature, lack of thunderstorms and sporadic rains have made the crop flourish. We expect Dussehri to be ready in next 20 days,” he added. However, what has emerged as the biggest concern for mango growers this year is the timing of the curfew. “Some workers are coming to work. This is the time when the crop needs extra care, but the pandemic has restricted the people’s movement,” Ali said, adding that the growers are also not finding buyers for their produce. “By this time we used to find contractors who would buy the crop from us and then sell it in the market. But over 70% of the orchards are still waiting for buyers,” he said. Mandis are closed due to curfew and mangoes do not have a long shelf life. If the curbs continue, most people may not get to taste Dussehris. Also, the fruit may lose its taste and aroma if stored beyond a period. Last year, too, most of the mango crop could not reach the market due to the curbs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dussehri-ready-for-market-but-covid-curbs-could-play-a-spoiler/articleshow/82509492.cms||Neha Shukla

Mumbai-based Capt Prasad (53) was a commander on Boeing 777 aircraft. He had tested positive for Covid on April 21, and was hospitalised on April 23, said a close friend of the deceased pilot. “He operated his last flight, a return flight from San Francisco, and landed here on April 15,” said a source, adding that Capt Prasad’s wife too is hospitalised with Covid. A pilot colleague of Capt Prasad said, “What has upset most of us is that this could have been prevented had the government prioritised vaccination for our aircrew.” “We continue to be utilised for the bulk of evacuation and Vande Bharat missions but we were conveniently forgotten when it came to vaccinations,” he added. Even as grief and disbelief spread among Air India pilots, there came news of the death of Tirkey, a Kolkata-based aircraft maintenance engineer. Air India in a statement said, “We are deeply saddened by this universal calamity... Some of our colleagues have succumbed to the virus in spite of the organisation ensuring strict adherence to protocols. An aggressive vaccination schedule for the employees is already on, wherein all employees are to be vaccinated by May-end.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ai-staff-blames-govt-as-airline-loses-captain-engr-to-covid/articleshow/82509497.cms||---

Virender is the second DSP in Haryana who has died of the virus. Earlier, Ashok Dahiya, a DSP posted at Badli in Jhajjar, succumbed to Covid-19 during treatment at the AIIMS outreach centre in Badsa, Jhajjar. “When people did not dare leave their homes due to fear of coronavirus, these ‘karmaveer’ of police remained on the frontline without any fear and were busy serving the people with dedication. These bravehearts, ensuring effective lockdown and Covid-appropriate behaviour for the protection of people, often come in direct contact with infected persons. Nevertheless, police personnel have neither lost the courage nor there has been any decrease in devotion to public service,’’ said DGP Manoj Yadava.

---||Chandigarh||‘Zero wastage of vaccines in HP will help in allocation’||Shimla: Himachal Pradesh has been able to save Covid-19 vaccine doses by achieving zero wastage. NHM mission director Nipun Jindal said 19,86,812 doses had been administered in the state till May 7 and stock received by the state was 21,19,710, while stock available at cold chain points after utilisation according to eVIN was 1,60,730. Hence, he said, vaccine wastage in the state was -1.4%, whereas it was as high as 10% in other states. He said vaccinators in Himachal Pradesh had been trained to load and administer the doses with attention to wastage. He said it was observed that in most of the vials there were extra doses. He said a vial, once opened, needed to be used up within a certain time. If the doses from the vial are not administered in time, they have to be thrown away. This means that there has to be a sufficient number of people willing and ready to be vaccinated at a time in order to ensure maximum efficiency. He said according to data, Himachal Pradesh has the highest full immunisation coverage among all states in the country. He said Himachal Pradesh sustained its routine immunisation activities during Covid pandemic as well and this had been possible because of team efforts and intensive micro-planning, monitoring and supervision. “Vaccine wastage is an important indicator of the efficiency of any vaccination programme,” he said. He said the Centre will allocate vaccines to states and UTs based on the criteria of performance (speed of administration, average consumption), extent of infections (number of active Covid cases). He said wastage of vaccine will also be considered in the criteria and will affect the allocation. “Based on the above criteria, the state would be able to secure more vaccines from the central government for prioritised groups. All credit for this goes to the entire workforce involved in Covid vaccination,” he added. 50 O2 concentrators from China In related development, a government spokesperson said 50 portable ventilators had been received from Switzerland and 150 oxygen concentrators from China in the form of international aid. These have been kept at the state COVID store.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/zero-wastage-of-vaccines-in-hp-will-help-in-allocation/articleshow/82509553.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Worried about managing Covid-19 waste, hygiene at home? Experts clear the air||LUCKNOW: If you are looking after a Covid-19 patient at home, the issue of waste disposal must be a major cause for concern. Many people are digging pits or burning waste to dispose it of but experts believe that simple home techniques may help you overcome the problem. Talking to TOI, experts said an alcohol-based rub, bleach and soapy warm water can help a lot in killing the virus and cleaning clothes, bedding, utensils and room used by a patient. “Masks discarded after eight hours of use or earlier, if soiled by the patient, should be disinfected in sodium hypochlorite which is available in a diluted form as bleach. Thermometer, oximeter and other gadgets should be cleaned with a rub having 70% or more alcohol, and then wiped clean with water,” said head of SGPGI’s microbiology department Prof Ujjala Ghoshal. Member of the environment cell at the King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Prof Mohd Parvez Khan, said: “Those who think that burning the items is a way to get rid of the virus, they are making a big mistake by creating unnecessary pollution. How many PPE kits, masks and gloves, which are made of plastic, can we burn? The best way is to use any sanitising liquid easily available as home cleaning products, an alcohol rub or bleach to clean the surfaces touched by the patient. This is also the protocol followed for disinfecting hospital beds.” “The virus gets destroyed when these cleaning agents are applied and left for 20 seconds or more. Even used N95 masks if hung to dry for five days and more, can be worn again without even being washed. Using disinfectant on them is added precaution on the sixth day,” he added. For cleaning the laundry and linen used by a patient in home isolation, Prof Ghoshal said, “Machine wash linen at 60-90º C with laundry detergent. Alternatively, soak linen in hot water and soap in a large drum, using a stick to stir. Avoid splashing. If hot water is not available, soak linen in 0.5% chlorine for approximately 30 minutes. Rinse with clean water and let the linen dry in sunlight.” To handle any dishes, cups/glasses, or silverware used by the patient, the attendant should wear gloves and then just wash them with soap and hot water or in a dishwasher. “If the patient is using the toilet on the bed, after disposing of excreta, the bedpan should be cleaned with a neutral detergent and water, disinfected with a 0.5% chlorine solution and then rinsed with clean water,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/worried-about-managing-covid-19-waste-hygiene-at-home-experts-clear-the-air/articleshow/82509558.cms||Yusra Husain

They will oversee the process at the Sector 94 crematorium that has been handling 50-60 bodies almost every day for the past few weeks. The Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) will also follow a similar model to handle the cremation process, officials said. The prominent crematorium for the city is at Shafipur. The order had said cremations would be conducted at the behest of the local urban or rural bodies and expenses of up to Rs 5,000 in each case would be handled by the local authority. Later, the amount would be reimbursed by the government. Oxygen tankersIn another development, Noida Authority will start floating tenders from Monday to procure cryogenic oxygen tankers. It will initially try to get 35 tankers of different sizes. Chief executive officer of Noida Authority Ritu Mahehswari said: “We have initiated the process of getting tankers that can separate oxygen with high purity .”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/no-cremation-cost-in-noida-gr-noida-to-follow-model/articleshow/82509560.cms||Shalabh

---||Thane||Touts tampering with slots to deny Thane locals shots: BJP||THANE: Activists and BJP leaders have alleged the possibility of mischief in the online Covid vaccination slot registration system and have demanded a probe by the cyber cell following complaints from Thane residents about failure to land slots. Manohar Dumbre, BJP group leader in the Thane corporation, complained that locals were unable to secure registration on Co-Win while those from neighbouring cities like Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and even Panvel were easily getting slots at Thane vaccination centres. “The slots are getting booked within a jiffy and Thane residents are often left out of the process. I suspect there could be some malware or involvement of touts indulging in group bookings. I have requested the administration to investigate. The common man should not be denied the opportunity of getting vaccinated,” Dumbre told journalists. An exasperated resident said he has been unable to book a slot for his parent for days as every time he tried vaccination sessions would show as booked. Another resident, Yogita R, had a similar story to narrate. Cyber expert Unmesh Joshi said, “We feel there could be a possibility of some manipulation in the system or the coding needs to be looked into immediately.” Mayor Naresh Mhaske said the administration has streamlined the vaccination process. “The app is not controlled by the corporation and the state government has also highlighted and sought central intervention. We have announced slot opening times so that there is greater transparency in the process,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/touts-tampering-with-slots-to-deny-thane-locals-shots-bjp/articleshow/82509588.cms||Manoj Badgeri

---||Goa||Standing Up To The Might Of Sport Lisboa Benfica||For Rene Costa, this was a dream come true. You could say the same about a majority of Goan football enthusiasts. On May 7, 1960, when Sport Lisboa e Benfica, or simply Benfica, landed in Goa for three friendlies, including one against an all-Goan side, people could scarcely believe their luck. In the past, 1955 to be precise, Clube Ferroviario de Lourenco-Marques travelled here from Mozambique and four years later, there were Port Trust of Karachi. But nothing generated more interest than Benfica, already one of the great club sides of the world at the time. “This was too good to be true,” says Costa, a lifelong fan of the Portuguese club. “You could say this was a huge gift (for Goan football). We had never seen players of those standard in Goa before.” The Benfica side that landed here was largely a reserve team with a handful of internationals. They arrived on a nine-day tour that combined politics with football as pressure continued to build on Portugal to relinquish its hold over foreign lands. “Benfica played three games and won all, although I must say, this team was not as strong as everyone feared it would be,” says Honorato Velho, the tough-tackling former Panvel SC and Academica defender. “We expected them to make mincemeat of Goan opponents, but that didn’t happen. The Goan teams in fact measured up to the challenge.” The visitors started their tour with a 2-1 victory over Military Selection in Margao, thanks to goals from Mendes and Palmeiro, while substitute Alves drew level for Military. Goa were Benfica’s next opponents in Vasco and the visitors were comfortable 4-0 victors with Mendes and Espirito Santo scoring two goals each. Vasu Raiturcar was the undisputed star for the hosts with Benfica players and officials singling out the speedy forward for praise. Despite conceding four goals, goalkeeper Benzinho Fernandes also won plenty of admiration. “Benzinho was good anytime, anywhere,” recalls Velho. “Whether it was in the local league, at national championships or against foreign teams, he always showed a safe pair of hands. He was hefty, solid-built and covered the goal well.” However, it was another goalkeeper, Palmela, who emerged as the hero for Goans at the end of the tour. Benfica had it easy in their first two friendlies, but were made to sweat in the concluding game against Goa Selection, a team comprising Goan and Portuguese players who were based here and playing in the Primeira Divisao or premier division. It was Palmela’s heroics under the bar that stretched Benfica to the limit. The visitors took an early lead through Espirito Santo, and however hard they tried, could not get past the Goa goalkeeper again. With a little bit of luck, Goa Selection could have even walked away with a famous draw. The likes of Ivo, Bagorro and Arrentela, all playing upfront, kept Benfica goalkeeper Bastos busy but could not get the equaliser. “The Goan team played well. Palmela, goalkeeper of Independente, was very impressive, while players like Saturnrino, Bagorro and Arrentela also caught the eye,” says Costa. Up against opposition who were hardly trained, Benfica were always expected to do well here. It were only the Goa Selection who pushed them on the backfoot. “The football can be compared to the standard of third division in Portugal,” Benfica director Alfred Valveira told the club’s publication. “Goa Selection played tactically and more definitive football because of the preparations instilled by officials from Lisbon. The locals played more openly, without any tactics.” A year after Benfica concluded their Goa tour, the world heard more of them. In 1961, the same year Goa got liberated from 450 years of Portuguese rule, Benfica ended Real Madrid’s record run of five-in-a-row European Cups – now UEFA Champions League -- and then successfully defended their European crown a year later. In the early sixties, the tactics of Hungarian coach Bela Guttmann and the extraordinary ability of Eusebio, made Benfica the most feared team in Europe. None of them were part of the team that toured Goa, but those who did, left a big impression.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/standing-up-to-the-might-of-sl-benfica/articleshow/82509634.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

When all the requests for the past 10 days failed to evoke any response, the students took to various social media platforms and also wrote to vice-chancellor Prof AK Rai. “Results were declared on April 29, in which our entire batch was marked absent in the internal assessment. After we lodged a complaint with the administration, the results of a few students were revised, while no changes were made in the results of the remaining 35 students,” said BCom V semester student Rachna Singh. She said, “Nobody is answering our emails, text messages or calls on why we have we left out. It’s really stressful as non-addition of marks has not only reduced our percentage but also a number of students have been marked failed.” “After our complaint on April 30, results of BCom V semester was revised by adding marks of the internal assignment, but still a number of students have not been awarded internal marks in the Indian economy, even after submitting the assignment and giving a presentation to our professor Archana Singh. Similar is in case of other subjects,” said Ayush Singh, a student.

---||Mumbai||Only 27% of Maharashtra health warriors got PM insurance money: RTI||MUMBAI: Under the Prime Minister’s scheme for compensation to the family of Covid warriors — including doctors, nurses, and health workers — only 210 applications have been sent to the central government from Maharashtra, of which insurance amount has been paid only in 58 cases — that’s 27 % of the total applications sent. An RTI query by activist Jeetendra Ghadge has revealed that, district-wise, Pune sent the maximum (47) applications; BMC sent 38 even though Mumbai has seen the highest number of casualties of health staff. However, among final approvals, more Covid warriors’ families from Mumbai have got compensation than in any other district. Of 39 applications from Thane, only four have seen final compensation. The scheme has been applicable since April last year. The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package(PMGKP), an insurance scheme for healthcare workers fighting Covid-19, was initiated in March 30, 2020 to provide insurance cover of Rs 50 lakh to healthcare workers. It has been extended on April 20, 2021 for one year following the second wave. According to Ghadge Maharashtra must have many more deaths of medical staff. “IMA has stated that among around 750 deaths of doctors in the country, Maharashtrawitnessed third highest (74) deaths after Tamil Nadu (89) and West Bengal (80). However, since there are several insurance conditions to be satisfied, only a few cases have moved forward, he said. As per figures compiled on April 28, 2021, received from the Maharashtra government, a total of 210 applications were made of which 27% have been benefited so far. Even though the highest applications were made from Pune, only three cases have been approved whereas 22 cases of BMC have seen disbursement of compensation of total 38 applications, the RTI data revealed. Of eight cases applied for from Kolhapur, six received compensation. Ghadge said, “The health care staff is taking serious risk while taking care of us, but unfortunately the delay in the process for getting these claims approved is letting us down. We are not honouring their sacrifice the way we should have. Besides, only the central government scheme covers health workers while the state government covers other Covid warriors. It’s important to boost the morale of our healthcare workers by giving them financial security, I hope the government takes notice of these figures.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/only-27-of-maharashtra-health-warriors-got-pm-insurance-money-rti/articleshow/82509689.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Lucknow||Hospitals can’t charge for O2, ask kin to get cylinders||LUCKNOW: No Covid-19 hospital in Lucknow will charge fees from patients for oxygen nor force their attendants to arrange oxygen cylinders from outside. These directives were issued by officer-in-charge for Covid in Lucknow, Roshan Jacob, on Sunday. After inspecting Covid facilities in the city, Jacob told the chief medical officer that despite district administration ensuring uninterrupted oxygen supply to hospitals, it was found that some hospitals were directing the attendants of patients to arrange oxygen cylinders and even charging for oxygen being provided by the hospital. “Legal action under the Epidemic Act will be initiated against such hospitals,” she added. Jacob instructed CMO offices to ensure that all Covid hospitals follow rational management of oxygen usage and set up oxygen monitoring team and audit committee. “All Covid hospitals must aim for judicious use of oxygen therapy in individual cases. Each hospital must have a nurse and OT technician as member of oxygen monitoring team to check leakage in pipelines, shut down valves not being used for oxygen supply. For oxygen audit committee, each hospital must form a team comprising additional medical superintendent, anesthetist and nursing superintendent. The committee will review oxygen usage of hospital twice a week and will ensure preventive measures to stop unnecessary usage,” Jacob said. She also told the CMO that all hospitals, including CHC Mohanlalganj, Gudamba, Chinhat, Malihabad, Jhalkari Bai hospital (Lalbagh), TB hospital (Thakurganj), Rani Laxmi Bai hospital (Rajajipuram) and Ram Sagar Mishra hospital (Sarhamau), where oxygen plants have to be set up, should send proposal for the same to Lucknow district magistrate at the earliest. She ordered setting up of oxygen plants at those private hospitals which have not done the needful till now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hospitals-cant-charge-for-o2-ask-kin-to-get-cylinders/articleshow/82509700.cms||---
---||Goa||A nightmare every 3am: As oxygen vanishes, GMC patients gasp||PANAJI: The clock had barely crossed 3am when the bedside monitors at Goa Medical College’s wards 113 and 145 began beeping insistently. Underneath the clock, the ward’s oxygen gauge showed that the pressure in the O2 high flow central line had plummeted to 0.5psi. As Covid-19 patients started convulsing and gasping for air, their relatives raised an alarm, sent messages to volunteer groups, and even dispatched SOS messages on social media. This macabre oxygen crisis continues to play out every night at GMC, indicating that the state’s leading public hospital still faces an acute shortage of oxygen. Despite chief minister Pramod Sawant and health minister Vishwajit Rane insisting that adequate oxygen supplies are available in the state, patients and their relatives say that they have to go through a “living hell” around 3am. A source informed TOI that GMC has started rationing oxygen flow in order to ensure that the oxygen is sustained till fresh cylinder trolleys arrive. “In ward 113, it is clear that GMC has been severely rationing oxygen,” said Supriya, a volunteer who has been helping Covid-19 patients and their families access medical care and other facilities. “A patient’s SpO2 was 60% and oxygen supply was at 25%. Her desperate husband was trying to hold the oxygen mask connection together, hoping it would help.” Goa has 31,875 active cases, with an average of 2,500 new cases reported on a daily basis. The number of patients needing hospitalisation, too, has risen sharply, but doctors have been complaining of an acute shortage of oxygen and beds for nearly a month. The government continues to insist that the situation is under control, and that oxygen supplies have been augmented. “Two people have already died a short while ago. More will die,” said Supriya. GMC is the state’s largest medical facility, and is the first place where patients run to when they require medical care. Rajesh (name changed), whose mother is in ward 145, faced a harrowing time as he watched his mother struggle to breathe, ironically on Mother’s Day. His mother has a CT score of 24/25, and is hooked on to the high flow oxygen line. “My mother is in a critical condition as the pneumonia has spread in her lungs. The oxygen pressure was below 0.5 for more that 10 minutes,” said Rajesh. “This is not just once, but twice.” Sadly, oxygen concentrators are lying unused at some GMC wards, as staffers haven’t been able to figure out how to use the 110v devices with a flat pin on the Indian standard 220v round pin sockets, a nurse said. One family from ward 113 conveyed to TOI through intermediaries that their 45-year old mother has been struggling for a ventilator for the past three days, albeit unsuccessfully, and is currently dependent on the oxygen lines to survive. GMC’s wards have run out of space too, and beds and patients are being given cardboards or bedsheets to put on the ground to sleep. Desperate relatives are trying everything to sustain the lungs of their loved ones. Meanwhile, health secretary Ravi Dhawan said on Sunday that there is no shortage of oxygen in the state. “Oxygen is sufficient to meet our current demand,” he said. “Initially, Goa was allocated 11 metric tonnes by the government of India, which was enhanced to 21 metric tonnes and then to 26 metric tonnes per day. Then we have capacity within the state, where there are three suppliers.” While the superspeciality block at GMC is equipped with an oxygen tank of 20,000 litres, GMC has a smaller tank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/a-nightmare-every-3am-as-o2-vanishes-patients-gasp/articleshow/82509737.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Lucknow||Army resurrects oxygen plants gasping for breath||LUCKNOW: Playing a multifaceted role in country’s battle against coronavirus the Army is making efforts to augment medical capacity, provision of medical staff in hospitals and resuscitate oxygen production. In association with the civil administration, the Army has been swiftly repairing oxygen resources and plants which were considered beyond redemption. The progenitor of this effort was an initiative of the Central Command of the Indian Army to identify unserviceable oxygen plants in various districts, examine defects, work out the methodology and execute repairs in a race against time. In the last two weeks, 509 and 510 Army Base workshops engineers and jawans have resurrected unserviceable oxygen plants in Agra, Etawah, Bulandshahr and Saharanpur districts. According to officials, the army’s endeavour began following a request from Agra district magistrate, Prabhu Narayan Singh, in the last week of April when he sought military help in resurrecting a defunct oxygen plant in Aurangabad (Agra-Mathura border). “A technically qualified team from 509 Army Base workshop (Electronics and Mechanical Engineers Corps) in Agra carried out extensive welding and repair work and made the plant functional in 36 hours. The army was supported by IAF, which airlifted intercooler copper tube bundle and other components of the plant from Ahmedabad. By April 30, the plant started producing over 1,700 oxygen cylinders per day for government and private hospitals in Agra,” an official said. Thanking the Army for its efforts, the Agra DM said: “My sincere gratitude to station commander, Agra, Brigadier PK Singh, air officer commanding, Air Force station, Kheria, Air Commodore Surendra Kumar Verma and their team for their support to Agra administration (sic).” “With this success, a blueprint was established and several coordinated efforts were launched by 509 and 510 Army Base Workshops with the civil authorities. In a wide outreach, small and large unserviceable plants at various small towns across western UP were addressed,” a senior defence official said. Oxygen plants in Saifai (Etawah), Khurja (Bulandshahr) and Pilkhani (Saharanpur) were repaired by the first week of May which gave a fillip to oxygen production to the tune of 1100 kilo litres per day. “Each plant needed a different technical solution given their different layouts and peculiar defects. Some were so old that the manufacturers were out of business, for others, the production of spare parts was stopped and hence it had to be fabricated. The technical prowess of the army’s Corps of EMS underwent a tough examination. But they persevered and succeeded with diligence,” an official said on condition of anonymity. “In case of Agra, in an apt illustration of coordinated efforts, an IAF aircraft lifted a critical component from Ahmedabad overnight. In Saharanpur, among two non-functional plants, parts were cannibalised and one was made operational.

In a letter to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Gangwar complained that officials were not receiving phone calls and patients were forced to run from one hospital to another in the name of referrals. He urged the CM to take measures to improve healthcare infrastructure in the state and set up oxygen plants in Bareilly to meet the rise in demand for oxygen. “I have come to know that there is an oxygen shortage in Bareilly as many people have hoarded cylinders in their homes,” he said. Recently, BJP MPs Kaushal Kishore (Mohanlalganj) and Rajendra Agarwal (Meerut) had also expressed anguish over the state government’s inability to ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen and Remdesivir. BJP MLA from Mohammadi (Kheri) Lokendra Pratap Singh had written to the CM on April 7 claiming that people in his constituency were dying due to the shortage of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-mp-to-cm-improve-med-infra-o2-supply/articleshow/82509790.cms||---
---||Goa||In Covid times, volunteers shine a ray of hope||PANAJI: Over the past fortnight, Saligao-based Ashley Delaney has helped dress two bodies of Covid victims, pushed stretchers for patients, and helped those without attendants complete their admission formalities at Goa Medical College (GMC). Outside the wards, the Goa culinary club and Goa Sikh youth hand out nutritious packed meals to relatives of patients and all those in need at the hospital. In the corridors, Merces resident Brian Gonsalves has provided 100 hand-held fans to patients and relatives left there for lack of beds in the wards. These are just a few of many citizens who have decided to step out and help those most affected by the worst public health emergency in Goa’s recent history. Delaney landed in the Covid ward in early April, when several members of his family were infected and his father-in-law required admission. “As my father-in-law’s condition improved and he did not require my services through the day as an attendant, I shifted to assisting others,” he said. “During my time at the hospital from April 21, I saw that many were without caretakers, as they could not afford the Rs 3,000 or more charged for the service.” He said he could spare the time as during the pandemic, there was little work for his e-waste and computer business. He spends at least ten hours a day at GMC, and returns home at 2.30am sometimes. “There was a 40-year-old single woman left at the casualty ward on oxygen support, with no one to assist her as hospital staff are overwhelmed,” he said. “She is only one of the many patients without attendants for various reasons, in her case, for instance, both her parents are visually impaired. And so I helped get her admitted by completing the formalities. In the case of two deaths, their relatives were elderly women who were too numbed by their loss, and needed someone to help dress the bodies.” For Delaney, the occasional playtime with his children is the only thing keeping him sane through the tragedies he witnesses. Within the GMC campus, the Goa Sikh youth provide meals to all who require them. “We have set up a kitchen in Santa Cruz, and on the lines of langar, around 500 meals are prepared,” said Sukhwinder Singh. “We are trying to bring some relief to the relatives who are doing all the running around. Anyone is free to pick up the meals and water bottle from our counter outside GMC in the afternoons from 12.30pm. Relatives can also pick up extra packets to cover their dinner. The idea is that the caretakers’ health should not get affected due to the lack of nutrition. Meals are also delivered to elderly persons and others left at home without help during the pandemic. The cafe counter at GMC, managed by Laxmi Kuncolienkar, also offers ‘packets of love’, as the fellow members of her Goa culinary club have called the food portions. “The counter is open from 1pm to 3pm, and mostly attendants of Covid patients are seen benefiting from the meals, as Covid patients are already provided meals by the hospital,” she said. “But doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers or anyone who requires it are free to take away the packets. It is our small token effort to spread the cheer.” Several well-known restaurants, apart from public-spirited individuals, are part of this initiative. However, the acts of kindness provided by volunteers aren’t limited to the hospital premises. In Panaji, restaurateur Prahlad Sukhthankar has opened his kitchen to cook meals for distribution to daily wage-earners without an income during the pandemic. “Initially, I saw that my cousin in Mapusa had taken up the responsibility of providing free meals to families in home isolation, and offered to help,” he said. “I had a bigger kitchen, staff and packaging facility. We started by cooking 25 meals, which has now gone up to 150. We pledged that we will give out 1,500 complimentary meals up to May 15.” He said he first opened his kitchen to cook free meals as a way to keep his staff motivated during the pandemic. “I tell them they will receive blessings from those who receive the meals, and it helps the staff stay active,” he said. “We provide a nutritious vegetarian thali. The RSS in Panaji and individual volunteers pick up the meals and distribute them to daily wage earners and anyone else who is in need.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-covid-times-volunteers-shine-a-ray-of-hope/articleshow/82509798.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Goa||At 71.8%, Goa Covid recovery rate among lowest in country||PANAJI: Goa’s ability to manage the Covid-19 pandemic continues to be red-flagged with the state now featuring among the worst performing states when it comes to recovery of Covid-19 patients. Among states, Goa has the third lowest recovery rate after Uttarakhand and Karnataka, said the Union ministry of health and family welfare. The Union ministry also pointed out that Goa and Delhi have higher deaths per million than the national average, a fact that TOI had warned about a day earlier. Goa’s recovery rate is 71.8%, which is significantly lower than the national average of 81.9%. Uttarakhand has the lowest recovery rate among states at 66.2% followed by Karnataka at 69.8%. The states with the highest recovery rate are Tripura at 92.1% followed by Delhi (91.5%) and Arunachal Pradesh (90.1%). The Union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands has the best prognosis for Covid-19 patients with a 95.5% recovery rate, the ministry said. “The data shows that for every 100 patients in Goa, 71 recovered,” an epidemiologist said. “Goa’s active caseload is 27.9% of the confirmed cases.” On Sunday, of the 5,671 swab samples tested, the state detected 2,633 new cases of which 271 had to be hospitalised. The number of Covid-19 patients discharged from hospitals was much lower at 175 on Sunday. The state’s active caseload stands at 31,875. The state government’s handling of the pandemic has come in for intense scrutiny as despite having a small population and good health indicators, the state continues to flounder. A day earlier, TOI reported that at over 75,463 active cases, Goa’s count is almost four times the national average of 16,828, and far higher than other severely-affected places like Delhi and Kerala. “The government got complacent, declared a premature victory over Covid-19, allowed super spreader events like election rallies and exhibitions to take place and basically took its eye off the ball,” said a doctor at GMC, while explaining why Goa has failed to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. Doctors have said that Goa is going through a large-scale community transmission phase and that many Covid-19 patients are dying before they are brought to the hospital for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/at-71-8-goas-covid-recovery-rate-among-lowest-in-country/articleshow/82509827.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh CM orders vigil to check actual oxygen use in hospitals||LUCKNOW: Amid reports of shortage of oxygen supply, the state government has come across some hospitals in the state which are showing higher oxygen consumption than their average requirement. The revelation, which came to the fore on Sunday after preliminary audit of oxygen supply in the state, has prompted Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to direct the health and medical education department to keep a close watch on such hospitals and coordinate with them for regulated oxygen consumption. The audit was done by IIT-Kanpur, IIT-BHU and IIM-Lucknow. The CM also directed the officials to ensure the supply of oxygen to Covid-19 patients who are in home isolation. “Oxygen should be supplied on the basis of Covid-19 positive report or on doctor’s prescription based on symptoms,” he said. The measure will also be applicable on comorbid patients who require oxygen. The move is in contrast with the UP government’s earlier decision of making oxygen supply only to hospitals and medical institutions while restricting it to private individuals. The CM directed the officials to closely monitor oxygen supply to hospitals in all 75 districts. In the last 24 hours, the government has provided 950 metric tonnes oxygen to hospitals in the state. Of this, 571 MT was provided to oxygen refilling stations while 310 MT was given to medical colleges and hospitals. Private hospitals were provided 61 MT of oxygen, state home department officials said. Yogi also pitched for increasing the supply in the days to come. In case of districts near Lucknow and Kanpur, oxygen supply was done with the help of Oxygen Express. Likewise, reinforcement of oxygen was done in and around Saharanpur, Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad. While 40 tonnes oxygen was supplied to Varanasi, the state government is looking forward to run a special train carrying the lifesaving gas to Gorakhpur and nearby districts. “Efforts should be made for doubling of beds, medical equipment and manpower to meet the crisis. The process of increasing 1 lakh beds in L2 and L3 hospitals, which deal with complicated and critical cases, should be expedited,” the CM said. “The state government is planning to increase the number of beds, equipped with oxygen supply, by 15,000,” Yogi said. ACS (information) Navneet Sehgal said the state government would approach the Centre for supply of 1500 MT of oxygen for additional beds. The CM has also ordered that the record of demand and supply of Remdesivir injection should be maintained. For this, the DMs and CMOs have been asked to ensure that the injection is provided to patients in the presence of a doctor and a nurse. The Centre has allocated a quota of 4.95 lakh vials to UP till May 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-orders-vigil-to-check-actual-o2-use-in-hosps/articleshow/82509838.cms||---
---||Goa||Severe cases, longer recovery leading to bed shortage: Doctors||PANAJI: A large number of serious patients presenting in a short period of time have led to the bed shortage in the state. Severe cases of Covid pneumonia can require an oxygen bed for two weeks, depending on the severity while others recover within five to 10 days. This too contributes to the shortage. “It’s not like the case of a heart attack where a patient undergoing angioplasty is kept in hospital for two- three days and then discharged. This virus is unpredictable and patients can stay up to 20 days in hospital to recover,” IMA president Dr Vinayak Buvaji said. A private doctor in Margao treating Covid patients said it takes one to two weeks to get severe patients off oxygen. Once they are off oxygen they can be discharged in two days,” he said. “Bed occupancy is really bad. Each one is praying and hoping they don’t reach that stage where they require a bed. It’s turning into a parking lot. The moment one takes out their car, the next car is ready to park. But the issue is not just about increasing the beds but the requirement of manpower too,” Buvaji said. On Saturday, the ministry of health and family welfare in its national policy for admission in hospitals stated that admissions to hospital must be based on need. It also stated that beds should not be occupied by persons who do not need hospitalisation and that discharge should be strictly in accordance with revised discharge policy available. Buvaji said there are instances where patients refuse to go home after being discharged. “They fear other family members will get positive,” he said. There is also a panic factor leading to unnecessary admissions, but given the unpredictability of the disease, this is logical, healthcare worker say. The private doctor said that patients panic and want to get admitted without really being sick. “We try to discourage people who are clinically stable not to get admitted,” he said. But Buvaji said people with comorbidities getting admitted for fear their condition could worsen at home, is understandable considering how unpredictable the virus is. The private doctor said their hospital is able to treat patients by using Remdesivir more aggressively. “This is helping patients’ clinical improvement. But the virus is unpredictable. We could salvage a patient who came with 56% saturation but at the same time we lost a patient who we were sure would improve. We are seeing fast deterioration in some patients but not in all,” he said. Severe cases need a longer stay in the hospital so it’s advisable to diagnose and treat early, senior pulmonologist Dr Anil Mehndiratta said. “The lockdown should help break the chain and reduce the load,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/severe-cases-longer-recovery-leading-to-bed-shortage-docs/articleshow/82509846.cms||Lisa Monteiro

It now ranges from Rs 700-900 for Covishield manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Rs 1,250-1,500 for Covaxin manufactured by Bharat Biotech (BB). The CoWIN website shows that the bulk of private-sector vaccination right now is by four big corporate hospital groups — Apollo, Max, Fortis and Manipal. An overwhelming majority of countries are not making people pay from their own pocket for Covid vaccination. India is not only one of the few exceptions, the cost of vaccines in the private market in India is among the highest — almost $12 for getting a shot of Covishield and $17 for Covaxin. Initially, the Centre was procuring both vaccines at Rs 150 and supplying to state governments and private hospitals. The private sector was allowed to charge Rs 100 per dose as vaccination charges. Private hospitals had agreed that Rs 100 would cover the cost of administering the vaccine. However, many hospitals are effectively charging Rs 250-300 per shot of Covishield as vaccination charges. A Max hospital spokesperson told TOI that the landed price of Covishield was Rs 660-670, including GST and transportation and storage costs. There is 5-6% wastage due to breakage, and thus the cost of vaccine per inoculation is Rs 710-715, she added. “The vaccine administration charges include hand sanitiser, PPE kit for staff, biomedical waste disposal etc which comes to Rs 170-180. The net cost of Rs 900,” she said. It is not clear if the procurement price of hospitals is the same as the prices declared by the two vaccine companies. For private hospitals, Bharat Biotech had announced a price of Rs 1,200 per dose of Covaxin while SII had announced Rs 600 per dose, in both cases double the price for states. With such a huge price difference, public health activists warned of diversion of stocks to the private sector which would bring in greater profits for vaccine makers. Several state governments have been complaining that they do not have enough doses to continue the drive. Delhi, which is administering one lakh doses per day, has stock only for four to five days according to its CM. The Maharashtra health minister announced on Saturday that the SII CEO had told him the company would not be able to supply Covishield to the state till May 26. In Telangana, due to non-availability of stocks, the government is continuing the vaccination drive only for those above 45 years. Kerala too had complained that it had received just 3 lakh doses against its request for one crore doses (75 lakh Covishield and 25 lakh Covaxin doses). Smaller hospitals too are being refused when they try to place orders. Many hospitals that sought to place orders for Covishield said they had been told the company had pending orders from Centre and states and would have to channelize them first followed by orders already placed by private hospitals. The company told them it was not taking any further orders at present, they said. “The new vaccine policy had gone out of its way to ensure profiteering for a small group of hospitals. To open up vaccines for free market pricing by the private sector indicates that inequity is almost like a principle in this policy. So even within the private sector it is just a small section of corporate hospitals which are being favoured. The policy has nothing to do with universal vaccination and is in fact going to make universal vaccination more difficult,” said Dr T Sundararaman, global coordinator of the People’s Health Movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-rs700-rs1500-price-of-covid-vaccine-in-indias-private-sector-among-costliest/articleshow/82509814.cms||Rema Nagarajan

Police said the pradhan, Aslam Khan, also took out a victory procession flouting Covid-19 guidelines. An FIR was lodged at Thanagaon police station on Saturday following which the accused were arrested. Station house officer, Thanagaon, Anil Singh said Aslam had registered a thumping victory in the gram pradhan election for Belauta village last week. Aslam and his associates, identified as Salman, Atiq, Farid and Arif, came out on the streets to celebrate the victory. “Beating drums, Aslam and his supporters moved around shouting anti-India slogans and uttering objectionable words while showering praises on Pakistan. The comments could have triggered a communal clash. A police team reached the spot after getting complaint from local residents,” Singh said, adding that Aslam and his supporters also flouted Covid-19 guidelines. A preliminary probe was conducted on the basis of the statements of villagers. The police also collected video footage of the rally and arrested the accused after lodging an FIR against them. “The accused have been booked on charges of committing malicious act intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or beliefs, action likely to spread disease, and under relevant sections of the Epidemic Act,” the SHO said. UP police has so far lodged 13 FIRs in connection with victory rallies taken out after the announcement of panchayat election results in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/new-pradhan-4-others-held-for-raising-anti-india-slogans/articleshow/82509880.cms||---

Sources said one of the bodies was handed over to the wrong family, leaving both distraught. Both the deceased were of similar built and had worn similar clothes. The personnel mistakenly handed over the body of a Quepem resident to the family of the other deceased from Verna. The mistake was realised only after the Quepem family came to the hospital to claim the body. The issue was resolved after the Verna family returned to the hospital with the wrong body. This is the second such case of a goof-up in identification of the deceased at the hospital. In the earlier case that occurred over a week ago, the family of the patient was intimated about his death, only to later realise that the patient was very much alive and undergoing treatment in a Covid ward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/another-body-goof-up-at-south-goa-district-hospital/articleshow/82509910.cms||---

Raut advocated the need for an alliance like Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) at the national level, hinting at a non-Congress leadership. The Sena MP said he had a discussion with NCP chief Sharad Pawar on the formation of a strong opposition alliance at the national level. Congress is a part of the MVA in Maharashtra, and Raut wants the party to be part of a new alliance to take on the Modi government at the Centre, but the alliance should not be under Congress leadership, unlike in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), which was at the Centre from 2004-14. Raut told journalists on Sunday, “The country needs a strong opposition alliance in the near future to take on BJP and Congress would be the ‘soul’ of any opposition alliance. However, Congress needs to improve their performance. As I have said earlier, the Maharashtra pattern should be implemented. MVA alliance is doing well in Maharashtra. Such type of an alliance is needed at the national level.” The Sena’s chief spokesperson also said that he had discussed the issue with Pawar on Saturday. On the leadership of the possible alliance, Raut said, “Everyone wants to become a leader. However, it should be decided in consultation with every partner. Like three different parties with different ideologies came together and formed MVA under the leadership of Uddhav Thackeray in Maharashtra; it is an ideal alliance.” In his weekly column ‘Rokhthok’ in Sena mouthpiece Saamna, Raut pointed out that TMC chief Mamata Banerjee won West Bengal, but the performance of Congress and the Left was painful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-should-be-bedrock-of-alliance-not-leadership-says-raut/articleshow/82509936.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

This way the restriction will span over 15 days. Earlier, the government had extended the restrictions till May 6 and then till May 10. The decision was taken in a high level meeting presided over by CM Yogi Adityanath on Sunday morning. Additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal said “partial curfew” has been extended to further arrest the spread of the pandemic. He said essential services, including vaccination, industrial activity and medical related services, will continue to operate. Sehgal said the number of active cases has come down because of the curfew. The state health bulletin showed that the number of active cases came down from 2,45,736 on Saturday to 2,33,981 on Sunday. In fact, the active cases in UP have registered a decline of 77,000 since April 30. The government also directed the closure of educational institutes till May 20. Even the online classes should not be organised during this period, the state government said in a statement. On April 13, the Allahabad high court had directed the UP government to impose lockdown in districts with high caseload. On April 13, the Allahabad high court had directed the UP government to impose lockdown in districts with high caseload. The bench comprising Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar had noted that the night curfews were a very small step to check the Corona spread. The court had directed the government to ensure that there was no unnecessary public movement even during day timing. The HC had fixed the next date of hearing on April 19 but the government moved the Supreme Court which stayed the HC order. The government had maintained that it has already taken several steps to prevent the spread of infection. The number of coronavirus cases had peaked to 3,80,55 on April 24, leaving the state government in a tailspin and forcing it to consider taking strict restrictive measures including extending partial corona curfew. The move helped the state government to bring down the number of Covid cases to 23,333 cases by Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/curfew-in-up-extended-till-may-17-to-further-tame-covid/articleshow/82509944.cms||Pankaj Shah

If one takes that number as a base, the cumulative cases of the district have reached 2.8% of the population at 2.03 lakh on Sunday – meaning three out of every 100 persons either got infected by Covid earlier or is currently undergoing treatment. The ratio is much higher than the 1.1% for Gujarat at large. The district on Saturday crossed 2 lakh cumulative cases, becoming the 14th Indian district to cross that mark. According to analysis, the district accounts for 30% of the state’s cumulative cases and 37% of the state’s Covid mortality. “There are multiple factors that made the city an epicentre of the pandemic. The first and foremost is its population and overall congestion. Second is higher movement at all levels – from international travels to inter-state and inter-district travels,” said a city-based expert. “Higher load of the cases from the start has resulted in many pioneering practices here which were later emulated in other parts of the state.” Gujarat on Sunday recorded its lowest daily tally in 21 days at 11,084. It was also fourth consecutive day for the state to record higher discharges compared to the new cases – at 14,770, the state recorded its highest ever daily discharges on Sunday, reducing active cases by 3,686.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3-of-every-100-persons-in-abad-dist-experienced-covid/articleshow/82509926.cms||---

The vaccination will take place from 9am to 5pm in cabins in the oratory and social distancing will be maintained, he said. Around 500 chairs have been put in place for people in the waiting area as well as in the basketball court in the observation area where people have to wait for half an hour after the vaccination. “Here there is parking space and separate entrances,” Monserrate said, adding that people must use the back entrance and exit from the pani puri stalls gate. The front gate will be closed. Testing will continue at the Panjim urban health centre.

Of the total, 517 were infected till February, whereas during the current wave, about 203 have got infected, they added. Dr Rajesh Solanki, who got retired during the pandemic, chose to continue his duty as officer on special duty (OSD). “When he got infected in the second wave, he continued tele-counselling for Covid patients,” said a senior official. “Likewise, Dr Chirag Patel got infected during his duty at triage area, directly dealing with the Covid patients. He spent several days in ICU, battling for life. He has again resumed work.” Dr J P Modi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, said that irrespective of the weather, these Covid warriors are seen donning PPE kits and putting in more hours than their shifts to ensure that maximum patients get treated of the deadly virus. “None of them have enjoyed any festivities in past one year, and have also stayed away from their families. Our appeal to all is to remain utmost careful and prevent spread of the virus with Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Dr Modi, who had contracted Covid last year. According to city-based experts, across the government and private-run hospitals, the number of infected HCWs was high last year. “But this time around, the infection is comparatively lower and mortality is very low – which could be attributed to vaccination and better precautions coupled with SOPs for HCWs,” said a senior hospital administrator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/720-civil-warriors-who-got-infected-resumed-duty/articleshow/82509985.cms||---

Dedicating four oxygen plants in Vadodara district through video-conferencing, Rupani said that the discharge rate of Covid patients is increasing while the positivity rate is reducing. “We have created a situation where no patient has to lose his or her life because of a shortage of oxygen,” he said. “We have been providing an uninterrupted supply of oxygen to hospitals.” Rupani also visited community Covid care centres set up under the state-wide ‘Maru Gaam, Corona Mukt Gaam’ campaign, at Chekhla village in Sanand taluka in Ahmedabad district. In a message to the state delivered while speaking with the villagers at the common meeting place, he said the second wave is much more severe, fast spreading, and fatal. He said that it often affects entire families. There is a need to be all the more alert, he said. Talking to media persons, he said that at present 1.40 lakh tests are being carried out daily in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-will-be-1st-to-exit-2nd-wave/articleshow/82510036.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Why people are as important as places||AHMEDABAD: As one thinks about Paris, the first thing that comes to mind is the Eiffel Tower, the imposing Colosseum beckons visitors in Rome and the Opera House is synonymous with Sydney’s identity internationally. It would be four years for the city to have received the coveted UNESCO World Heritage City tag – the first in India – in 2021. But has the city been successful in branding itself? What would it take for the city to get that identity? A paper by MICA faculties delved into these questions and argued that the flow of process must be bi-directional – it must not only be pushed by the authorities, but also be accepted and adopted by local stakeholders including residents. The paper ‘Introducing bi-directional participatory place branding: a theoretical model with multi-stakeholder perspectives’ by Varsha Jain, Preeti Shroff, and Subhalakshmi Bezbaruah from MICA and Altaf Merchant from University of Washington Tacoma from The US got published in the Journal of Product & Brand Management recently. “Place branding is becoming increasingly important for collective heritage brand strategy as the stakeholders create an aura of a geographic location. It’s not just about marketing, but also a conscious effort by the stakeholders to make the city or spot unique,” said Prof Jain. “We thus proposed bi-directional participatory place branding.” The team interviewed residents and stakeholders in the Walled City and found that heritage has as much as an intangible aspect (life stories, experiences, feelings and aspirations) as the tangible aspects (buildings, monuments, etc.) that can make the residents brand ambassadors of local heritage. The researchers argued that this potential has remained untapped in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/why-people-are-as-important-as-places/articleshow/82510034.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat high court moved over mucormycosis cure in public hospitals||AHMEDABAD: Congress MLA Gyasuddin Shaikh approach the Gujarat high court on Saturday and sought directions to the state government to treat patients suffering from mucormycosis and other fungal infections in Covid-19 patients in public hospitals. Shaikh urged the court to ask the government not to force discharge of Covid patients, who are suffering complication due to mucormycosis post Covid-19 treatment. The day Shaikh filed the petition in the HC, chief minister Vijay Rupani announced that each government hospital will have a separate ward for treatment of patients suffering from mucormycosis. He has based his application on media reports including TOI articles about the tsunami of mucormycosis among those who recovered from Covid-19. In his petition filed through advocate Anand Yagnik requesting the HC to allow him to join litigation in suo motu PIL on Covid-19, Shaikh has cited increasing number of cases of fungal infections in patients after they are successfully treated for Covid-19. But being extremely short of beds, the government hospitals compel the patients to leave the hospitals and are given involuntary or forceful discharge even though they are suffering from mucormycosis. He claimed that such patients are not treated for mucormycosis and asked to get treatment in concerned hospitals. Shaikh has submitted that the Civil Hospital and SVP Hospital have discharged such patients compulsorily with prescription that they are suffering from mucormycosis and should get treatment. The reason given orally to these patients was that the hospitals do not have infectious disease experts and the medicines are very expensive and unavailable in the hospitals. Refusing treatment for mucormycosis in public hospitals on any pretext is unconstitutional. It is also illegal and unlawful in view of notifications issued under the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act, the petition claimed. The petitioner further claimed that as a result of refusal to treat mucormycosis in public hospitals, ENT doctors in private hospitals take undue advantage of the situation. The petition is likely to be taken up for hearing on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-moved-over-mucormycosis-cure-in-public-hospitals/articleshow/82510045.cms||---

After visiting the step-up hospital at Shyama Prasad Mukherjee stadium, Bambolim, the CM said that some Covid patients from Goa Medical College (GMC) would be shifted here. Sawant criticised the public for crowding at markets after his curfew declaration, as if everything would be closed. He also hit out at the opposition. “Instead of criticising the government, they should advise people on how to control Covid,” he said. Sawant said that he has directed health officers to provide medicines in case of an oximeter shortage. “People should start medication immediately,” he said. “I have found that even after the oxygen level drops, people are not ready to shift till they get a private bed, and when there is a complication, they are shifted to hospital, and the government is held responsible.” He also urged Covid-positive patients to get admitted to hospital as soon as possible. “People should proudly say that they are Covid positive, there is no stigma attached to it,” he said. Meanwhile, the state has started recruitment of doctors, both medical (MBBS) and Ayush. “We will give them preference when we recruit in government hospitals,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-if-people-cooperate-deaths-will-drop-in-8-days/articleshow/82509027.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: IAF delivers 200 oxygen concentrators||Panaji: The state’s ability to provide precious oxygen to Covid-19 patients got a boost after the Centre delivered 200 oxygen concentrators for Goa on Sunday. The concentrators were flown in from Delhi on an Indian Air Force An-32 military transport aircraft and then handed over to the directorate of health services (DHS). DHS sources said that a significant number of oxygen concentrators will be given to Goa Medical College, while the remaining will be distributed among the other government-run hospitals. “I thank the Union government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for providing the state 200 oxygen concentrators, which were delivered to us today by the IAF aircraft,” chief minister Pramod Sawant tweeted. The IAF is operating a Covid Air Support Management Cell (CASMC) at Palam Air Base, Delhi, where international aid is gathered and then allocated to various states. The primary task of the CASMC is to efficiently coordinate the distribution of all the Covid relief material coming in from foreign countries. The twin-engine turbo prop aircraft arrived at the Goa International Airport around noon and Indian Naval personnel helped unload the cargo. The cargo was quickly loaded onto a vehicle sent by the DHS and delivered to the department. “We were facilitators and coordinators between different stakeholders, like the Indian Navy, DHS, particularly for entry coordination, aircraft arrival, while DHS dealt with material handling,” said Goa Airport director Gagan Malik. A senior official at GMC said that the hospital requires at least 100 oxygen concentrators to bridge the gap between oxygen demand and oxygen supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/iaf-delivers-200-oxygen-concentrators/articleshow/82510054.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Oxygen levels of Azam Khan, son drop, shifted to Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan and his son Abdullah were shifted from Sitapur jail to Medanta Hospital in Lucknow for Covid treatment on Sunday evening. Reports said the decision was taken after their medical condition started deteriorating on Sunday morning. The duo had tes positive on May 1. DG prisons, Anand Kumar, said a panel of doctors formed by Sitapur CMO examined the Rampur MP and his son on Sunday after they complained of fever and coughing. The doctors told the jail officials that the oxygen levels of Azam and Abdullah were dropping rapidly and recommended shifting them to an L-3 hospital. Since there is no L3 hospital in Sitapur, senior administrative officials decided to shift them to Lucknow in an advanced life support ambulance. The ambulance carrying Azam and Abdullah was escorted by police personnel led by SDM, Sitapur Sadar, Amit Bhatt. The medical bulletin issued by the critical care team of Medanta Hospital in Lucknow stated that Azam Khan has moderate infection of corona, and is being kept under observation of doctors with 4 litres of oxygen and other treatments. The bulletin also stated that condition of Abdullah Khan was stable and satisfactory and he is also kept under the supervision of doctors. Azam and Abdullah have been lodged in Sitapur jail since February 2020 in connection with several criminal cases. They are among 15 inmates of Sitapur jail who have tested Covid positive. The 13 inmates were isolated in their barracks and their condition is improving. Prison officials said 1,11,882 convicts and undertrials are lodged in jails across the state and 1,722 active cases were detected on Saturday. “Covid cases in prisons are relatively low in prisons due to strict adherence of pandemic protocols and non-stop monitoring,” said a senior jail official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/o2-levels-of-azam-son-drop-shifted-to-city/articleshow/82510106.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Rumours can get you trapped in human rights violations’||Viral pleas urging people to adopt children orphaned by Covid could be rumours but, most definitely, illegal. In a bid to alert people against the perils of such pleas, Tannistha Datta, child protection specialist with Unicef India said, “Adoption is a legal issue, not something for WhatsApp groups to deal with. There are serious risks here of trafficking and malintention. Datta’s fears weren’t unfounded. “Something didn’t seem right about the age difference between the kids if they were siblings,” said Vijay Doiphode, chairperson, Child Welfare Committee (CWC), Mumbai, who tried calling the number several times. “It rang out. We’re not sure of the genuineness of the case. A lot of rumours are coming our way.” “And if people fall for these rumours, they too can be trapped in human rights violation,” warned Vasudeva Sharma, former chairman of CWC and nodal director for Childline, Bangaluru. Under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, offering or receiving children outside the legal processes as well as their sale and purchase are acts punishable with three to five years in jail or Rs 1 lakh in fine. Alarmed by the messages, the Ministry of Women and Child Development issued an advisory on April 30 to all states and UTs on “immediate measures” to secure “children recently orphaned or abandoned by Covid”. While it has urged individuals and organisations to share any such information on Childline and mandated these children to be produced before the CWC within 24 hours “to ascertain their needs”, the ministry also passed a fresh order this week directing hospitals and Covid care facilities to seek contact details of the person to whom the children should be handed over. Although the scale of instances is still small, anecdotal evidence from organisations working with children at risk suggest that the second wave has made orphans of an unknown number of kids. “Non-profits in Bengaluru did not report any incidents in the first wave. Now, in the last one week, we’ve received four such cases, where parents have either died or are hospitalised and the child is almost abandoned,” said Sharma. Save the Children, a child rights organisation, recorded two cases last week — one in Delhi where a pair of siblings aged 17 and 15 were left alone for days after their mother, a single parent, and their grandmother who they lived with, died of the disease — and another in Bengal’s Birbhum district, where a 16-year-old girl was orphaned after her widowed mother succumbed to the disease. “In case of the Delhi children, their maternal grandmother took charge, and in Birbhum, the district child protection unit and CWC are investigating the needs of the girl currently with her maternal uncle,” informed Prabhat Kumar, deputy director — child protection in Save the Children, India.” Akancha Against Harassment, a Mumbai-based social initiative on cyber safety, claims to have recorded 13 such cases from Noida, Delhi, Nagpur and UP within 48 hours of launching a child rescue helpline to connect the children with authorities. “Most calls were about kids from nuclear families in urban metros, not tier-III towns or villages where community support is usually strong,” said Akancha Srivastava, the founder, rueing the plight of children whose extended families, out of fear of infection or not wanting additional liabilities during these times of economic distress, are refusing to come forward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rumours-can-get-you-trapped-in-human-rights-violations/articleshow/82510182.cms||Mohua Das
---||India||Covid-19: As drive slows, gap between jabs and vaccine seekers grows||MUMBAI: The gap between the number of people who register for Covid vaccines and those managing to get vaccinated is growing steadily. Even with the number of registrations declining, 2.42 crore people registered for vaccination on Co-Win in one week from May 1 to 7. The total number of registrations on Co-Win so far is over 19 crore. The number of doses being administered per day, including first and second dose, has fallen to an average of 16.6 lakh per day for the last one week (May 1 to 7) from a high of over 40 lakh in early April. At the current pace of vaccination, it would take nearly three months to vaccinate just those registered till now.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); According to a tweet of Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, 72 lakh doses are available with the states and 42 lakh doses are ready to be sent to the states in the next three days. Put together that is 1.14 crore doses, not even enough to cover 50% of those who registered in the last week. Read AlsoOnly 36,000 Covaxin doses for Maharashtra; Mumbai’s turnout dips by 67%Maharashtra received a meagre 36,000 doses of Covaxin on Sunday despite the health department writing to the Centre that around 5.5 lakh people are awaiting their second dose. The state also got 7.03 lakh doses of Covishield that could help sustain the drive for just three more days.The total population eligible for vaccination when it was limited to healthcare and frontline workers and those above 45 was about 34 crore. Barely a third of that population had been vaccinated when the Centre threw it open to the 18-44 age group on May 1, adding 60 crore people to the target population. At the current rate of vaccination — less than 17 lakh a day — the 170-crore remaining doses needed to fully cover the entire 94-crore adult population would take about 1,000 days — or close to three years. Read AlsoThe problem with India’s vaccination driveThe pace: The total number of registrations on Co-Win so far is 19 crore. The number of doses being administered per day, including first and second dose, has fallen to an average of 16.6 lakh per day for the last one week (May 1 to 7) from a high of over 40 lakh in early April. At the current paceOn a weekday, close to 60,000 sites conduct the vaccination across India, and less than 3,000 of them are private sites, most of which are located in big cities. Thus, the burden of vac cinating the rural population is mostly on respective state governments, which have had to shut down vaccination centres for lack of vaccine supply. It is no different even in cities — with state after state reporting shortages and vaccination centres being forced to shut at least temporarily or to carry out ‘token drives’.

Payal Kanodia, trustee of M3M Foundation, said the facility is equipped with oxygen concentrators for each bed and will offer a 24x7 ambulance service with oxygen support. She said it can be used to admit patients with mild or moderate symptoms and those who need oxygen support under medical supervision. Kanodia claimed the facility — set up in One Key Resiments, a condominium the company is developing — will be managed and run by Indian Air Force, while infrastructure and other services like oxygen concentrators and meals will be managed by the foundation. The IAF refused to comment. The company said it has also tied up with private hospitals so that patients can be shifted there in case their condition worsens. Deputy commissioner Yash Garg said, “We welcome such efforts if companies and voluntary organisations are coming forward to help fight the pandemic. We are already working to increase oxygen supply and oxygen concentrators, after which we can increase the number of beds for Covid patients with the help of private companies who have assured support.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/now-a-150-bed-covid-facility-in-sector-67/articleshow/82510240.cms||---

Haryana CHI, which will be accessible only to healthcare workers and home isolation teams, will record patients’ details like address and vitals like temperature, oxygen level, comorbidities, family members, and vaccination status. The app will also indicate if a patient is asymptomatic, mild, moderate or severe. This is a very ambitious project for Haryana as it has more than one lakh Covid patients in home isolation at present, of which 35% are in Gurugram. The city has 42 home isolation teams with two members each. “We received the user ID and password for the app from the state government on Sunday. We will be working on it from Monday,” said Dr Isha Narang, deputy civil surgeon, Gurugram. “A member of the home isolation team will upload data of a patient showing Covid symptoms, and the app will determine if he/she can be put on home isolation or hospitalisation is required. Earlier, the data was recorded on Google Sheets,” she added. Health workers will also upload details of the family members of Covid patients who are in home isolation on the app. “This will be an extensive exercise in which we can check if the teams are visiting patients regularly,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. Home isolation kits worth Rs 80 lakh to be distributedGurugram will distribute around 1,600 kits with medicines and other equipment required for Covid patients under home isolation.  The kit will contain 15 items, including masks, medicines, digital thermometer, steamer and pulse oximeter, among others. Each kit is worth Rs 5,000 and will be provided free of cost to those in home isolation. For the project, Gurugram will receive Rs 80 lakh under the National Health Mission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/app-to-monitor-covid-patients-at-home/articleshow/82510253.cms||Ipsita Pati

Recently, a woman from Baina was rushed to the hospital in the evening, but died immediately. Since the family could not arrange for a burial at night, they came to pick-up the body the next morning. Meanwhile, as per Covid protocol, a separate room had to be identified to preserve the body till it was collected. Hospital sources said, “We had a mortuary in the old building which was supposed to be renovated. But since the inception of the new premises, that work has not been taken up and the file is pending with the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation.

After nine days of trying to register for the jabs in the city, the residents say, they decided to book slots in Delhi. “I vaccinated in Delhi today. Many of my friends and family members have also booked their appointments in Delhi. Everybody I know seems to be going there to get vaccinated. It is easier and better managed than Gurugram,” said Manoj Kumar, a Sector 30 resident. Sanjay Gulati, a Sector 89 resident, said, “We need more vaccines and session sites in Gurugram. Since a small number of private hospitals are carrying out the drive, the government centres cannot give the shots to all in such a short time. I took my vaccine in Delhi as getting a slot was easier. The city has many session sites.” An official from the health department, said: “We have an erratic supply of Covid vaccines. Thus, we cannot increase the session sites.” As per the new guidelines, the private hospitals from May 1 were supposed to procure their vaccine directly from the manufacturers. However, they are unable to get their stocks. At present, Gurugram is carrying out vaccinations for people in the 45-plus category at 41 session sites. Also, 37 sites are being set up for people in the 18-44 age group. These session sites are in government facilities and only two private hospitals — Max and Fortis — are carrying out the vaccination drive. On Sunday, a total of 7,727 recipients in the 18-plus category took their first dose in the city. As many as 4,630 people in the 45-plus category got vaccinated.

According to procurement figures of Food Corporation of India (FCI), till Saturday the overall procurement of wheat stood at 335 lakh tonnes compared to 237 lakh tonnes during the corresponding period last year, an increase of 41%. The data show that while the government had set the target to procure 80 lakh tonnes of wheat, the total procurement till Saturday was around 81 lakh tonnes. In the case of Punjab, the total procurement so far stands at 128 lakh tonnes against the target of 130 lakh tonnes. However, the procurement in Madhya Pradesh has been hovering around 94 lakh tonnes compared to the target of 135 lakh tonnes. During this year the estimated total procurement of wheat is 427 during the RMS and last year the total procurement was 390 lakh tonnes. Officials said they are confident of meeting the target during this season.

The complainant, The Car Pavillion Private Limited, has said that the accused, identified as Shivam Singh, and his firm either hacked their bank account or colluded with an employee of their own company for embezzlement of funds. A copy of the FIR said that the complainant company has a bank account with ICICI Bank and had availed the facility of e-banking services whereby the ICICI bank allows its customers to carry out transactions over various channels of communications like the internet, but not limited to funds transfer facility by giving payment instructions, whether through electronic clearing service or otherwise. “The company as per the internal practice had given the user ID and password to a limited number of employees and certain other authorised persons. They are not only responsible but also accountable for managing banking transactions and transfer of funds as per instructions and requirement and the company considers them a secondary accused,” the complaint read. “On April 8, the secondary accused made 16 illegal transactions of Rs 2.5 lakh each totalling to Rs 4 crore and the money was deposited into Shivam’s account. However, the company is unable to identify the secondary accused,” a police officer said. An FIR has been filed at the cybercrime branch under Section 420 (cheating) of the IPC and sections 66 and 66D of the IT Act. “We have formed a team to investigate the case and an FIR has been registered,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/one-booked-for-siphoning-off-rs-4-crore-from-private-firm/articleshow/82510384.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Fresh batches of oxygen cylinders arrive in Kolkata, bring whiff of hope in midst of crisis||Kolkata: Fresh lots of oxygen cylinders — which are currently hard to find in Kolkata — have started to arrive in the city in small batches, sparking hope of a possible solution to the medical oxygen crisis in the midst of the pandemic’s second wave. On Sunday evening, a batch of 15 cylinders reached the city on an Air Force special mission flight from Bhubaneswar. This supplements another batch of 75 cylinders that reached the city last Friday — on a similar flight, from Ranchi — along with a stock of oxygen concentrators. According to a senior airport official, the consignments were loaded on to state health department trucks, from where they were taken to Swasthya Bhawan in Salt Lake. The shortage in Bengal is not of the gas itself, but of proper cylinders to store it in for medical use, which TOI has highlighted in a series of articles in the last three weeks. The crisis has been so acute that pharmacists and volunteers were calling up old customers and issuing pleas on social media, asking people to return empty cylinders that they may have stocked at home. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had also written to PM Narendra Modi, raising her concerns about oxygen availability, where she informed him that the oxygen requirement in Bengal had gone up to 470MT per day between last Thursday and Friday because of the rising caseload, and this was expected to increase to 550MT per day shortly. “The consignment of cylinders (Friday’s) was the first to arrive in recent times after the cylinder crisis in the state. It arrived in an IAF plane and was delivered to the state health department. From the airport, they took the shipments to Swasthya Bhawan,” said a senior airport official. TOI tried speaking to multiple health officials in the state on the exact status of the oxygen cylinders’ availability with the state and the arrival of future consignments, but there was no formal response. A health department official said that the central family welfare stores in Bagbazar — the largest storehouse of Covid vaccines in the city — has been slated as the storage hub for oxygen cylinders as well, but the official was not aware of the exact number of cylinders in the pipeline that may arrive in the city in the next few days. Along with the cylinders, fresh stocks of oxygen concentrators too have been brought to the city — a total of 1,029 boxes between April 30 and last Friday. On Sunday, 9,600 oxygen concentrators were transported from Beijing, Wuhan, Nanjing and Hong Kong to Kolkata and Delhi. Meanwhile, a number of private medical gas equipment agencies in Kolkata said they had booked hundreds of fresh cylinders that are being imported from China in phases but added they were unlikely to get it directly and sell it to retailers like they used to. “As the state government has notified against hoarding and stocking of cylinders, all new consignments can reach city wholesalers after a clearance from the state administration. There are no cylinder manufacturers in the country. The cylinders are imported from China and Hong Kong and are only assembled here by some private companies in Maharashtra and Gujarat, from where other wholesalers in different states procure them. At present, a number of private agencies have placed orders for new cylinders but they are unlikely to get fresh stocks by themselves any sooner,” said Swapan Panda, a medical oxygen wholesaler in Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fresh-batches-of-o2-cylinders-arrive-in-city-bring-whiff-of-hope-in-midst-of-crisis/articleshow/82510456.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Waive GST on Covid medicines, equipment: CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a GST and customs duty waiver on medical equipment, medicines and oxygen, required to combat Covid 19. “I look forward to your kind consideration and co-operation in this critical matter,” Banerjee wrote to the PM on Sunday, pointing out that a large number of organisations, individuals and agencies had donated various things — oxygen concentrators, cylinders, cryogenic storage tanks, tankers and tank containers and Covid-related drugs — to help fight the pandemic. The chief minister felt the donations would greatly supplement the state government’s efforts in meeting the huge gap between demand and supply. “However, many of the donors and agencies have approached the state government to consider exemption of these items from customs duty, IGST, CGST and SGST,” she wrote. GST on various items that are now being used to treat Covid varies between 5% and 12%. Earlier, the IGST (integrated GST) on imported oxygen concentrators was as high as 28%; this has been brought down to 12% recently, although there is a perception that this, too, is high, considering the enormity of the pandemic situation. There is even a nominal GST on Covid vaccines. Banerjee wrote that she was requesting the PM because the GST rate structure was under the purview of the Centre, adding it would “help remove supply constraints” and “life-saving drugs and equipment and contribute towards effective management of the Covid pandemic”. She pointed out that GST and duty waiver was a critical factor in augmenting the medical system — including infrastructure, equipment, medicine and oxygen — due to the spike in Covid cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/waive-gst-on-covid-meds-equipment-cm/articleshow/82510483.cms||---
---||India||Assam: Himanta Biswa Sarma’s report card of 5 years may have landed him top job||GUWAHATI: Why did BJP’s central leadership pick Himanta Biswa Sarma as Assam’s next CM over incumbent Sarbananda Sonowal? While there might never be an official answer, the consensus opinion is that Sarma's performance over the last five years — in government and politics — was seen as enough reason to plump for him despite his predecessor’s popularity and clean image. Within BJP ranks, many were swayed by Sarma’s style of functioning that conveyed an ability to get the work done, be it articulating the party’s stand on contentious issues like CAA and NRC or tapping into local sentiments by pitching Congress’ alliance with Badruddin Ajmal’s AIUDF as a threat to Assamese identity. His refrain throughout his campaign was that the electoral battle was between the miyas (migrant Muslims), allegedly comprising 35% of the state’s population, and the natives. When it comes to troubleshooting for the NDA, in Assam as well as elsewhere in the northeast, Sarma’s talent for successful gambles is well known. In the Bodoland Ter ritorial Council elections last December, he persuaded the BJP leadership to dump old ally Bodoland People’s Front and get the fledgling United People’s Party Liberal on board. The new combination went on to form the council. Holding key ministries, Sarma is also credited with rolling out a series of development and welfare programmes, including the popular Arunodaya scheme that provides Rs 8,000 each annually to unemployed women. As finance minister, Sarma earned Assam the distinction of being the first state to roll out the GST regime. Many believe Sarma’s closeness to Union home minister Amit Shah tipped the scales in his favour. The leadership could not have been unaware that Sarma, who had chafed at being consigned to the No.2 slot through the five-year-term, was getting impatient about securing what he, as well as many others in the party, considered to be his “rightful due”. A source close to Sonowal said when the proposal for him to step down came, he didn’t hesitate for a moment. “Sonowal declined some posts that were offered to him in lieu of the chief ministership. But if Narendra Modi wants to take him somewhere, he will never say no to him,” a source said. Sonowal has publicly acknowledged Sarma as his most efficient minister, entrusting him with key portfolios.

---||Kolkata||Bengal violence: Fake posts from Brazil, Bangladesh flood social media||KOLKATA: Cops in Bengal have deleted more than 500 fake posts of “post-poll violence in Bengal” and “Hindu genocide in Bengal” in the last 96 hours but the numbers are just one indicator of the enormity of the problem. The fakes have become much more “international”: among images sought to be passed off as “Bengal violence images” are old photos from Brazil, Venezuela and Bangladesh. On Sunday, the CID tweeted a video link where a verified user — Chaudhary Amit Singh — claimed a man was beaten and assaulted with sticks and stones. Two of the posts that the cops have identified as fakeThe video had originated from Brazil, and is at least three years old, the CID said. Also, a 2018 video from Venezuela has been shared on social media as a political worker being lynched in Bengal in post-poll violence by “TMC goons”. Kolkata Police has flagged a Bangladeshi video that was being passed off as an attack on a polling agent in Bengal. After this, half a dozen videos have surfaced with morphed images from incidents which took place in Bangladesh, sources said. Since May 5, when police units across the state began monitoring fake news, the number of fake videos under surveillance is stated to be in the hundreds. The CID has contacted social media companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter and have taken down close to 300 posts and accounts. The Kolkata Police claimed on Sunday that it had flagged and removed 200 others. Investigators say there has been special emphasis on a few districts, from where the volumes are higher. The state police have lodged five FIRs in Cooch Behar alone. Four people have been arrested. Another arrest took place at Howrah. TOI had reported that CID had arrested two persons from Deganga and Sonarpur earlier. CID sources said most of the rehashed old incidents are those that were reported from UP, Bihar and Odisha. “We have lodged five separate FIRs at Cooch Behar and arrested four persons for sharing fake news that was promoting enmity. We have decided to have no tolerance for anyone sharing fake and unverified news and WhatsApp forwards. All cyber units have been asked to be vigilant and cross-check everything on the internet and issue rejoinders on our police social media pages,” said a top cop at Nabanna. ADG (law and order) Jawed Shamim has urged people to be vigilant against fake or unverified news. In Kolkata, police have now lodged four FIRs — the last on Sunday by Shyampukur police station — for sharing fake news that can disturb peace in the city. The cops have slapped Section 153(A) (promoting enmity between different groups), apart from sections dealing with cheating and under the IT Act. Joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma said the cyber cell was treating each post seriously. “We have already issued six notices for the profile owners to come and contact us. If they fail to do so, we will initiate legal action,” said Sharma. Cyber law expert and special prosecutor Bivas Chatterjee said organized fake news had witnessed a huge spurt in the last one week. “This is the ugly face of social media. Recently, the government came out with a rule, which we are referring to as Information Technology Rules 2021. It has stringent rules on the ethics and the legality of various posts and the liability of various intermediaries. The person posting these objectionable contents can be booked for various non-bailable penal provisions, including the IPC,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-violence-fake-posts-from-brazil-bdesh-flood-social-media/articleshow/82510582.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Covid leaving kids orphaned, but viral adoption pleas are illegal||In the midst of cries for oxygen and emergency drugs on social media, a desperate appeal that stopped people in their thumb scrolling tracks a fortnight ago was a message urging families to adopt two girls—one aged three days and another six months—with the claim that they had lost their parents to Covid. “Please help these kids get a new life, spread the word,” urged the post that quickly went viral. Several such emotional pleas for adoption of children orphaned by the virus have surfaced over the past few days. And though these forwards may be well intentioned, the request is unlawful and could even put a child in danger of being sold or trafficked. “Stop. This is illegal. Adoption requires a due process and is the last option after all other care options to have children rehabilitated within their families are exhausted,” wrote Tannistha Datta, child protection specialist with Unicef India, trying to alert people. “Adoption is a legal issue, not something for WhatsApp groups to deal with. There are serious risks here of trafficking and malintention." Datta’s fears weren’t unfounded. “Something didn’t seem right about the age difference between the kids if they were siblings,” said Vijay Doiphode, chairperson, Child Welfare Committee (CWC), Mumbai, who tried calling the number several times. “It rang out. We’re not sure of the genuineness of the case. A lot of rumours are coming our way.” “And if people fall for these rumours, they too can be trapped in human rights violation,” warned Vasudeva Sharma, former chairman of CWC and nodal director for Childline, Bangaluru. Under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, offering or receiving children outside the legal processes as well as their sale and purchase are acts punishable with three to five years in jail or Rs 1 lakh in fine. Alarmed by the messages, the Ministry of Women and Child Development issued an advisory on April 30 to all states and UTs on “immediate measures” to secure “children recently orphaned or abandoned by Covid”. While it has urged individuals and organisations to share any such information on Childline and mandated these children to be produced before the CWC within 24 hours “to ascertain their needs”, the ministry also passed a fresh order this week directing hospitals and Covid care facilities to seek contact details of the person to whom the children should be handed over, in case of any eventuality. Although the scale of instances is still small and data limited on what could be “a potential aftermath” of the pandemic, anecdotal evidence from organisations working with children at risk suggest that the second wave of the pandemic has made orphans of an unknown number of kids. “Non-profits in Bengaluru that had grouped together last year to keep an eye on children orphaned or who ran away from family did not report any incidents in the first wave. Now, in the last one week, we’ve received four such cases, where parents have either died or are hospitalised and the child is almost abandoned,” said Sharma. Save the Children, a child rights organisation, recorded two cases last week — one in Delhi where a pair of siblings aged 17 and 15 were left alone for days after their mother, a single parent, and their grandmother who they lived with, died of the disease — and another in Bengal’s Birbhum district, where a 16-year-old girl was orphaned after her widowed mother succumbed to the disease. “In case of the Delhi children, their maternal grandmother took charge, and in Birbhum, the district child protection unit and CWC are investigating the needs of the girl currently with her maternal uncle,” informed Prabhat Kumar, deputy director — child protection in Save the Children, India, that recorded an escalation in such calls since April-end with requests for “food, a safe shelter and medicines once the parents have tested Covid positive and the child is stuck alone in the house. There have also been requests for help with transport to help these children reach their relatives’ house.” Akancha Against Harassment, a Mumbai-based social initiative on cyber safety, claims to have recorded 13 such cases from Noida, Delhi, Nagpur and UP within 48 hours of launching a child rescue helpline to connect the children with authorities. “Most calls were about kids from nuclear families in urban metros, not tier-III towns or villages where community support is usually strong,” said Akancha Srivastava, the founder, rueing the plight of children whose extended families, out of fear of infection or not wanting additional liabilities during these times of economic distress, are refusing to come forward. “Relatives of a 13-year-old girl and a 10-year-old boy in UP called to inform us that they were taking care of them after their parents passed away but did not have the resources to carry forward the responsibility for much longer,” she added. While most child care organisations across the country have banded together with district child protection units, local communities in villages and resident welfare associations in urban areas to maintain vigilance, the Delhi government has identified 100 child care institutions where children orphaned by Covid can be housed. But the biggest challenge in rehabilitating young ones is their resistance to institutional care, said NGOs working with children. “After living all their life with family, suddenly being brought into an institution, can be most traumatic. So, kinship care is something that needs focus,” said Sharma, adding that some agencies were coming together to find family care for such children, which is not adoption or foster care but taking care of the child temporarily till the next measures are drawn up. “See, it’s not just about feeding or sheltering a child but taking care of a child from an emergency situation. We’re proposing alternative parental care, and around 60 adoptive parents who have already adopted one or two children have come forward to take such responsibility. We will proceed only after a nod from the directorate of child protection. But this cannot be a permanent arrangement,” said Sharma, stressing on the need for the centre to devise long-term reforms to tackle the tragic fallout for this wave of new orphans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-leaving-kids-orphaned-but-viral-adoption-pleas-are-illegal/articleshow/82510642.cms||Mohua Das
---||Kolkata||Bengal: Mix of old hands and new faces in Mamata Banerjee's 3rd cabinet||KOLKATA: The third cabinet with Mamata Banerjee as chief minister is set to be sworn in on Monday, with its 43 members comprising an almost equal mix of the seasoned and the new. While 17 senior ministers who had been in both the earlier cabinets have all found a place the third time around, 16 are set to be first-time ministers. Amit Mitra, who did not contest the Bengal polls, returns to the state cabinet. Manas Bhunia, Pulak Ray, Rathin Ghosh and Biplab Mitra also step into the cabinet — Ray, Ghosh and Mitra for the first time — after leading the party fightbacks in West Midnapore, Howrah and South Dinajpur. Cricketer Manoj Tiwari also gets a place in the new cabinet, as does former IPS officer Humayun Kabir. Eight women ministers will also be sworn in, with Sashi Panja the only one to get a cabinet rank. Among the eight women ministers, three — Sandhyarani Tudu, Jyotsna Mandi and Birbaha Hansda — are from Scheduled Tribe communities. Madan Mitra, a transport minister in the first Mamata Banerjee cabinet, and Tapas Roy, Tapan Dasgupta, Asima Patra, Manturam Pakhira, ministers in the second cabinet, did not get a ministerial berth. Dasgupta and Patra, both from Hooghly, have been replaced by Becharam Manna, the Singur winner (he was a minister in the first TMC cabinet but got dropped from the second), and former Lok Sabha MP Ratna De Nag. Pakhira was replaced by Bankim Hazra from South 24 Parganas, for not only developing Sagar, a Hindu pilgrimage site, but also for being a key organiser in the Gangasagar Mela, held during Covid with minimal public health worries. According to party leaders, there will not be any big surprise in portfolio-allocation. While announcing her candidate list ahead of the polls, Banerjee had made it clear that while Mitra would not contest due to health reasons, he would be in the cabinet, even suggesting the formation of a bicameral legislature in Bengal after it was done away with in 1969. Among the party leaders who have been rewarded for holding on to the organisation to lead a fightback in the face of mass defections, several anti-Suvendu Adhikari leaders have found a place in the state cabinet. This includes Ramnagar MLA Akhil Giri and Keshpur MLA Seuli Saha. Adding to the list is Srikanto Mahato from Salboni. All first-time cabinet ministers are veteran party loyalists who have always worked behind the scenes. Ray, a Chhatra Parishad leader from the early 80s, always moved along with Mamata Banerjee. An MLA from Uluberia South, he fought back defection in rural Howrah. Biplab Mitra, a trusted Mamata Banerjee lieutenant, had defected to BJP briefly in 2019 only to return and lead the party fightback in South Dinajpur. Ghosh is the third-time MLA from Madhyamgram and four-time chairman of Madhyamgram Municipality. In north Bengal, Malbazar saw a minister — Bulu Chikbaraik — after 36 years. Parimal Mitra was the last minister from Malbazar. Paresh Chandra Adhkari of Mekhliganj, who was food and civil supplies minister during the Left regime, also came back as an MoS. In Malda’s Mothabari, MLA Sabina Yasmin, who was MoS labour in 2011 as a Congress MLA, was made MoS after she defected and won.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mix-of-old-hands-and-new-faces-in-didis-3rd-cabinet/articleshow/82510656.cms||---

The team will cater not only to Orlim, but will alsohelp patients from the neighbouring villages. Speaking to TOI, Godinho said that they have identified an isolation centre in the village and one patient is already housed there. “We are accommodating patients who can take care of themselves as it is not for treatment, but only a quarantine centre,” he said. The centre is equipped with bare necessities like mattress and bedsheets. The team has also arranged for fogging machines to sanitise homes. On request, house owners will be taught to operate the fogging machine. The will also arrange a vehicle with a driver to transport Covid patients to and from hospitals and homes. Freshly cooked food will also be provided to patients who need food. Essentials will also be supplied to home-bound patients. Godinho, a member of the Dominican order, on Sunday morning went around the village making announcements urging people to stay indoors and also to use the services of the disaster management team. “This service is voluntary. It is basically to reach out to patients in need,” he said. When questioned over finance for this endeavour, he said that a lot of people have come forward to help. “I have received calls from well wishers extending monetary support. If need be, I will get in touch,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/volunteers-help-covid-patients-at-orlim/articleshow/82510699.cms||---

---||Mumbai||In a first, IIT-Bombay to offer healthcare info course||MUMBAI: When the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB), opens its gates, even if virtually, to the fresh batch of students this August, healthcare informatics will be one of its new offerings. The institute’s foray into healthcare will be a coming together of core sciences—maths, medicine and computer science. It will be offered as an interdisciplinary dual degree programme as well as a minor programme. The course will bring together expertise from computer science, bioinformatics, statistics, AIML (artificial intelligence & machine learning) and medical science. The programme will address teaching and research on a wide spectrum of topics. The course will include subjects like clinical data management, healthcare standards and ethics, modelling and data efficient machine learning, to name a few. “Improving healthcare is one of the biggest priority areas for all countries worldwide, including India. There are several dimensions to this: Increasing the number of healthcare professionals, enhancing infrastructure, improving the quality of healthcare services and, overall, advancing the science and engineering that underlie healthcare informatics,” said Ganesh Ramakrishnan, institute chair professor at the department of computer science and engineering. Worldwide, the healthcare informatics market is estimated to be US$125 billion. “Today’s healthcare is not just about episodic symptoms, diagnoses and medications. It also involves progression tracking, individualisation, patient management, efficient and cost-effective health services, optimal usage of health resources, among others,” said IITB director Subhasis Chaudhuri. “On top of that, one should also consider national disease database creation, health analytics and decision support systems. All these require an intensive and interdisciplinary training of manpower that can help in better management of tomorrow’s healthcare system in India. With the limited healthcare resources we currently have, we think this initiative has the opportunity to make a good social impact,” he added. Irrespective of whether IITB will expand its offerings in the area that sees a convergence of engineering and healthcare, its initiative in this space is timely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-a-first-iit-bombay-to-offer-healthcare-info-course/articleshow/82510791.cms||Hemali Chhapia

Chairman of the group Abhijit Sawant has assured the MMC chief officer Agnelo Fernandes of “full assistance and cooperation” in its efforts to help citizens. With Margao witnessing a high number of Covid cases and about 2,500 active ones, the council had appealed to citizens and business communities to contribute to MMC’s efforts to provide facilities for medical assistance. Each 25-bedded Covid centre proposed to be set up by MMC will require beds, oxygen concentrators and other facilities,which will be put in place by way of municipal funds and corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds from philanthropic organisations. On Friday, Sahil Barua, CEO of Delhivery, a logistics company donated two oxygen concentrators to MMC.

---||India||Never thought of deferring assembly polls due to Covid surge: CEC Sushil Chandra||In his first interview after the assembly polls and taking over as chief election commissioner, Sushil Chandra said the strong turnout was a vote of confidence in the Election Commission and defended the role of central forces who he said had ensured fair polls. He also spoke frankly about difference of opinions with fellow EC Rajiv Kumar to TOI's Bharti Jain. Excerpts: Q: It was stated by election commissioner Rajiv Kumar in the draft affidavit which was not filed in Madras High Court that the EC had considered deferring the recent polls in view of the Covid surge. At what stage was this considered?A: At no point of time in the commission was there any thought of deferring the elections. Only a request was received for clubbing the last two phases and at that time, the EC had discussed various consequences of doing so. Considering the logistics of manpower and central forces’ deployment which is decided much in advance, it was not considered necessary to club the last two phases. But at no point of time in the commission was there any thought process regarding deferring of elections (on account of Covid).   Q: Did the EC at least consider deferring the last few phases when Congress requested this in view of Ramzan? Was there such a suggestion from any EC member?A: Ramzan, like all festivals and holidays, was considered before planning the elections. Nobody in the EC expressed any view with regard to deferring of polls. Q: Why was election commissioner Rajiv Kumar’s separate affidavit offering to take personal responsibility if Madras HC did not withdraw its ‘murder’ remark, not filed by EC?A: The affidavit and miscellaneous application (MA) before Madras HC and later the SLP in the Supreme Court were approved by both the commissioners, or basically, the EC. He (Kumar) had very clearly mentioned that he was absolutely fine with the draft MA and gave his go-ahead. Similarly, SLP was also approved by him. So the documents that were filed in the court had approval of the commission. The affidavit (drafted by Kumar) is a separate issue. That was discussed with the counsel before going to Madras HC and he had opined that only one affidavit could be filed on behalf of the commission. In an SLP, there is no question of filing affidavit. If at all there are any differences in an organisation, matters are decided on the basis of precedents, rules and judicial pronouncements. There are procedures in the commission to handle these types of situations. Q: There appears to be an impression that the view of 50% of EC, given that it presently has only two members, went unheard?A: All views of the election commissioner were incorporated and that is why he approved the miscellaneous application and SLP. Actually, both the EC members were on the same page in that the oral observations of the Madras HC CJ must be withdrawn. The SC has now given a judgment in our favour. The court was clear that the remarks of the HC were harsh and inappropriate. It also did not attribute any culpability of the pandemic to the EC. Read AlsoPunish me, but absolve Election Commission of doubts: Rajiv Kumar in affidavit that couldn't be filedNEW DELHI: Deferring some phases of the recently-held assembly polls due to the coronavirus pandemic could have led to a situation where holding the remaining phases under President's rule would have triggered sharper criticism about the poll panel favouring one party against another, ElectionQ: Considering the alleged pressure on the Nandigram returning officer (RO) after he rejected a recount demanded by the Trinamool agent, is EC thinking of giving some post-poll protection to ROs in general?A: Election-related officials often face the wrath of the new government in the post-election phase. The EC is concerned about this. Last year, the commission directed the chief secretaries not to initiate disciplinary proceedings against senior officers in the CEO office up to one year from expiry of their tenure. EC will further deliberate to ensure that its field officers, including returning officers, are not targeted for performing their statutory duties in a fair and neutral manner. A similar one-year bar (on disciplinary action) for returning officers may be discussed. Q: How does the EC rate itself on conduct of recent polls?A: The assembly elections were completed peacefully with 82.2% voters in West Bengal, 82.3% in Assam, 83.4% in Puducherry, 74.5% in Kerala and 73.6% in Tamil Nadu exercising their franchise following Covid-appropriate behaviour and in a free and fearless manner. As many as 18.6 crore electors were eligible to cast votes at 2.7 lakh polling stations in these polls. Altogether 13.6 lakh postal ballots as against 2.97 lakhs postal ballots in 2016 were available for counting due to extension of this facility to voters of 80 years and above, persons with disabilities, Covid positive electors and those employed in essential services. Despite the scale, successful elections were made possible with meticulous planning, dedication and commitment of more than 13 lakh election officials who discharged their duties impartially and all the security personnel who created a conducive and orderly environment for peaceful polls. Successful democratic transition within the prescribed timeframe, despite the pandemic situation, is an achievement. Q: There was criticism over the eight-phased poll in West Bengal? In retrospect, do you think polls could have been shorter?West Bengal has a history of multiple-phase elections due to state specific situations. In 2016 and in 2019, it had seven-phase elections. During the commission’s visit to the state in January 2021, political parties requested that Central forces be deployed at all the booths. The EC also assessed law & order situation on the basis of inputs from the Union home secretary, NCRB report and its interactions with the state government officials. Considering the past practices, increased number of polling stations, law and order situation, Commission decided to hold election in West Bengal in eight phases but over a duration that was 11 days shorter than 2016.

"They attacked me. No one from Nandigram attacked me but you brought goons from UP and Bihar. We want a freeQ: The EC was criticised by some for failing to control crowded rallies despite Covid guidelines. Do you think the 2020 guidelines of EC need to be revisited?A: The Covid guidelines issued on August 21, 2020, worked well for Bihar polls. When the latest elections were announced in February, Covid situation had significantly improved. There was no indication from the health authorities or experts that a second phase of the pandemic was on its way. However, the commission did not liberalise any of its Covid protocols issued for Bihar elections. It was also made clear that any change in the instructions of NDMA/SDMA will be automatically applicable in cases of election. During the last few phases, as the Covid situation intensified, EC responded by revising its instructions much before the competent agencies did, and was always ahead of the curve. But EC is absolutely open to reform and, if need be, more detailed Covid safety guidelines will be devised in consultation with political parties, once the current wave subsides. Q: Have the attacks against EC by politicians over its impartiality and fairness affected its credibility as an institution? A: Credibility of an institution comes from the trust reposed by voters in the process. With high voter turnout despite Covid, it is without doubt another mark of faith after successful Bihar elections in 2020. All stakeholders including political parties accepted the result. The credibility of the institution of EC is as strong as ever. Q: A refrain among some parties, particularly Trinamool Congress, was that central forces were ‘used’ by EC to the advantage of a certain political party. What is your view?A: We would like to dispel this misperception. Our central forces are one of the finest in the world. They are composed of personnel from all over the country and their neutrality is unquestionable. Recent elections witnessed very few law and order-related incidents for which credit must go to these central forces who were ably supported by the state police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cec-never-thought-of-deferring-assembly-polls-due-to-covid-surge/articleshow/82510863.cms||Bharti Jain

Sanguem has three residential colonies of those displaced from the Selaulim dam project. Sarpanch of Curdi-Waddem village panchayat, Kushta Gaonkar said the number of Covid cases are rising. He said that when people were rehabilitated at Waddem some 30 years ago, the government had constructed a building for housing health centre. However, it has been lying unused. “This structure could be converted into a Covid care centre with some minor upkeep,” he said. “Though it is unused, it has electricity and water connection,” the sarpanch said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/set-up-covid-care-centre-at-curdi-locals/articleshow/82511203.cms||---

Excerpts from the interview: Congress fought against Trinamool but now Congress leaders are hailing Mamata Banerjee’s victory over an aggressive BJP led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Isn’t it strange? Even Mamata’s worst enemy must concede that she has won an amazing victory, seemingly with money, logistics, central agencies and carpet bombing through media, all stacked against her. I have no inhibition in hailing her in keeping the anti-BJP secular flag flying high. That does not mean we will not introspect and try to rebuild Congress in West Bengal. After TMC’s sweep, there are calls that Mamata be made the opposition face to take on PM Modi in 2024 polls. What is your opinion? No one can deny that Mamata necessarily has to be a significant frontline occupant of the anti-BJP opposition space. That space, however, must be built up with consensus and calibration, and should be an exercise of interactive coalition-building and not of persons or egos. ‘What and how’ have to be diligently worked upon soonest and ‘who’ as an issue must be relegated to the end. What was wrong with the Congress strategy for West Bengal elections where the party drew a blank? Mainly, the electorate generally and those who did not want BJP decided to ensure their vote got maximum impact and therefore voted for the perceived winner TMC, thinking that a Left-Congress vote would be wasted. Candidly, some of us wanted a different alignment but as disciplined soldiers, we went along with the state unit’s view of Congress-Left alliance, which may well have also contributed to this defeat. Did Congress fail in its minority strongholds of Malda-Murshidabad as it targeted Mamata? The reason of voting for a perceived winner applies even more to these districts. It is not necessary that the electorate was against Congress but a perception gained ground that the only way to defeat BJP was to elect TMC. The alignment could have been different but having once aligned with the Left, some targeting of TMC was inevitable. What is evident post-2019 is that regional parties have succeeded in thwarting BJP while Congress has been caving in. What is the problem? While results for Congress are depressing, I don’t agree with the ‘cave in’ phrase. We lost but gave strong fights in Kerala and Assam, and in Tamil Nadu, as an ally, our strike rate was good. The real dismal show was Bengal where there is no alternative but to rebuild from scratch with new local faces at every level. Many believe leadership alone is not the problem plaguing Congress but the issues run deeper? The current Congress leadership, including president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, are acutely aware of the need to operationalise a leadership matrix wanted by an overwhelming bulk of Congressmen and it will happen soon. Naturally, leadership issues must go hand in hand with strengthening, reinventing and revitalising Congress bottom up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/didi-significant-frontline-occupant-of-anti-bjp-space-but-lets-not-decide-on-a-leader-right-now/articleshow/82511107.cms||---

From 1,646 days in February, it drastically fell to 429 days by March 31. Despite the clear warning signals, the government ignored the key indicators as doubling time further fell to 119 days by April 10 and down to 36 days by April 30. Doubling time is the exact number of days required for the cases in an epidemic to double, based on the rate of the cumulative increase in the number of cases. Experts say the doubling time is a crude estimate of the current rate of spread of the virus. The trends were no less shocking in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. According to an analysis done by Indiaspend, The doubling time began falling from February 18 onwards, From 11,636 days, it fell to 658 days by March-end and to 95 days in April-end. Accusing the Centre and state governments of complacency, K Sujatha Rao, former secretary to the ministry of health and family welfare, said had public health experts and scientists been consulted, they would have warned the governments on the severity of the second wave. “There is some amount of negligence both in the states and the Centre. We allowed festivals and events where crowds gather. There was no urgency shown towards the value of vaccination,” Rao said. Sujatha Rao said the healthcare system was overstretched and doctors and nurses exhausted. “Learning from the terrible experience in the second wave, governments should allow only essential services and important industries and shut down all other activities like pubs, film theatres, malls and large markets,” she said. Explaining that the infection is bound to spread and new variants will continue to mutate, she said: “If 70% populace is vaccinated, it will provide immunity. Vaccination may not stop transmission of infection, but it is known to reduce deaths and save lives.” She also said the country was paying a heavy price for its oversight. “We should have stockpiled basic requirements like hospital beds, oxygen, medicines like Remdesivir.” However, Telangana health officials refuted the charges that the government did not act in time. Director of medical education, Dr K Ramesh Reddy, told TOI: “We were totally prepared. When the cases were rising in Maharashtra and Delhi, we knew they would rise slowly in Telangana too. At one point, the doubling time decreased fast, with increase in positive cases.” He said that when the first wave came, the state had only 1,000 oxygen beds. “Now, we have 10,000 ICU, ventilator and ordinary oxygen beds in Telangana. We have 600 non-invasive ventilator and ventilator beds in Gandhi Hospital alone. This is a record in the world where at one place these many ventilator beds are available. Out of 1,000 patients at Gandhi Hospital, 600 are on ventilators. At TIMS, we have 137 ventilators and we are going to increase them to 200,” he claimed. He also denied that government hospitals faced a shortage of Remdesivir injections. “We strictly followed the protocols and used them only for patients who required it. We had no issue with it. But, private hospitals used them indiscriminately because of which the shortage is felt. In December 2020, when the caseload came down, the production was decreased. Later when the cases surged, the production has been increased but they need 15-day sterile period,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/doubling-time-slide-began-in-feb-t-ap-ignored-signs/articleshow/82511273.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao asked officials to invite applications from thousands of medical students, highlighting that they would be awarded “weightage marks” in government jobs in future. The CM who held a review meeting on Covid-19 scenario on Sunday called upon young doctors to come forward and serve the people during difficult times. “They would be hired for two to three months to reduce the burden on medical and health staff working as frontline warriors during the coronavirus surge in the state,” one official said. He instructed the medical and health officers to appoint on temporary basis doctors, nurses, lab technicians, pharmacists and other para medical staff immediately and utilise their services for the Corona treatment. These temporary employees would be paid respectable salaries. The MBBS qualified candidates and others can apply online at https://odls.telangana.gov.in/medicalrecruitment/Home.aspx. He also urged the qualified nurses, pharmacists, lab technicians, and paramedics to come forward and offer their services. During the day, KCR spoke with health minister Harsh Vardhan and urged him to relax vaccination guidelines so that super spreaders like the cab and auto drivers, conductors, LPG cylinder delivery boys and daily wage workers can be vaccinated. After the review meeting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to CM KCR by telephone. The PM told KCR that the union minister Harsh Vardhan briefed him about the suggestions given by the CM. “Your suggestions are good and we will implement them. I thank you for the good suggestions,” Modi told KCR. The CM urged Modi to supply more oxygen and Remdesivir injections to the state. Modi responded positively to the CM’s request and assured that immediate action would be taken on these requests, informed the CMO here. The CM has also announced that a 250-bed super specialty hospital at Kakatiya Medical College premises, Warangal, and another similar 250-bed super-specialty hospital at RIMS, Adilabad be made operational immediately. He directed principal secretary (finance) Ramakrishna Rao to immediately release Rs 56 crore to the two hospitals for appointing 729 staff, including doctors, nurses, lab technicians and provide other facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-govt-to-recruit-50000-mbbs-passouts-as-covid-warriors/articleshow/82511346.cms||Roushan Ali

In February, it had dropped below one lakh (stood at 99,217 on February 22). That was about the time the second Covid wave started. A civic official explained, “If the number of positive cases are low, there is also a drop in high-risk contacts to be tested and those who need to be quarantined. While those in buildings are able to quarantine in their homes, those in smaller homes and those in slums need to be institutionally quarantined.” In some areas, corporators said they have received complaints about persons flouting home quarantine norms under the excuse of stepping out for medical reasons. Former corporator Abhishek Ghosalkar (from Shiv Sena, R North ward) said, “For RT-PCR tests, the BMC would send teams to a person’s home; in case the person required an HRCT scan, an ambulance would be sent. What worked is that the BMC put the onus on housing society managing committees to ensure that those home quarantined do not flout norms. Most managing committee members were very strict.” In Goregaon, BJP corporator Deepak Thakur said that whenever a person is found flouting quarantine rules, at first they are told that they are putting others at risk; if they do not listen, they are warned of police action. “Sometimes it gets very difficult, especially in case of senior citizens. Recently, a senior citizen living alone had stepped out saying he was bored staying home the entire day. We explained to him that we would arrange whatever supplies he needed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/home-quarantine-in-city-down-16-in-1-mth/articleshow/82511427.cms||Richa Pinto

The court was hearing the petition filed by Nagalingam, who sought the authorities to issue a passport to him. According to the petitioner, he applied for the passport on March 29. However, a communication was sent by the regional passport officer in Madurai to the effect that there is an FIR pending against the petitioner before the Karuppayurani police station in the district. Therefore, the petitioner was called to explain as to why he did not reveal the pendency of a criminal case. Subsequently, the petitioner also submitted his reply to the passport authorities. Since, the authorities have not acted on the reply by the petitioner, Nagalingam filed a petition before the Madurai bench of Madras high court. Justice N Anand Venkatesh observed that it is seen from the records that the FIR came to be registered against the petitioner only on the ground that he was not wearing a face mask while riding a two-wheeler during the pandemic last year. “That apart, the very registration of an FIR cannot be construed to be criminal proceedings, unless it translates itself into a final report and the same is taken cognizance by a competent court,” observed the judge. Hence, the judge directed the authorities to process the application submitted by the petitioner and issue a passport to him, if the petitioner has satisfied all the other requirements, within four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-grants-relief-to-man-denied-passport/articleshow/82512044.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The petitioner also wanted the authorities to desist from establishing a playground inside the Oorani.The petitioner’s counsel submitted that if the construction is allowed to go on, the waterbody would be completely occupied one day. The additional government pleader submitted that the construction of the anganwadi is almost complete and there was no proposal to set up a playground inside the Oorani. A division bench of Justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that though the land has been classified as Oorani, bearing in mind the doctrine of sustainable development and taking note of the fact that only two cents have been used for public purpose, the court is not issuing an order to demolish it.“However, this court is conscious of the fact the authorities of the government or the local body may enter into the remaining land classified as Oorani under the guise of developmental activities,” observed the judge. Disposing of the petition, the judges directed that there shall be an order of perpetual injunction, restraining the authorities from putting up any construction in the remaining land classified as Oorani and the same shall be maintained as Oorani. The only exception is the two cents, in which the anganwadi centre is constructed and no other construction shall be made, the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/anganwadi-built-on-sivaganga-waterbody-not-to-be-demolished/articleshow/82512045.cms||---

The court was hearing the petition filed on behalf of villagers of Gandhigramam and 14 other nearby villages in Andipatti taluk in Theni district. Petitioner I Andi challenged the GO dated February 8 and wanted the authorities to resurvey the villages to confirm tiger population. Andi said the villagers have been residing there for three generations and cultivating cereals, cotton and millets. The government had issued pattas to all the people in these 15 villages, he said.  The petitioner, 68, stated that he has neither seen a tiger attack on the villagers during his lifetime nor any footprints. The petitioner’s counsel submitted that declaring Gandhigramam as buffer zone would cause great prejudice to the villagers. No proper survey was conducted before passing the GO and the government should prioritize development and welfare of humans, not other living creatures. A division bench of Justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that it would be incorrect on the part of the petitioner to state that no proper survey was done before issuing the order as a detailed procedure was followed. “We do not agree with the petitioner, who states that the people should be prioritized over wildlife. In the food cycle, wildlife plays an important role and none should do anything to make wildlife extinct. Conservation is not an act of charity towards nature, but an essential necessity,” observed the judges. The judges said the actual reason for the petitioner to approach the court is only to recognise their possession of land. Hence the judges dismissed the petition and similarly placed people to approach the appropriate authority of the forest department to establish their rights to cultivate and carry on other activities, by submitting appropriate applications supported with records. On receipt of the same, the competent authority shall inquire into the same and do the needful in accordance with law, said the judges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madras-hc-junks-plea-against-go-on-tiger-reserve/articleshow/82512046.cms||Kaushik Kannan

I am being asked to go to Samayanallur, which is far away,” said a 50-year-old woman from Koodalpudur, who does not want to be named.B Pandiaraja, member of Madurai district vigilance and monitoring committee said that more than 700 people have taken first jab in the Kovilpappakudi and more than 150 of them are waiting to get the second dose. But, not all can travel far to get the vaccine.“The available vaccine should be equally distributed throughout the district. There are three PHCs under Samayanallur Upgraded PHCs.

At present there is a shortage and they are rationalizing in such a way so that wastage can be minimized.“There are 54 PHCs and 13 Upgraded PHCs. Vaccines re now distributed only to Upgraded PHCs.

Additional traffic police personnel were deployed to ease congestion in the streets around the Meenakshi Amman Temple. Social distancing went for a toss in public places and stores. Textile stores were overwhelmed as people wanted to finish their purchase for the upcoming Eid festival. Some of the stores closed the main entrance and let customers through another entry to evade the authorities, who were doing rounds checking crowds. Fish stalls and meat stalls also witnessed good crowds on Sunday. All the stalls in the Nelpettai Fish Market were overflowing with crowds. Many came to the market with masks pulled down to the cheek. Shopkeepers too did not wear masks properly. The grocery stores in East Veli Streets were also overcrowded.

Dr Satish Devadoss, convener of the healthcare panel of the CII, says Madurai district depends on two refillers who procure liquid oxygen from Sriperumpudur, Bellary in Karnataka and Kanjikode in Kerala. As supplies have dropped now, one of them has been struggling to meet the demand of hospitals. Three days ago, the district administration held talks with these liquid oxygen refillers and asked them to adhere to the agreements signed with private hospitals and supply oxygen accordingly. But the hospitals say the situation hasn’t improved much. A multispeciality hospital which used just 1KL of liquid oxygen for one to two weeks now uses it up in a single day, said Devadoss.On Saturday, a forty-two-year-old female patient admitted to a private hospital in Bibikulam had to be shifted to the Government Rajaji Hospital as the hospital ran out of oxygen, but she died on the way. Major corporate hospitals in the city are trying to install storage facilities on their campus, but have been told by the installing firm that they would have to wait for two months as the demand is high. The cost of installing an oxygen plant has doubled from Rs 5 crore before the pandemic, according to sources in a hospital. The hospitals say while they are ready to serve the people to the maximum extent possible the government needs to help them have access to the required quantity of medical oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-allot-major-portion-of-sterlites-oxygen-to-south-tn/articleshow/82512088.cms||---

Maharashtra tops with 7.95 lakh new cases but there is a slight drop in fresh infections. The situation in Kerala remains worrisome considering the rapidity with which it has been adding new cases. Its increase in the last fortnight has been more than 178% compared to the previous one. On Tuesday, the state overtook Karnataka to log the most cases after Maharashtra. While the total cases in Maharashtra is 50.5 lakh, it has crossed 19 lakh in Kerala, ahead of Karnataka (18.8 lakh), UP (14.8 lakh) and TN (13.5 lakh). Andhra Pradesh, another state with a high caseload of 12.6 lakh, is also a concern with a fortnightly surge of more than 178%.   Cases in Kerala and Andhra still climbingWhile in Kerala cases went up from 1.46 lakh to 4 lakh during the past two fortnights (between April 8-21 & April 21-May), in Andhra they rose from 70,800 to over 1.97 lakh during the same period. Meanwhile, the new cases added across India during the two fortnights moved from 28.67 lakh to 47.3 lakh, an increase of 65%. In percentage terms, Assam registered the highest 294% growth in new cases over the last fortnight, while Goa saw a surge of 200%—both had around 10,000 new cases during April 8-21 which increased to over 38,000 in Assam and 30,000 in Goa in the subsequent fortnight.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Maharashtra, however, is the only state which has shown a slowdown with new infections declining by 0.4% during the last fortnight as compared to the previous one. Its total new cases reported in the last fortnight was 7.95 lakh, lower than 7.98 lakh in the previous 14-day period. The case surge has been phenomenal across the country and it would be difficult to conclude that states that went to polls were particularly affected. Consider this: the increase in total confirmed cases in the last fortnight was 178% in Andhra Pradesh, 165% in Odisha, 157% in Karnataka and between 100%- 120% in several others, including Haryana, Bihar and Rajasthan.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); In states that recently went to elections, the surge in the last fortnight was highest in Assam at 293%, followed by Kerala 178%, Bengal 143%, Puducherry 116% and Tamil Nadu 104% as compared to cases added a fortnight ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-karnataka-biweekly-cases-highest-after-maharashtra/articleshow/82512428.cms||---
---||India||BJP drops Sonowal, picks Himanta, its NE troubleshooter, as Assam CM||GUWAHATI: Five-time MLA and NDA’s northeast troubleshooter Himanta Biswa Sarma was named Assam's 15th chief minister on Sunday, a day after he and incumbent Sarbananda Sonowal were called to Delhi ahead of the BJP legislature party meeting in Guwahati that put its seal on the high command's choice. Sarma, who quit Congress in 2015 to join BJP after a much-publicised succession rift with his mentor and then CM Tarun Gogoi, made the cut after almost a week of speculation over whether the 52-yearold former Supreme Court advocate would pip his predecessor Sonowal at the post. His elevation, seen as an acknowledgement of his contribution towards BJP's growth in Assam and the northeast as well as a recognition of his support among MLAs and his fierce ambition to take the helm, came at Sonowal’s cost. Unlike in 2016, when PM Modi had declared Sonowal as BJP’s CM candidate, the party did not commit itself to either retaining him or naming an alternative before the polls — a significant switch which, given that the party ran on the record of the outgoing government, raised speculation about a possible leadership change. If Sonowal was unhappy, he did not show it. The former CM, who is widely regarded for his sober and clean image, was dignified in acquiescing to the turn of events. BJP circles, both in Assam and New Delhi, have been rife with speculation about him landing a berth in the Union cabinet. Sarma will be state’s first CM from Brahmin communitySarma will be the state’s first chief minister from the Brahmin community and the only one from lower Assam to get the top post since the late Bhumidhar Barman of Congress was CM for a brief period in 1996 following Hiteswar Saikia’s death. Known to be a go-getter, Sarma’s challenge to Tarun Gogoi in 2015 had been thwarted by Sonia Gandhi. He, along with 10 other Congress MLAs, quit the party soon after and crossed over to BJP. The selection of Sarma, who is likely to take oath on Monday along with a small team, as the new leader of the BJP legislature group was announced by Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar. Early on, Sonowal proposed Sarma’s name at the legislature party meeting. The proposal was seconded by BJP state president Ranjeet Kumar Dass. BJP’s partners in the NDA — AGP and the Bodoland party UPPL — swiftly completed the formality of declaring their support to Sarma. In his first address as CMelect to his colleagues in NDA, Sarma pledged to uphold Sonowal’s legacy of “valuebased politics”. “The first five years of the NDA government in Assam under the leadership of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal took the state to new heights and restored peace and development in the state. Unlike the moon, the Sonowal government had no scars. He was our leader and will remain our leader and our margdarshak,” he said. “Personally, I am grateful to Sonowal for having so much trust in me, which was reflected in him giving me the responsibility of handling so many crucial departments.” Sarma, who had held the health, finance and education portfolios under Sonowal’s chief ministership, drove to Raj Bhavan to stake claim to form the new government. Earlier, Sonowal had visited governor Jagdish Mukhi to submit his resignation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-drops-sonowal-picks-himanta-its-ne-troubleshooter-as-assam-cm/articleshow/82512434.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||India||Covid is leaving kids orphaned but adoption pleas are illegal||In the midst of cries for oxygen, hospital beds and emergency drugs on social media, a desperate appeal that stopped people in their thumb scrolling tracks a fortnight ago was a message urging families to adopt two girls — one aged three days and another six months — with the claim that they had lost their parents recently to Covid. “Please help these kids get a new life, spread the word,” urged the post that quickly went viral. Such emotional pleas for adoption of children orphaned by the virus have surfaced over the past few days. And though these forwards may be well intentioned, the request is unlawful and could even put a child in danger of being sold or trafficked. “Stop. This is illegal. Adoption requires a due process and is the last option after all other care options to have children rehabilitated within their families are exhausted,” wrote Tannistha Datta, child protection specialist of Unicef India. Illegal adoption can land you in jail for 5 yearsAlso, adoption is a legal issue, not something for WhatsApp groups to deal with. There are serious risks here of trafficking and malintention, Dutta added, trying to alert people on social media. Datta’s fears weren’t unfounded. “Something didn’t seem right about the age difference between the kids if they were siblings,” said Vijay Doiphode, chairperson, Child Welfare Committee (CWC), Mumbai who tried calling the number several times. “It rang out. We’re not sure of the genuineness of the case. A lot of rumours are coming our way.” “And if people fall for these rumours, they too can be trapped in human rights violation,” warned Vasudeva Sharma, former chairman of CWC and nodal director for Childline, Bangalore. Under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, offering or receiving children outside the legal processes as well as their sale and purchase are acts punishable with three to five years in jail or Rs 1 lakh in fine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-is-leaving-kids-orphaned-but-adoption-pleas-are-illegal/articleshow/82512436.cms||Mohua Das

She also used the same argument for vaccines, while underlining that the Centre was providing free vaccines to those above 45 years as well as frontline workers and also bearing the GST. Banerjee had written to PM Modi seeking GST and customs duty waiver on medical equipment, medicines and oxygen, required to fight Covid 19.

The institute’s foray into healthcare will be a coming together of core sciences—maths, medicine and computer science. The course will be offered as an interdisciplinary dual degree programme as well as a minor programme. The course will bring together expertise from computer science, bioinformatics, statistics, AIML (artificial intelligence & machine learning) and medical science. Healthcare informatics market is worth $125bnHealthcare informatics will address teaching and research on a wide spectrum of topics that include clinical data management, healthcare standards and ethics, modelling and data efficient machine learning, to name a few. “Improving healthcare is one of the biggest priority areas for all countries worldwide, including India. There are several dimensions to this: Increasing the number of healthcare professionals, enhancing infrastructure, improving the quality of healthcare services and, overall, advancing the science and engineering that underlie healthcare informatics,” said Ganesh Ramakrishnan, institute chair professor at the department of computer science and engineering. Worldwide, the healthcare informatics market is estimated to be US$125 billion. “Today’s healthcare is not just about episodic symptoms, diagnoses and medications. It also involves progression tracking, individualisation, patient management, efficient and cost-effective health services, optimal usage of health resources, among others,” said IITB director Subhasis Chaudhuri. “On top of that, one should also consider national disease database creation, health analytics and decision support systems,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-a-1st-iitb-to-offer-healthcare-info-prog/articleshow/82512449.cms||---

Among images sought to be passed off as “Bengal violence images” are old photos from Brazil, Venezuela and Bangladesh. On Sunday, the Bengal CID tweeted a video link where a verified user — Chaudhary Amit Singh — claimed a man was beaten and assaulted with sticks and stones. The video had originated from Brazil, and is at least three years old, the CID said. Also, a 2018 video from Venezuela has been shared on social media as a political worker being lynched in Bengal in post-poll violence by “TMC goons”. Kolkata police has flagged a Bangladeshi video that was being passed off as an attack on a polling agent in Bengal. After this, half a dozen videos have surfaced with morphed images from incidents which took place in Bangladesh, sources said. Since May 5, the number of fake videos under surveillance is stated to be in the hundreds. The CID has contacted social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter and have taken down close to 300 posts and accounts. The Kolkata police claimed on Sunday that it had flagged and removed 200 others. Investigators say there has been special emphasis on a few districts, from where the volumes are higher. The state police have lodged five FIRs in Cooch Behar alone. CID sources said most of the rehashed old incidents are those that were reported from UP, Bihar and Odisha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengal-police-get-500-fake-social-media-posts-deleted/articleshow/82512470.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||India||Sonowal gracefully exits with Mahabharata quote||GUWAHATI: Sarbananda Sonowal signed off as Assam CM on Sunday with a quote from the Mahabharata, where Bhishma — lying on a bed of arrows — tells the eldest Pandava Yudhisthir that a king must stand for the country and not the other way round. Addressing newly-elected MLAs of BJP and its allies after Himanta Biswa Sarma’s election as the leader of the House and the state’s next CM, Sonowal said, “So, we the representatives of the people, exist for society and the country. This we should keep in mind and always work in the interest of the country and society. Many of you here have worked with dedication in the last five years and so society has re-elected you. Respect the love and trust of society.” Choosing to make a graceful exit, Sonowal drove to the assembly for the BJP legislature party meeting along with his successor. On reaching there, he waited for Sarma to alight from the other side of the vehicle before both walked into the assembly building together. At the meeting, there seemed to be an uneasy calm till the proceedings began. It was Sonowal who proposed Sarma’s name as the leader of the legislature party. When it was time for the felicitation, Sonowal walked across the dais to present Sarma with a traditional gamocha (scarf) and patted him on the back before posing for pictures with an arm resting on his successor’s shoulder. Sarma took off his mask after a prod from Sonowal. The outgoing CM expressed confidence that the new NDA government, under the leadership of his “younger brother”, would take the state to greater heights. “Himanta has been given a huge responsibility and I bestow my love and blessings on him so that he can perform his duties well for the welfare and progress of all sections of the society,” he said while addressing the newly elected members of all three alliance partners – BJP, AGP and UPPL. Sonowal said that for the last five years, the BJP-led government in the state had been able to win the people’’s trust and confidence by bringing peace and development. “We thank the people for reposing their trust in us... I urge all the elected members of the alliance to work with dedication and honesty,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sonowal-gracefully-exits-with-mahabharata-quote/articleshow/82512477.cms||Prabin Kalita

Travel agencies have begun taking bookings for tickets in charter flights from Kerala to Oman via Uzbekistan, which includes a 14-day stay in the Central Asian country. The ban came into force on April 24 after the transit routes initially used to reach the Gulf through countries like Nepal and Maldives were blocked after those countries tightened norms for Indian passengers. The temporary suspension of flights from India was announced following a surge in cases in the second wave of Covid-19. Alhind Travels is accepting bookings from passengers intending to travel from Kozhikode to Oman via Uzbekistan on May 25. The travel firm will fly the passengers in a chartered flight from Calicut to Tashkent and would fly them to Muscat after they complete their 14-day quarantine. “Many are desperate to travel to the Gulf for different reasons. Currently, people who have to undertake emergency travel to UAE and Saudi Arabia are travelling via Bahrain after undergoing 14-day quarantine there before flying to their destinations. But it is difficult to get visas from Bahrain and it costs around Rs 1.1 lakh for the package,” said Yassir Mundodan, regional manager of Alhind Travels. “The advantage of transit via Uzbekistan is that the passengers can complete their quarantine there without much difficulty. They can fly to Oman after conducting an RT-PCR test. Within a day, we received 20 bookings for the 180 seats in the charter flight,” he added. The fare package including air tickets and the14-day stay in Tashkent would cost Rs 1.35 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/seeking-to-beat-gulf-ban-with-uzbek-detour/articleshow/82512491.cms||K R Rajeev
---||Chandigarh||Punjab desperately needs medical oxygen as Covid-19 cases surge||CHANDIGARH: As Covid-19 active cases touched 74,343 in Punjab on Sunday, hospitals across the state are gasping for oxygen. Punjab’s medical oxygen allocation is 227 metric tonnes (MT) per day against its existing requirement of 295MT, which is increasing by almost 50MT in a week. A total of 296 critically-ill Covid patients were on ventilator support across Punjab on Sunday and 9,384 patients were on oxygen support. Amid soaring demand for medical oxygen every day, the state government has been repeatedly knocking at the doors of the central government to increase its supply to save precious lives. “Medical oxygen consumption for Ludhiana has increased from 13MT on April 15 to 66MT on May 8,” says Punjab Civil Services (PCS) officer Amit Bamby, the nodal officer for monitoring oxygen supply in Ludhiana, the worst affected district of the state. Ludhiana has nearly 50 small hospitals and six big hospitals taking care of Covid patients. On April 15, Ludhiana’s small hospitals needed 800 oxygen cylinders per day and their consumption has now increased to 3,800 cylinders a day, he added. Ludhiana recorded the highest number of 1,550 Covid deaths in Punjab till Sunday. “We are on the toes round the clock. I’ve been sleeping for 2-4 hours in the last 20 days as we keep getting SOS calls from hospitals and in case we are short of oxygen supply, we have to arrange from other districts,” said Bamby. Demand spikes, but oxygen allocation to state still low As Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has repeatedly raised the demand for enhancing oxygen supply, the central government on April 30 increased medical oxygen allocation for Punjab to 195 MT per day — 90 MT from Bokaro (Jharkhand), 60 MT from Inox Barotiwala (Himachal Pradesh), 20 MT from Panipat (Haryana),15 MT from Roorkee (Uttarakhand) and 10 MT from Linde India at Dehradun (Uttarakhand). After including the internal allocation of 32 MT, the total allocation to Punjab comes to 227 MT as on date. Punjab government officials said that two days back the state stopped getting oxygen from Dehradun oxygen plant as Uttarakhand required oxygen for its hospitals. As the cases in Haryana are also increasing at a rapid pace, Punjab can face a critical shortage of oxygen in case the Panipat plant also stops supply to Punjab. Dr Adarsh Suri, chief administrator of 400-bedded Sohana Hospital in Mohali district, told TOI, “Yesterday, we were left with only 30 oxygen cylinders even as we had 130 Covid patients. If we have a single Covid patient in emergency whose oxygen saturation level reaches 65-70, he would require four to five oxygen cylinders in a single night. You can imagine the situation.” He said that his hospital sends SOS messages to the state government every day though the officials try to extend full support, they are also struggling to increase the daily oxygen quota of the state. As hospitals in Punjab are also getting calls from overburdened Delhi and NCR almost every day, Dr Suri says his hospital is ready to admit Covid-19 patients up to 50% (200) of its full capacity of 400, provided it gets the required oxygen quota. Since Punjab requires at least 36 tankers against its present availability of 20 tankers, the state government has requested the central government to enhance the number of tankers. As the state government is also facing logistics issues in transporting its oxygen quota from Bokaro, it has also urged the central government to allocate its quota from a nearby state besides arranging Indian Air Force transport aircraft sorties to pick up oxygen from Bokaro. Vaccine shortage a concern too During the discussion on the state’s Covid situation and measures taken to tackle the crisis, Amarinder also urged Modi to ensure immediate supply of the required Covid-19 vaccine, which too is in short supply. He told Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the state had so far been unable to initiate the Phase III of the vaccination process for the 18-45 age group, which is now scheduled to start in government hospitals on Monday, after the delivery of one lakh doses. He added that the vaccine doses were in short supply even for the 45+ age group. Though he said that 1.63 lakh vaccine doses were expected to come on Sunday, these were not enough to meet the state’s requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-desperately-needs-medical-oxygen-as-covid-19-cases-surge/articleshow/82512493.cms||---

Punjab government officials said that two days back the state stopped getting oxygen from Dehradun oxygen plant as Uttarakhand required oxygen for its hospitals. As the cases in Haryana are also increasing at a rapid pace, Punjab can face a critical shortage of oxygen in case the Panipat plant also stops supply to Punjab. Dr Adarsh Suri, chief administrator of 400-bedded Sohana Hospital in Mohali district, told TOI, “Yesterday, we were left with only 30 oxygen cylinders even as we had 130 Covid patients. If we have a single Covid patient in emergency whose oxygen saturation level reaches 65-70, he would require four to five oxygen cylinders in a single night. You can imagine the situation.” He said that his hospital sends SOS messages to the state government every day though the officials try to extend full support, they are also struggling to increase the daily oxygen quota of the state. As hospitals in Punjab are also getting calls from overburdened Delhi and NCR almost every day, Dr Suri says his hospital is ready to admit Covid-19 patients up to 50% (200) of its full capacity of 400, provided it gets the required oxygen quota. Since Punjab requires at least 36 tankers against its present availability of 20 tankers, the state government has requested the central government to enhance the number of tankers. As the state government is also facing logistics issues in transporting its oxygen quota from Bokaro, it has also urged the central government to allocate its quota from a nearby state besides arranging Indian Air Force transport aircraft sorties to pick up oxygen from Bokaro. Vaccine shortage a concern too During the discussion on the state’s Covid situation and measures taken to tackle the crisis, Amarinder also urged Modi to ensure immediate supply of the required Covid-19 vaccine, which too is in short supply. He told Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the state had so far been unable to initiate the Phase III of the vaccination process for the 18-45 age group, which is now scheduled to start in government hospitals on Monday, after the delivery of one lakh doses. He added that the vaccine doses were in short supply even for the 45+ age group. Though he said that 1.63 lakh vaccine doses were expected to come on Sunday, these were not enough to meet the state’s requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/punjab-desperately-needs-medical-oxygen-as-covid-19-cases-surge/articleshow/82512503.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi lockdown for 1 more week, this time no metro, more curbs||NEW DELHI: The lockdown in Delhi has been extended by another week with even more stringent measures in place. The Metro has been shut down this time, and no weddings will be allowed in any public place like hotels. All lockdown restrictions already in place for the last three weeks will continue and the e-passes issued to individuals engaged in essential services will remain valid. Last year, the Delhi Metro did not run for 169 days. It started limited operations from September 7, 2020. While the Metro will be closed, other modes of public transport will continue to ply, though with restrictions. A complete prohibition has been imposed on organising any marriage ceremony at public places, marriage halls, banquet halls, hotels etc. Marriage ceremonies can be organised in a court or at home. Not more than 20 people will be allowed to attend these functions. For those attending, the wedding card will work as a travel pass. “The government, based on everyone’s feedback, and owing to the helplessness of the situation, will extend the lockdown to next Monday (May 17), 5 am,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said at a digital press conference. We can’t afford to let our guard down, says CMIn the past few days, I have interacted with several people, and everyone believes that while Covid cases have reduced, they are still high. The infection rate is still 23% — one cannot afford to let the guard down,” he said. “Only if we can live, can we conquer. If we are able to live our lives, we can do a lot of things later in life. First and foremost, we have to save lives,” the CM said at a digital press conference. “More stringent the lockdown is, the more rapidly we will be able to conquer Covid,” he said. He said the government was compelled to impose the lockdown last month due to a rapid surge in Covid cases and an alarming rise in the number of people falling seriously ill. Kejriwal said that because a lockdown was imposed, the chain of the transmission has somewhat started to break with the positivity rate dropping from 35% to 23% in a short span. “We have used this lockdown period to strengthen our health resources and infrastructure. In the past few days, with the central government’s help and based on the directions by the Supreme Court and High Court, the oxygen situation has improved,” he said. Kejriwal said that vaccination drive has also gained momentum in Delhi but there is a scarcity in the stock of vaccines and the Delhi government has asked the Centre for assistance. “I’m hopeful that just the way the central government has been supportive on other issues, they will also be supportive in this matter,” he said. In an order of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority regarding the extension of the lockdown, all district magistrates and other senior officials have been asked to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour like wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing at inter-state bus terminals, railway stations, shops selling essential items, mandis, etc. The authorities have also been asked to keep a hawk eye on any shop selling nonessential commodities or services and weekly markets functioning illegally. The Delhi Police has been asked to ensure effective checking by putting adequate checkpoints and pickets to prevent unnecessary movement of people during the lockdown.

---||India||World’s ‘best’ vaccines could soon come to poor countries||In the 6 months since Covid vaccines became available, those based on mRNA technology have scored top marks. So far, there are only two – made by Pfizer and Moderna – and both show 95% efficacy. Other types of vaccines are usually 80% or less efficacious. This difference affects not only the protection you get as an individual but also the protection available to the ‘herd’ or society. With a better vaccine a country can reach ‘herd immunity’ faster by vaccinating fewer people. But mRNA vaccines are still confined to the rich world. This is partly because supply is limited and those countries placed their orders first. Another reason is these vaccines get spoilt if they are not stored at extremely cold temperatures. The Pfizer shot initially required storage at -80°C. Poor countries couldn’t afford to buy specialised freezers for it in bulk. A fragile moleculeWhy do mRNA vaccines need ultra-cold storage? It’s because their main ingredient, mRNA (messenger RNA), is extremely fragile. “(It is) really easily destroyed, and that’s because there are many, many enzymes that will just break it apart,” Selena Simmons-Duffin writes in NPR. Ultra-cold temperatures prevent that. “The lower the temperatures, the slower the molecular movements — and the lower the chance of damaging reactions,” says Maya Wei-Haas in the National Geographic. The vaccine’s key ingredient is called “messenger” because it carries instructions for your cells to start making a part of the Covid virus. Your immune system learns to recognise this part and take on the actual virus. If the mRNA breaks, the message is lost. “Only one cut in your mRNA strand can be enough to lose function,” Wei-Haas quotes a scientist. Second-generation mRNALast year, mRNA vaccine makers were in a hurry to get vaccines out, even if it took ultra-freezers to keep them stable. “Our top priority was to quickly develop a safe and effective vaccine,” Ugur Sahin, CEO of Pfizer’s vaccine partner BioNTech, said. But now they are focusing on updated vaccines that are easier to store and distribute. In the next few days, a third mRNA vaccine could arrive, Carl Zimmer writes in The New York Times. Made by German company Cure-Vac, it has caught the world’s attention because it remains stable at 5°C for 3 months, and can be left at room temperature for 24 hours. The vaccine has been tested on 40,000 volunteers in Europe and Latin America, Zimmer says, and “CureVac is on the cusp of announcing the results.” If it’s successful, it could come to low- and middle-income countries. Meanwhile, BioNTech announced on May 4 it is “working on getting approval” for their updated mRNA vaccine that can be safely stored at 2°C-8°C for up to 6 months. Moderna began a trial of its next-generation vaccine, called mRNA-1283, on March 15. CEO Stéphane Bancel said they expect the new vaccine to be “refrigerator-stable” and it could “facilitate easier distribution and administration, including potentially for developing countries.” First-generation surprisePfizer and Moderna’s first mRNA vaccines have also turned out to be a lot hardier than initially thought. Pfizer’s -80°C requirement is old news now. Long-term studies showed the vaccine kept well between -25°C and -15°C for up to two weeks. The US Food and Drug Administration approved this new storage advice on February 25. Moderna now claims its existing vaccine (mRNA-1273) can be kept at 2°C-8°C for up to three months. Initially, it was considered safe at this temperature for only one month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/worlds-best-vaccines-could-soon-come-to-poor-countries/articleshow/82512515.cms||Abhilash Gaur
---||Chandigarh||Six from Tikri border protest site booked for gang rape of activist||ROHTAK/BATHINDA: In a first incident of its kind at the farmers’ protest site, the Haryana Police on Sunday night booked six persons for gang rape and abduction of a 25-yearold activist at Tikri border. The accused, identified as Anil Malik, Anup Singh, Ankush Sangwan and Jagdish Brar along with two women, had pitched tents at Tikri border under the banner of Kisan Social Army and have been booked under sections 365, 342, 376-D, 506, 120-B of the Indian Penal Code. According to the details in the FIR, a delegation of farmers, including the accused, had held a public meeting in Hooghly, Bengal, on April 1. The victim, an artist and designer, had come in contact with them and she convinced her parents to allow her to go to a protest site in Delhi to support the farmers. On April 11, on the way to Punjab on train, accused Anil Malik tried to force himself upon her but she resisted and asked him to go away. On April 12, on reaching Delhi border protest site, the victim was forced to share the tent with the accused as she was alone, the FIR stated. She told her father on phone that the accused had not been decent with her and was trying to pressurise and blackmail her. Her family brought the issue to the notice of farm leaders and her statement was video-recorded. She was shifted to another tent with women protesters. However, the victim developed fever on April 21 and was shifted to hospital where she was diagnosed with Covid-19. When her father joined her at the Delhi hospital for treatment, she confided in him that she had been sexually assaulted on the train and in the tent by the accused. No farmer leader willing to explain delay in filing of FIR She also requested that the accused be punished but without harming the farmers’ movement. She died during treatment at a private hospital on April 30. No farmer leader was willing to explain the reason for the delay in filing of the FIR in the case especially as the victim had complained against the accused at Tikri border and had been shifted from the tent of the accused much before she fell ill and before her death had recorded a video statement that was shared with farmer leaders. The SKM leaders said after they came to know that a woman has been sexually harassed at Tikri border, they investigated the matter and did not want to make any comment without verifying the exact details. “After it was ascertained that the woman’s claim was correct, we started the action.” However, SKM failed to explain why they did not approach the police as the woman’s claim was authenticated four days ago and the Kisan Social Army camp was removed from the site. “Most of the SKM leaders knew about the incident, we are surprised why they kept silent and did not allow us to meet her father, who was under immense pressure. If any leaders are at fault, they too should be asked about all what happened and why there was delay in taking action,” BKU Ekta Ugrahan woman wing head Harinder Kaur Bindu told TOI. BKU Ekta Ugrahan president Joginder Singh Ugrahan, whose organization has a massive presence at Tikri border, told TOI when the matter was brought to their notice they conducted a preliminary inquiry and found the victim’s statement to be true. “The accused have been removed from the protest site and an FIR has been registered against the accused, the SKM leadership stands in support of the victim's family,” he said, adding: “No one is permitted to misbehave with the women and SKM is ready to provide any kind of help to the victim’s family in ensuring justice in the case.” Sanyukt Kisan Morcha on Sunday gave a call for social boycott of all accused who sexually harassed the victim. The Morcha on Sunday clarified that it will engage in legal fight against the accused and will stand by the aggrieved family. The morcha has also decided to set up a committee where complaints of harassment of women could be made. Punjab Kisan Union leader Jasbir Kaur Natt, who was in direct contact of the woman before her demise, told TOI: “it is matter of serious concern which needs to be debated threadbare. Here at protest there is no difference between males and females and women in large numbers are participating. The farmers will investigate and ensure no such thing is allowed to happen again.” In a statement issued on Sunday in the names of ninemember committee of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha stated that when the case came to fore the morcha committees decided to take stern action against the accused. The Tikri committee removed the tent of Kisan Social Army and announced ouster of the accused from the movement apart from giving call for social boycott of the accused. The SKM said that Kisan Social Army was not its authorised representative and its social media handle was not associated directly with SKM.

So the patient keeps on running from one place to the other even as his oxygen level continues to fall,” the Union minister said. In the open letter, the Bareilly MP alleged that there was rampant hoarding of oxygen cylinders with many dealers selling it at higher prices. He also complained that medical equipment like monitors and ventilators were being sold in the market at exorbitant rates. He urged the CM to fix the price of the equipment. Gangwar also requested the state government to provide 50% subsidy to private hospitals for setting up oxygen plants, on the lines of Madhya Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-management-in-bareilly-poor-gangwar-tells-yogi/articleshow/82512529.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Chandigarh||As supply lines choke, PGI stares at oxygen crisis in Punjab||CHANDIGARH: The refusal of the UT administration to one of the suppliers to provide PGI with a type of oxygen cylinders on Saturday and Punjab not allowing refilling of tanks could push the premier medical institute into a crisis. Sources said a truck sent by PGI was refused for oxygen refilling at Mandi Gobindgarh. On Sunday, 62 b type cylinders of PGI were filled up by UT administration out of its own oxygen quota, as mentioned in a media release from the administration. However, it is still to meet the ever-increasing demand of oxygen in the 447-bed Covid hospital in PGI. Doctors explain the surge of moderate to severe cases had resulted in increasing the bed capacity from 200 to 447. “We have almost been begging for oxygen cylinders for our patients from Chandigarh and Punjab. It is almost like a crisis, as faced in Delhi,” said a doctor. “We have maximum patients of Covid from Punjab, yet we were refused for refilling at Mandi Gobindgarh. However, the issue was resolved with the intervention of authorities,” said a faculty member. At the same time, recovery and OT rooms and other places have been converted into ICUs. These places do not have oxygen pipes and patients need cylinders. 76 ventilators for Covid patients A senior doctor said, “Also, with an increase in the number of patients on ventilators and nasal hydrocannula— a device used to deliver an increased oxygen airflow to a patient in need of respiratory help,— there is a slight dip in pressure gradient in those areas where oxygen pipes are fitted. To decrease this load, oxygen cylinders are required in addition to the liquid medical oxygen coming from the pipes.” “The process for the installation of one more oxygen storage tank is under way. The possibilities to have an independent oxygen plant for the institute are being explored,” said PGI spokesperson Dr Ashok. Presently, there are180 ventilators for non-Covid patients and 76 for Covid ones. “It was not anticipated that the institute which used to require not more than 13 MT of oxygen will still need more out of the 22,” said a faculty member at PGI. The faculty said, “There are over 400 patients admitted and majority under high flow oxygen, while some are on ventilators. With more than 250 ventilators both for non-Covid and Covid patients, there is a high demand for medical gases in the institute now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/as-supply-lines-choke-pgi-stares-at-oxygen-crisis-in-punjab/articleshow/82512532.cms||Shimona Kanwar

On the line is a woman from Gurugram asking about the process involved in adoption of a child who has lost both parents to Covid-19. Soon after a 27- year - old man calls from Delhi with queries related to adoption. Another caller from Madhya Pradesh says his family wants to adopt a child who has lost his parents to the pandemic and they have been making inquiries with hospitals. These are some of the calls received over the last fortnight by counsellors at the tele-counselling toll free number (SAMVEDNA - 1800-121-2830) steered by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights. In the last week alone, around 17 callers reached out to SAMVEDNA with queries for adoption of children orphaned in the second wave of the pandemic. According to NCPCR, in keeping with protocol, each caller is informed that adoption can be done only through a laid out legal procedure under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 and through the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA). They further share the legal procedure and information about how a call should be placed to Childline 1098 immediately for intervention, the role of police and also information on contacting the child welfare committee and CARA. NCPCR also plans to followup and track these cases through the call recordings in the coming days. In the backdrop of reports regarding children orphaned due to loss of parents to Covid-19 pandemic and posts circulating on social media, both the ministry of women and child development and NCPCR have written to states on measures related to rehabilitation of such children to ensure safety and prevent trafficking. Also WCD ministry has asked the ministry of health and family welfare and sought that a column may be added to hospital admission forms seeking details of a trustworthy person to whom children be handed over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/queries-on-adopting-covid-orphans-flood-helplines/articleshow/82512541.cms||Ambika Pandit

In the affidavit, the Centre said, “Price factor (of the vaccines) will not have any impact on the ultimate beneficiary, namely the eligible person getting the vaccine since all state governments have already declared their policy decision that each state will be administering vaccine to its residents, free of cost.” It added, “Due to consultations and ‘persuasion’ by the Centre, both the manufacturers of vaccine, Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India, have declared their respective prices which are uniform for all state governments. It is pertinent to note that the central government by nature of its large vaccination programme, places large purchase orders for vaccines as opposed to the state governments and/or private hospitals and, therefore, this reality has some reflection in the prices negotiated.” “Thus, while it is ensured that the two vaccine manufacturers are not unduly enriched from out of public money, the citizens are not supposed to make any payment for getting both doses of the vaccine.” However, it also said the economics of the vaccine manufacturers must be borne in mind. “Till date, there are only vaccines available from two vaccine manufacturers. Both manufacturers have taken financial risk in developing and manufacturing these jabs and it is prudent to take decisions on pricing through negotiations in a transparent consultative process keeping statutory provisions as a last resort under the present circumstances,” it said. “With a view to ensure that there is no disparity between the states inter-se, with active consultation of the Centre with both the firms, the Centre has fixed uniform prices to be paid by all states,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/differential-pricing-of-jabs-wont-impact-citizens-centre/articleshow/82512545.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The details have to be filled up at the time of hospital admission. The state will also give Rs 2,000 per child per month to their caretakers along with the other facilities, Rekha Arya, state minister for women and child development said on Sunday. “We will extend all possible financial help for the education and well-being of the children to their guardian who should ideally be a close family member,” Arya said. Arya said the measure aims at preventing the children from falling into the hands of human traffickers. “We are also taking the help of over 20 NGOs to take care of all such children if the situation calls for it,” she said. The director of the state WCD department, Yogendra Yadav, said they are working towards giving a ‘home environment’ to an orphaned child rather than send them to a shelter home straight away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uttarakhand-to-give-rs-2k/month-to-caretaker-of-every-orphan/articleshow/82512549.cms||Shivani Azad

Johl (92) started his career as landscape designer at the famous Pinjore Mughal Gardens after obtaining a Master’s degree from the PAU, Ludhiana, in 1955. He then worked for two decades as head of Chandigarh’s landscaping wing under the legendary Dr M S Randhawa. Johl also managed the greens and groves of Chandigarh Golf Club in the 1960s and 1970s when the iconic ‘nursery of Indian golf ’ was in its nascent stages. The nursery also groomed his sons, architect Ajai Johl and Amandeep Johl, who were golfing contemporaries of Indian legend Jeev Milkha Singh and they won laurels on the national amateur and international professional circuits respectively. “We came to Chandigarh when it was a bare landscape riven by sandstorms. My late husband worked his heart out to green it with rare and diverse flora from different regions of India and countries of the globe. The Rose Garden was a product of his expertise and design. From the sands and piercing dust, emerged the roses and flowering trees of Chandigarh because of the work done in those decades,” a bereaved Gurbrinder K Johl told TOI. Johl went on to head the Punjab government’s Landscape Circle and was appointed advisor to PUDA. His master projects included Punjabi University campus, Patiala, Rail Coach Factory, Kapurthala, and the historical city of Anandpur Sahib. Apart from contributing articles to prominent newspapers, Johl distilled his knowledge in two authoritative volumes cowritten with the renowned Chandigarh-based architect, Sarbjit Singh Bahga, and titled, ‘Trees in Urban Habitat’, and ‘Landscaping Human Habitat’. The first volume represents a study of tree plantations of Lutyen's Delhi and Corbusier's Chandigarh. Kaim silent witness to city’s greening His intimate knowledge of arid Chandigarh's greening was such that he could recall where precisely a very rare tree such as the Kaim (Mitragyna parvifolia) could be found: along the slip road branching from Madhya Marg to GMSH, Sector 16, and bang in the centre of the CGC's 7th hole fairway, which is reckoned as one of the toughest par-5 holes in India. The Kaim planted by Johl is one of the principal factors that make the 7th hole so daunting a challenge for the best of golfers. The Kaim is a silent witness to Chandigarh's iconic greening and landscaping history and it will in that spirit mourn its mentor, who passed gently into the night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/stalwart-of-chandigarhs-greening-passes-away/articleshow/82512578.cms||VIKRAM JIT SINGH

Writing to the PM with six suggestions on ways to overcome the crisis, Kharge echoed the views of party president Sonia Gandhi, former PM Manmohan Singh and MP Rahul Gandhi, who have all written to the government emphasising on the need for an all-party meeting. He said that while most nations had planned in advance, prioritised their people and put in place contingencies for the anticipated second and third waves of the pandemic, such plans appeared to be missing in the Indian context. “Experts have warned us that although the situation is dire, it can become far worse if leadership is not immediately exercised. So, for the well-being of our people and in the national interest, I urge you to consider the suggestions outlined in this letter,” Kharge said. Among key suggestions, he said the government must use the Rs 35,000 crore allocated in the Union budget for free mass vaccination, adding that allowing private firms to set differential prices for vaccines would adversely impact Indians. “I, therefore, urge you to not relinquish the state’s moral duty in immunising citizens. This is completely doable because India has a history of successful, large-scale immunisation programmes,” he added. Kharge reiterated Congress’s demand to leverage compulsory licensing to increase vaccine production, besides waiver of GST on vaccines, PPE kits, ventilators and oxygen equipment. He said the government should expedite distribution of relief material from foreign countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kharge-sends-modi-6-covid-suggestions-seeks-all-party-meeting/articleshow/82512587.cms||---

Apart from the 590 metric tonnes of daily liquid medical oxygen quota currently devised by the Union government for Andhra Pradesh, the state government has recently floated tenders to purchase liquid oxygen from foreign companies.  The successful bidder has to supply 200 metric tonnes of oxygen a day for 60 days. A special focus has been laid on oxygen management in view of recent technical glitches in supply at various hospitals across the state. Due to the sudden spurt in the demand for oxygen, there have been instances of black-marketing of oxygen cylinders and related devices. The state government has constituted a state oxygen war room and directed the districts to set up district oxygen war rooms along similar lines to ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply to the consuming points. Meanwhile, the state government has given its administrative sanction to the tune of Rs 310 crore to set up pressure swing adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen generation plants at 49 locations and to procure 50 cryogenic tanker vehicles for oxygen supply and storage. Special chief secretary, industries and commerce department, R Karikal Valaven, has been appointed as the officer in-charge for coordinating the movement and supply of liquid oxygen from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. After hypoxia had emerged as the new focus area in Covid-19 treatment during the early months of the first wave last year, oxygen lines were created for nearly 28,000 beds. Covid-19 treatment facilities were at the time supplied with pulse oximetres to detect cases of ‘happy hypoxia’ or ‘silent hypoxia’ in patients. Due to the compromised lung function and capacity following Covid-19 infection in some patients, oxygen cannot reach the red blood cells, leading to hypoxia. At the peak of the first wave in September last year, only some 1,600 critical cases had required ICU facility, while some 7,000 patients were treated with supplemental oxygen. But of the nearly 1.9 lakh active cases as of Sunday, May 9, about 6,300 patients are receiving intensive care and 22,000 patients are on oxygen beds. The peak liquid medical oxygen demand during the first wave was only 260 metric tonnes a day, and that too this peak quantum was used only for two to three days. The state, however, supplied about 560 tonnes to various hospitals on Sunday. Principal secretary, health department, Anil Kumar Singhal, said that the oxygen demand may increase in the coming weeks. “We have requested the Union government to increase AP’s daily oxygen supply quota. The 49 PSA plants at the district, teaching and area hospitals would be ready within the next three months,” said Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/managing-o2-supply-is-now-key-to-tackling-second-wave/articleshow/82505294.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Officials are also mulling placing markings at the vegetable stalls to ensure that the public follows the social distancing protocol. The MVP rythu bazaar has been shifted to Alwar Das playground at MVP Colony in the city. The rythu bazaar at Alwar Das stadium is one of the biggest of its kind under Visakha East constituency and draws a large number of people. Keeping in view the needs of residents of Peda Waltair and surrounding areas, officials have set up a rythu bazaar at AU College of Engineering grounds. Besides relocating rythu bazaars, officials have set up 10 mobile rythu bazaars. However, traders at rythu bazaars said with the rise in Covid-19 cases in the city, the number of consumers has fallen and their businesses have taken a hit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/rythu-bazaars-go-mobile-to-rein-in-covid-spread/articleshow/82505369.cms||---

Annandd Rao, who practices numerology as a hobby, has set up a banner asking the public to use the changed spelling. “If you use the changed spelling of ‘Caronaa’ and ‘Covviyd-19’ and affix the same to either doors or in public places, ‘Caronaa’ will disappear not only from Anantapur district, but also from the world. This is guaranteed as it is divine power as per numerology,” reads the banner. Speaking to TOI, Annandd Rao said he has carried out nearly nine years of research in numerology. “The existing name ‘Corona’ adds up to a dangerous number, causing unimaginable devastation to the entire world. If we fill the spelling with divine power, it will create an aura leading to the complete disappearance of the virus. Similar benefits can be achieved by changing the spelling of Covid-19 to ‘Covviyd-19’,” claimed Annandd Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/man-says-change-covid-to-covviyd-to-end-pandemic/articleshow/82505336.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

These hospitals will cater only to emergency services in non-Covid cases while all taluk hospitals have been asked to keep at least five oxygen beds and bipap ventilators for oxygen support ready. The state on Sunday logged 35,801 new cases, taking the caseload to 18,72,573 and the test positivity rate to 28.88%. Active cases stood at 4,23,514 while the toll mounted to 5,814, with 68 more deaths. The new guidelines for hospitals, which said the state was experiencing the worst phase of the pandemic, have directed converting all fever clinics to Covid clinics. The Covid OPs should provide necessary consultation, lab services and medicines to patients. The state was taking concerted efforts to contain the epidemic and provide efficient healthcare to patients. All primary and family healthcare centres should ensure the stock of steroids and oral anticoagulants, it said. If bedridden patients are testing positive, oxygen concentrators should be arranged at their homes and home care provided. The department has also directed providing other treatment support through palliative care volunteers at the panchayat level, it said. Counsellors with the district health administration should ensure that patients in home isolation are regularly contacted to assess their health status. The department has also asked private hospitals to increase the Covid oxygen and ICU beds to a minimum of 50% capacity. It has also directed them to start Covid OPs with necessary investigation and treatment facilities. Healthcare personnel have been asked to use disposable gowns, gloves, N95 masks and face shields inside hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/health-department-tells-all-hospitals-govt-and-private-to-focus-on-covid-care/articleshow/82512609.cms||Jipson Sikhera
---||Bengaluru||Vaccination for 18+ in Karnataka from today, shortage to hit drive||BENGALURU: Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar on Sunday announced that the vaccination drive for those in the 18-44 age group will start in government hospitals from Monday. However, government officials said there is not enough vaccine to ensure an uninterrupted vaccine campaign in the coming weeks. This is the second start for the campaign in 10 days. On May 1, chief minister BS Yediyurappa soft-launched the drive with 3.5 lakh doses in the government’s kitty and only 10,000 in the targeted group have been administered shots against Covid-19 till date. The 18-44 age group has 3.2 crore people in Karnataka, and the government requires at least 6.5 crore doses to cover the two-jab regime. In confirmation of acute shortage, the government, with its dwindling stock of vaccines, on Saturday decided to vaccinate only those who are getting the second dose in the 45-plus age bracket with the existing vials. “Given the situation, we cannot offer assurance that vaccination for 18+ will be continuous from Monday. The best we can assure (citizens) is that we will provide vaccines based on availability and hold sessions as and when we get delivery (of vaccines),” said chief secretary P Ravikumar. Sudhakar said in a tweet that the government has placed orders for 2 crore doses of Covishield, and Serum Institute of India delivered 3.5 lakh doses on Saturday night, taking the total to 6.5 lakh. The government has placed an order for 1 crore doses of Covaxin, but there is no clarity on the delivery timeline. Senior officials said that the next consignment of Covishield with 3 lakh doses is expected in the third week of May, but that is not enough to fast-track administration of vaccine as nearly 50,000 Covid-19 fresh cases are being reported in the state every day. Co-Win registration must, no walk-in for 18-44 age groupThe minister said that those above 18 years will get vaccination at major government hospitals -- KC General, Jayanagar General Hospital, Sir CV Raman General Hospital, ESI Hospital and Nimhans in Bengaluru -- and district hospitals for the time being. The government will soon allow taluk hospitals and primary health centres to give vaccination at a later stage. Beneficiaries must register on Co-Win and there is no walk-in for the18-44 age group. “The government is leaving no stone unturned to vaccinate each and every citizen at the earliest. I urge my young friends to make use of the opportunity,” said the minister. Soon after the minister’s announcement, eligible people rushed to Co-Win portal for registration. While the portal allowed registration, the scheduling of time slots was not possible as it displayed a message: “No vaccine centre is available for booking.” Officials said they were distributing vaccines among the centres till Sunday night and Co-Win portal would allow booking of time slots once the distribution is done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/vaccination-for-18-in-karnataka-from-today-shortage-to-hit-drive/articleshow/82512618.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

---||Business||Copper hits lifetime high over bets on green energy||Copper soared this week to an all-time high, continuing a sizzling rally that’s seen prices double in the past year. The previous copper record was set in 2011, around the peak of the commodities supercycle sparked by China’s rise to economic heavyweight status — fueled by massive amounts of raw materials. This time, investors are betting that copper’s vital role in the world’s shift to green energy will mean surging demand and even higher prices. Copper futures rose as high as $10,440 a ton in London on Friday. The reddish brown metal is mostly unrivaled as an electrical and thermal conductor, while also being durable and easy to work with. Today, a vast array of uses in all corners of heavy industry, construction and manufacturing mean it’s a famously reliable indicator for trends in the global economy. The copper market was one of the first to react as Covid emerged in Wuhan, with prices slumping by more than a quarter between January and March last year. Then as China’s unprecedented steps to control the domestic spread of the virus started to yield results, copper rapidly rebounded — and it hasn’t looked back since. But it’s not just China driving the rally. While the country accounts for half of the world’s copper consumption and has played an integral part in copper’s surge, demand there has actually softened this year. Yet prices continue to drive higher||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/copper-hits-lifetime-high-over-bets-on-green-energy/articleshow/82512634.cms||---

We have also tied up with hyperlocal delivery companies. Our average ticket size for essentials is around Rs 1,500 for this service, which is far higher than that of onlineonly players in the space,” said a senior executive at Future Group. “No other player currently delivers in two hours.” Big Bazaar’s move comes at a time, when the debt-laden Future Group is looking at ways to put its assets to better use, while its Rs 24,700-crore proposed deal with Reliance (RIL) hangs in the balance. RIL had announced in August last year that it was buying out the retail and wholesale business of Future Group, but Amazon — with a minority stake in an unlisted Future Group company — subsequently dragged the Mumbai-headquartered retailer to court, alleging that the proposed deal violated contractual agreements. A Future Group spokesperson refused to comment, while a questionnaire emailed to Amazon remained unanswered till the time of going to the press. “Apart from the ‘Asli Dukan’ moniker, we have played on the word ‘Amazing’ by using terms such as Amazing Service, Amazing Prices, Amazing Products and Amazing Deals,” said the executive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/big-bazaars-marketing-push-takes-on-amazon/articleshow/82512641.cms||John Sarkar
---||Business||India’s import checks face scrutiny at WTO||NEW DELHI: India’s recent import curbs have come under scrutiny at the World Trade Organization (WTO), with several trading partners raising concerns over the checks placed by the government as part of its policy to encourage domestic production. At a recent meeting of the committee on market access, the concerns expressed by the trading partners ranged from tyres and air-conditioners to pulses. Besides, China lodged a protest against higher customs duty on telecom equipment and some other products. Companies from China, including several global giants from the US and Europe, which were exporting goods from across the border have reason to worry, and Beijing’s concern may be a reflection of that worry. In addition, Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE are facing restrictions on supply of 5G equipment. Similarly, the European Union raised concerns about India´s import policies on tyres. Last summer, the government had decided to licence the import of tyres into the country, moving it out of the open general list. The decision, cheered by domestic manufacturers, has faced criticism from several multinational players. Further, India’s restrictions on air conditioners were flagged by Japan, although some of the Japanese AC manufacturers were part of the deliberations that led to the curbs. Facing nearly 95% import of components, the government had identified ACs as an item for domestic production boost. It is now part of the list of products where the government has launched production-linked incentives. Apart from the manufacturing sector, the government decided to impose quantitative restrictions on certain pulses, resulting in complaints by Australia, Canada, the EU, the Russian Federation and the US at the WTO’s committee on market access. Even last year, some of the players had expressed their displeasure. The government, however, believes that the steps taken by it are in line with the WTO norms and most countries resort to these tools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indias-import-checks-face-scrutiny-at-wto/articleshow/82512650.cms||Sidhartha

The state recorded 23,333 cases which was around 3,500 less than 26,847 recorded on Saturday. The number of deaths, however, continued to remain pegged at 296, which was marginally down from Saturday's figure of 298. The number of active cases also recorded a downward trend - it came from 2,45,726 to 2,33,981 within 24 hours. Additional chief secretary, medical and health, Amit Mohan Prasad, asked people to stay cautious and all precautions despite the improvement in situation. The decline in the number of cases came in even as the state government extended the partial corona lockdown by a week till May 17. Lucknow continued to top the chart with 1,436 new corona cases, which was a considerable drop from Saturday's 2179. The state capital was followed by Meerut which recorded 1,425 cases of infection. Varanasi and Gorakhpur recorded 909 and 947 fresh cases, respectively. Lucknow, at the same time, saw 3546 people getting discharged from the hospital, which was, however, lesser in comparison to 4,515 people getting discharged a day ago. More number of people getting discharged in comparison to fresh cases, experts said, could potentially lessen the immense pressure on the state health system. This was, however, not the case with Meerut where the number of people getting discharged from hospital dropped from 1,623 to 1,362 within 24 hours. According to the health bulletin, the state government carried out 2,29,186 tests, taking the total numbers of tests conducted since the outbreak of pandemic last year to over 4.29 crore. Of the total tests conducted, over 15 lakh people have tested positive for the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fresh-coronavirus-cases-drop-in-up-but-virus-remains-lethal/articleshow/82512652.cms||---

Source said Ganesh and his son Shashidhar, from Chintamani taluk of the district, allegedly used inappropriate language against district minister and health minister Dr K Sudhakar and the hospital during their protest. However, Chikkaballapur Town police clarified that the arrest has nothing to do with them allegedly attacking the authorities. Hosp staffer told parents woman died past midnightGanesh’s daughter Anupama tested positive for Covid and was admitted to Covid Hospital in Chikkaballapur early last week. She reportedly told relatives on Wednesday evening that she was healthy and would reutrn home the next day. She was married to Anil, a farmer in the district, and they were expecting their first child next month. After endlessly waiting for Anupama’s call on Thursday morning to bring her home, her parents spoke to a hospital employee, who informed them that the woman died past midnight. Soon, her parents, brother and other relatives rushed to the hospital. They started shouting against the authorities and argued how could a healthy woman die in hours. Her parents and brother expressed anguish. Ganesh and Shashidhar allegedly used derogatory language against the minister in the presence of the public and police personnel. A video of the incident was widely circulated on social media. Sources said grieving relatives were not wearing masks and not maintaining social distance. They entered the hospital premises despite appeals by police. Based on a complaint by a police officer on hospital duty, Chikkaballapur Town police filed a case against Ganesh, Sahashidhar and two other relatives. A police officer said the charges invoked against the accused peresoons relate only to violating Covid norms and disregarding instructions of police personnel on duty. Ganesh and Shashidhar have been arrested. While Shashidhar tested positive for Covid-19 and was admitted to the Chikkaballapur hospital, Ganesh has been sent to district jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-pregnant-woman-dies-in-karnataka-kin-held-for-breaking-norms/articleshow/82512653.cms||Ranganath Krishnaswamy

In an interview with AFP, Soumya Swaminathan warned that “the epidemiological features that we see in India today do indicate that it’s an extremely rapidly spreading variant”. Swaminathan, an Indian paediatrician and clinical scientist, said the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19 was clearly a contributing factor to the catastrophe unfolding in India. “There have been many accelerators that are fed into this,” the 62-year-old said, stressing that “a more rapidly spreading virus is one of them”. The WHO recently listed B.1.617 as a “variant of interest”. Several national health authorities, including in the US and Britain, have said they consider B.1.617 a variant of concern, and Swaminathan said she expected the WHO to soon follow suit. “B.1.617 is likely to be a variant of concern because it has some mutations which increase transmission, and which also potentially could make (it) resistant to antibodies that are generated by vaccination or by natural infection,” she said. But she insisted that the variant alone could not be blamed for the dramatic surge in cases and deaths seen in India, pointing to “huge social mixing and large gatherings” in recent months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/variant-spreading-in-india-could-be-dodging-some-vaccine-protections/articleshow/82512681.cms||---

They had been suspended after Bengaluru South BJP MP Tejasvi Surya read out their names during allegations of a bed allotment scam. He had read out names of 17 Muslim employees when he visited the war room on May 4, giving a communal twist to his claims. The 17 were among 210 contract staff. He later claimed he wasn’t trying to give a communal twist to the case but only read out names given to him. The hiring agency, however, suspended all17 pending a police probe. Special BBMP chief (south zone) Thulasi Maddineni said that 11 had requested their suspension be withdrawn and they be reinstated as it was their livelihood and they would co-operate in the probe. The remaining six had not made a similar request. Thulasi said they’ve written to the agency to hire them and allow them to return to work. Surya declined to comment on the reinstatement. No proof yet of 17 staffers’ role: CopsA nother the hiring senior agency official had said suspended them to keep them away from the controversy. A police officer probing the scam said they questioned all 17 suspended employees but were yet to find anything conclusive about their involvement in the scam. Four others, including two contract BBMP doctors and a social worker and her associate, have been arrested. Following Surya’s allegation, all 210 employees’ contact numbers were shared on social media and there were insinuations of “terrorists” being at work. On May 6, Surya visited the war room and reportedly apologised for the inconvenience caused but later his office claimed it was fake news. However, an audio clip of Surya reportedly apologising went viral.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-bbmp-to-rehire-11-of-17-staffers-suspended-after-tejasvi-suryas-claim/articleshow/82512684.cms||Kiran Parashar

The 56-year-old spoke with attorneys from several firms as early as October 2019, saying the marriage was “irretrievably broken”, the newspaper reported on Sunday, citing documents and people familiar with the matter. Her unease about her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein dates back to at least 2013, the paper said. New York Times in October 2019 reported that Bill Gates had met with Epstein several times, and once stayed late at his townhouse in New York. A spokeswoman for Gates said at the time that the meetings had centered on philanthropy. Epstein had died in jail two months prior while awaiting trial on federal charges related to sex trafficking. The divorce was negotiated during the pandemic, involving legal teams working with a mediator to divide their fortune, which the Bloomberg Billionaires Index pegs at $145 billion. The couple said this week that they plan on remaining co-chairs of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and will continue to jointly lead. They’ve vowed to give away the vast majority of their wealth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/gates-divorce-talks-began-in-19-partly-due-to-epstein/articleshow/82512691.cms||---

This has been primarily due to the less number of people getting recovered during these days. The number of active cases has crossed1 lakh mark on May 8 as there were 102486 active cases which further increased to108913 on May 9. But on May 3, there were only 85750 active cases in the state. Thus there has been an increase of 23163 in number of active cases in just past six days which is an increase of 27%. However, as the government is increasing its hospitalisation capacity in the eye of the anticipated third wave of Covid-19, there are still more than 960 ICU beds which are empty despite the fact that the state is having so many active cases for the first time. When the increase in the number of active cases is considered, of the total increase of around 23163 in the past six days, half has only been reported from five districts namely Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Ratlam and Rajgarh. In terms of numbers, it is Indore that has seen maximum increase in active cases as 5463 active cases were added in past six days, followed by Bhopal where 2951 active cases were added. But when seen in terms of growth it is mainly the smaller districts. Rajgarh has seen a growth of more than 100% in the number of active cases which increased to1576 from 772 on May 3, in just six days. Districts like Harda, Khargone, Panna and Burhanpur have also seen more growth in active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/in-six-days-active-cases-up-27-in-bhopal-4-other-cities/articleshow/82512700.cms||Amarjeet Singh

---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Expatriates take Uzbek route to beat Gulf travel ban||KOZHIKODE: Expatriates seem to go to any length to overcome the current ban on flights from India to many Gulf countries including Oman and UAE. Travel agencies have started taking bookings for tickets in charter flights from Kerala to Oman via Uzbekistan, which includes a 14-day stay in the Central Asian country. Travel agencies have been looking at new ways to overcome the ban on direct flights from India to UAE and Oman that came into force on April 24 after the transit routes initially used to reach Gulf through countries like Nepal and Maldives were blocked after those countries tightened norms for Indian passengers. The temporary suspension of flights from India was announced following a surge in cases in the second wave of Covid-19. Alhind Travels is accepting bookings from passengers intending to travel from Kozhikode to Oman via Uzbekistan on May 25. The travel firm will fly the passengers in a chartered flight from Calicut International Airport to Tashkent airport and would fly them to Muscat after they complete their 14-day quarantine. "Many people are desperate to travel to the Gulf on account of job and business-related reasons. Currently, people who have to undertake emergency travel to UAE and Saudi Arabia are travelling via Bahrain after undergoing 14-day quarantine there before flying to their destinations. But it is difficult to get visas from Bahrain and it costs around Rs 1.1 lakh for the package," Yassir Mundodan, regional manager of Alhind Travels, said. He added that the travel agency has for the first time started accepting bookings from Calicut International Airport to Oman via Uzbekistan though it is a circuitous one. While the air distance between Kozhikode and Muscat is 2,324 km, the passengers have to fly 3,600 km to reach Tashkent and another 2,100 km from the Uzbek capital to Muscat. "The advantage of transit via Uzbekistan is the country does not insist on 14-day quarantine and passengers can complete their quarantine there without much difficulty. They can fly to Oman after conducting an RT-PCR test after 14 days. Within a day, we received 20 bookings for the 180 seats in the charter flight," he added. The fare package including air tickets and the 14-day stay in Tashkent would cost Rs 1.35 lakh. Oman had announced an indefinite suspension on flights from India from April 24 onwards while UAE had imposed a ten-day ban on the night of April 24 which has been extended further without specifying when it will be lifted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kerala-expatriates-take-uzbek-route-to-beat-gulf-travel-ban/articleshow/82512721.cms||K R Rajeev

The district administration is looking into the possibility of allotting space for the proposed hospital at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Gorakhpur. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who reached Gorakhpur on Sunday evening, is likely to visit the proposed site for the hi-tech hospital on Monday. The CM has directed officials concerned to expedite the process of making Covid hospitals operational. After reaching Gorakhpur in the evening, Yogi inspected the Integrated Covid Command Centre (ICCC) and issued necessary instructions to officials concerned to improve healthcare services. The CM asked officials to take swift action on complaints related to overcharging by hospitals. Later, Yogi reached Gorakhnath temple and took blessings of Baba Gorakshnath. He performed puja and paid floral tributes at the 'samadhi' of Mahant Avaidyanath. He will hold a review meeting with the district administration officials on Monday. CM: Active cases witnessed a downward trend, have reduced by 77K in eight daysHe said: “As a result, the number of active cases have reduced by 77,000 in eight days from 3.10 lakh to 2.33 lakh today.” “On April 24, the number of positive cases detected in 24 hours was 38,000 while today it has reduced to 23,000. The recoveries are rising and the positivity rate has come down in the state as well as in Varanasi. The number of active cases have reduced In Varanasi division as well as in the district,” he added. Referring to oxygen supplies, the CM said, “In normal time, all the hospitals in the state needed 300 MT-400 MT oxygen, but the demand rose massively after the surge in Covid in the second wave. PM Narendra Modi deployed Oxygen Express trains and aircraft of India Air Force to ferry oxygen and helped the state in getting 1000 MT of oxygen per day.” The initiative of PM Modi has led to creation of 750-bed temporary hospital for Covid patients by DRDO here and its 250-bed ICU wing with ventilators is ready to begin from Monday, said Yogi. “The doctors, paramedical and housekeeping staff of Army Medical Corps have reached and the work of two other wings having 500 oxygen supply beds in total will also complete and start operating with the help of staff allotted by BHU,” the CM added. The local administration, police and other departments will assist in administration, fire safety, supplies of power and water. The doctors, paramedical staff and frontline warriors are doing a commendable job and each and every one of us has to be cautious and follow Covid protocols strictly and get a vaccine safety shield, he added. “The vaccination for 18 to 44 year age group people will start in 11 more districts of Uttar Pradesh from Monday. Over 1.37 crore people in 45 years and above age group have been vaccinated in the state while one lakh people in the18 to 44 year age group have also been inoculated,” the CM said. With support of the Union government we have sufficient vaccines in the state. “In order to prevent crowding, the number of vaccination centres is being increased and prior registration has been made mandatory. It will also help in minimizing wastage of vaccine, which has been brought down below 2% now,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/boeing-to-set-up-200-bedcovid-hosp-in-gorakhpur/articleshow/82506169.cms||Arjumand Bano
---||Bengaluru||1.9L fresh Covid cases, over 1L recoveries in Bengaluru from May 1 to 9||BENGALURU: Amid the gloom amplified by deaths due to non-availability of ICU beds, about 1 lakh Covid patients have recovered from May 1 to 9 in Bengaluru against 1.9 lakh new infections in the period. With fear and negativity hanging low, the recovery rate is slowly improving after it plummeted last month following an unprecedented surge in Covid positive cases. The state data shows that 33,000 persons recovered from Covid in the past two days. “Not everyone testing positive is on deathbed. Many are fighting it and emerging victorious. We appeal to the people to shun fear and stay mentally strong by following health protocols, including wearing masks, sanitizing hands and maintaining distance,” a senior health department officer said. Between April 1 and May 9 (part of the second wave), Bengaluru’s Covid count touched 5.3 lakh cases. Of these, 1.8 lakh persons have recovered. The current active cases is 3.5 lakh. Over 3,000 deaths have been reported. City’s positive cases to touch 10L mark soonThe second-wave surge has been sudden, making Bengaluru the second-worst hit city in the country, after Delhi, on the Covid count and the city’s total positive cases is set to touch the 10-lakh mark soon. “The city’s recovery rate, which was a whopping 98% in the first week of March, has plunged to around 62% now. Even as positive cases are increasing, the number of daily discharges (of recovered patients) is also on the rise. In the coming days, it will outclass the number of active cases,” said an independent data-tracker. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, caught off-guard by the Covid deluge, has initiated measures to ensure more patients recover quickly. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta told TOI: “This is a pandemic and we are doing our best to ensure the system responds to the people in need of medical help, especially oxygen. We’ve added 620 oxygen beds in the past five days. We’ll add 2,000 beds in the next week.” He said the focus is now on preventing deaths by improving the oxygen-related infrastructure and added that the BBMP had operationalized more than 10 oxygen stabilization centres. The civic agency has also deployed 350 oxygen concentrators. Admitting gaps in Covid testing and up to four days of delay in results, Gupta said a decision had been taken to reduce reckless testing and ensure laboratories give results in 24 hours. “Nearly 80% labs have started giving results within a day,” he added. As soon as a person tests positive, the procedures are completed quickly and the person is advised on treatment — stay in isolation or get hospitalized. “Follow-up calls are made to check on patients’ condition,” he said, adding the BBMP wants to ensure patients get timely treatment and recover faster. Public-health experts said the number of Covid patients getting discharged from hospitals is increasing despite daily spikes, since patients who don’t require critical care are told to go home on the fourth or fifth day of achieving clinical stability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/1-9l-fresh-covid-cases-over-1l-recoveries-in-bengaluru-from-may-1-to-9/articleshow/82512723.cms||Rakesh Prakash

Closed for past one year now, many schools that partially opened classes for 9 to 12, were forced to stop owing to the second wave of Covid pandemic. As such, almost 50% schools have either closed or they are on the verge of closure. For past over a year, the schools have been closed. December had bought a ray of hope when state government agreed to allow them to open partial classes from class 9 to 12 since December 18. The state government was about to open schools for rest of the classes but that could not happen after curfew was imposed since April 12. Adding to their woes, several parents are now reluctant to pay the school fees. “As online classes have taken over the offline classes, parents are not keen to pay all fee. Schools are not asking full fee. Here, situation is such that even schools are not able to get first instalment even after students have started studying in next class,” said Babu Thomas, secretary, association of private un-aided schools. Several schools including MP Board and CBSE have reached to a level where it has become tough for them to open their campuses again. “Forget about opening of schools. There are several schools who have locked their campuses forever,” said Thomas As the schools are facing financial crunch, teachers are yet to get their salaries. A school teacher requesting anonymity said, “I have been working for past several months without being paid in a hope that I will get salary. I can understand the condition of my schools is not good. However, how to survive in such condition for long time.” Thomas urged the state government to help schools in such situation. “Schools have given no relaxation despite the campus are closed for over a year. We only demand waiver in electricity bills and other taxes. This is very much in the hand of the state government,” added Thomas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/fees-unpaid-many-schools-shut-due-to-financial-crunch-seek-government-help/articleshow/82512743.cms||Ramendra Singh

It’s not loss of a month’s business but loss of an entire season of festivals and marriages, when they had thought of making up for the losses incurred during the previous year’s prolonged lockdown. However, the warned second wave of Covid-19 upset all their plans so much so that they are now demanding economic package based on their previous I-T returns so that they could start the business afresh. “Hundreds of marriages were scheduled to take place this year. Garments, jewelry, automobiles, gift shops- traders from across the sectorswere looking to encash on the occasion. They took loans to stuff their shops with a variety of garments, jewelry, crockery and what not. The marriage season last year was ruined by the lockdown but after Diwali, it seemed that the Coronavirus pandemic is receding. Vaccination drive also began in the new year and nobody had anticipated a disastrous second wave. We had thought that what we lost due to lockdown last year would be recovered this year as so many marriages were in the offing but you can see, the district collector has banned marriages in the month of May under section 144 of the CrPC," said secretary of New Market Vypari Mahasangh, Ajay Devnani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/no-buzz-in-biz-traders-seek-i-t-based-relief-package/articleshow/82512759.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||PM Modi assures 100MT oxygen immediately to Karnataka after talks with BS Yediyurappa||BENGALURU: Chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday reportedly requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to increase oxygen allocation to Karnataka when the latter called him to take stock of the Covid-19 situation. Sources close to Yediyurappa said he highlighted oxygen scarcity as the main reason for Covid deaths in Karnataka and requested Modi to allocate more, given the rising demand. It’s said Modi assured him he’d send 100MT immediately and increase allocation to the state gradually. The state’s requirement was assessed at 1,700MT last week and it’s estimated to cross 2,000MT while the Centre’s allocation to Karnataka remains 975 MT. The HC had recently directed the Centre to increase the state’s quota to 1,200 MT and subsequently, the Supreme Court quashed the Centre’s plea to stay the high court’s order. Yediyurappa also apprised the PM about Karnataka’s need for 93 tankers to transport oxygen from various parts of the state. The state currently has17 tankers at its disposal. CM apprised PM about stricter lockdown from todayThe oxygen situation was mainly discussed during the call. The chief minister explained the gravity of the situation by citing the Chamarajanagar tragedy in which 23 persons died in the district hospital due to lack of oxygen. The Prime Minister assured his support,” said an official in the chief minister’s office. Yediyurappa reportedly explained measures taken to contain the pandemic. He apprised Modi about the stricter lockdown clamped from Monday and told him the situation in the state is expected to improve in a fortnight. He also explained the ongoing vaccination drive describing the drive meant for 45-plus as quite successful. Confusion over oxy allocationOver the past 48 hours, confusion prevailed in Karnataka over oxygen supplies being reduced to districts and increased for Bengaluru. The government has reduced allocation to Dharwad from 40 kilolitres of liquid oxygen to 36 kilolitres. According to government sources, a major reason for the confusion has been that the state has decided to take the actual requirement from districts instead of ad hoc assessments by deputy commissioners and district incharge ministers. Senior ministers claim the confusion arose after Karnataka took the May 6 requirement of oxygen from all district administrations to file an affidavit in the Karnataka high court. “However, it is a dynamic situation and caseload sensitive. Hence, we have asked the chief secretary to intervene and clarify on this matter to districts,” said a senior cabinet minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pm-modi-assures-100mt-oxygen-immediately-to-karnataka-after-talks-with-bs-yediyurappa/articleshow/82512784.cms||---

The decision has been taken on the basis of a Supreme Court order, to reduce congestion in the prisons. While the convicted prisoners who are not involved in grave crimes will be given parole of 90 days, the remand prisoners who are not habitual offenders -- and have only one case against them and have committed a crime that will be awarded a penalty of fewer than seven years -- will be given an interim bail on personal bond. A high-powered committee consisting of high court judge C T Ravikumar, additional chief secretary (home and vigilance) T K Jose and DGP and director of prisons and correctional services Rishiraj Singh arrived at the decision. In addition to the convicted prisoners and remand prisoners falling in the aforementioned categories, those who have already been sanctioned parole, and male prisoners above 60 years and female prisoners above 50 years who have not been convicted of treason or drug cases, also will be granted parole. Rishiraj Singh has instructed the authorities of all the prisons across the state to implement the decision of the committee at the earliest. The government had, on May 5, decided to grant two-week parole to all the prisoners. It was then decided that all those prisoners who are eligible for parole in 2021 and those who are willing to go on parole will be granted parole. However, the prisoners who are in the restricted category under rule 397 (L) of the Kerala Prisons and Correctional Services (Management) Rules, 2014, will not be eligible for parole. Those who fall in the categories will enjoy the benefits of the Supreme Court’s latest decision on May 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/1500-convicted-350-in-remand-to-get-parole-in-kerala/articleshow/82512899.cms||---

Doctors say lupus or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks its own tissues, weakening the body. Since lupus patients are put on immune suppressing medications, they are most vulnerable to getting infected by Covid-19. “Studies show that people suffering from autoimmune diseases are at high risk of contracting Covid-19,” said senior rheumatologist Dr Manukonda Muralikrishna. He said the prescribed treatment protocols for lupus patients might increase the risk of infections. He said people with SLE complications must be extra careful and stay at home to keep coronavirus at bay. Muralikrishna said various studies have shown that at least one in every thousand in India fall victims to lupus and most of them are women. The disease, he said, could even become life-threatening among women aged between 15 to 45 years. There are common symptoms for lupus and Covid-19, such as fever, difficulty in breathing, dry cough and chest discomfort. People who have difficulty breathing should immediately consult a physician, doctors recommend. Doctors say that lupus patients, if tested positive for Covid-19, should not stop taking any medications without advice from their physician as suddenly stopping the medication may lead to a flare-up of symptoms, which will place additional stress on the body. They added that patients who are already on steroids should not abruptly stop them and should discuss dosages with their doctor. “Antibodies instead of protecting them from viruses, bacteria and other foreign material, attack their own tissue cells in lupus patients. This makes the patient lose immunity,” said Muralikrishna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/lupus-patients-vulnerable-to-covid-19-caution-experts/articleshow/82505360.cms||Samdani MN

Chandra Maheshwari had suffered 70% burns before she was pulled out of the pyre by her younger sister. She was cremated in Barmer on Sunday. In the last four days, this is the second death in the family. Her father Damodar Das Maheshwari, 70, had died of corona. As he had no son, his three daughters performed the cremation rituals. His daughter Chandra fought with the crematorium officials and they persuaded her that as per guidelines the corona infected bodies have to be burnt in the prescribed crematorium. They took the body to the prescribed crematorium where the daughters were performing the last rites. After lighting the pyre, Chandra suddenly jumped into it and suffered 70% burn injuries. She was pulled out and brought to a hospital from where she was referred to Jodhpur. Sources said Chandra was very much attached to her father.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajasthan-33-year-old-woman-who-jumped-into-burning-pyre-of-her-father-dies/articleshow/82512904.cms||---

These include glass cubicles being set up at all touch points to prevent contact with passengers and using cameras to verify ID cards and air tickets instead of touching them. The cubicles are being set up at all major points inside the airport where security personnel have to interact with the passengers. CISF personnel will be standing inside the cubicle made up of glass, which will avoid direct interaction with passengers and prevent the chances of contracting the virus through aerosols. At the entrance to the airport, CISF personnel will stand inside the cubicle and verify documents and tickets of passengers through cameras. Passengers have to scan the barcode on the tickets at the cubicle to avail entry. "The risk of contracting the virus is high at security check areas where frisking has to be done by officers though they don PPE kits. However, all CISF personnel have received two doses of the vaccine making them more immune to the virus. Those who show symptoms will be immediately quarantined and direct contact between the personnel is limited. Also, CISF personnel are using face-shields too in addition to masks and gloves," said an airport source. Ever since the second wave of the pandemic hit the state, Cial has strengthened safety measures to protect all personnel working at the airport, especially security and ground handling staff who are at the frontline and have to interact with passengers each day. Cial has already provided PPE kits to all employees who come in direct, close contact with passengers. Frequent sanitation of all places, disinfection of cargo, markings on the floor to maintain social distancing, separating counters and cabins using transparent glasses are part of the measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cochin-international-airport-sets-up-glass-cubicles-for-no-contact-verification/articleshow/82512916.cms||---

All major tourist destinations in the hilly district, including Munnar, remain closed and tourism stakeholders are now seeking the support of the government to revive the industry. "May is the main vacation time, but the second wave of Covid-19 has ruined it. Monsoon tourism was another attraction but in the present situation we cannot expect a single tourist," said Gireesh PS, secretary of District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC). After the initial lockdown, the tourism sector in the district had witnessed a noticeable change with lesser-known destinations gaining popularity and it had reportedly helped the industry back to normalcy. "Small destinations such as Panchalimedu and Aruvikkuzhi had gained popularity, due to income sustainability. Most of the domestic tourists visited the rural destinations as they had visited the main tourism destinations once or twice and also because such places were less crowded. Idukki district had emerged as one of the main tourism centres in the state once again. But now the destinations are closed," said Gireesh. According to officials, in 2019, a total of 2,47,392 tourists visited the destinations in Idukki. Post-lockdown, 1,41,396 tourists visited the district, and over 70% tourist inflow was reported compared to last year. Aju Abraham Mathew, general manager of Tall Trees Resort in Munnar said that from December onwards most of the hotels and resorts had received full occupancy. "But after the Covid-19 second wave and lockdown, the situation has changed and the tourism sector is totally isolated. We don't know how to manage the situation." According to tourism stakeholders, once the industry had shown signs of revival after the first wave, resorts had conducted renovation works and vendors had stored goods in the hope of better business. But now, it is understood that many tourism firms are laying off staff. "The second lockdown was totally unexpected and we hope the situation slowly gets back to normal," said Roy, owner of Malabar Chips in Kumily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/second-wave-lockdown-ruin-tourism-revival-plans-in-idukki/articleshow/82512929.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Though the number of discharges (23,515 on Sunday) has been rising steadily, the overall recovery rate is still below 90%. As a result, the number of active cases has increased to 1,44,547. Getting a bed in hospitals has become increasingly difficult as only 20% (12,920) of total Covid beds (64,856) are vacant as on Sunday, according to official data. Of this, only 790 are ICU beds. The situation is worsening in hotspot Chennai, which continues to report the maximum number of new cases (7,130) and deaths (56). Only 11 ICU beds and 245 oxygen beds were available in the district, which has 32,863 active Covid patients. “At a time when people are thronging hospitals and demanding oxygen beds irrespective of the severity, we felt the need to establish more Siddha care centres to treat mild cases,” said Tamil Nadu Health Minister Ma Subramanian, who on Sunday inaugurated a 240-bed facility in Vyasarpadi. He said that 12 more Siddha care centres will be opened this week so that congestion at hospitals gets reduced in the coming days. He was optimistic that the lockdown will help in bringing down the caseload. “It is not that the cases are going to dip right from Tuesday. We might get to know the actual status only after one week. During this period, community transmission might drop. But there is a larger possibility of multiple members from the same families getting infected,” said public health expert K Kolandaisamy. Even after two weeks, authorities should restrict entry of attenders into hospitals, not reopen theatres or dining in hotels and bar entry into shops without ventilation, he added. Not only Chennai, cases and deaths were on the rise in other districts too, such as Coimbatore (2,509 cases and nine deaths), Madurai (1,048 cases and 14 deaths), Trichy (813 cases and 10 deaths) and Salem (639 cases and 4 deaths).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-28897-fresh-cases-236-deaths-1-4-lakh-active-cases/articleshow/82512926.cms||---

The state government officials expect Sterlite Copper to start it by this Wednesday. The company will initially supply 35MT of liquid oxygen. In addition, it has a capacity to fill another 3,000 cylinders per day (30MT) with gaseous oxygen. State-owned Sipcot, which is coordinating with industrial units, is getting ready the required cylinders. "Once Sterlite oxygen is made available, it will help catering to the needs of hospitals in 7-8 districts in south Tamil Nadu. This helps in doing away the need to transport liquid oxygen from other parts of the state and help overcome the major logistics hurdle," official sources in the state government said. According to them, even if there is adequate availability of medical oxygen, the challenge lies in the logistics of transporting it from the place of production to critical areas. "The company plans to ramp up the production to 100MT each of liquid and gaseous oxygen within two weeks. On its part, the state government as well as district administration has provided critical, timely support in reactivating Sterlite's oxygen plant and ensuring all necessary approvals were provided quickly," sources said. However, sources said, there could be a hitch since the local administration is planning to allow local activists into the plant in order to review its functioning. This is in contravention of the Supreme Court's directions, wherein it is only the oversight committee that is mandated to review the operations of the oxygen plant and assure the local community about its functioning, sources pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/expects-sterlite-copper-to-start-oxygen-production-by-wednesday-tamil-nadu-government/articleshow/82513007.cms||D Govardan

---||Kochi||Covid-19: Ernakulam’s active caseload nears total number of healthcare workers in district||KOCHI: Ernakulam’s active caseload is nearing the total number of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the district, further validating the fear of authorities that the health system may collapse any moment if the lockdown is not effective and people refuse to adopt Covid appropriate behaviour. The active caseload touched 67,210 on Sunday. While the number of HCWs in the district comes to around 73,362 (as per the vaccination roster), including both clinical and non-clinical staff in government as well as private sector. High caseload will lead to missing of cases as HCWs cannot attend to huge number of cases and rising deaths. “The number of Covid deaths in the district is also increasing day by day. Already 237 Covid deaths were reported between April 23 and May 5 in Ernakulam. On Thursday alone 40 Covid deaths were reported. If cases are not coming down in line with our expectations and exceed our projections, the situation will turn worse. We will know it in a next few days. We cannot bear the current caseload and HCWs cannot monitor domiciliary care centres and similar facilities. They work in shifts. The burden on HCWs beyond our imagination. The solution is that those under home care do self-monitoring and contact the health facility like telemedicine service nearby if any health issue is developed. Currently those who have minor symptoms are even sent to houses to undergo home care due to high patient load at hospitals. Last year, 10% of total patients were treated at hospitals. Those who have minor symptoms and put under home care should have been currently under treatment in hospitals if the caseload was low. Complications develop in the second week and we should be vigilant at that time. That is the course of the infection,” said a health official. Health department admitted missing of cases due to the rising caseload. 95 per cent of patients are under home care and only five per cent are in hospitals. “We cannot run the system with old staff pattern of HCWs. The treatment is based on protocols and we utilize maximum HCWs. We hired 1,200 health workers, including both doctors and nurses, this time. The other problem we face is that many home care patients in city limits do not know the HCWs in their respective areas. They can contact the Covid control room on 0484 2368802, which is already flooded with calls,” said NHM district programme manager Dr Mathews Numpeli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/covid-19-ernakulams-active-caseload-nears-total-number-of-healthcare-workers-in-kochi/articleshow/82513016.cms||Jipson Sikhera

These are only a few of the several rules residents' welfare associations in the city have rolled out ahead of the full lockdown which is starting from Monday. Residents said that they have to implement stricter rules, like last year, to contain the spread of the virus which is getting deadlier and has claimed too many lives. “The current situation is precarious and we cannot take any chances. We need to do our best to contain the spread,” said Sujatha Y, secretary of The Central Park Apartment Owners Association at OMR. Sujatha said that they have directed the maintenance staff to ensure that all deliveries are left at the gate and all residents must come and collect it themselves, that too, only after the packages are sprayed with disinfectants. “Only milk and newspaper vendors are being allowed as they come early in the morning. They need to be masked compulsorily, and all of them will be checked for temperature at the entrance... they will also have to sanitise their hands before entering.” The rule for domestic workers is no different. At the Casagrand Irene Owners Welfare Association, Manapakkam, the members have also closed their swimming pools and clubhouse to avoid gatherings. If residents want to go for a walk, they must wear a mask and maintain social distancing. “We have also installed the MyGate app on our phones to monitor the details of delivery agents, we take note of what time they enter the building and when they leave... they shouldn’t be in the campus for more than four minutes,” said SL Denis, secretary of the association. A few associations have also asked their maintenance staff to work in shifts. At The Central Park, one set of workers will stay back at the complex for a week and leave after the next set arrives. Residents have also been asked to avoid calling guests home unless there is an emergency and the number must be restricted to four. “Luckily our residents are very cooperative, and everyone knows the rules from last year's experience,” said Harsha Koda, cofounder of the Federation of OMR Residents Association (FOMMRA). Currently, the members of this association are busy collating databases of people who need to be vaccinated. “We have collaborated with primary health centers in the area and are making a list of people who need to get their second shots or both. We are also making a list of people above 18 years of age, so that once the drive starts we can help them get the vaccines,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-rwas-implement-new-rules-ahead-of-lockdown/articleshow/82513071.cms||Aditi R

As per the estimates on demand, supply and consumption of oxygen in hospitals being monitored by the war room in the district, approximately 9,800 litres of oxygen was consumed by MCH in 23 hours between Saturday and Sunday. Such is the rate at which oxygen is needed in MCH and a few private hospitals where patients under critical care are being treated. The 24-hour war room set up by the district administration is working non-stop to cater to the demand from the government and private hospitals. Nearly 400 cylinders of B (1,200 litres) and D (around 7,000 litres) types are being supplied to around 20 private hospitals daily. MCH alone gets a supply of 8.5kl of oxygen per day while private hospitals place demand for above 4kl oxygen per day. “We can’t say that we are in a comfortable situation, but we are managing the current demand. We have effected various steps to procure, refill, supply and monitor the usage. Majority of the demand is from the MCH because the patient load is very high and many of them are in critical care. Besides, demand is also coming from private hospitals treating Category C patients,” said district development commissioner Vinay Goel. The team at the war room collects information about availability of oxygen. It is collected and sent to agencies for conversion from industrial oxygen to medical use oxygen. This is filled and kept in the stock. Nodal officers with private hospitals update regularly on oxygen modules on Covid jagratha portal. All real-time data on present availability, demand and infrastructure is keyed in based on patient capacity. The team at the war room go through the demand and take steps to ensure the supply. “As part of the oxygen audit we have also ensured that the technician who uses oxygen cylinders/manifold cylinders is trained and hands on. We have conducted an online training for the technicians. We have also formed a district-level team to make sure that no hospital uses more oxygen than that is actually required. Using the patient data, we can assess the need and random surprise checks are done to find out if the hospital uses it fairly and transparently. We are also maintaining a buffer stock in addition to all these measures” said Goel. As many as 12 major private hospitals are also being monitored using executive magistrates. Dr Ajesh, nodal officer of oxygen supply in the war room, said that multiple filling of cylinders is a huge challenge even while meeting the requirements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/covid-19-in-thiruvananthapuram-oxygen-war-room-clocks-24-hours-to-meet-soaring-demand/articleshow/82513138.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Kochi||Kerala: Local bodies seek govt nod to procure vaccine directly||KOCHI: With delay in conducting vaccination drives, local bodies in the district have come up with the demand that vaccines should be allotted to them directly rather than distributing it through the government system. Many of the civic bodies are preparing for conducting vaccination drives on their own. Maradu municipal council had passed a resolution that they should be given 3,000 doses of vaccine urgently or the government should allow them to purchase the vaccine on their own last week. It was by overruling the objection by the LDF opposition that the UDF-ruled local body passed the resolution. “In our limits, people are not getting adequate doses of vaccine. Though there are more than 5,000 persons above the age of 60 in our municipality, less than 2,500 have got the jab so far. The elderly as well as their relatives are asking us when they will get the vaccine,” said Maradu municipality chairman Antony Asanparambil. “We get more than 100 such calls every day. The people won’t ask the government or the district administration. It is we who are to answer them. That’s why we decided to explore the possibilities of buying the vaccine,” he said. According to Maradu municipality authorities, they have adopted a stand that prevention is better than cure. “For procuring two doses of vaccine, it would require Rs 800. If a patient is admitted to hospital with Covid-related complications, it would require Rs 4,500 to Rs 6,500 for covering expenses for medical oxygen. The ventilator fee would come to Rs 2,500 to Rs 10,000 per day. The patient will have to pay Rs 800 a day as PPE kit charges. The hospital bills for Covid patients come to Rs 10 to Rs 12 lakh,” Asanparambil said. “Besides this, the suffering and mental trauma by the patients and relatives also are there,” he said. At the same time, it is not easy for the local bodies to procure vaccines directly from the manufacturers. It takes quite some time to receive the vaccine doses ordered by even the state governments. Given the situation, the local bodies will have to wait for months before getting the vaccines directly from the manufacturers. “Then, we will be giving funds to the government. The government should procure the vaccine and handover it to us,” Asanparambil said. Councillors from municipalities like Eloor also have raised similar demand. Kochi corporation also has decided to conduct vaccine drives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-local-bodies-seek-govt-nod-to-procure-vaccine-directly/articleshow/82513205.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: ‘Hospitals can’t detain dead body over bill’||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The district collector has issued warning against the private hospitals which are not releasing the dead bodies over non-payment of hospital bills. “This has been banned in the district and necessary order under the Disaster Management Act has been issued,’’ said district collector Navjot Khosa. The collector issued such an order in the wake of a complaint received against Neyyar Medicity hospital at Kattakada. The collector had sought a report from the district medical officer in the incident and a show-cause notice has been served to the hospital in the wake of the report. “Based on the reply, action will be decided against the hospital,” said the district collector. “It is inhuman that the hospitals are not releasing the dead body for money. At many times people are not able to pay the exorbitant bills charged by the private hospitals. The hospital is bound to inform the family about the health condition of the patient and also on the expenses of the treatment,” said Khosa. A 46-year-old had died in the said hospital while undergoing treatment for Covid-19. The hospital had given a bill of Rs 4,44,808 to the family of the deceased and the hospital was not ready to release the body since the payment was not done. Even though several people had interfered and requested to release the body, the hospital authorities was not ready for it. The family members of the patients also informed the district health administration that they were not informed about the health condition of the patient by the hospital authorities. Khosa has warned all the hospitals in the district that no such incidents should be reported. If any hospital is found doing this, then they will have to face action under the Disaster Management Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-hospitals-cant-detain-dead-body-over-bill/articleshow/82513231.cms||---
---||Kochi||Small groups active in reaching out to the needy||Kochi: With the entire government infrastructure getting stretched due to the increase in Covid cases, small neighbourhood ‘koottayama’ or groups are coming to the aid of Covid-positive or quarantined persons at home. “There are a lot of houses where two or three persons are staying and every day at least three to four cases are being reported in our area. Most of the people belong to middle-class or low-income category. It was when people started calling for help for provisions, medicines and ambulances that we decided to form a koottayama,” said Saju Paul, a resident of Alangad panchayat. He said that under the leadership of Fr Jose Dominic, 10 volunteers who are residents of Chirayam Junction to Pallathnad bridge have got together and started reaching out to people. “Our numbers were shared among the nearly 1,000 members in this area. There are people unable to step out because of Covid infection or quarantine restrictions. We leave the provisions at the gate and people who can afford the cost pay for the provisions. We are arranging kits for people who can’t afford to pay,” said Paul. “In some of the areas, Asha workers have also joined the groups because they are unable to reach out to every household. The health inspectors in some areas have been shifted to more intense Covid areas. Several WhatsApp groups have been formed with volunteers’ numbers being shared,” said Santhosh Jacob, an RTI activist. While such a system is active in apartment complexes, it has not filtered into independent homes because there is no threat of use of common facilities. The Covid Jagratha portal which is also giving data of hospitals and bed status is being shared in many groups. “However, though that data is available, when we call the hospitals, they say they don’t have beds,” he added. At Cheranelloor, St James Church has opened its hall to convert it into a Covid care centre for patients who don’t have rooms in their homes. “We found that some families do not have rooms to isolate Covid positive persons. The panchayat and health department are coordinating to bring in patients and to give medical support,” said Fr Felix Chullikkal, Cheranelloor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/small-groups-active-in-reaching-out-to-the-needy/articleshow/82513250.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala University teachers seek govt intervention||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala University teachers’ association has sought urgent intervention by the university authorities and the state government to offset the impact of the recent Kerala high court order that nullified the varsity’s faculty section notification-2017, as per which the university had appointed 58 teachers. The association said the university had issued the notification based on the Universities Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014 and the UGC norms. The former UDF government carried out amendment in the Universities Act, making room for considering teaching posts in different departments as one unit. Though UGC had issued guidelines on similar lines, it faced roadblocks in the form of numerous court interventions. It was in this background that Kerala government and later the central government brought in legislations to give legal sanctity for considering different teaching posts as single unit. The association sought urgent intervention of university authorities and state government in this matter. As per the HC order, the practice of considering teaching vacancies in different departments as singe unit would lead to 100% reservation in some of the posts in which only one vacancy was available. The university notification was challenged in the HC immediately after the issuance of the same. The appointments to the posts were carried out with a rider that it would be subject to the outcome of the court verdict. Of the 58 faculty members, 30 had come from various government and aided colleges. The amendment made by the UDF government in the Universities Act had earned criticism and was considered by a section of academics and job seekers as a move with political motives. Not only Kerala, but other universities too had carried out appointments by considering all posts as single units. “The impact of the court intervention would have far-reaching consequence on higher education sector,” the association said here on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-university-teachers-seek-govt-intervention/articleshow/82513277.cms||---
---||World||Taliban declare three-day Afghan ceasefire for Eid holiday||KABUL: The Taliban on Monday declared a three-day ceasefire across Afghanistan to mark this week's Eid al-Fitr holiday, just two days after being blamed for killing more than 50 people -- mostly young girls -- in a bomb attack outside a school in the capital. The ceasefire offer comes as the United States continues to pull out its last 2,500 troops from the violence-wracked country despite faltering peace efforts between the Taliban and Afghan government to end a decades-long war. "Mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate are instructed to halt all offensive operations against the enemy countrywide from the first till the third day of Eid," a statement released by the Taliban said. "But if the enemy conducts any assault or attack against you during these days, stand ready to robustly protect and defend yourselves and your territory," it added. Eid al-Fitr marks the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, and the holiday begins according to the sighting of the new moon. The Taliban declared similar ceasefires last year to mark Islamic holidays. The government usually reciprocates with a truce. Fraidon Khawzon, spokesman for chief negotiator Abdullah Abdullah, said early Monday: "We welcome the announcement....the Islamic republic is also ready and will announce soon." The latest offer comes after the government blamed the Taliban for Saturday's attack outside a girls' school in Dasht-e-Barchi, a suburb of the capital largely populated by the Shiite Hazara community, which is often targeted by extremist Sunni Islamist militants. A series of blasts outside the school -- when residents were shopping ahead of the holiday -- killed more than 50 people and wounded over 100. It was the deadliest attack in more than a year. The Taliban, who denied responsibility, had earlier issued a statement saying the nation needed to "safeguard and look after educational centres and institutions". On Sunday, relatives buried the dead at a hilltop site known as "Martyrs Cemetery", where victims of attacks against the Hazara community are laid to rest. Hazaras are Shiite Muslims and considered heretics by extremist Sunnis. Sunni Muslims make up the majority of the Afghan population. Bodies in wooden coffins were lowered into graves one by one by mourners still in a state of shock and fear, an AFP photographer said. "I rushed to the scene (after the blasts) and found myself in the middle of bodies, their hands and heads cut off and bones smashed," said Mohammad Taqi, a resident of Dasht-e-Barchi, whose two daughters were students at the school but escaped the attack. "All of them were girls. Their bodies piled on top of each other." Books and school bags belonging to the victims still lay scattered at the site of the attack. The Taliban insist they have not carried out attacks in Kabul since February last year, when they signed a deal with Washington that paved the way for peace talks and withdrawal of the remaining US troops. But the group has clashed daily with Afghan forces in the rugged countryside even as the US military reduces its presence. The United States was supposed to have pulled all forces out by May 1 as agreed with the Taliban last year, but Washington pushed back the date to September 11 -- a move that angered the insurgents. The leader of the Taliban, Hibatullah Akhundzada, reiterated in a message released ahead of Eid that any delay in withdrawing the troops was a "violation" of that deal. "If America again fails to live up to its commitments, then the world must bear witness and hold America accountable for all the consequences," Akhundzada warned in Sunday's message. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has declared a day of national mourning for Tuesday. "This savage group does not have the power to confront security forces on the battlefield, and instead targets with brutality and barbarism public facilities and the girls' school," he said in a statement. Saturday's blasts drew widespread global condemnation. Pope Francis called it "an inhumane action", while Iran blamed the jihadist Islamic State. India, meanwhile, called for the dismantling of "terrorist sanctuaries" and a ceasefire to boost peace efforts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-declare-three-day-afghan-ceasefire-for-eid-holiday/articleshow/82513296.cms||---

Sales would be allowed only till 11am here. Only wholesale dealings would be allowed and there would be no entry to the market after 11am,” said police. Police increased the security at the market as it was one of the epicentres of the outbreak during the first wave. City police meanwhile said that over 5,000 requests were received at various police stations in the city, seeking passes for travel and only 300 were allowed. “Beat officers of the Janamaithri project are assisting in providing essential commodities to those who are staying in containment zones,” said city police.

Swift passage for ambulances is hampered by potholes and some people taking advantage of the lockdown, have craved out new passages in the middle corridor. “Smooth passage of traffic is no longer certain along the BRTS. Poor road maintenance has meant that street that could accommodate two lane traffic, has been effectively converted into a single lane movement,” said Danish. He referred to BRTS road along Polytechnic Square. Ahead of lockdown of 2020, She-Longue owner removed the protective cemented divider for cyclists to ensure his customers could park their vehicles. In the first few months of 2021, came digging work for Narmada pipeline in the same corridor. Shabby patchwork after laying of pipeline, has left the three layered road uneven. “Wait for the monsoon. Water logging to traffic jams, all would be a common feature of the road from New Market to VIP road,” said Ramesh Singh, a businessman. It has been over a month, since, BRTS approach road near the Polytechnic Square (for both traffic moving towards and from Banganga) was dug. BRTS officials are unaware of the huge pothole, that reduces speeding vehicles to break to zero. The pothole was dug by a private contractor and the road has not been relaid for more than a month. “Around 50 to 100, emergency vehicles pass through the stretch each day. Imagine someone on oxygen support, suffering a bump. Will the patient condition not deteriorate. VVIPs pass through the road each day. Someone should take note and order an investigation,” said a local resident, seeking anonymity. When contacted, Bhopal City Link Limited (BCLL) CEO, Aditya Singh, said, “Since I have been apprised of the situation, corrective action would be taken.” BCLL operates 220 plus city buses and only its buses are permitted to ply within the BRTS corridor, along with emergency vehicles. Bhopal BRTS is a bus rapid transit system built to improve public transport in Bhopal. The construction was funded by the union government under its flagship JnNURM. 24 kilometres started in 2009. The Bus service in BRTS corridor commenced in 2013. In the initial DPR of the project, it was cited that bus lanes and upgrade road geometrics would take place as per need. However, much of the BRTS pedestrian pathway and cycle track remains neglected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/shabby-brts-pushes-ambulances-in-slow-lane-when-it-matters-the-most/articleshow/82513353.cms||Jamal Ayub
---||Ahmedabad||West Ahmedabad records 65% corona cases, east sees 68% deaths||AHMEDABAD: The corona pandemic is playing rather differently in the city of Ahmedabad. Ironic it may seem but while west Ahmedabad has recorded 65% of the Covid-positive cases during the pandemic but it was east Ahmedabad where majority 68% deaths were recorded. The western part, which had 31% of the city’s 22,282 cases as on June 13 of 2020, is now a Covid hotspot. On May 7, the west accounted for 65% of the 1,88,745 cases in the city. But a grimmer contrast: of the nearly 3,000 deaths due to Covid-19 so far, 32% were recorded in the west while 68% were recorded in east Ahmedabad. Data from the AMC reveals that in 10 months between July 13, 2020, and May 7 this year, the city added 1,65,463 fresh Covid cases; 1,14,226 cases were from the western part of the city. The remaining 51,237 were from central, north, south, and east zones. A senior health officer from the AMC said, “Since Diwali, we have noticed that the western part of the city has been in Covid-19 grip.” He said, “Be it for its micro-containment areas or for registering the highest share of the cases in the city, the west has grabbed the headlines.” The officer said that the area, which was once cut off from the east, is now the highest contributor to the Covid infections in the city. The west zone wards of Navrangpura, Paldi, Vasna, Naranpura, Ranip, and Vadaj account for 28.6% of the total1.88 lakh cases. The wards of Thaltej, Gota, Bodakdev, and Chandkheda in the north west zone account for 25% of the total cases. This means every second person infected in the city is either from the west zone or the north west zone. The south west zone, spanning Vejalpur, Jodhpur, and Bopal, have14.8% of the total cases. The officer said that if one compared the data of May 7 with that of July 13, 2020, these three zones were at the bottom of the case pile last year. Municipal officers attributed the surge in cases in West Ahmedabad to night culture where young hung out till late night. The AMC had to impose a curfew on 30-odd stretches in this part of the city. Also, mask compliance was the weakest in these areas. About the deaths, the officer said: “In the western part, one will find that cases were detected early and people had better resources for getting medical care." In the east, people tended to wait for three to four days to get tested. Most got admitted in critical states which contributed to higher mortality||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/west-ahmedabad-records-65-corona-cases-east-sees-68-deaths/articleshow/82513329.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Addressing newly-elected MLAs of BJP and its allies after Himanta Biswa Sarma’s election as the leader of the House and the state’s next CM, Sonowal said, “So, we the representatives of the people, exist for society and the country. This we should keep in mind and always work in the interest of the country and society. Many of you here have worked with dedication in the last five years and so society has re-elected you. Respect the love and trust of society.” Choosing to make a graceful exit, Sonowal drove to the assembly for the BJP legislature party meeting along with his successor. On reaching there, he waited for Sarma to alight from the other side of the vehicle before both walked into the assembly building together. At the meeting, there seemed to be an uneasy calm till the proceedings began. It was Sonowal who proposed Sarma’s name as the leader of the legislature party. When it was time for the felicitation, Sonowal walked across the dais to present Sarma with a traditional gamocha (scarf) and patted him on the back before posing for pictures with an arm resting on his successor’s shoulder. Sarma took off his mask after a prod from Sonowal. The outgoing CM expressed confidence that the new NDA government, under the leadership of his “younger brother”, would take the state to greater heights. “Himanta has been given a huge responsibility and I bestow my love and blessings on him so that he can perform his duties well for the welfare and progress of all sections of the society,” he said while addressing the newly elected members of all three alliance partners – BJP, AGP and UPPL. Sonowal said that for the last five years, the BJP-led government in the state had been able to win the people’’s trust and confidence by bringing peace and development. “We thank the people for reposing their trust in us... I urge all the elected members of the alliance to work with dedication and honesty,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/sarbananda-sonowal-gracefully-exits-as-assam-cm-with-mahabharata-quote/articleshow/82513391.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||World||Gunman kills six at US birthday party before shooting himself||WASHINGTON: A gunman opened fire at a birthday party in Colorado, killing six people in the early hours of Sunday before taking his own life, US police said. Colorado Springs police responded shortly after midnight to an emergency call at a mobile home park, where they found six adults shot dead and one adult male who was seriously injured. He was transported to a local hospital, where he died from his injuries. Preliminary investigations revealed that families had gathered for a birthday party inside one of the trailers when the shooting occurred. "The suspect, a boyfriend of one of the female victims, drove to the residence, walked inside and began shooting people at the party before taking his own life," the police said in a statement. "We are still investigating to determine a motive." None of the children at the party were injured in the attack, according to the police, and they were being cared for by family members. The victims have not been publicly identified. "From the officers who responded to the shooting to the investigators still on scene, we are all left incredibly shaken," said Colorado Springs police chief Vince Niski. "This is something you hope never happens in your own community." Colorado Springs mayor John Suthers said the "senseless act of violence" had sent the community into mourning, and called for prayers for the victims, their families and the first responders. A woman who lived in the mobile home park told the Denver Post she was awakened by the sound of so many gunshots that she thought it was a thunderstorm. Colorado Springs-based newspaper The Gazette reported that family and friends of the victims gathered Sunday afternoon outside the trailer to mourn the attack. It was the third mass shooting in Colorado Springs since October 2015, including a random Halloween massacre and an attack on a Planned Parenthood clinic in November that same year, local media said. The United States has suffered a spate of mass shootings in recent months, including at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, an office building in California, a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado and at several spas in Atlanta. President Joe Biden last month branded US gun violence an "epidemic" and an "international embarrassment." There were more than 43,000 gun-related deaths in the United States last year, including suicides, according to the Gun Violence Archive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/gunman-kills-six-at-us-birthday-party-before-shooting-himself/articleshow/82513354.cms||---

To put the figure in perspective, a month ago on April 9, 35 out of 42 deaths were from urban areas, giving their share in daily mortality at 83%. The phenomenon indicates rise in mortality in non-urban areas along with a rise in positive cases. This is why the state government has aggressively launched a corona-free villages campaign in rural Gujarat. Analysis of the deaths reveal that in April – the month which saw the highest ever cases and mortality due to coronavirus across Gujarat — the urban areas were driving the growth with 71% of the deaths and 67% of the cases recorded from the eight municipal corporation areas. “But now the scenario is changing – as the cities are recording a dip in the cases and deaths, there is a relative rise in positivity and mortality in other parts of the state. In May, the non-urban areas’ share has increased to 41% in daily cases and 53% in daily deaths,” said a city-based public health expert. 26% fewer cases in AhmedabadAnalysis of the districts reveal that the four major districts with urban population – Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot – had a mortality rate of 0.8% compared to 1.3% in other districts against the state average of 1% in the past one week,” said a city-based public health expert Analysis of weekly cases and deaths (from April 26 to May 2 and May 3 to 9) also indicate the different trends for Ahmedabad and Surat – considered to be the epicenters of the pandemic – and rest of the state. Both the districts recorded a decline of 26% and 34% respectively in cases and 20% and 44% respectively in deaths. In contrast, Anand (33.5%), Aravalli (35.7%), Panchmahal (55%), etc. recorded steep rise in cases, and Bhavnagar (40%), Porbandar (200%) Kheda (300%), etc. recorded rise in deaths compared to the previous week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-tightens-grip-in-rural-gujarat-share-of-deaths-up/articleshow/82513443.cms||Parth Shastri

According to AMU administration, in order to analyse the severity of Covid-19 and its suspected new variant that wreaked havoc in Aligarh as many faculty members, retired teachers and other employees of the university succumbed to it, the samples collected at the ICMR-approved Covid-19 testing laboratory of the department of microbiology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (JNMC) of the varsity, have been sent for viral genome sequencing to the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi. It is suspected that a new Covid variant could be fuelling the surge of Coronavirus cases in Aligarh. In his letter, the AMU VC wrote, “Sixteen serving faculty members of the varsity along with a number of retired teachers and other category of employees living on the campus and adjoining localities have succumbed to Covid-19. This is giving rise to suspicion that there could be a new variant circulating in the Civil Lines area of Aligarh in which AMU and many other adjoining localities are situated.” Meanwhile, the administration has announced that the varsity and the institutions run by it will remain closed till May 16, following the state government’s decision to extend lockdown in order to curb the Covid spread. However, essential services, including medical services, sanitation, electricity, water supply, proctor’s office and computer centre, will continue to work as per the directions of the heads of the department or office concerned, stated a notification issued by AMU registrar Abdul Hamid. As on Friday, the varsity had lost 16 serving and 10 retired faculty members to Covid in the last 20 days. Vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor’s older brother also fell to the virus. As many as 16 employees, including faculty members, are undergoing treatment in the Covid ward of the university’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (JNMC). A few of them are critical. Terming the deaths “a tragic loss for the university”, Mansoor said a vacuum has been created after the demise of such learned faculty members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/after-16-faculty-deaths-aligarh-muslim-university-seeks-virus-genome-sampling/articleshow/82513523.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||India||All citizens to get vaccine free: Centre||NEW DELHI: In a late-night affidavit, the Union government on Sunday told the Supreme Court that differential pricing of vaccines by manufacturers for the Centre and the states or private hospitals would have no impact on the citizens who would be given the vaccine free of cost. The Centre said, "price factor (of the vaccines) will not have any impact on the ultimate beneficiary namely, the eligible person getting the vaccine since all state governments have already declared their policy decision that each state will be administering the vaccine to its residents, free of cost." It said, "Due to consultations and 'persuasion' by the Central government both the manufacturers of the vaccine, Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India, have declared their respective prices which are uniform for all state governments. It is pertinent to note that the Central Government by nature of its large vaccination programme, places large purchase orders for vaccines as opposed to the state governments and/or private hospitals and therefore, this reality has some reflection in the prices negotiated." "Thus, while it is ensured that the two vaccine manufacturers are not unduly enriched from out of public money, the citizens are not supposed to make any payment for getting both doses of the vaccine," the Centre said. However, it also said that the economics of the vaccine manufacturers must be borne in mind. "Till date, there are only vaccines available from two vaccine manufacturers. Both manufacturers [one an Indian company and second a licensee of a British company] have taken the financial risk in developing and manufacturing these vaccines and it is prudent to make decisions on pricing through negotiations in a transparent consultative process keeping statutory provisions as a last resort under the present circumstances," it said. The Union government said, "To ensure that there is no disparity between the States inter-se, with active consultation of the Central Government with both the manufacturers, the Central Government has successfully fixed uniform prices to be paid by all the state governments." "As per the policy, which is devised keeping the priority of maximum vaccine reach to the citizens depending upon their vulnerability in mind, ensuring equitable distribution of the quantity of vaccine to all states at a uniform rate, the possibility of vaccine pricing decision in India having an inevitable impact on the country’s efforts bringing in more global vaccine manufacturers to India, the policy mandates 50% of the total manufactured quantity of vaccine from both manufacturers to be supplied to the Central Government. The logic behind this is to give priority in vaccination to the most vulnerable group of the population." Explaining the vaccine distribution formula, the Centre said, "the remaining quantity to be uniformly distributed amongst all states on a pro-rata basis [viz. the total manufactured quantity from both the companies is divided and allocated to the States keeping in mind the total population of each State between the age group of 18- 44 years]. Out of the 50% quota allotted to each State, the division is made on a 50% - 50% basis. In other words, from out of the 50% allotted to the State, 50% will go to the State [calculated on a pro-rata basis based upon the population of the age group of 18-44 years] and the balance 50% will go to the private sector based upon the contracts between the private sector and vaccine manufacturers."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/all-citizens-to-get-vaccine-free-centre/articleshow/82513372.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Mumbai||New neighbours: Ex-CP, retired judge probing his charges||Adding an interesting footnote in the saga of ex-CP Param Bir Singh Vs former home minister Anil Deshmukh, Justice Kailash Uttamchand Chandiwal and Param Bir Singh, now posted as director general (Home Guards), have offices on the same floor. Justice Chandiwal is probing Singh's charges of corruption charges and irregularities against Deshmukh. Singh's 'letter bomb' stating Deshmukh had set a target of mobilising Rs 100 crore from restaurant and bar owners and that the task had been given to controversial assistant police inspector Sachin Waze had sent shockwaves in the corridors of power. The state government appointed Justice Chandiwal, a former Bombay HC judge, to investigate Singh's charges. Justice Chandiwal's task will be to probe if there is any substance in the allegations and if the probe should be entrusted to the anti-corruption bureau. He has been set a six-month deadline. Though his appointment was notified on March 30, Justice Chandiwal was not given office premises. Finally, a premises in the old secretariat building was allotted which, as it turns out, makes Singh his neighbour. Deceased PSI's batchmates raise Rs 20 lakhBatchmates of police sub-inspector Gyanoba Kale, who recently succumbed to Covid, collected Rs 20 lakh within a week of his death. The 2013 batch officer was popular not only in his village, but even among the police force in the district. Worried about his family's plight, his batchmates swung into action and sent out messages seeking financial contributions. In less than a week, the PSI who had initiated the campaign received messages from most PSIs of the 2013 batch pledging support. So far, Rs 20 lakh has been collected. It has been proposed to put the money in fixed deposit for a specific period with Kale's parents, wife and son as beneficiaries. A senior IPS officer said the police force is passing through a critical period owing to the pandemic situation and police personnel are working round the clock for the safety and security of people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/new-neighbours-ex-cp-retired-judge-probing-his-charges/articleshow/82513564.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||World||South Korea's Moon says looking for North Korea response for peace talks||SEOUL: South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Monday he was looking forward to North Korea's response to engagement efforts as he seeks to restore peace-building amid stalled talks over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes. Moon's comments, in a speech marking the fourth year of his presidency, come ahead of his first summit with U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington on May 21. The South Korean president is expected to push the United States to seek engagement with North Korea, though Biden has shown little interest in making North Korea a top priority. Biden's administration says its overtures to Pyongyang have not been answered, and it recently completed a policy review that called for a "practical" approach of using diplomacy to find achievable goals toward eventually persuading North Korea to surrender its nuclear weapons. But Biden has shown no sign of loosing sanctions, which have hampered Moon's efforts to launch economic and tourism projects with the North, and the White House has not appointed a special envoy to handle the issue. Moon has made engaging with North Korea a signature project and appeared to make progress in 2018 amid summits with leader Kim Jong Un, but as Moon enters his final year in office, Pyongyang shows few signs of interest in talking. In his speech, Moon said that he wouldn't be impatient during his final year, but that he would do everything he could to return to the days of engagement. "If there is an opportunity to turn back the clock of peace again and advance the peace process on the Korean peninsula, I will make all efforts," he said. "We look forward to North Korea's response."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/south-koreas-moon-says-looking-for-north-korea-response-for-peace-talks/articleshow/82513594.cms||---
---||Business||Hack at Colonial Pipeline: What we know and don't know||WASHINGTON: Ransom-seeking hackers have broken into Colonial Pipeline, prompting the company to shut one of America's major arteries for fuel delivery. Here is a look at what we know, and what we don't, about one of the most disruptive digital shakedown efforts to hit a US company. WHO IS INVOLVED?Alpharetta, Georgia-based Colonial Pipeline and the US government have both blamed ransomware for the massive outage, pointing the finger at cybercriminal gangs who routinely hold data and computer networks hostage in exchange for digital currency payments. There is no official word on which group is believed to have carried out the intrusion - and attributing malicious activity online can be extremely difficult - but a former US official and three industry sources told Reuters a group dubbed "DarkSide" was among the suspects. If so, that would lay the responsibility on a new but professional group of criminals believed to be operating out of the former Soviet republics. Cybersecurity FireEye is involved with the incident response, according to three industry sources. HOW BAD IS IT?Ransomware can deal catastrophic damage to an organization's network by locking away critical data or even wrecking computers beyond repair. But the effect on the actual nuts and bolts of energy companies' operations varies. A destructive cyberattack on Saudi Aramco in 2012 crippled the oil giant's computer network but left production more-or-less unscathed. By contrast, a more recent ransomware incident at Norsk Hydro temporarily pushed the aluminum maker to switch away from automated production at its smelters. Experts say the severity of the Colonial case will depend on whether the ransomware made its way into the company's operational technology network, which interfaces with the pipeline itself. Earlier this year, US government officials announced https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-049a that an intrusion at an unnamed natural gas compression plant that spilled over into its operational technology network forced a two-day shut down of its entire pipeline. Colonial has not given any public indication as to the reach of the ransomware outbreak, but Robert M. Lee, chief executive of cybersecurity firm Dragos, said he believed Colonial's operations network was shut down proactively "to make sure that nothing spread into those systems." He said that will hopefully translate to "a temporary outage versus something that would be more sustained." WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?US government officials are working with Colonial to help it recover while scrambling to avoid more severe fuel supply disruptions should the outage continue. Colonial's pipeline network serves major US airports, including Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson Airport, the world's busiest by passenger traffic, and experts say regional fuel supplies could be impacted if the pipeline stays shut. "A one-to-two-day outage is really a minor inconvenience," said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. But by day four or five, he said, "we could see a much greater widespread impact through large areas throughout the mid-Atlantic and the southeast." Whether the pipeline stays shut that long in turn depends on how deeply the hackers penetrated Colonial's network - and how soon cybersecurity experts can pull them out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/hack-at-colonial-pipeline-what-we-know-and-dont-know/articleshow/82513560.cms||---

On Saturday, women chased a team of health workers creating vaccination awareness in Astari village in Niwari district. The workers were on a bike and a four-wheeler had been converted into a ‘rath’ with a public announcement system to spread the message. The rath had been parked in the middle of the village and the bikers were moving around encouraging residents to get vaccinated. After a point, all the workers gathered at one spot when the village women assembled with stones and sticks. They chased them away by pelting stones and saying that no one will be vaccinated. “Social media messages have been creating vaccine hesitancy among villagers,” said an official. Block development officer Dr Ramesh Chandra said that a special camp would be held in the village for vaccination. He said, higher officials are working to ensure that correct message on vaccination drive reaches the masses. Deherka police station incharge, Gaurav Rajoria said, after the incident, we spoke to elders of the village to help us encourage residents to get vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/women-chase-away-vaccine-awareness-team/articleshow/82513599.cms||---

According to Idukki district police chief R Karuppa Swami, police are patrolling the forest routes near the border checkposts to check illegal entry of people to Idukki from Tamil Nadu. Police on Sunday returned the taxi vehicles which reached the border checkposts in Idukki carrying workers to the cardamom plantations. The officers returned the taxi jeeps from Kumily, Bodimettu and Cumbummettu checkposts. A meeting called by power minister M M Mani had on Friday decided to impose ban on vehicles carrying workers to the plantations in the wake of the lockdown. District collector H Dinesan said that agriculture activities, including the works in the cardamom and tea plantations could be continued using the minimum number of workers and by following Covid-19 protocol. “The farmers in the district can engage in the agriculture activities in their farms,” the collector said, adding that the works in tea plantations could be continued during the lock-down period. The ban on workers from outside the state was imposed as it would cause crowding inside the vehicles, increasing the chances of the virus to spread, said officials. The lockdown announced in Tamil Nadu from Monday would further reduce the interstate movements, added officials. Meanwhile, police have filed cases against 94 people for violating the Covid protocol in the district. This is in addition to the 496 petty cases. The district on Sunday reported 1,046 positive cases with a test positivity rate of 26.97%. The source of the disease remained untraced among 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-intensify-vigil-at-border-checkposts/articleshow/82513622.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mediclaim policy cannot exclude mental illness||Shikha Nischal had obtained a healthcare (mediclaim) policy from National Insurance on May 29, 2016 and had renewed it without break. The policy for May 29, 2020 to May 28, 2021 had a coverage limit of Rs3,95,000. In June 2020, Shikha was hospitalised for a month after she developed schizoaffective disorder, a type of mental illness. The total cost came to Rs5,54,636. However, the insurer rejected her reimbursement claim on the ground that the policy excluded treatment for psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders and diseases. She approached the insurance ombudsman, contending that the exclusion of mental illness was illegal as it violated the provisions of the Mental Health Act of 2017. The ombudsman concluded the claim had been rightly repudiated. Shikha challenged the order in a writ petition before Delhi HC. Her advocate, Shahrukh Ejaz, pointed out that section 21 (4) of the Mental Health Act specifically provided that insurance companies would not make any distinction between mental and physical illnesses. The HC observed the Mental Health Act does not differentiate between mental and physical ailments. It indicted the IRDA for turning a blind eye to legal provisions and allowing insurers to continue excluding mental illnesses even after enactment of the Mental Health Act. By its order of April 19, the HC allowed Shikha's writ petition. It ordered IRDA to circulate the order and ensure policies adhere to provisions of the Mental Health Act. It also directed the insurer to pay Rs25,000 towards costs.  (The author is a consumer activist and has won the Govt. of India's National Youth Award for Consumer Protection.

For, 72-yearold Sarita Pant took just 10 days to slay the Covid dragon and return home victorious a second time. The first round of battle she fought earlier was with ovarian cancer in March when she defeated the crab in a year-long battle. “I had heard about the extreme effects of coronavirus but I wasn’t scared at all. During my stay in the hospital I kept chanting God’s name and kept telling myself that I will be back with my family soon. I beat cancer and coronavirus within a year,” Pant, a resident of Tarsali, told TOI. After she was admitted to a private hospital on April 28 for Covid treatment, Pant was kept on oxygen for six days before she recovered and was discharged on May 7. While her own faith in herself remained unwavering, her family comprising two daughters and a son and their families were, however, in tenterhooks. “Mom had just recovered from ovarian cancer and her immunity was low due to several rounds of chemotherapy. She had undergone a major surgery in March for ovary and uterus removal, and her cancer had barely cured. But coronavirus brought her back to the hospital. We were scared as her oxygen levels had dipped severely. She, however, didn’t seem perturbed at all,” said Sandip Vaidya, son-in-law of Pant. In October last year, Pant complained of shooting pain in her stomach and the tests showed that she had a tumour below the pancreas. Pant was detected with ovarian cancer later and her chemotherapy started. “She underwent six rounds of chemotherapy but to our surprise, she never complained about any pain.

---||World||'No doubt' US has undercounted Covid deaths: Anthony Fauci||WASHINGTON: The United States, which has reported the world's worst overall Covid-19 death toll, has "no doubt" been undercounting fatal cases, top pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci said Sunday. The country has officially lost over 581,000 people to the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus -- but a University of Washington study released on Thursday estimated deaths at more than 900,000. "That's a bit more than I would have thought the undercounting was," Fauci told NBC's "Meet The Press." "But I think there's no doubt... that we are and have been undercounting." The United States has reported over 32.6 million cases since the virus was first identified at the end of 2019 in China. America was battered by a spike in cases and deaths after the end-of-year holidays, but since January new infections have come down as vaccination rates have jumped. "We are turning the corner. We have 58 percent of adult Americans with at least one shot, over 110 million Americans fully vaccinated," White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeffrey Zients told CNN's State of the Union. President Joe Biden wants 70 percent of adults in the US to have received at least one shot of the Covid-19 vaccine by the July 4 Independence Day holiday. But the rate peaked around April 10 and has been declining since then, with vaccine hold-outs slowing the race to population immunity. Federal, state and local officials are partnering with pharmacies, restaurants, breweries, supermarkets and sports teams to come up with incentives to get people to get their shots. In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy launched a "Shot and a Beer" program to encourage vaccination, while in West Virginia Governor Jim Justice announced that the state will offer $100 savings bonds to residents aged 16 to 35 who get inoculated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/no-doubt-us-has-undercounted-covid-deaths-anthony-fauci/articleshow/82513707.cms||---

So the patient keeps on running from one place to the other even as his oxygen level continues to fall,” he said. In the open letter, the minister and Bareilly MP alleged that there was rampant hoarding of oxygen cylinders with many dealers selling it at higher prices. The Union minister also complained that medical equipment like monitors and ventilators were being sold in the market at exorbitant rates. He urged the chief minister to fix the price of the equipment. Gangwar also requested the state government to provide 50% subsidy to private hospitals for setting up oxygen plants, on the lines of Madhya Pradesh. When contacted, Gangwar told TOI, “Yes I have given a letter to raise issues related to Covid-19 management.

---||India||Judge suffers Covid bite for not practicing what he preached||NEW DELHI: Not practising what he preached to citizens through judicial orders extracted a heavy price from a high court Judge, who himself and family members got infected by a coronavirus. The turn of events concerns an Orissa high court Judge, who as part of a bench had last year passed several orders directing the authorities how to enforce lockdown to minimise movement of people and prevent the rapid spread of Covid disease in the state. In one of the orders, the bench had said, "We expect and hope that the government in its appropriate department shall bring out composite planning on availability of such essential items locally thereby requiring no use of two-wheelers (by the public to go out for the purchase of essential items) at the earliest." A year down the line, he forgot what he had said in his judicial orders about maintenance of social distancing and embarked on a pilgrimage with his 90-year-old mother, wife, brother and his wife in April when the exponential surge in Covid cases had begun, HC sources told TOI. The first destination was Allahabad, where they submerged at Sangam the ashes of his father, who had died last year. From there they proceeded to Haridwar, to take a holy dip in the Ganga river during the Kumbh, where a sea of humanity participated and many blamed it as an event that fuelled the rapid spread of the Covid disease. From Haridwar, the Judge and his family members proceeded to Gaya for certain religious rituals and then reached Puri on April 15. On returning to Cuttack, all family members tested positive for Covid. They recovered but the Judge's old mother succumbed to the virus. Similarly, the Supreme Court decided to step in after faulting the Centre's oxygen allocation methodology during the second surge of Covid, when each affected state has been demanding a higher allocation. The Centre asserted that a daily oxygen supply of 500-600 MT to Delhi would be enough to meet the demand from hospitals and cited the management of a similar Covid caseload by Mumbai on April 10 with an oxygen supply of around 280MT. But, the SC asserted that Delhi should get 700 MT of O2. The SC also thought it fit to permit the judiciary, through high courts, to manage the pan-India oxygen allocation. It gave a free hand to the HCs to determine the quantity of O2 required by the state and direct the Centre to provide the same. The case in point is the Karnataka HC order asking the Centre to supply 1200 MT of oxygen as against an allocation of 900MT. In contrast, the SC has not been able to manage a small issue of providing seamless video-conferencing facilities for the advocates to argue before benches even though more than a year has passed since the SC started conducting its judicial business through video-conference. The glitch-ridden system played so truantly that once Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul in a virtual hearing openly criticised the system and said if the Delhi HC could manage a better system why not the SC. But, the system remains unchanged. The advocates keep complaining about getting delinked abruptly. So much so that even the SC's E-Committee chairman Justice D Y Chandrachud got delinked once making an advocate to innocently comment - "Justice Chandrachud has fallen off". It created a mild panic but soon many realised that he had only "fallen off" the video link.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/judge-suffers-covid-bite-for-not-practicing-what-he-preached/articleshow/82513671.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Sullivan highlighted recent engagements by senior US officials with senior Israeli and Palestinian officials and key regional stakeholders to press for steps to ensure calm, deescalate tensions, and denounce violence, read a statement from National Security Council (NSC) spokesperson Emily Horne on NSA Jake Sullivan's call with Israeli counterpart Meir Ben-Shabbat regarding the situation in Jerusalem. Sullivan also reiterated the United States' serious concerns about the potential evictions of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood. They agreed that the launching of rocket attacks and incendiary balloons from Gaza towards Israel is unacceptable and must be condemned, read the statement. Sullivan encouraged the Israeli government to pursue appropriate measures to ensure calm during Jerusalem Day commemorations. Sullivan expressed the administration's commitment to Israel's security and to supporting peace and stability throughout the Middle East, and assured Ben-Shabbat that the US will remain fully engaged in the days ahead to promote calm in Jerusalem, the statement added. Meanwhile, amid violent clashes in East Jerusalem, the Israeli Supreme Court has delayed a hearing scheduled for Monday that could have determined whether four Palestinian families in the city's Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood will be evicted. Over 70 Palestinians in total are set to be evicted from Sheikh Jarrah in the coming weeks to be replaced by right-wing Jewish Israelis. The Palestinians live in houses built on land that courts have ruled were owned by Jewish religious associations before the establishment of Israel in 1948. The city has been embroiled in intense chaos as Palestinians have clashed with Israeli police, with both sides blaming the other for igniting the confrontations.

Deaths grew at a faster pace of nearly 15%, with the daily case fatality rate crossing 1% for the first time in the second wave in the last three days. The weekly toll crossed 25,000 for the first time as the country recorded 27,243 deaths during May 3-9, up from 23,781 reported in the previous week. The growth in weekly cases slowed considerably, indicating that perhaps the second wave had reached, or was nearing, its peak. India recorded 27,44,545 new cases in the week, a rise of 5% from last week's count of 26.13 lakh. By contrast, cases had grown by 16% last week (April 26-May 2) and by 47% in the week before. On Sunday, daily cases dropped below 4 lakh for the first time in five days as 3,66,902 fresh infections were detected in the country. So far, the highest daily case count has been 4,14,554 reported on Thursday (May 6). Since then, the daily numbers have declined on each successive day. Fatalities from the virus too dipped on Sunday to 3,751 after remaining over 4,000 in the past two days. Significantly, the CFR has remained just over 1% for the past three days. CFR is the percentage of patients who have succumbed to the virus out of the total number testing positive. India's overall CFR is nearly 1.1%. While daily cases dropped in most of the major states on Sunday, three states and a Union territory reported their highest single-day rise in infections. These were Tamil Nadu, where 28,897 fresh cases were reported, Bengal (19,441), Chandigarh (895) and Meghalaya (418). Punjab was also among five states and UTs where the daily toll on Sunday was the highest ever. The state reported 191 fatalities, while deaths surged massively in Uttarakhand with Sunday's toll rising to 180. Puducherry (26), Meghalaya (18) and Manipur (15) also reported their highest death tolls. Maharashtra continued to report the highest deaths in the country, with 572 recorded on Sunday. The toll, however, was sharply down from over 800 reported on each of the last five days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-growth-in-cases-slows-but-death-rate-crosses-1/articleshow/82512424.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

Their plea comes three days after the man’s 35-year-old wife died of the infection as she was unable to get a hospital bed. “We need medicines, we don’t know what our health condition is. We feel we have been left to die by ourselves as we are in isolation at home,” said Suresh, who lives near Bangalore International Exhibition Centre. He is also awaiting the Covid test result of his other daughter who is 8. According to Harish Gowda, a relative, Yashodha HG, who worked as a garment worker, was going to work as usual but fell ill on May 2. “Without taking any chance, we took her to ESI Hospital in Peenya where doctors tested her and said she was Covidpositive and her oxygen saturation level had dipped drastically,” he said. “From Monday morning, I called all helplines at least 75 times, but in vain. We would call and wait for at least 20 minutes to speak to the representative. All they did was collect details and assure us they’d get back, but they didn’t. Some of them even abruptly cut the call,” he rued. According to Harish, Yashodha’s condition worsened. “On Wednesday night, she started choking and we rushed her to various hospitals. But all we were told was there were no beds available. On Thursday morning, she passed away,” he added. But the family’s ordeal did not end. “We all got tested. Of my three daughters, the eldest (11) and the youngest (7), got their reports on Friday and were positive. My mother and I are also infected. Since then, we have been calling helplines to getour health monitored or at least get medicines. At some point, the district hospital asked me to come and collect medicine kits. I got them with some friends’ help,” Suresh said.“We are not educated and are suffering. We want a doctor to at least talk to us to know our health condition. Else, we will end up like Yashodha,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-after-wife-dies-without-bed-covid-positive-man-kin-seek-help/articleshow/82513740.cms||Kiran Parashar
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: IAS officer alleges mob assaulted him at war room||BENGALURU: IAS officer V Yashwanth Gurukar has filed a complaint with police, claiming he was manhandled by a mob of 50-60 people outside Bommanahalli Covid-19 war room in HSR Layout on April 30. According to the complaint, when Yashwanth visited the BBMP war room around 11am, 50-60 unidentified persons were protesting outside and tried to barge in. “Joint commissioner Ramakrishna and I were manhandled by the protesters and we were prevented from discharging our duties,” it read. HSR Layout police booked a case under IPC sections 353 (assault/criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of duty) and 504 (intentional insult and provocation to break public peace). The IAS Officers’ Association had submitted a memorandum demanded action against an MLA without naming the elected representative. Though Yashwanth has not named the MLA in the complaint, sources said Bommanahalli MLA Satish Reddy and his followers had staged the protest on April 30. BBMP officials alleged it happened because Reddy’s men, who wanted to sit in the war room to block beds for some people, were turned away. Reddy claimed he did ask BBMP officials to block beds for some people who were sick and approached him, but he was not involved in a bed allotment scam. He said the reason behind the protest was that 17 people had died in four days and there were no vehicles to ferry the bodies to crematoria and BBMP had ignored his pleas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-ias-officer-alleges-mob-assaulted-him-at-war-room/articleshow/82513831.cms||---
---||World||Cyberattack on US pipeline is linked to criminal gang||NEW YORK: The cyberextortion attempt that has forced the shutdown of a vital US pipeline was carried out by a criminal gang known as DarkSide that cultivates a Robin Hood image of stealing from corporations and giving a cut to charity, two people close to the investigation said Sunday. The shutdown, meanwhile, stretched into its third day, with the Biden administration loosening regulations for the transport of petroleum products on highways as part of an ``all-hands-on-deck'' effort to avoid disruptions in the fuel supply. Experts said that gasoline prices are unlikely to be affected if the pipeline is back to normal in the next few days but that the incident - the worst cyberattack to date on critical U.S. infrastructure - should serve as a wake-up call to companies about the vulnerabilities they face. The pipeline, operated by Georgia-based Colonial Pipeline, carries gasoline and other fuel from Texas to the Northeast. It delivers roughly 45% of fuel consumed on the East Coast, according to the company. It was hit by what Colonial called a ransomware attack, in which hackers typically lock up computer systems by encrypting data, paralyzing networks, and then demand a large ransom to unscramble it. On Sunday, Colonial Pipeline said it was actively in the process of restoring some of its IT systems. It says it remains in contact with law enforcement and other federal agencies, including the Department of Energy, which is leading the federal government response. The company has not said what was demanded or who made the demand. However, two people close to the investigation, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the culprit as DarkSide. It is among ransomware gangs that have ``professionalized`` a criminal industry that has cost Western nations tens of billions of dollars in losses in the past three years. DarkSide claims that it does not attack hospitals and nursing homes, educational or government targets and that it donates a portion of its take to charity. It has been active since August and, typical of the most potent ransomware gangs, is known to avoid targeting organizations in former Soviet bloc nations. Colonial did not say whether it has paid or was negotiating a ransom, and DarkSide neither announced the attack on its dark web site nor responded to an Associated Press reporter's queries. The lack of acknowledgment usually indicates a victim is either negotiating or has paid. On Sunday, Colonial Pipeline said it is developing a "system restart" plan. It said its main pipeline remains offline but some smaller lines are now operational. ``We are in the process of restoring service to other laterals and will bring our full system back online only when we believe it is safe to do so, and in full compliance with the approval of all federal regulations," the company said in a statement. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Sunday that ransomware attacks are ``what businesses now have to worry about,'' and that she will work ``very vigorously'' with the Department of Homeland Security to address the problem, calling it a top priority for the administration. ``Unfortunately, these sorts of attacks are becoming more frequent,'' she said on CBS' "Face the Nation.`` "We have to work in partnership with business to secure networks to defend ourselves against these attacks.'' She said President Joe Biden was briefed on the attack. ``It's an all-hands-on-deck effort right now,'' Raimondo said. ``And we are working closely with the company, state and local officials to make sure that they get back up to normal operations as quickly as possible and there aren't disruptions in supply.'' The Department of Transportation issued a regional emergency declaration Sunday, relaxing hours-of-service regulations for drivers carrying gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other refined petroleum products in 17 states and the District of Columbia. It lets them work extra or more flexible hours to make up for any fuel shortage related to the pipeline outage. One of the people close to the Colonial investigation said that the attackers also stole data from the company, presumably for extortion purposes. Sometimes stolen data is more valuable to ransomware criminals than the leverage they gain by crippling a network, because some victims are loath to see sensitive information of theirs dumped online. Security experts said the attack should be a warning for operators of critical infrastructure _ including electrical and water utilities and energy and transportation companies _ that not investing in updating their security puts them at risk of catastrophe. Ed Amoroso, CEO of TAG Cyber, said Colonial was lucky its attacker was at least ostensibly motivated only by profit, not geopolitics. State-backed hackers bent on more serious destruction use the same intrusion methods as ransomware gangs. ``For companies vulnerable to ransomware, it's a bad sign because they are probably more vulnerable to more serious attacks,'' he said. Russian cyberwarriors, for example, crippled the electrical grid in Ukraine during the winters of 2015 and 2016. Cyberextortion attempts in the U.S. have become a death-by-a-thousand-cuts phenomenon in the past year, with attacks forcing delays in cancer treatment at hospitals, interrupting schooling and paralyzing police and city governments. Tulsa, Oklahoma, this week became the 32nd state or local government in the U.S. to come under ransomware attack, said Brett Callow, a threat analyst with the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft. Average ransoms paid in the US jumped nearly threefold to more than $310,000 last year. The average downtime for victims of ransomware attacks is 21 days, according to the firm Coveware, which helps victims respond. David Kennedy, founder and senior principal security consultant at TrustedSec, said that once a ransomware attack is discovered, companies have little recourse but to completely rebuild their infrastructure, or pay the ransom. ``Ransomware is absolutely out of control and one of the biggest threats we face as a nation,'' Kennedy said. ``The problem we face is most companies are grossly underprepared to face these threats.'' Colonial transports gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and home heating oil from refineries on the Gulf Coast through pipelines running from Texas to New Jersey. Its pipeline system spans more than 5,500 miles (8,850 kilometers), transporting more than 100 million gallons (380 million liters) a day. Debnil Chowdhury at the research firm IHSMarkit said that if the outage stretches to one to three weeks, gas prices could begin to rise. ``I wouldn't be surprised, if this ends up being an outage of that magnitude, if we see 15- to 20-cent rise in gas prices over next week or two,'' he said. The Justice Department has a new task force dedicated to countering ransomware attacks. While the U.S. has not suffered any serious cyberattacks on its critical infrastructure, officials say Russian hackers in particular are known to have infiltrated some crucial sectors, positioning themselves to do damage if armed conflict were to break out. While there is no evidence the Kremlin benefits financially from ransomware, U.S. officials believe President Vladimir Putin savors the mayhem it wreaks in adversaries' economies. Iranian hackers have also been aggressive in trying to gain access to utilities, factories and oil and gas facilities. In one case in 2013, they broke into the control system of a US dam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/cyberattack-on-us-pipeline-is-linked-to-criminal-gang/articleshow/82513744.cms||---

Dr Hemant Leuva, a city-based surgeon and avid mountaineer, is living by the same philosophy. In fact, this professor of surgery at NHL Municipal Medical College has started his ascent of Mount Everest on Saturday. Talking to TOI, Dr Leuva said that if weather permits and all goes well, his team would summit on May 12 or 13. “No amount of preparation can prepare you for the ultimate ascend that not only pushes you physically, but also mentally. But I am in the company of good and experienced hands,” he said. His feat is however not only of a mountaineer. In November and December last year, the doctor and his wife Dr Surabhi, chief medical officer with Gujarat Vidyapith, both tested positive for Covid-19. The tryst with infection made their resolution to conquer the Everest stronger. Dr Surabhi, also a mountaineer, has accompanied him to the Mt Everest Base Camp. The duo worked tirelessly during the pandemic in their respective fields. Along with the administrative and operative work at SVP Hospital for the Covid patients, Dr Leuva also coordinated the calls on104 for Covid queries. “The pandemic however inspired me, and pushed me to realize my dream sooner than later. It could have been riskier, but I was declared medically fit for the arduous climb, which only motivated me to attempt it this season,” said Dr Leuva. Thus, when Covid cases started downward fall earlier this year, Dr Leuva eyed the summer window of 2021. The preparations took over two months – from starting a fundraiser to support his quest to prepare mentally and physically. “We climbed Mt Lobuche with 20,000 feet height to prepare for Mt Everest. The acclimatization also takes place with the teams going regularly from camp 1 to 4 at different elevations and coming back to the base. On the final ascend, the mountaineers just go from camp 4 to the peak,” said Dr Leuva, adding that the weather they experience is good for the climb. He is making the climb with the message of saving the environment to save Earth. “It’s any mountaineer’s dream to reach the highest peak of the world – but there must be a reason for taking this up. For me, it’s like going to the mother’s lap,” said Dr Leuva. “We have been running a group of semi professional mountaineers and trekkers ‘Mountain Movers’ from Ahmedabad where doctors and other professionals are members. Our aim is to go closer to nature to motivate the members to preserve it for the next generation and promote sustainable practices.” He along with Mountain Movers in the past have ascended Mt Stok Kangri, Mt Deo Tibba (India), Mt Kilimanjaro (Tanzania) and Mt Island Peak (Nepal) among others in the past few years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dr-hemant-leuva-doctor-conquered-covid-mount-everest-is-next/articleshow/82513667.cms||Parth Shastri

The father is suspected to be Covid-19 positive but his poor family has not been able to afford even an RT-PCR test. Despite his disability, the youngster took his father to many hospitals only to be turned away. On Sunday evening, he knocked on the doors of hospitals in Koramangala and Shivajinagar. Finally, around 10pm, Shameem Akthar, 68, a tailor specialising in sari embroidery design, was admitted to a hospital in Indiranagar. Shameem developed fever and cough last week. “We were treating him at home with some medicines but his condition started to deteriorate on Monday. I’m completely blind and my ammi (mother) is old. We couldn’t do much for him,” Shameem’s son Shabaaz, said, while taking care of his father in their small home on 4th Cross in New Guddadahalli, off Mysuru Road. Shabaaz, in his mid-20s, said his father’s oxygen levels dipped as low as 80% and they arranged for an oxygen cylinder which is keeping him alive. “In the past five days, we have been taking him to hospitals to find an ICU bed but haven’t been able to find one,” he said. Shameem is showing all symptoms of having contracted the virus. The family managed to get a CT scan done, only to learn that his score was 17 of the severity score of 25, which is alarming and his condition remains critical. “When we tried to reach many voluntary organisations for support, the response was not very positive. His oxygen level is low and I believe that’s why many hospitals turned him away,” said a Covid volunteer who assists patients in finding beds. Shabaaz’s tenacity in looking for a bed for this father finally paid off, offering him a small ray of hope to see him recover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/blind-son-finds-icu-bed-for-father-in-bengaluru-after-five-day-hunt/articleshow/82513908.cms||Petlee Peter

Wipro has said it will reimburse affected employees and family members if their treatment costs exceed the insurance coverage. CEO Thierry Delaporte wrote in a LinkedIn post that they would also offer extended time off to recover from the disease, or support family or friends, or prioritise mental health. He also wrote that the company has arranged "fully-funded Covid isolation centres in various cities." TOI had reported that HCL Technologies is offering a Rs 30 lakh insurance cover and an additional Rs 7 lakh employee deposit linked insurance cover to employees for Covid-19. In the event of an HCL employee's unfortunate demise due to Covid, the families will get the full value of this cover, as also an amount equal to the one-year salary of the employee. For Infosys, Covid-related medical treatments are covered under the group employee insurance. Infosys has set up employee Covid care centres in Pune and Bengaluru. These centres would be managed by Ruby Hall hospital for Pune, and Manipal Hospitals for Bengaluru. Employees who have contracted or recovering from Covid-19 are given 21 days of additional paid leave by the company. Accenture said they have built several resources including 24/7 telemedicine services, care-at-home services, enhanced insurance coverage, virtual childcare, mental health support, and support for testing and vaccinations to support its over two lakh employees and their families in India.

BHOPAL Intensive investigations were carried out by the scientists, say officials. “We started working on this drug for curing cancer in 1998. Since the results were very cheering, investigations went on and we got it patented in 2002-2004,” says Paritosh Malviya, the public relation officer (PRO) at DRDO, Gwalior. Ministry of defence (MoD) mentioned it in its annual report 2003-04 saying “Clinical trials using 2-deoxy-DGlucose (2-DG) to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy of cancer in patients with malignant brain tumor has yielded very encouraging results with enhanced survival and improved quality of life.” MoD referred to the development of this drug again in its annual report 2010-2011 in the Life Sciences Systems/ Products column revealing that the Phase – III clinical trials were successfully completed and DCGI clearance was wait for its launch in the market. It says, “The safety and efficacy of 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG) as the optimal radiosensitizer through cell lines, animal and human trials has been established. The glucose anti-metabolite, 2-deoxy-Dglucose (2-DG), is a glycolytic inhibitor that significantly depletes the energy in cancer cells, thereby compromising their ability to repair the damage and resist therapy. This results in a selective increase in damage caused by radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs in tumors” Further research was shifted to the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS), a DRDO lab in Delhi, in collaboration with pharma major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Hyderabad. The drug, which comes in a sachet in powder form, has to be taken orally by dissolving it in water. The drug works by accumulating in the virus infected cells and prevents virus replication by stopping viral synthesis and energy production. Pursuing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for preparedness against the pandemic, DRDO took the initiative of developing anti-Covid therapeutic application of 2-DG. In April 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic, INMAS-DRDO scientists conducted laboratory experiments with the help of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad and found that this molecule works effectively against SARS-CoV-2 virus and inhibits the viral growth. Based on these results, Drugs Controller General of India’s (DCGI) Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) permitted Phase-II clinical trial of 2-DG in Covid-19 patients in May 2020. In Phase-II trials (including dose ranging) conducted during May to October 2020, the drug was found to be safe in Covid-19 patients and showed significant improvement in their recovery. A significantly favourable trend (2.5 days difference) was seen in terms of the median time to achieving normalisation of specific vital sign. Based on successful results, DCGI further permitted the Phase-III clinical trials in November 2020. The Phase-III clinical trial was conducted on 220 patients between December 2020 to March 2021 at 27 Covid hospitals in the country. The detailed data of phase-III clinical trial was presented to DCGI. In 2-DG arm, significantly higher proportion of patients improved symptomatically and became free from supplemental oxygen dependence (42% vs 31%) by Day-3 in comparison to SoC, On May 1, 2021, DCGI granted permission for Emergency Use of this drug as adjunct therapy in moderate to severe COVID-19 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/drdo-drug-first-tested-in-gwalior-lab-on-cancer-patients-in-1998/articleshow/82514025.cms||P Naveen
---||World||Myanmar 100 days: Three female activists||BANGKOK: They have given up everything and are working in the shadows to overthrow the junta. A hundred days on from the military coup that ended Myanmar's brief dalliance with democracy, three women tell AFP about their lives and their struggle, living between anger and hope. AFP has changed their names because of the danger they face in speaking out against the regime. "They murdered my future," said writer Ma Hninsi. Since the coup, the 55-year-old has lost her literary magazine, her lifestyle and her circle of friends. A political prisoner for six years under the previous military regime in Yangon's notorious Insein prison, Ma Hninsi's world collapsed again with the coup on the morning of February 1. "There was a lot of confusion as communications were cut off. The streets were empty, only army supporters were parading around," she said. The resistance organised itself quickly and Ma Hninsi demonstrated every day in Yangon. "For the first weeks, in the streets there were many people, women, children," she said. "People were angry, but the atmosphere was peaceful. We sang and danced." But then the atmosphere changed. "One day, the military started shooting. We understood that they had nothing left to lose," she said. More than 770 civilians have been killed in the junta's crackdown on protests, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a monitoring group. The junta reports a much lower death toll, and blames the violence on "rioters" engaging in "acts of terrorism". On Armed Forces Day on March 27, around 100 people were killed in crackdowns on protests, according to the AAPP, the bloodiest day since the coup. Near Ma Hninsi's home, students were surrounded. "I took advantage of a calm period to hide five of them in my car and evacuate them. Within minutes, we came across a patrol," she said. Since then, Ma Hninsi has been hiding, writing and meditating every day "to relieve the stress". She is also collecting money to support workers taking part in the civil disobedience movement which is paralysing entire sectors of the economy. "The solidarity is enormous. Everyone helps as much as possible," she said. "We will win. It's not a dream -- it's a certainty." Htoi Zin has spent her whole life in Kachin State, in the far north of the country, near the Chinese border. Over the past three months, many anti-junta activists have sought refuge in the territory, which is partly controlled by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), an ethnic armed group that has fought the military for years. From this isolated region, political resistance is being organised and Htoi Zin, 32, helps the new arrivals settle in. "They have often travelled for several days to avoid security checks. Many are depressed, they have lost everything, sometimes they have witnessed atrocities," she said. She provides them with a roof over their heads, food and Chinese SIM cards to get around the junta-imposed mobile data blackouts, helped by online donations from Myanmar but also from the United States, Japan and Singapore. "Often small amounts of a few dozen dollars, but it can be as much as $1,000. I exchange the online donations for cash at merchants," she explains. Since the coup, the long-running conflict between the military and KIA has flared once again, and the two have combined to send prices for everyday goods in the area soaring. "Twenty kilos of rice costs $30 (now), when it was $19 before the coup, and it's the same for oil or tomatoes," Htoi Zin said. "If this continues, we will soon not be able to afford it." "I am too old to take up arms, but I support the insurgents 100 percent," said Nan Poe, an activist. On March 1, as soldiers hunting her interviewed her neighbours, the 53-year-old fled her Yangon home by the back door, not stopping even to put on her shoes. She went east to territory controlled by ethnic Karen rebels, which has given refuge to many junta opponents. A month later, the Karen National Union (KNU) armed group seized a military post and the army retaliated with air raids, the first in more than 20 years in the region. For a week, Nan Poe hid in the jungle, helped by villagers. She crossed the border into neighbouring Thailand, but after three days was sent back by the authorities and now she prefers to stay in Myanmar. "We have to stand up alongside the Karen youth who are fighting for our people," she said. As clashes between the KNU and military rumble on and air strikes continue, she helps build makeshift shelters on the hillsides, digging holes that she covers with sandbags and wood. "At dawn, as soon as we hear the planes, we run to put the children in the shelters," she said. "I tell them to be brave, that victory will be on our side."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/myanmar-100-days-three-female-activists/articleshow/82514098.cms||---

Biden spoke at length with Modi last month and conveyed solidarity with India in its fight against the viral disease. He assured the prime minister that the US and India will work closely together in the fight against Covid-19. "Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need," Biden had said in a tweet. Reflecting an overwhelming support for a "natural ally", the entire country not only the administration, but also the corporate sector which created a global task force, as well as Americans and Indian-Americans have opened their coffers for India.

Several companies like Boeing and Mastercard have announced financial assistance worth USD 10 million each, Google has pledged USD 18 million, which the Global Task Force that comprises CEOs of top American companies have already pledged USD 30 million worth of life saving equipment. Describing it as a “Berlin Life Moment”, Mukesh Aghi of US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF), told PTI he expects the assistance to touch almost USD 1 billion by the end of the month. “It is emotional for the diaspora, almost everyone has someone who has been touched by Covid-19,” he said.

People of the country and the Diaspora too have come out in large numbers. Indian-American Vinod Khosla has committed USD 10 million, top corporate leader John T Chambers has promised USD 1 million. For the first time in its history, Sewa International has raised USD 15 million; American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI) (USD 3.6 million), Indiaspora (USD 2.5) million and Jai Shetty has raised USD 4 million. “There has been overwhelming support and offers of assistance from the US Government, private sector, diaspora and the American public at large. In fact, in my interactions in recent days, the US interlocutors across the board ask me, ‘tell us what more we can do for India'”, India's ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu told PTI. “They recall with fondness the help India gave. These are reflective of strong partnership and close people to people ties between our both nations. We deeply appreciate these gestures. We will continue to engage with the US in our collective fight against the pandemic,” he said.

On Sunday, Indian-Americans from Tamil Nadu including eminent philanthropist M R Rangaswami, held a “Help Tamil Nadu Breathe” to raise USD 1.5 million in few hours. “This is an incredible outpouring of generosity, which people have come to expect from America. When the world has a crisis, beyond politics, beyond dispute America steps up,” Rangaswami said. “It is comforting to see US cargo jets with much needed medical supplies landing at the Delhi airport regularly,” said Karun Rishi, president of the USA-India Chambers of Commerce. Noting that the stakes are very high for the entire world, he said India's success or failure to come out of this once in a century crisis will have a direct impact throughout the world. Echoing Biswal, Rishi said that more needs to be done. “The scale of assistance to India needs to increase and speeded up. To make some reasonable impact to tide over this crisis, India may need between USD 25-USD 50 billion in assistance in the form of vaccines, technology transfer, increasing vaccines and therapeutics manufacturing capacity, medical equipment and public health measures,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/outpouring-of-support-from-us-for-india-covid-19-help-touches-usd-half-a-billion/articleshow/82514118.cms||---

---||World||Myanmar coup: 100 days of turmoil||YANGON: Myanmar's military seized power on February 1, ousting the civilian government and arresting its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. The 100 days that have followed have seen mass street protests, bloody crackdowns by the junta, economic turmoil and growing international concern. A recap of events: The generals stage a coup on February 1, detaining Nobel peace laureate Suu Kyi and her top allies in pre-dawn raids. It ends Myanmar's decade-long experiment with democracy after close to half a century of military rule. The generals claim fraud in November's elections, which Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide. The putsch draws global condemnation, from Pope Francis to US President Joe Biden. Two days later 75-year-old Suu Kyi is charged with an obscure offence over unregistered walkie-talkies at her home. Resistance to the coup begins with people banging pots and pans -- a practice traditionally associated with driving out evil spirits. The junta tries to block social media platforms including Facebook, which is hugely popular in Myanmar. Nightly internet blackouts are later imposed. Popular dissent surges over the weekend of February 6 and 7, with tens of thousands of people gathering on the streets calling for the release of Suu Kyi. Workers begin a nationwide strike on February 8. A young woman, Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, is shot in the head and another person is wounded after police fire on crowds in Naypyidaw on February 9. The next day Washington announces sanctions against several military officials, including Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the army chief now in charge. More rounds of sanctions follow in the subsequent weeks from the United States, Britain and the European Union. On February 16 Suu Kyi's lawyer says she has been hit with a second charge, this time under the natural disaster management law. Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, the woman shot 10 days earlier, dies on February 19, becoming a symbol of opposition to the junta. Suu Kyi is hit with two new criminal charges on March 1. Her lawyer says she is now accused of inciting unrest and breaking telecommunications laws. Ten days later the military accuses her of accepting illegal payments of cash and gold. On March 11 rights group Amnesty International says it has documented atrocities by the junta including the use of battlefield weapons on unarmed protesters. A day later a UN rights expert on Myanmar accuses the military of crimes against humanity. The junta defends seizing power on March 25 and says it will not tolerate "anarchy" wrought by protesters. Armed Forces Day on March 27, the military's annual show of strength, turns into a bloodbath with more than 100 civilians killed in protest crackdowns -- the deadliest single day since the coup. Violence escalates in border areas between the military and Myanmar's numerous ethnic rebel armies -- several of which have declared their support for the protest movement. On March 31 a UN envoy calls for Security Council action to stop the country spiralling into civil war. On April 2, Suu Kyi's lawyer announces the most serious charge laid against her -- of breaching the official secrets act. Ousted civilian lawmakers, forced into hiding, announce the formation of a shadow "National Unity Government". Leaders from regional bloc ASEAN hold a summit on the Myanmar crisis in Jakarta, and invite junta leader Min Aung Hlaing. They agree a five-point statement calling for dialogue, an end to violence and the appointment of an envoy. But state media report days later the bloc's "suggestions" will only be considered "when the situation returns to stability" in Myanmar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/myanmar-coup-100-days-of-turmoil/articleshow/82514140.cms||---

For dentists warn that it can be mucormycosis (MM), which even they have been witnessing for the first time. After MM starts with sinusitis, the fungus severely damages eyes and the surrounding organs. But recent cases have shown how damaging it can be for the jaws too. Mucormycosis infectionDue to the fast and severe spread of the infection, ENT surgeons in the city had to remove half of the jaw and teeth of a patient who recently recovered from Covid infection. If MM infection starts spreading in the lower part of the face, the patient will suffer toothache which will lead to tooth mobility in just one day, dentists said. “In the last three days three patients, who have recovered from Covid19 infection a month ago, came with mobile teeth. Their CT scan did not reveal any damage to the maxilla, but the biopsy revealed that it is MM,” said Dr Risshi Bhatt, maxillofacial surgeon. “After consulting a senior ENT surgeon the surgery was conducted and half of the upper jaw had to be removed to save the life of the patient,” Dr Bhatt added. Dr Venus Tilavat Patel, an ENT surgeon, who has treated several cases of loss of vision due to MM, said that such serious problems in the jaw is something new even for ENT surgeons. “Last year, MM cases had been reported but we are witnessing its severity upto this extent for the first time now,” the doc said. At the state-run New Civil Hospital (NCH), doctors are coming across various cases of MM with teeth mobility. “We are treating two patients of MM with tooth mobility and it indicates the severity of the infection. It can create a hole in the upper palate of the mouth if ignored,” said Dr Gunvant Parmar, professor and HoD of dentistry, Government Medical College (GMC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/covid-patients-losing-jaws-to-mucormycosis-infection/articleshow/82514068.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
