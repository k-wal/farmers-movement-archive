Since the beginning of the week, the level had dipped from an already low 15 lakh on Monday to just over 13 lakh on Tuesday and looked likely to close Wednesday at about 12 lakh. The low level of vaccination on Wednesday was a result of zero doses in 92 of the 754 districts listed on the portal. In particular, only five of the 41 districts in Gujarat and three of the 33 in Telangana had administered any doses if the data was accurate. The 26 other districts with no vaccination on the day were scattered across the remaining states and UTs with Uttarakhand accounting for four of them. All told, there were 15 states or UTs with at least one district in which there was no vaccination on Wednesday. India’s declining level of daily vaccination has been a matter of concern at a time when rapidly vaccinating the adult population is widely regarded as the best way of preventing a third wave of a pandemic that has already killed nearly 3 lakh people by the official count and many more by unofficial estimates. States have been complaining of shortages of vaccines and while the Centre has assured them that supplies would pick up significantly in the future, that could have to wait till July at the earliest. With an adult population of about 94 crore, India would need to administer 188 crore doses to fully vaccinate all of them, a target that the Centre has suggested will be met by year end. As of Wednesday, however, a total of just over 18.6 crore doses had been administered over the last four months and a bit, leaving nearly 170 crore shots to be given over the remaining nearly seven and a half months. That would require an average of over 75 lakh doses a day, almost twice the peak level achieved so far and five times the current daily levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vaccination-graph-continues-to-dip-below-20-lakh-for-6th-day/articleshow/82781928.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: Plan till mid-June for efficient use of jabs, Centre tells states||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday advised states to do advance planning for vaccine administration till mid-June and publicise it on Co-Win to ensure efficient utilisation of available jabs and avoid overcrowding at centres, while itself sharing advance information about supply and availability of doses. Between May 1 and June 15, 5.86 crore doses will be provided to states under the central quota. Besides, as per information received from manufacturers of Covishield and Covaxin, 4.87 crore doses will be available till the end of next month for direct procurement by states and UTs, according to the the health ministry. The vaccines supplied by the Centre will be used to immunise only those above 45 years of age and health and frontline workers. People in the age group of 18-44 years will get vaccine only from stocks procured by respective state government, private hospitals and corporates. The Centre has asked states and UTs to prepare a district-wise and vaccination centre-wise plan for the administration of Covid vaccine till mid-June, and publicise it. The move is aimed at enabling “efficient and judicious” utilisation of available doses for smooth implementation of the vaccination programme, health ministry said. Last week, the government said that it is supplying states with 1.92 crore doses of Covid vaccine between May 16 and May 31, which includes 162.5 lakh doses of Covishield and 29.49 lakh doses of Covaxin. Apart from preparing a district-wise and vaccination centre-wise plan for administration of Covid vaccines, states have also been instructed to use multiple media platforms for dissemination of such a plan to enhance awareness among the masses. Apart from preparing a district-wise and vaccination centre-wise plan for administration of Covid vaccines, states have also been instructed to use multiple media platforms for dissemination of such a plan to enhance awareness among the masses. Also, states and private vaccination centres have been advised to publish their vaccination calendar on Co-Win digital platform in advance, while desisting from publishing single day vaccination calendars. “The vaccination exercise as a tool to protect the most vulnerable population groups in the country from Covid continues to be regularly reviewed and monitored at the highest level,” the health ministry said. Till Wednesday morning, India administered a total of 18.58 crore vaccine doses, of which nearly 64 lakh doses were given to those in the 18-44 age group. The Centre implemented the new Covid-19 vaccination policy from May 1, when it also opened vaccination for all adults above 18 years of age. As part of the new strategy, 50% of the locally manufactured vaccine doses would be procured by the Centre and it would continue to make them available to state governments for vaccination of people above 45 years. The remaining 50% vaccine doses produced locally would be available for direct procurement by the state governments and private hospitals. Besides, states and private players can also import vaccines for immunisation of 18-44 years population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-plan-till-mid-june-for-efficient-use-of-jabs-centre-tells-states/articleshow/82782364.cms||---
---||India||Vaccination to be deferred 3 months after recovery from Covid: Centre||NEW DELHI: Those infected with Covid-19, including persons who contracted the infection after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, should take the jab three months after recovering from the disease, the health ministry said on Wednesday. People with other serious illnesses requiring hospitalisation or ICU care should also wait for 4-8 weeks before getting the Covid-19 vaccine after being discharged from hospital, according to the ministry said. All lactating women can take vaccines, though a technical advisory group on immunisation is still studying data to evaluate whether it can be allowed for pregnant women, the ministry said. Blood can be donated after 14 days of either receiving an anti-Covid shot or testing RT-PCR negative, if having suffered from the disease. The decisions were based on recommendations by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC). “The suggestions were made keeping in mind evolving situation of the pandemic, emerging scientific evidence and experience from across the globe,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, who also co-chairs NEGVAC, said in a letter to states and UTs. So far, the government’s advisory was to wait for 4-8 weeks after recovery from Covid-19 symptoms in case of infection before getting the vaccine. The NEGVAC suggested that those who have received anti-SARS-2 monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma should defer Covid-vaccination by three months from the date of discharge from the hospital. The health ministry clarified there is no requirement for screening of vaccine recipients by Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) prior to Covid-19 vaccination. This is significant as many vaccination centres are insisting that an on-the spot RAT test be conducted prior to vaccination, primarily to ensure the recipient is not Covid positive. In case of individuals who have received the first dose and contracted the Covid-19 infection before completion of the dosing schedule, the second dose should be deferred by three months after clinical recovery from Covid-19 illness. According to the ministry, it is advisable to receive both the doses irrespective of past history of Covid-19 infection as this will help in developing a strong immune response against the disease. The Centre has advised states to ensure effective dissemination of the information to service provides as well as the general public, through use of all channels of information and communication in local languages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vaccination-to-be-deferred-3-months-after-recovery-from-covid-centre/articleshow/82782676.cms||---

If no satisfactory response is received, necessary steps in consonance with law will be taken,” sources said, emphasising that the government is “concerned and serious” over what they called WhatsApp’s “bulldozing its way through to force users” to agree to the update. In a fresh letter sent to the company, the IT ministry said that WhatsApp’s new privacy policy — which permits sharing business communication of users with Facebook although personal chats remain encrypted — is a “violation of several provisions” of the existing Indian laws and rules. “In fulfilment of its sovereign responsibility to protect the rights and interests of Indian citizens, the Indian government will consider various options available to it under laws in India.” The government said that WhatsApp’s policy “undermines the sacrosanct values of informational privacy, data security and user choice for Indian users, and harms the rights and interests of Indian citizens”. The company, which has received opposition to its latest update from the IT ministry, Competition Commission of India, and even the courts, remains defiant in its decision to move ahead with the proposal, which though had been deferred across the European Union as the latter found the move against the tenets of user and data privacy of its citizens. WhatsApp’s new privacy update has faced flak across the globe, especially with the company trying to force customers to accept the measure by limiting functionalities beyond May 15 (in India). When contacted, a spokesperson for WhatsApp in India said that the company continues to engage with the government on the matter. “… we reaffirm what we said before that this update does not impact the privacy of personal messages for anyone. Our goal is to provide information about new options we are building that people will have, to message a business on WhatsApp, in the future.” The company said that it has not deleted any accounts, and claimed that no one lost functionality, even though there were instances of users not being able to access chats or not getting direct access to the main interface. Shreya Suri, who tracks IT regulatory policies at law firm IndusLaw, said unlike the EU, lack of a data protection law in India is making it easier for WhatsApp to push the new update in India. “It’s taking advantage of a loophole since we don’t have a law.” On May 10, WhatsApp had made it clear that users who do not update despite repeated reminders will start encountering “limited functionality” on the app. “You won’t be able to access your chat list, but you can still answer incoming phone and video calls… After a few weeks of limited functionality, you won’t be able to receive incoming calls or notifications and WhatsApp will stop sending messages and calls to your phone.” In its fresh communication, the IT ministry has also raised objections to WhatsApp giving discriminatory treatment to Indian users vis-à-vis users in Europe. “As you are doubtlessly aware, many Indian citizens depend on WhatsApp to communicate in everyday life. It is not just problematic, but also irresponsible, for WhatsApp to leverage this position to impose unfair terms and conditions on Indian users, particularly those that discriminate against Indian users vis-à-vis users in Europe.” Earlier, competition watchdog CCI had ordered an investigation into the matter as it found the proposed changes prima facie “exploitative and exclusionary” for users. Even the Supreme Court had raised objections and said that it will “examine” the proposed update, even while the matter is now being heard in the Delhi High Court. “You may be a two- or three-trillion-dollar company, but people’s privacy is more valuable,” the Supreme Court had said, making clear that it will not allow sharing of user data by the company. The decision to share data with Facebook had started raising concerns globally considering the poor track of the company in maintaining user-data privacy, something evident in the Cambridge Analytica scandal and many other such breaches (it faces a CBI inquiry in India over the data leaks) that happened at Facebook.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-puts-whatsapp-on-notice-as-co-starts-putting-curbs-on-users/articleshow/82782786.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||Bengaluru||Covid-19: Karnataka sees sharp rise in deaths among the young||BENGALURU: Nearly 56% of deaths due to Covid-19 in the 20-49 age group in Karnataka have occurred in the past two months, showing how brutal the second wave of the pandemic has been on the younger generations, exacting a heavy toll on society and several families which have lost their lone earning member. Doctors say they rarely saw young patients suffering from severe infections leading to fatalities during the first wave. “Now they account for not less than 30% of ICU beds,” said Dr Mahendra Kumar, medical director of Sagar Hospitals, Jayanagar. A majority, they point out, seek hospital beds 8-11 days after showing symptoms when the infection has deteriorated from mild to severe. In absolute numbers, of the 4,432 victims in the 20-49 age bracket so far, 2,465 died between March 17 and May 17. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesIntensivists treating Covid cases in ICU say most of these youngsters were the breadwinners of their families and in several cases, sons have left behind parents who survived the infection. A decade-wise breakup of the 20-49 age group from the state war room data shows deaths have rapidly climbed in each category in the past two months though case fatality rates remain less. Read AlsoBlack fungus complication adds to India's Covid woes: All you need to knowThe government has told doctors to look out for signs of mucormycosis or 'black fungus' in Covid-19 patients as hospitals report a rise in cases of the rare but potentially fatal infection.“Percentage-wise, it might appear less but for the family which has lost the a breadwinner, it is 100% failure. In the second wave, infections are largely being seen among the younger population,” said a Covid technical advisory committee member. While 4.8 lakh people aged 20-29 have been infected so far, the number is 5.1 lakh for 30-39-year-olds and nearly 4 lakh in the 40-49 bracket. Ahead of the third wave, he pointed out, the slow pace of vaccination in the 18-44 age group is a major concern. Read AlsoICMR approves home-based RAT kit for Covid testingThe Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has approved a home-based rapid antigen testing (RAT) kit for Covid-19, which will be soon available in the market and can be used for detecting positive cases in home setting.Dr Brunda MS, consultant for internal medicine at Aster CMI Hospital, points out that one of the reasons for rising deaths in this age group is that it was not part of the initial vaccination drive. “We are seeing a lot of youngsters dying from Covid-19. First, not many have taken precautions seriously and didn’t follow the guidelines of social distancing, wearing masks and usage of hand sanitiser. This is the primary reason why the second wave has badly hit this age group,” she said. “Several youngsters are out for work, while some have also partied. And they have suffered from damage caused by infections and damage caused by exaggerated immune response, which is self-destructive,” said Dr Sheela Chakravarthy, director of internal medicine at Fortis Hospital, Bannerghatta Road. Nearly 20% of ICU beds in Fortis Hospital are occupied by youngsters, she added. Doctors agree late hospitalisation is also contributing to more deaths. “Symptoms among youngsters have been varying and late reporting for admission after symptoms worsen or there is sudden deterioration has been a worrying factor,” says Brunda. This is worsened by non-availability of beds, certain drugs and adequate facilities, she added. Chakravarthy says happy hypoxia — low blood oxygen levels without external signs such as difficulty in breathing — occurs 8-10 days after the onset of infection and there are several cases of youngsters who have come at the last minute when they are completely exhausted. Young patients search for beds at the last minute and there is a time lapse again. “Early intervention can save lives,” she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-19-karnataka-sees-sharp-rise-in-deaths-among-the-young/articleshow/82783619.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||India||PM Modi pushes for innovation in extreme weather alerts||NEW DELHI: On a visit to Ahmedabad to review damage due to cyclone Tauktae, PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday called for use of more innovative methods to communicate extreme weather warnings and improve coordination between states, Coast Guard and Navy. At a meeting at Ahmedabad airport, Modi said Tauktae had broken from the patterns of previous storms and there is a need to integrate more scientific methods and a focus on comparisons between recent cyclones to see emerging patterns. Extensive coastlines require greater efforts in preparations and rescue and this was important not just in terms of human lives but also the likely economic damage that such storms inflict. This needed better communication mechanisms, the PM said. A source quoted Modi as having said that “conventional approach was to issue advertisements and information in newspapers. This is important but we need to think beyond such methods. State governments must work with FM radio networks, since FM radio is increasingly popular among youngsters and women”. He said integrating radio services was part of disaster management practices along with roping in mobile network providers to prepare durable strategies that could send out timely SMS, updates and more. The PM’s message was to also ensure targeted messaging to phones in an area that is in the path of a storm like Tauktae. A long-term measure Modi suggested was to strengthen disaster relief forces on the lines of NDRF. He said a recognisable uniform for SDRF will help just as the Army olives inspire a feeling of trust among citizens. Thus, when people in duress see the SDRF uniform, they should feel a spirit of trust and seek their help. The PM urged officials to give topmost priority to repairing homes and pay attention to the well-being of livestock that is so essential to economic activity. Officials recalled setting up the GSDMA when Modi was CM and said the agency has continuously evolved in its role. The PM also stressed on the need for micro-containment zones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-pushes-for-innovation-in-extreme-weather-alerts/articleshow/82783763.cms||---
---||India||Govt hikes subsidy to cushion jump in fertiliser prices||NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday increased the subsidy on di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser by almost two-and-a-half times to cushion the impact of a steep jump in global prices. Farmers will now get a subsidy of Rs 1,200 per 50-kg bag of DAP instead of Rs 500, so that they can continue to purchase a bag of the fertiliser at the old price of Rs 1,200 instead of the current market rate of Rs 2,400. After urea, DAP is the most widely used fertiliser in the country. The move will increase the annual subsidy burden by Rs 14,775 crore. The government had budgeted for fertiliser subsidy of Rs 79,500 crore during the current financial year and had not given the break-up for DAP separately in the budget papers. The move comes at a time when there is widespread protest in Punjab and Haryana over the government’s move to amend the agriculture laws, with farmer outfits still blocking roads at Delhi’s borders. Over the last few months, a spike in fertiliser prices was putting additional burden on farmers although the government was trying to hold back companies from price increase. But it finally agreed to bear the burden instead as farmers had to shell out more. The decision to increase was taken at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The PM remarked that his government is committed to the welfare of farmers and will take all efforts to ensure that farmers do not have to face the brunt of price rise. This is the second major decision in the farmers’ interest, after directly transferring Rs 20,667 crore in farmers’ account under PM-KISAN on the day of Akshay Tritiya,” the PMO said in a statement. Last year, the actual price of DAP was Rs 1,700 per bag and the Centre was giving a subsidy of Rs 500 for every bag resulting in farmers having to pay Rs 1,200.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-hikes-subsidy-to-cushion-jump-in-fertiliser-prices/articleshow/82785124.cms||---

---||India||BJP ‘links’ toolkit to Congress activist; Rahul says it’s lying||NEW DELHI: BJP and Congress on Wednesday remained locked in a high-decibel confrontation over the former’s charge that the opposition party had orchestrated a campaign to malign the Modi government over the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic by circulating a “toolkit” for amplification of its charges. Even as BJP, disregarding Congress’s threat of legal action, doubled down on its charge of fabricating a campaign linking the “toolkit” to a Congress insider, Rahul Gandhi accused BJP of spreading lies to divert attention from its failures. “Vaccines are in short supply and Covid deaths are increasing. The central government policy: Divert attention, spread lies, make a noise to hide facts,” he tweeted. It was BJP which fired the first salvo on Wednesday, with party spokesperson Sambit Patra releasing what he called more evidence linking the “toolkit” — a catalogue of issues on themes ranging from Central Vista to christening the virus after Modi — to a Congress activist, Saumya Varma, who worked for Congress's research team headed by former MP Rajiv Gowda. The charge was refuted by Gowda who accused BJP of forgery. “Let’s be clear. We made a research note on the Central Vista for the party. It’s genuine and fact-based. I tweeted yesterday that ‘Covid-19 toolkit’ is forged and is a made in BJP product. BJP spokesman Sambit Patra is showing metadata/author of a real document and attributing it to a fake document,” he said, adding that while the document on Central Vista was genuine, BJP had pasted Varma’s signature to the “toolkit” to make the latter appear Congress’s handiwork. Congress also sent SMS messages in bulk to caution people about the “forgery”.Patra, however, pressed on, claiming that Sanjukta Basu, one of the members of Rahul's social media team, had attested to Congress’s authorship of the toolkit. “Congress denies the toolkit is theirs. They disowned the digital footprint of Saumya Varma, whose name figured as author of the toolkit but Sanjukta Basu, part of Rahul Gandhi’s social media team, openly admits that the toolkit is theirs and hails the initiative,” he said. BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted, “In another tell-all development, Saumya Varma, whose name figured as the author of the Congress toolkit, has deleted her Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. It is getting murkier as Congress rushes to erase digital footprint of their anti-India activities.” However, Gowda, who teaches at IIM, said Varma had to deactivate her social media accounts because of the harassment she faced from BJP. “BJP ecosystem indulges in the worst form of cynical politics. Its dirty tricks department extracted a colleague’s name from our genuine Central Vista document and attributed it to its fake ‘toolkit’. She deactivated her social media accounts after online harassment," he tweeted The tweet put him in the line of fire of BJP. Party general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh said, “Congress tries to salvage the wreckage, the more it sinks. Taxpayers’ money to IIM, IITs are for nation building. But here his entire team’s energies are for breaking India under Rahul Gandhi."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-links-toolkit-to-congress-activist-rahul-says-its-lying/articleshow/82785719.cms||---
---||India||Delhi HC sounds alarm on black fungus||NEW DELHI: This time Delhi can’t be “caught unawares”, Delhi High Court warned the state government on Wednesday while pointing to the shortage of a key drug to treat cases of black fungus, a post-Covid affliction. “What are the bottlenecks? You have to point them out. It can’t be a case of shortage if the drug is locally made. How can the drug be suddenly in short supply? We can’t be caught unawares,” said a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, while asking Delhi government to inform it by Thursday about the stock and supply status of Amphotericin B used in the treatment of mucormycosis, commonly called black fungus. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra said a single patient needed 90 vials of the drug for treatment but the state government didn’t have the required stocks because supply was controlled by the central government. On the sudden shortage, Mehra pointed out that the demand for Amphotericin B had suddenly shot up 100 times when it was earlier not regularly prescribed in such high numbers by doctors. “We have no stocks. Purely and squarely, the supply of this drug lies with the Centre, like Remdesivir. We are getting it in a rationed manner since the Centre has to make it available,” Mehra told the court, adding that other states too were facing this shortage. The bench responded, “What are the stocks held by you, what are your supplies and how are you distributing it, please tell us.” The court also sought to know the rationale behind the drug being cleared first by a technical committee before being approved for use on a needy patient. The government had submitted that it had set up a four-member panel to meet twice a day to clear applications. The high court asked both the Centre and Delhi government to take instructions on the issue and apprise it on Thursday. The bench noted, “Nobody had anticipated that we would be so badly hit by the second Covid wave which was why there were shortages of medicines.” The bench is monitoring the treatment of Covid patients and availability of hospital beds, testing laboratories, etc. Last month, it had noted with alarm that the coronavirus had raised its “ugly head” once again and the pandemic was raging with much greater intensity than earlier. “It is evident that the healthcare infrastructure is at the stage of imminent collapse,” the court had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-hc-sounds-alarm-on-black-fungus/articleshow/82786044.cms||---

It would take up drone surveys to develop 3D images of the temples and their properties, which devotees can view from any part of the world. The move comes against the backdrop of an online campaign ‘#free TamilNadu temples’ by the right-wing and Hindu ideologues. The department, following instructions from HR & CE minister P K Sekar Babu, has taken up the digitization of the temple and their properties “to achieve total transparency and to put an end to the misinformation campaign by people with vested interests,” said a senior officer. The government is clear in its approach to introduce transparency and efficiency in the administration of all the 44,227 temples located across the state. So far, the HR & CE department has uploaded data related to 32,239 temples in the existing Thirukoil web portal. “Executive officers have validated the information of 23,488 temples. It will be subjected to super checks by assistant/ joint commissioners of the department,” a senior officer told TOI. The department would engage an agency to develop digital elevation and surface models, covering the entire 4.95 lakh acres of lands belonging to temples with survey numbers. “It will take six to eight months to complete the task. Once it is done, people from anywhere can see a 3D image of any temple and its properties. We will capture high-value (sensitive) properties like idols. But these ‘sensitive idols’ cannot be accessed by the public considering their antiquity value and vulnerability to smugglers,” added the official. Minister Sekar Babu, while holding a review meeting with officials, urged them to upload all the information related to the administration of temples, festivals and consecrations. “We will also update temples’ annual budget expectations, revenue and people's donation to each temple. We will post an audit of the temples in the portal and it will be open for public view. It will help officials to devote their time to improving facilities for devotees and temple infrastructure,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hr-ce-to-take-up-drone-surveys-to-develop-3d-images-of-temples-properties/articleshow/82786369.cms||Shanmughasundaram J
---||India||CBI books MDs of Iffco, Indian Potash Limited for alleged corruption||NEW DELHI: The CBI has booked Managing Director and CEO of Indian Farmers’ Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) U S Awasthi and several others for alleged irregularities in import of fertilisers and inflated subsidy claims. The agency has also named former MD of Indian Potash Limited Parvinder Singh Gahlaut and his sons as accused in the FIR. CBI on Wednesday carried out search operations at 12 premises linked to Awasthi and Gahlaut in Delhi, Mumbai and Gurgaon. “Rs 8.80 lakh cash was found at the premises of Awasthi and fixed deposit receipts of over Rs 5.5 crore were found in the name of Parvinder Singh and his family members. Details of 14 bank accounts have been obtained apart from documents of 19 immovable properties at Mumbai, Himachal Pradesh, Gurgaon, Delhi and Sonipat,” CBI spokesperson R C Joshi said in a statement. The FIR was registered on the basis of references from the ministry of chemical & fertilisers. The case pertains to the accused allegedly claiming higher subsidies from the government by importing fertilisers at inflated prices and receiving commission from the supplier through sham transactions, officials said. The government provides a subsidy on fertilisers supplied to farmers to keep the prices reasonable. It was alleged that IFFCO and Indian Potash Limited have been importing huge quantities of fertilisers running into several thousands of MTs and raw materials for fertilisers from various foreign suppliers. CBI alleged that the accused, in order to cheat the government by claiming a higher subsidy, imported fertilisers and raw materials at highly inflated prices through Kisan International Trading FZE in Dubai (a subsidiary of IFFCO) and other middlemen. The inflated prices covered the alleged kickbacks meant for Awasthi and Gahlaut, which was transferred by the overseas suppliers to them through sham transactions, officials said. The agency has also booked sons of Awasthi —Amol, a promoter of the Catalyst Business Associate, and Anupam, a promoter of Catalyst Business Solutions, they said.

---||India||Shift Narada trial to a court outside Bengal, CBI tells HC||KOLKATA: Ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee as well as former ministers Madan Mitra and Sovan Chatterjee remained in custody for at least one more night as the Calcutta high court, after a two-and-a-half-hour hearing on Wednesday, decided to take up their bail pleas and related issues for hearing again on Thursday. The CBI named Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and law minister Moloy Ghatak as parties in their plea for transferring the case out of Bengal and the counsel for the arrested politicians accused the agency of saying “half-truths” in court, which was without “precedence in post-Independence India”. The CBI interpreted the CM and the state law minister’s presence at the CBI’s eastern zone headquarters and the court complex on Monday as an attempt to “influence the probe”. Not so, said the defence, explaining that the act was to “extend support and sympathy” to her senior cabinet colleagues. Solicitor-general Tushar Mehta started his arguments around 2 pm after a division bench of acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Arijit Banerjee convened virtually. Mehta’s arguments followed the formal CBI plea in court, seeking to transfer the Narada case outside Bengal. “A clear, cogent and forceful attempt” was made by CM Banerjee and other state functionaries “to overreach, impede and intimidate the judicial system and due process of law”, he said, submitting photographs and other documents to support the CBI claim. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for the arrested politicians, argued that staying their bail order without even giving them a hearing denied them “natural justice”. He also accused the CBI of saying half-truths in court, like “Aswathama Hata...” in the Mahabharata, as it wanted these leaders in custody at any cost. Justice Banerjee intervened at this point, saying Monday’s HC stay order followed a specific allegation of a judicial order being given under pressure. Singhvi countered this by saying the CBI special judge did not mention any such thing in his order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shift-narada-trial-to-a-court-outside-bengal-cbi-tells-hc/articleshow/82786596.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

Under the initiative, the SDRF will deploy two of its personnel in each adopted village. They will look after all the measures being undertaken to control further spread of the virus in the villages. “The main objective of this initiative is to provide 24x7 assistance to the people of densely populated Covid-hit villages in the hill districts of the state. On a pilot basis, the SDRF has adopted 20 such villages,” said Ridhim Agarwal, deputy inspector general (DIG), SDRF, Uttarakhand. For the first phase of the project, six villages from the Kumaon division and 14 from the Garhwal region have been identified. The maximum number of shortlisted villages are from Pauri, Chamoli and Uttarkashi districts, according to the SDRF official. Besides distributing masks and sanitisers, the SDRF personnel will also send daily status reports of the particular village to the control room. “Each village has been provided with oxygen cylinders, sanitisation equipment and necessary medicines so that the contagion can be contained,” said a senior SDRF official adding that the infected villagers in isolation are being regularly monitored. The SDRF is also ensuring that Covid patients in these villages practice breathing exercises daily. “The SDRF personnel are also conducting contact tracing and have segregated low-risk and high-risk Covid patients under isolation. These patients are regularly contacted by the control room to keep a tab on their health conditions,” said the SDRF official. Notably, the nine hill districts in Uttarakhand collectively recorded more than 33,000 Covid-19 cases — nearly 31% of all cases in the state — from May 1 to 16. During this period, Tehri recorded the highest of 5,652 Covid-19 cases, followed by Pauri (5,247) and Uttarkashi (5,159).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-disaster-response-force-adopts-20-covid-hit-villages-in-hill-districts-2-personnel-to-be-deployed-in-each-village/articleshow/82777979.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Visakhapatnam||AP ropes in 4K docs for virtual consultation of Covid patients||Visakhapatnam: With more than 1.5 lakh Covid-19 patients in home isolation, the Andhra Pradesh health department is focusing on providing virtual consultation to patients under home care through constant monitoring of their vitals. The nearly 4,300 doctors registered with the 104 call centre are currently making outgoing calls to about 15,000 to 25,000 patients every day. The health department wants to take this number to nearly 50,000 calls a day, considering the increasing number of cases that are being reported in the state evey day. Mild and asymptomatic Covid-19 patients who have the facilities for isolation in their homes, can opt for this facility. According to health officials, asymptomatic cases are those laboratory confirmed cases that do not experience any symptoms and have an oxygen saturation level above 94 per cent. The clinically assigned mild cases are those patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms and/or fever without shortness of breath and having oxygen saturation above 94 per cent. Back in May 2020, three Covid-19 patients had availed the home isolation facility in Rajahmundry in East Godavari district for the first time in the state. As they were not displaying any classic symptoms of the disease, the three software employees were allowed to receive the treatment at their home instead of being admitted to a Covid-19 hospital. It was then viewed as a bold move, considering the social stigma, rumours and panic associated with the pandemic. Since then, lakhs of patients have availed home isolation facility in Andhra Pradesh. As per the revised guidelines of the Union health ministry for home isolation of Covid-19 cases, patients must be in communication with a treating physician and promptly report in case of any deterioration. A mechanism to shift the patient in case of any sudden deterioration or need for treatment has to be established. Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Anil Kumar Singhal said that the health department has increased the number of outgoing lines at the 104 call centres to provide teleconsultation to patients in home care. “Based on their symptoms and diagnostics, they would be further referred for various medical services such as hospital or Covid care centre admission. The patients in home isolation would be provided with home isolation kits,” said Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-ropes-in-4k-docs-for-virtual-consultation-of-covid-patients/articleshow/82778823.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Vijayawada||Fence in villages with zero infections: Experts||Amaravati: Experts say there is an urgent need to ‘fence’ in zero infection villages from other towns and villages to contain Covid-19. Public representatives in village local bodies should play a proactive role to protect such safe villages from getting infected by initiating measures at the right time. A group of doctors who recently studied the pattern of virus spread found that many rural areas that were not infected during the first wave were affected in the second wave. “There are many reasons including elections, village festivals, weddings and social gatherings for villages becoming hotspots during the second wave. A few villages in every district have not reported any cases and the priority should be to protect such areas,” said Dr V Anil Kumar, who has handled hundreds of Covid-19 cases at Government General Hospital (GGH), Guntur. The villages that have close cultural and trade ties with towns and cities have become Covid-19 hotspots. The movement of people from these villages to towns and back for work or other purposes has resulted in the increase in cases. Similarly, border villages and the capital city have been affected because people have been migrating to cities for work and rushing back to their native places. “The return of a few asymptomatic cases to villages has led to the rise in cases in most villages,” said legislator Maddisetti Venugopal. The experts suggest that the government immediately initiate measures to protect zero infection villages. They have also suggested preventing people from travelling, except on medical emergencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/fence-in-villages-with-zero-infections-experts/articleshow/82779292.cms||Samdani MN
---||Kolkata||Social initiative by city intellectuals joins Cov fight||Kolkata: An initiative that was formed by writers Sunil Gangopadhyay and Nabaneeta Dev Sen, and carried forward by the likes of actor Soumitra Chatterjee and painter Jogen Chowdhury, has now plunged into Covid relief work. Chowdhury, who is now the president of The Bengal, has got directors Goutam Ghose, Arindam Sil and Srijit Mukherjee, singer Usha Uthup, dancer Dona Ganguly and a retinue of actors and social activists to form a mediators’ ring that will connect donors and distressed Covid patients. The group is asking donors not to send cash, but to sponsor underprivileged patients fighting for life either at home because they cannot afford expensive private hospitals and did not get beds in government hospitals or lodged in safe homes that are being supported by NGOs. A list of NGOs that have been working for Covid patients has been drawn up and a 24-hour link has been formed through volunteers. Donors are being given details of requisitions by NGOs with case specifics and the two sides are then being connected. Even individual patients, especially senior citizens, are free to contact the volunteers of The Bengal on the WhatsApp numbers provided. These patients are being immediately attended to by The Bengal volunteers, who are connecting them to the nearest NGO. Help is being provided to them by these NGOs from donors who are buying the cylinders and medicines. “Every family with a patient knows who is sending help and through whom. Likewise for the donor. We did not want to set up a fund-collection system,” said Esha Dutta, a social entrepreneur and project spokesperson. “This is a war-like situation and we thought of joining the fight as a body because we have the advantage of knowing a lot of people that we can reach out to,” Chowdhury said. Directors Goutam Ghose and Arindam Sil said the work The Bengal does for senior citizens in the Pronaam initiative with Kolkata Police has helped them take up this project. In the past week that the Covid work has been activated for the group, help has been sent in form of oxygen cylinders to Behala gurdwara where an oxygen langar has been set up, medicines and cylinders have been sent to the safe home called Banichakra in ward 87, to the safe homes in Sunderbans that have been linked up by director Srijit Mukherjee through NGOs working there, as well as to the safe homes that have been set up by NGO Prayas, Yuva Sangh and Calcutta Foundation. “Help is pouring in. There are friends willing to help and we are lucky each such donor is able to reach some patient or the other and is even able to monitor their condition. There is one thing we are not able to help with — finding hospital beds for patients. We have kept that out of our purview,” Dutta said. Even Durbar, an NGO working among sex workers of Sonagachhi, has been added to the list and is receiving help for patients living in the red light area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/social-initiative-by-city-intellectuals-joins-cov-fight/articleshow/82780101.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Business||Lawyer who defended Tatas against Mistry quits||Mumbai: Four years after he was appointed the general counsel of Tata Sons, Shuva Mandal (44) is stepping down to pursue private practice. Mandal’s exit follows his recent win for Tata Sons against the company’s former chairman Cyrus Mistry in a corporate governance case in the Supreme Court. Mandal was brought in by Tata Sons from law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas specifically to develop a legal strategy against Mistry, who was removed from the top post after a fallout with patriarch Ratan Tata. A product of National Law School-Bengaluru, Mandal replaced 17-year Tata Sons veteran Bharat Vasani in 2017, becoming one of the youngest general counsel in corporate India. “He feels he will have more opportunity for career progression and better remuneration in private practice,” said a person with whom Mandal shared his plans. Mandal didn’t respond to an email from TOI, while Tata Sons declined to comment on the report. Mandal also represents Tata Sons’s interests on the boards of direct-to-home company Tata Sky, and AirAsia (India), which runs the budget carrier. Both the companies are in the midst of a change — Tata Sky is exploring exit options for partner Walt Disney, and AirAsia (India) is evaluating a financial bid for Air India. Under chairman N Chandrasekaran, Mandal will be the third exit from the Tata Sons management team after Shane Fitzsimons (who used to be the group synergy officer) and S Jaishankar (former corporate affairs head). After Fitzsimons and Jaishankar quit, their portfolios were assigned to Aarthi Subramanian (group chief digital officer) and Banmali Agrawala (head of infrastructure, defence and aerospace). But for the post of general counsel, Tata Sons will have to put on its hiring hat and look for a candidate to replace Mandal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lawyer-who-defended-tatas-against-mistry-quits/articleshow/82783102.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Ahmedabad||One in every two Covid casesnow outside 8 major Guj cities||Ahmedabad: Call it the impact of Cyclone Tauktae, or extension of overall fall of Covid-19 cases in Gujarat – but in 24 hours ending 5 pm on Wednesday, Gujarat recorded 5,246 new cases, the lowest in 39 days. It was not all – the share of eight major cities of Gujarat was 49%, the lowest in 209 days. It effectively means that one in every two positive cases recorded in Gujarat on Wednesday was from outside the major cities, which public health experts roughly term as rural Gujarat. On October 22 last year, the eight cities had recorded 46% of daily cases when the daily cases were 1,112. The share of eight cities – Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, and Gandhinagar – in fact is on constant decline in May. On May 1, the share of the cities was 65%, which got reduced to 52% on May 10, and further to 49% on May 19. In absolute terms, the total number of new positive cases in eight cities (2,588) was the lowest in 42 days. “It’s not the time to rejoice just yet – while the overall cases are on a downward slope, the impact of cyclone may have led to comparatively less people stepping out in extreme weather to get tested. Compared to 1.39 lakh daily tests on May 13, the number was 1.14 lakh on May 18. The test positivity rate however has also fallen – from 7.7% on May 13 to 5.6% on May 18. We take May 13 as it was the last day of 10,000-plus daily cases for Gujarat,” said a public health expert. But the statistics also follow the pattern observed across the country during the current wave where the rural areas now command a significant share of the daily cases. For example, compared to Vadodara city's 436 daily positive cases on Wednesday, the district recorded 205 - fourth highest in Gujarat. Out of top 10 municipal corporations and districts with highest cases, five each were municipal corporations and districts. Experts said that given the issues of infrastructure and availability of healthcare professionals, the non-urban areas pose a challenge for the state administration in containing the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/one-in-every-two-covid-casesnow-outside-8-major-guj-cities/articleshow/82780728.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Mumbai||31% of elderly fully vaccinated in Mumbai, 73% got at least 1 shot||MUMBAI: Around 31% senior citizens in the city have been fully vaccinated with two doses and 73% have got at least one shot of Covid vaccine since the drive for this most vulnerable age group started on March 1. Civic authorities said they will now study data of hospitalisations and deaths to understand if vaccination made a difference on mortality or severity of infection. In the 45-59 age group, 8% are fully vaccinated and a little over 45% have got one dose. Vaccination for this group, with an estimated population of 19.2 lakh, started in tranches with those having comorbidities getting doses from March 1. It was opened to all on April 1. Overall, 8% of the city’s adult population has taken both shots while 31% have taken one dose. Mumbai has an estimated population of 11.1 lakh people over 60 years, of whom 8.1 lakh had taken the first shot as on Tuesday and 3.3 lakh had taken both. Unlike frontline and healthcare workers who showed a great deal of hesitancy, the senior citizen drive saw a bumper response since Day 1. Within three days, daily vaccinations for the elderly had hit 10,000. It rose to as many as 30,000, with many queuing up outside centres hours before they would open. A senior civic official said the 45-59 group was equally enthusiastic but the stockouts broke the momentum of the drive. Now, with the gap between two doses of Covishield extended to 12-16 weeks, there will be a further delay in complete vaccination. The BMC data, however, shows a worrying trend of many healthcare workers having skipped the second dose. Although their drive was started on January 1, only 91% of the estimated 2 lakh have taken the first dose and 63% the second dose. Similarly, while 2.3 lakh frontline workers have taken the first dose, less than 55% have taken the second dose. “We think there is hesitancy in taking the second dose,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said deaths have decreased significantly among senior citizens in the second wave across the state, but only a detailed scientific study could make a correlation with vaccination. On Wednesday, the city saw a better response to the walk-in drive as nearly 30,000 people turned up for vaccination compared to 16,754 on Tuesday. Gomare said walk-ins for 45-plus coming for Covaxin second dose will be allowed on Thursday as well, while vaccination on Friday and Saturday would be through online registrations only. Vaccination will be held on Friday from 10am-3pm at selected centres, the BMC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-31-of-elderly-fully-vaccinated-in-city-73-got-at-least-1-shot/articleshow/82782452.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Patna||Patna: Hospitals report many cases of ‘happy hypoxia’||PATNA: The happy hypoxia cases have been on the rise. City hospitals have reported several such cases in which the patients did not feel any problem though their oxygen level dipped below 70, affecting vital organs like lungs, kidney, liver, heart and even brain. If not treated on time, the disease could lead to death. In one such case, a 50-year-old doctor of Patna suddenly felt some uneasiness. When checked, his oxygen saturation level indicated below 90. He called his colleague at the AIIMS-Patna and got himself admitted. “We shifted him to ICU but he died on the fourth day due to happy hypoxia,” said AIIMS-P nodal officer for Covid, Dr Sanjeev Kumar. “In some cases, the Covid patients having no symptoms other than behaving differently or losing their temper without reason needed hospitalisation because of low oxygen saturation level,” said Dr Sanjeev. Presently, 10 such patients are undergoing treatment admitted in AIIMS, while one died a couple of days ago. IGIMS reported three cases of happy hypoxia in a week. Its medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said, “A few days ago, a person was rushed after noticing drastic fall in his oxygen level. He was admitted to the ICU but died within minutes.” Since most of the post-covid patients felt confidant of their health status after being tested negative, sudden fall in oxygen saturation level put necessitated their immediate hospitalisation, Mandal added. Though there is no record of the happy hypoxia cases at NMCH, a dedicated Covid hospital, its nodal officer Dr Ajay Kumar said the number could be in hundreds. “More than 700 out of about 1900 Covid patients admitted there in the second wave so far could have suffered from happy hypoxia as their oxygen level had dropped significantly,” he said. “There were several cases when Covid positive patients undergoing treatment at home without symptoms of fever and cough suddenly began behaving differently or aggressively. It was due to the happy hypoxia,” he added. In one such case admitted to the NMCH, a 40-year-old Covid patient without any symptoms incidentally had only 60% oxygen saturation level. However, PMCH reported no case of happy hypoxia. But its superintendent Dr I S Thakur did not rule out its prevalence among those in home isolation. “It is a serious threat as the oxygen level of a person dips to alarming level,” he said. Paras HMRI hospital, however, has 47 cases of happy hypoxia, confirmed its regional director Dr Talat Halim. All these patients were admitted after drop in their oxygen saturation level. “Since most of the patients remain in a happy state of mind till the diagnosis of short supply of oxygen to their body parts, it is named as happy hypoxia,” Talim explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hospitals-report-many-cases-of-happy-hypoxia/articleshow/82777278.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||Patna: Senior citizens feel the pinch most amid pandemic||PATNA: The second wave of the Covid pandemic has adversely affected one and all, but senior citizens are feeling the pinch most. Mostly living in isolation, cut off from their sons and daughters, life has become difficult for them. Patna University (PU) English department’s former head Shiv Jatan Thakur, who has just recovered from the Covid infection, said the pandemic has compounded the miseries of senior citizens as most of them suffer from some degree of old-age ailments like weak eyesight, diabetes, hypertension or rheumatic pain. Hence, they are mostly dependent on their domestic help for household chores and cooking their meals. But, the present lockdown has cut them off even from the services of their domestic help and drivers, he said. Thakur said many senior citizens are unable to visit their doctors for routine medical check-up and medication. “During the normal circumstances, I used to take morning or evening walks daily. But, due to an alarming spike in the Covid infections, I am unable to move out of my house, increasing the risk of the advancement of my old-age disease,” he said. Retired civil surgeon Dr Kumkum Prasad, who lives independently in a flat at S K Puri, said, “My second dose of Covid vaccine was due in the last week of April, but I could not be vaccinated till date. One day, I hired a taxi and went to the Gardiner Road Hospital with full precautions, but when my turn for vaccination did not come even after more than two hours, I returned as there was a huge rush there and I did not take the risk of getting infected.” Dr Prasad further pointed out that by inviting the people above 18 years of age for vaccination without arranging sufficient doses of vaccine, the authorities have only added to the rush already prevailing at the vaccine centres. Several nurses and doctors involved in the vaccination drive have themselves been infected, she added. Former head of PU Hindi department, Dinesh Prasad Singh, who resides near Bazar Samiti with his wife, said as there is no domestic help or caretaker at his house, he has to move to some nearby shops for purchasing the medicines prescribed by doctors for their old-age ailments. Besides, at times he also has to visit kirana shops to buy grocery items. He has not been vaccinated as yet as he is afraid of getting infected with the virus at the centre due to huge rush. Singh suggested that a van meant for carrying senior citizens for their essentials should be pressed into service in each locality on the pattern of one (Covi Van) launched in New Delhi recently. Besides, a programme of door-to-door vaccination should also be launched in every city so that maximum number of people get vaccinated in the shortest possible time, he added. Retired botany teacher A K Sharan, 72, said he has taken both the doses of vaccine, but is still susceptible to the virus. “The way the coronavirus is spreading, and in view of my age, I have kind of locked myself in my flat,” he said and added, “Life has become monotonous and boring.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/senior-citizens-feel-the-pinch-most-amid-pandemic/articleshow/82777347.cms||B K Mishra

The SDM said three sweepers have been terminated for dereliction of duty. The DLSA secretary cum judge Aditya Pandey sought the report after a video went viral showing two persons in PPE kits carrying the body of a Covid patient on a pushcart to Islampur cremation ground. This was the second such incident reported in the district in two days. Earlier on Sunday, a video had shown the body of a Covid suspect being carried to Sohsarai cremation ground on a garbage cart of Biharsharif Municipal Corporation. An FIR was lodged against the councillor of ward number 8 and four sweepers under the Epidemic Diseases Act. The ward jamadar and supervisor were suspended while the four sweepers were terminated late Monday evening. It was found that the sweepers had connived with ward councillor Sushil Kumar Mithu, who had extorted Rs16,000 from a widow to cremate his son who had succumbed to the virus on May 13. While investigating the Islampur incident, along with Hilsa ASDM Shashank Raj, executive officer of nagar panchayat Naveen Kumar and Islampur circle officer Ajay Kumar, the SDM said Covid positive Shankar Chaudhry of Malliksarai had died in home isolation five days ago. He said when nobody from the neighborhood came forward to help the kin of the deceased, they used the nearby parked nagar panchayat’s garbage cart for carrying the body to the cremation ground. While taking cognizance of the Biharsharif incident, urban development and housing department’s principal secretary Anand Kishore directed the district officials to ensure stringent action against the accused and create awareness through media that bodies of the suspected or Covid patients are cremated by the municipal corporation free of cost. The residents have urged Nalanda DM Yogendra Kumar Singh to lodge an FIR against ward jamadar and supervisor for their lapses. The DM had ordered an inquiry soon after the earlier video went viral on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/body-carried-on-pushcart-for-cremation-in-bsharif/articleshow/82777707.cms||Farrukh Nadim

Around a month back the kid suffered a freak accident while playing at his home in Waghodiya village as he had fell down and the toy drum stick penetrated his neck. But barring a small wound the kid, Dhruv Parmar, showed no other sign of injury or discomfort. Within few minutes Dhruv was up and playing and his parents had no clue about the stick being lodged inside his neck. He was taken to local doctor who dressed up the small wound which got healed in around 10 days. But Dhruv’s parents later noticed a swelling, which kept on increasing, in right as well as left side of the neck. The couple from Waghodiya, located around 25 kms from Vadodara, went from one hospital to another in search of a doctor who would diagnose the problem but Covid-19 was a priority everywhere. Later, a CT scan and subsequent CT angiography revealed a 12 cm long plastic tube that had gone between the air pipe and food pipe in the neck. It had ruptured a major blood vessel in neck leading to a balloon like swelling which is known as aneurysm.“Taking it out was not a simple surgery as it would result in rupture of the aneurysm causing life-threatening bleeding,” said vascular surgeon Dr Sumit Kapadia, who along with another vascular surgeon Dr Hiten Patel and anaesthetist Dr Harshal Dave performed the surgery. “We adopted a hybrid approach to avoid opening the chest. A balloon was placed to temporarily stop the blood flow while the aneurysm was dissected in the neck and the stick was taken out. The artery was later repaired and the balloon was removed,” said Kapadia. According to doctors, a review of published medical literature shows that such penetrating neck injuries are rare in children. They can have devastating complications due to injuries to airway, nerves or blood vessels. “There is no specific incidence of such toys causing penetrating neck injuries in children. But such cases would be less than 1 % of all injuries in children,” said Kapadia. “A penetrating object should never be removed directly. It should always be done in operation theatre by specialised surgeons,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/toy-stick-stuck-in-6-yr-olds-neck-removed-after-surgery/articleshow/82776848.cms||Prashant Rupera

"Power generation from two units of stage-2 (1320MW) surpassed the memorandum of understanding (MoU) target with overall generation of around 7804 million units in fiscal 20-21. The third unit of 660MW (Unit-1 of stage-1) has achieved full load in April and Bihar will receive an additional power from this 660MW very soon,” Abhishek Shukla of NTPC Limited, Barh, said in a statement. The officials claimed that though many employees, their family members and associates have been affected due to Covid- 19, the plant personnel showed strong resolve and continued with their jobs. NTPC (Barh unit) executive director Prem Parkash said: “The second wave of Covid-19 pandemic has impacted our internal setup significantly. However, the frontline engineers produced uninterrupted power, meeting the demand in this difficult time of pandemic." Despite internal challenges, the NTPC Barh management implemented several social welfare initiatives. “The nearby villages were sanitised with the distribution of 12MT bleaching powder to each project panchayat. Around 5,000 face masks have also been distributed among contract workers and staff engaged in the project,” Shukla said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ntpc-barh-achieves-full-load-power-generation/articleshow/82777838.cms||Rajiv Kumar

This is the second bank loot in Samastipur within the last 20 days. Earlier on April 29, criminals had looted Rs 1.8 lakh from the Canara Bank branch at Bikram Bandepur under Mufassil police station area. Tajpur police station SHO Shambhu Nath Singh said at least six to seven criminals had barged inside the branch posing as customers around 10.22 am. “The criminals, who reached the spot on four different bikes, took the bank staff and customers hostage at gunpoint and looted the money lying on the cash counter. Their faces were covered with masks, clothes and helmets. However, they did not open fire during the loot. After looting, all of them fled immediately from the spot.” The SHO also said that more than Rs 15 lakh was lying inside the iron chest of the branch when the criminals had barged inside. “However, from CCTV footage of the branch, it seems that they didn’t even attempt to go for the cash lying in the chest. They only collected whatever they could from the cash counter,” he said. Meanwhile, Samastipur SP Manavjit Singh Dhillon said the branch manager, in course of investigation, has told police that there was no armed guard deployed at the branch. “It seems the criminals had randomly selected the bank. Raids are on at suspected locations to nab the miscreants after sealing the district border,” the SP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rs-7-75-lakh-looted-from-sbi-branch-in-samastipur/articleshow/82777528.cms||---

Gopalganj SP Anand Kumar said the villagers told the police that she committed suicide while her family members she was ill and died. Police were investigating the reason behind her death.

Social media is flooded with shared images of the prescribed drug with people desperately seeking help in procuring the medicine from anywhere possible. Atul Babariya, former employee of a water park and currently unemployed claimed he visited various private and public hospitals in the city in search of the injection. “Along with financial crisis, I and my family have to struggle to source the injections for my elder brother. I used to get injections from New Civil Hospital (NCH) but due to strike by nurses that has been disturbed now,” he said. NCH has started three wards to admit MM patients considering the rising number of black fungus cases. NCH also started surgeries to treat patients, but shortage of injections is still a major obstacle. Nilesh Patel got his father admitted in Kiran Hospital for treatment of MM. The hospital had initially asked the family to arrange for the injection from outside. “The hospital is providing the injection now. But I went to NCH to get the injection after Kiran Hospital officials asked me to arrange for it. We are still worried,” said Patel, a textile businessman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/patients-kin-hit-by-scarcity-of-mm-drug/articleshow/82777150.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Vax centres prepare fresh jab schedule to prioritize recipients||Kolkata: On a day when 2.1 lakh Covishield doses arrived in the state, the health department asked the government Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) to identify two categories of recipients who are yet to get their first jab. The department has also asked the centres and Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) to innovate their vaccine programme in the context of the revised gap between two Covishield doses. In a couple of days, CVCs are expected to come out with a schedule for the first dose, second dose, age and priori-ty categories. KMC has decided to follow a new vaccination schedule from the coming week. The second dose of Covishield will be administered at KMC-run centres across the city only on Mondays. For frontline workers, Covishield will be administered on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Covaxin doses will be administered at 46 KMC-run urban primary health centres located across 16 boroughs. These exclusive KMC Covaxin vaccination centres will remain open on all weekdays. “Each CVC within the district or KMC will henceforth follow a systematic immunisation drive. Local administration would like to work on innovative ways of scheduling the drive, dividing days of the week between different age groups as well as separately scheduling/prioritising first/second dose,” said the order on Wednesday. On Wednesday morning, an Air India flight delivered the Covishield vials that the state government has purchased directly from the manufacturers. Another 2 lakh doses will be arriving in Kolkata from the Centre on Thursday. Most CVCs in government hospitals said they needed more clarity on the first dose — whether they should also start taking in people from the general population. Currently, the first dose is being given only to the priority group of healthcare and frontline workers from these hospitals. “Some more groups, apart from healthcare workers and frontliners, have been included in the category that should be given the first dose. Hopefully, we should get more clarity in a day or two on whether we can include general population as well for the first dose,” said a vaccination coordinator of a government CVC. KMC will follow the Union health ministry guideline on the Covishield second dose, said Atin Ghosh, the member of the KMC board of administrators (BoA). According to a KMC health department official, civic medical officers in charge of the CVCs are finding it difficult to carry on with the vaccination schedule under the Covid restrictions. “Vaccinators and paramedics are finding it difficult to reach the centres,” said a KMC official. The revised gape between two Covishield doses and the travel restrictions, coupled with vaccine shortage, have led to a massive dip in footfall in vaccination camps. Since the past four days, the number of doses administered per day has come down to about 60,000. “Most people coming to take the jab are travelling in their own cars. In the absence of public transport, it is difficult for people to reach the CVCs unless they live within a walking distance,” said a source at SSKM Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-centres-prepare-fresh-jab-schedule-to-prioritize-recipients/articleshow/82779590.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

VSP, which had been supplying oxygen to Andhra Pradesh since April 13, was supplying between 150 to 170 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen to the state for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in the state. The steel plant has five units that are producing 100 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) every day but it has been supplying more than 150 tonnes per day. On Monday also, VSP had supplied 150 tonnes of LMO. The VSP had a storage capacity of 7,000 tonnes before it had started supplying oxygen to the state and to Maharashtra. However, the storage levels have come down to around 1,550 tonnes and the safety stock or dead storage in the tank should be maintained as a safety measure and for emergency purposes. “We can’t go beyond the dead storage levels. But we will definitely supply more than 100 tonnes everyday. It may go up to 120 tonnes also as our production of oxygen is 100 tonnes per day,” one of the VSP senior officials said on condition of anonymity. According to steel plant sources, VSP has a commitment to supplying oxygen to AP and it will fulfil the needs of the states. “We are giving 100 tonnes daily generated oxygen and another 70 tonnes from storage. We have already informed officials that we will give 100 tonnes a day in the future,” said the senior officer. The VSP has dispatched 5,460 tonnes of LMO to AP since April 13 and a cumulative 14,310 metric tonnes of LMO since the onset of pandemic. Sources said that 160 MT LMO was dispatched to various places in AP in the last 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vsp-may-be-forced-to-reduce-supply-of-oxygen-to-state/articleshow/82778958.cms||Siva G

Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said the state has 11 teaching hospitals. “But CT and MRI machines are available only in seven teaching hospitals. Set up under the PPP model, these machines do not have any scope for upgradation of technology, software, quality of diagnosis or quality of picture. But henceforth, the best quality diagnostic services will be made available in these hospitals. Moreover, these services will be brought under the Aarogyasri scheme. The Aarogyasri trust will spend money for the operation and maintenance of these machines; so that the equipment will be upgraded and be useful to everyone,” he said. The chief minister said new CT and MRI machines are being set up in Srikakulam, Ongole, Nellore, while Kadapa, which has an MRI machine will get just a CT machine.

While a king cobra hanging on to the temple tower fell to the ground at the Srinivasa Mangapuram temple recently, two leopards have been spotted everyday at the TTD-run Kapila Teertham temple abutting the Seshachalam forest for the past three days. Following the movement of leopards, TTD’s vigilance and security wing swung into action to seal off the entry and exit points by strengthening the fencing around the main temple complex. Speaking to TOI, TTD’s chief vigilance and security officer Gopinath Jatti said there was no reason for panic as the security fencing around the temple has now been fortified. “After the movement of two leopards were spotted in our CCTV cameras, we plugged the points from where these leopards were entering the temple. Security has also been strengthened at the temple as a precautionary measure,” said Gopinath Jatti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/leopards-spotted-near-ttd-temples/articleshow/82779426.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Those manning the centres said they did not receive fresh supply of the vaccines. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh told this newspaper that they received 14,100 doses of Covishield on Wednesday afternoon for those above 18 years of age. The vaccines will be sent to the selected sites. “We had zero vaccines before the new stock arrived and, because of that, people of this age group could not be inoculated at any regular or special centres for them. The vaccine drive for this age group will be conducted on Thursday at 62 sites, including 10 special centres,” he said. “If we get another lot of the vaccines on Thursday, then only we will be able to vaccinate people of 18+ age group on May 21. The district has the capacity to inoculate up to 20,000 persons per day. However, due to the shortage of vaccines, the drive has been affected,” he added. Reacting to the people’s complaint about non-availability of slots on CoWIN portal, the DM said the disproportionate demand and supply was the main reason that the slots book very fast. “On an average, we have vaccines for not more than 14,000 and over 1 lakh people are trying to book the slots. For 18-plus people, we have started vaccination at block level. But for 45+ people, it is available even at additional PHC level,” Singh said. Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said out of the 62 centres for people in the age group of 18 to 44, only 4-5 have some stock of vaccines left and that might probably be used on Wednesday. “For the vaccination of 45+, we have 80,000 vials at the district headquarters, sufficient to use for the next 15-16 days. But we need vaccines for 18+ people,” he said. The drive was also affected in other districts as well owing to non-availability of vaccines. Unable to book slots on CoWIN portal even after spending hours a day, several residents vent their ire on social media. Amita Kashyap, a resident of Kadamkuan, said the state government should have started the vaccination drive only after getting enough doses to vaccinate all. “I don’t understand how people get the slot. I have never seen any slot available at all. None in my family or extended family has also been able to book a slot,” she said. Vivek Singh of Boring Canal Road area said the portal was very slow due to heavy rush for slots which get booked within minutes. “The moment I booked a slot, it showed an error. When I refreshed the page, the slot was gone,” he said. “There are limited slots and they are getting filled rapidly. I spent half my day looking for the slots,” said Ashutosh Kumar, a resident of Rajendra Nagar. 2 lakh doses reach Patna: A consignment of 2 lakh doses of the vaccines against Covid-19 reached Patna airport on Wednesday. The Airports Authority of India (AAI), Patna, tweeted: “A consignment of 17 boxes containing 2,00,000 doses of COVID vaccine arrived at Patna Airport from Pune by Indigo flight 6E-6122 today.

He has also told them to use anganwadi and primary schools’ teaching staff to lay a strong education foundation for children. The chief minister also released a book on ‘spoken English’ and CDs designed by the department of women development and child welfare for anganwadi teachers. During the review meeting held at his Tadepalli camp office on Wednesday, the officials briefed the chief minister that there were some schools with fewer than 10 students and some with less than 30 students. Officials also said that there were some schools where teachers are more in number than students. The officials laid out some proposals as per the national guidelines for effective utilisation of schools and services of teachers. The officials said changes would be made in schools based on the student-teacher ratio and added that students of anganwadi centres will join primary schools that have fewer students. The officials added that anganwadi teachers, along with the existing teachers of primary school, would ensure quality education for all students. The officials laid out proposals to bring classes 3 to 5 under high schools and change upper primary schools into high schools wherever possible. The chief minister directed officials to explain goals to teachers with care. Stating that teachers play an important role in the revolutionary changes being effected in education, the chief minister said schools should adhere to national standards in maintenance of infrastructure and utilisation of teachers’ services. The student-teacher ratio should be maintained and schools should be within a two-kilometre radius for students. The chief minister said all schools and anganwadi centres are being revamped and a situation in which a school has to be closed down should not arise. He also directed officials to construct additional classrooms under Naadu-Nedu wherever required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/anganwadis-and-primary-schools-to-now-be-merged/articleshow/82779494.cms||Gopi Dara

He said currently a total of 526 community kitchens are running in all 38 districts of the state as on May 18 with Samastipur having a maximum of 34 kitchens, Patna 19 and Sheohar just one. DMD sources said some of the community kitchens began providing both lunch and dinner to the poor and needy since May 5, the day the Bihar government imposed the lockdown in the state. Since then, the number of community kitchens is steadily increasing. Altogether 526 community kitchens are running across the state to date. “Altogether 1,07,026 people were provided meals from 526 community kitchens on May 18,” Amrit said while providing the district-wise data of the beneficiaries. He added that the attendants of Covid-19 patients were also being provided with both the meals from these community kitchens. Initially, these community kitchens were opened with the idea to provide meals to the poor and needy who were left without work or any earnings due to the lockdown. But soon it was also decided to provide meals to the attendants of Covid-19 patients admitted to various government facilities. “At several places, meals were being delivered even to the family members of Covid-19 patients who are in isolation at home,” said an official of the Patna district administration. After taking stock of arrangements and facilities at different community kitchens of 23 districts on Monday and Tuesday, CM Nitish Kumar asked DMD officials to increase the number of community kitchens and also set up such kitchens at the block headquarters. “Given the CM’s order, more kitchens are being opened by the different district administrations. The number of such kitchens will shoot up in a few days,” said a DMD official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/over-8l-people-given-free-meals-from-community-kitchens-in-2-weeks-dmd/articleshow/82777364.cms||Madan Kumar

Announcing its guidelines on Wednesday, the RBI said that even gift cards can be made interoperable by issuers through the UPI platform. The new norms are a boost for issuers of prepaid digital wallets as they do not need to build a large merchant network that accepts their e-wallets. Any merchant that accepts UPI will be able to accept payments from any new prepaid issuer. The RBI has also made merchant acquirers ensure that any merchant who accepts payments from one prepaid wallet or prepaid card will accept payment from all issuers. Issuers have been given up to March 2022 to enable interoperability. As announced in its monetary policy in April, the RBI also hiked the maximum amount outstanding in respect of full-KYC issuers to Rs 2 lakh. The move makes prepaid instruments, also known as PPIs, almost on a par with payment bank accounts. This is because PPI customers will be allowed to withdraw money from the ATM. The only PPIs that are excluded from the interoperability requirements are mobility cards like those used in metros or FASTag, which are largely closed-loop instruments, meaning they can be used only for specified transactions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-makes-prepaid-cards-digital-wallets-interoperable/articleshow/82782465.cms||---
---||Business||Look at Wadhawan’s bid for DHFL: NCLT||MUMBAI: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has asked the committee of creditors to consider the proposal made by jailed promoter Kapil Wadhawan for DHFL, against which insolvency proceedings were initiated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Lenders are perplexed with the order as they have agreed to sell the company to Piramal Group after an elaborate process. Wadhawan had in October 2020 offered his personal and family properties, which he claimed were worth Rs 43,000 crore. Wadhawan had written to the RBI-appointed administrator R Subramaniakumar where he stated that his offer would ensure maximum value for the assets that have been put on the block to repay loans. “This is unusual. The promoter had written a letter from prison. He is under investigation for fraud and a host of illegalities. We had not voted on it as it was only a letter and we did not feel he was eligible,” said a banker. Bankers have two options — either to go in for an appeal or to have a quick vote and be done with the matter. Lenders are yet to meet on this. Section 29A of the bankruptcy code explicitly excludes insolvents and wilful defaulters from making a bid as a resolution applicant. While bankers can restructure loans of defaulters if over 90% of them vote for it, this can only be done outside the bankruptcy proceedings. Withdrawing DHFL from the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC) process can be done only by the party that initiated the proceedings. In this case, the party was the RBI and not a creditor. For the RBI, the DHFL insolvency proceedings is a test case as this is the first financial services company against which the insolvency law is being used. Lenders point out that in the Essar Steel case, the Supreme Court ruling is clear that the decision of the committee of creditors is final. Also, Piramal’s acquisition of DHFL has been approved by both the RBI and the committee of creditors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/look-at-wadhawans-bid-for-dhfl-nclt/articleshow/82782378.cms||---

He said the farmer would be issued a receipt during the purchase and the amount would be remitted into their bank accounts shortly. The minister said that the government has appointed one special officer each for 20 procurement centres to oversee procurement operations in view of Covid-19 regulations. The minister also said the price will be fixed depending on moisture and other quality parameters. “We have already purchased 13.40 lakh metric tonnes paddy worth Rs 2,510 crore from 1.15 lakh farmers in the state,” said Nani, adding that the government would complete the procurement of about 25 lakh metric tonnes of paddy by the end of May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/govt-to-procure-entire-paddy-crop-in-bid-to-bail-out-farmers/articleshow/82794324.cms||Samdani MN
---||Kolkata||Health department, cop lens on remdesivir cartel in Kolkata hospitals||KOLKATA: A section of pharmacy staffers, hospital administrations and a few individual medicine stockists have formed a cartel in a few hospitals in and around Kolkata, forcing kin of Covid patients to buy medicines like remdesivir and Favipiravir even when hospitals have enough stock, police and health department officials have alleged. “There is an artificial shortage that has been created by a cartel comprising hospital staff and a section of suppliers. People are being forced to buy medicines from a section of suppliers at two- to three-times the MRP. The hospital staffers involved make a commission from the transaction. We have located one such hospital in Sonarpur, another in Howrah and a third with multiple branches in Kolkata,” an officer said. The state government had in an order dated April 24 made it clear that hospitals have to source remdesivir and not ask patient parties to do so. The Drug Controller General of India had also asked manufacturers to supply remdesivir directly to hospitals. “It is unfortunate that hospitals are indulging in such practices. If a complaint comes directly from the kin, it helps us act on it,” said a health department official, advising people to alert Swasthya Bhavan or the West Bengal Health Regulatory Commission about such cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/health-dept-cop-lens-on-remdesivir-cartel-in-hosps/articleshow/82780183.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Visakhapatnam||Centre raises daily medical O2 quota for AP to 625MT||Visakhapatnam: The Union government has increased the daily medical oxygen quota for Andhra Pradesh to 625 metric tonnes from the existing 590 MT, health and family welfare department principal secretary Anil Kumar Singhal said on Wednesday. Singhal further said that the Union government has also allocated 1,650 vials of Amphotericin B for treatment of black fungus (mucormycosis) cases in the state. “The health department has already placed an order for these vials. Meanwhile, the AP health department on its own is procuring 15,000 vials of Amphotericin B from three different drug manufacturers,” he told reporters. “Each patient may need 60 vials for treatment and it is estimated to cost about Rs 2.5 to 3 lakh per patient. The state government has already included treatment for black fungus under Aarogyasri scheme. The supply of these vials would begin in the next few days,” he added. The state technical committee on Covid-19 has been asked to prepare a rough estimate for the number of vials needed for treatment of black fungus cases in the next one to two months and other measures, Singhal informed. “A short tender would be floated after the technical committee comes to a consensus on the number of vials required. The committee would discuss the condition with the hospital superintendents and other officials in the districts,” he said. Singhal further said that village-level Covid management committees have been constituted under the chairmanship of the village sarpanch for day-to-day monitoring of the Covid-19 situation in villages. “The committee will closely monitor all positive cases under home isolation and suspected cases. They would also conduct sanitation drives in their respective villages and ensure that citizens follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour while coming out of their homes,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/centre-raises-daily-medical-o2-quota-for-ap-to-625mt/articleshow/82778751.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bereaved healthcare providers set aside personal losses, report to work||Kolkata: They have either lost a family member to Covid or even had to stay in isolation for testing positive to the virus. But with a long battle ahead, they have not even had the time to mourn the passing away of their loved ones as their profession demands they return to the frontline to tend to the infected. With each passing day, doctors, nurses and other support staff are setting exemplary examples of selflessness to pull the state out of the crisis. When Santoshpur resident Nirmal Krishna Chaudhuri (88) died on May 4, his microbiologist son Bhaskar Narayan was on mandatory home quarantine as he, his wife and daughter had tested positive. The head of the microbiology and molecular biology at Peerless Hospital has been spearheading the lab where Covid samples are being tested. He could not even have a last look at his father, forget about performing the last rites. Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra completed the formalities of handing the body to civic bodies for cremation. “I went back to lab on the first day after completing my quarantine as coordinating from home was really difficult. I could not sit back at home mourning when so many patients need Covid confirmation report on time so that medical care is not delayed,” said Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri. Nursing assistant Sraboni Mandal had lost her mother to Covid recently and she herself testing positive in April-end. Mandal was back in the Covid ward at CMRI right after completing the mandatory home isolation. “It is still tough to accept that I have lost my mother. But I have to think about hundreds of patients who need me to feed them food, give medicine,” said Mandal. OT technician Subhasish Khanra was in the Covid ICU at Apollo on April 28 when he got the news that his 35 year-old brother had lost the battle against Covid pneumonia in another private hospital. Khanra rushed home after finishing his duty, spent the next day with family only to swing back to work the next day. “This time, we are seeing many younger patients in the ICU where we have assist in procedures like intubation, monitor oxygen saturation and perform CPR on patients at times. Even if I help in saving a life, it consoles me thinking that somebody’s brother/sister will go back to their families,” said Khanra. Pulmonologist Raja Dhar lost his father to Covid and later his mother, wife and he also tested positive to the infection, all needing hospital care. Dhar had been a part of the core Covid team and Fortis earlier and now with CMRI. “If it was not for Covid, I probably could have spent more days at home with family after my father’s death. But I could not afford that as the pandemic is not stopping any time soon,” said Dhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bereaved-healthcare-providers-set-aside-personal-losses-report-to-work/articleshow/82780291.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Varanasi||Highway projects to miss evenrevised deadline due to Covid||Varanasi: The second wave of Covid-19 has given another jolt to the highway projects that had already missed the initial deadline in 2020 due to the first wave of the pandemic. The worst-hit projects are Varanasi-Sultanpur (part of Varanasi-Lucknow national highway-56) and Varanasi-Azamgarh Ghaghra bridge (NH-233), as both are going to miss even the revised deadline of June as fatalities in the staff of company executing both the projects created panic among all other members, including labourers, and after returning home they have not returned so far. Even if they return now, meeting deadline will be impossible due to monsoon, which becomes active in the region by June 15. “The work on NH-56 and NH-233 was stopped in April as three and two staffs, respectively, of the company executing these projects died after surge in Covid-19 as all other staff panicked and returned to their homes, mostly in south India,” said NHAIs project director Varanasi SB Singh, when TOI took stock of the progress in projects of Rs 3814.14 crores, including 137.89 km NH-56 of Rs 1792 crores, 118.89 km NH-233 of Rs 1526 crores, 72.15 km NH-29 of Rs 868.50 crores and Ring-Road phase-IIs package-I and II on Wednesday. Mentioning that first wave of Covid-19 had already compelled the agency to revise the deadlines of completion of NH-56, NH-233 and NH-29 that were were targeted to be completed between March and June 2020, to June 30 this year, Singh said, “The four-lane conversion work on NH-29 will be completed by June end as work is in progress in this project. But, work on NH-56 and NH-233 is now expected to be completed in October or November only as even if the staff of construction company return, they will have to stop the work again as monsoon becomes active between June and September in this region.” According to NHAI, 85% work of both these projects is complete. On NH-56 mainly the work on Jaunpur by-pass road and Azamgarh by-pass road on NH-233 is incomplete, said Singh adding, delay in supplying thermal power project ashes by contractors has also delayed the work of approach road at underpasses of these projects. When the work on the projects of four-lane conversion of NH-56, NH-29 and NH-233 was stopped in March 2020, it could be started after the end of monsoon in October 2020. Work of four-lane conversion of NH-56 was being done in two parts — Lucknow-Sultanpur and Sultanpur-Varanasi. The work between Lucknow and Sultanpur had been completed in 2019 but construction work between Varanasi and Sultanpur was delayed due to delay in completing the process of land acquisition. Similar reasons had delayed the work on NH-29 and NH-233.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/highway-projects-to-miss-evenrevised-deadline-due-to-covid/articleshow/82780919.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Sebi imposed a fine of over Rs 5.2 crore on Cairn India and Rs 15 lakh each on former directors P Elango, Aman Mehta and Neeraj Sharma. According to Sebi’s order in this matter, between January and July 2014, Cairn India had launched a buyback programme to mop up over 17 crore shares at a maximum price of Rs 335 each through the open market route. Under Sebi rules, a buyback can be successful if at least 50% of the target quantity of shares are bought back by the company. In this case, the company failed to reach the 50% level and hence the offer was declared unsuccessful.Sebi, however, launched an investigation into the whole buyback process and found that on several days the company refrained from bidding on NSE and BSE’s buyback platforms even though the share price of Cairn India was favourable to the offer price. “Therefore, it was alleged that the public announcement and subsequent actions of Cairn show that the announcement of buyback of shares by Cairn was a misleading announcement designed to influence the decision of the investors and induce them to trade in the shares of Cairn,” the Sebi order noted. Elango, Mehta and Sharma were “alleged to have facilitated the company in making the said misleading announcement”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-fines-cairn-ex-directors-rs-5-7-crore/articleshow/82782496.cms||---

The state health department had reported 111 deaths on Tuesday, the highest so far in the second wave of coronavirus. A total of 12,043 people recovered during the same period. Though the data shows decline in the number of new cases, the average death toll is almost the same as it was registered during the peak in Bihar. For instance, on May 6, 15126 people had tested positive, the highest in a single day. Ninety deaths were also registered across the state that day. From May 7 onwards, the number of daily new cases started falling and the department reported 7,752 cases on May 13, which was nearly half of that on May 6. But the daily deaths remained 90 on May 13. AIIMS-Patna nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Sanjeev Kumar said there has been reduction in new patients, but serious cases almost remain the same. “During the peak period, we had around 350 patients and average 11 to 12 deaths were reported daily. Now, when there are 240 to 270 patients on a given day, but the number of deaths remains the same. This is because there is no decline in the number of severe cases. This is the reason why ventilators beds and ICU are full,” he said. Dr Sanjeev further said the new strain, called the Indian strain abroad, was rapidly destroying lungs and leading to fatality. PMCH nodal officer for Covid and consultant physician, Dr Israrul Haque, also cited the same reason, adding that a few deaths were also because of complications post-Covid. “The data suggests that the peak is over. But there are cases of post-Covid complications. One needs to be observant after recovery and in case of fever, chest congestion or any symptom, one should consult a doctor,” he said. AIIMS-Patna reported six deaths, the youngest being a 35-year-old man. Here, 34 new patients were admitted and 24 got discharged. NMCH reported two deaths, including of a 55-year-old man from Buxar and another sexagenarian from Patna. Meanwhile, 25,037 beneficiaries were vaccinated on Wednesday, including 16,974, who got their first shots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/single-day-corona-deaths-cross-100-mark-on-2nd-day-in-bihar/articleshow/82776948.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||Pay Rs 10 lakh compensation to Munger victim’s father, says Patna high court||PATNA: The Patna high court on Wednesday orally directed the state government to pay Rs 10 lakh compensation to the father of 18-year-old Munger boy Anurag Poddar, who had died in alleged police firing on the procession going to immerse the idols of Goddess Durga in October last year. The court threatened to initiate suo motu contempt proceedings in case of non-payment of the compensation amount. The next hearing is on June 25. On April 7, a bench of Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad had ordered the state government to pay the compensation to Anurag’s father Amar Nath Poddar within a month. Amar had moved the high court urging CBI investigation under its monitoring into the death of his only son in alleged police firing after police-public clash during idol immersion procession at Deen Dayal Chowk in Munger on October 26 night last year. The court fumed as the compensation amount had not been paid yet. Presently, the high court is monitoring the investigation being conducted by the CID. The state government had submitted on Monday that an SLP would be filed in the Supreme Court on the compensation matter. Government pleader Nadim Seraj on Tuesday apprised the court about filing of a modification application for compensation payment after completion of the investigation as state’s counsel in the Supreme Court had succumbed to Covid-19 before giving his opinion on filing the SLP. The bench then observed that it was not very happy with the manner in which the information was furnished on Monday and then again on Tuesday on the same issue. Supreme Court counsel Alakh Alok Srivastava, who appeared for the petitioner, submitted that non-payment of the compensation is contempt of court and modification application in such criminal writ petition is not maintainable, specially when the high court had already ordered for making payment within a month. The court on Wednesday also rapped the CID for not conducting proper investigation into Anurag’s murder and pointed out a series of shortcomings. It was left fuming on perusing the CID’s progress report, which gave an impression that the murder might have taken place for resisting a robbery attempt. ADG (CID) Vinay Kumar, who was virtually present before the court, submitted that Anurag’s cellphone was recovered from a person at Panipat in Haryana, who had got it from another person having criminal cases against him, giving rise to the robbery suspicion. However, the court directed him for further investigation. It also asked if the then Munger SP, Lipi Singh, had been interrogated or not. Kumar submitted that she had not been interrogated yet. The court asked him if the CID was planning to interrogate her, to which he submitted that they will do it. The Election Commission of India had removed the then Munger DM, Rajesh Meena, and SP Lipi Singh after a violent mob torched Kotwali and Mufassil police stations and two outposts along with police vehicles on October 29. The mob had also attacked the SP office to protest Anurag’s killing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-to-state-pay-rs-10l-compensation-to-munger-victims-dad-or-face-contempt/articleshow/82777455.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Bihar: Tejashwi turns official residence into Covid care centre, invites NDA barbs||PATNA: In what could be the second such initiative in the country and the first of its kind in the state, leader of opposition in Bihar assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Wednesday converted his official 1, Polo Road bungalow into a medically-equipped Covid care centre and offered it to the Nitish Kumar government to run it. The initiative invited sharp criticism from the ruling NDA leaders. “Because it is a government bungalow, we cannot run the Covid care centre and, therefore, have decided to offer it to the state government to run it,” Tejashwi said in a video clip released on social media. “It has been provided with all the medical requirements of the Covid patients,” the RJD leader said. The photographs showed the rooms having beds, oxygen cylinders and medicines. “We hope the government will adopt the Covid care centre at my official bungalow,” Tejashwi said, adding: “If the government needs some help, I am ready to provide it,” he said. Karnataka home minister has also converted his residence in his assembly constituency into a Covid care centre. “I decided to convert the official bungalow allotted to me into a Covid care centre because the patients are not getting beds, oxygen and medicines at government hospitals or finding it difficult to get them,” Tejashwi explained the reason behind his initiative. A communique released from his side said it had been named as RJD Covid Care Centre. Earlier, on Monday, Tejashwi had written a letter addressed to CM Nitish Kumar to seek permission from the government that the legislators, including he himself, be allowed to open Covid care centres and/or community kitchens for the benefit of Covid patients in the state. Meanwhile, the NDA constituents assailed Tejashwi with sarcasm, acerbic barbs roping in his family. Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi took a swipe at Tejashwi by thanking him for the initiative and tweeted, “It is also requested that leaving aside your political discourse, you also ensure the arrangement/deployment of doctors. If you don’t find the doctors, then you can also begin public service with the help of PMCH topper in your family.” Manjhi ws alluding to Tejashwi’s sister Misa Bharti, who had topped the MBBS examination at Patna Medical College. The state BJP termed the Tejashwi’s move as a step to gain public limelight to neutralize the effect of former MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, the chief of Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik), who was arrested recently in a 32-year-old kidnapping case. “The fact is that the RJD family is feeling afraid of the kind of politics Pappu is doing. Many RJD workers have joined hands with him in appreciation,” state BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said. “Tejashwi, as a move to counter Pappu Yadav, is planning to return to Bihar from Delhi and save his so-called MY (Muslim-Yadav) politics,” he added. JD(U) MLC and spokesman Neeraj Kumar mocked Tejashwi, calling him “Lapataganj ke nayak” (leader of a place/shelter for those who do the vanishing act). Neeraj also sought to know from Tejashwi if the doctors in his family will join him in doing service to the Covid patients and, also, if he will like to reside at the 1, Polo Road bungalow where Covid care centre of the RJD has been opened, to enhance the morale of patients who will be treated there?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-turns-official-residence-into-covid-care-centre-invites-nda-barbs/articleshow/82777605.cms||Abhay Singh

The survey has helped identify many patients with fever and other symptoms of Covid-19. In keeping with the instructions of the state government, the Krishna district administration took up a door-to-door fever survey to assess the overall health of the public. The decision came in the wake of the Covid-19 positivity rate in the district crossing 20 per cent. Teams of health workers, along with panchayat authorities and volunteers, went door-to-door in rural areas, enquiring about the health of villagers. Altogether, 6.5 lakh families were covered till Wednesday while another five lakh are yet to be covered. Around 4,800 cases of fever with symptoms of Covid-19 were identified in the survey, according to the office of the district medical and health officer (DM&HO). However, officials noted that many in rural areas who displayed Covid-19 symptoms were ignoring the signs. Local healthcare workers were not informed and patients were being rushed to hospitals in nearby cities when symptoms worsened. “Around 50 per cent of the fever survey has been completed in the district. We distributed around 8,000 home isolation kits to patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Patients can contact 104 helplines if they need any kind of medical help and assistance round-the-clock,” district collector A Md Imtiaz said. “A total of 14.5 lakh households are to be covered under the survey and we will get a clarity on the Covid-19 situation after the completion of the survey,” the collector added. Altogether, 77 hospitals with a total of 4,875 beds are ready to treat Covid-19 patients in Krishna district.

These include decision to sell minor minerals through e-auction, collect seigniorage fee through outsourcing, and fix seigniorage based on weight rather than size in granite mining. Seigniorage will now be fixed based on tonnage of the material, which is estimated to increase income for the state between 35 to 40 per cent. It was also decided to conduct e-auction where leases are obtained and mines are not maintained, which can fetch a revenue of around Rs 1,000 crore for the government. The new rules will come into force from September. Jagan asked for the vigilance and enforcement section in mining department to ensure the government suffers no loss. He also asked officials to ensure 60-79 lakh metric tonnes of sand is available before the start of the monsoon as sand reaches would get submerged and may lead to shortage if the required quantity of sand is not stocked up.

The accused were identified as Madineni Venkata Mahesh Babu, a software engineer employed in Hyderabad and from Ghantavaripalayam village of Savalyapuram mandal in Guntur, and Mulpuri Srisai Kalyan from Jawaharpet of Machilipatnam mandal, Krishna district. Addressing the media, Guntur Urban SP RN Ammi Reddy said Mahesh, who is the coordinator of ‘CBN Army’ Facebook page and a YouTube channel, had put up a post against the YSRC MP, which was found to be ‘obscene and objectionable’. A complaint was lodged against both youngsters by YSRC youth leader Panuganti Chaitanya at Arundelpet police station and a case was registered on April 24. Police said that the video had morphed Vijayasai Reddy’s photos and included a voice-over that allegedly insulted the government. On Wednesday, TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu wrote a letter to the DGP, stating that the detention of Mahesh and Kalyan was ‘illegal’ as it no notice was served under Section 41 of CrPC. Naidu condemned the press conference and ‘parading them’ (the duo) in front of the media. “Such press meets are held only to deter others from raising their voice against the ruling YSRC party,” the letter reads.

A delegation of dealers submitted a memorandum to civil supplies commissioner V Anil Kumar, informing him about going on strike from June 1. They said commission being paid by the government in Telangana was the lowest when compared to the commission the dealers get in other states. The dealers said nearly 70 of their colleagues have died due to Covid-19 so far but the state government has neither recognised them as frontline warriors nor announced any financial assistance to the family members of those who died. They demanded Rs 50 lakh financial assistance to the family members of those who died of Covid-19. Civil supplies department officials said they were looking into the demands of the dealers and added that a final decision would be taken soon. Copies of the memorandum submitted by the dealers would be sent to the chief secretary, they said. Telangana Ration Dealers’ Association president Nayakoti Raju told TOI that they have been distributing rice to 87 lakh card holders every month by risking their lives in the first and the second wave of the pandemic.

The family also sent the word around so that fellow villagers would assemble and join the funeral procession. With just one male member — Balai's son Sukumar — in the family, at least three other men were required to carry the corpse to the cremation ground 1.5-km away. Six families reside in the hamlet. As the clock ticked by, morning turned to afternoon and then evening. Yet no one came to the house. When the body began to decompose in the heat, Sukumar arranged for an antigen test to convince the villagers the body did not contain the virus. The result came negative but still villagers stayed away despite Sukumar’s pleas. When all seemed lost, help arrived from an unexpected quarter. Muslim youths from adjoining Rasulpur Sahabajar village arrived and told Sukumar they were there to shoulder his burden and assist him in giving his father a decent cremation. Rubial, Mukhtar, Khokon Khan and Syed Milu then joined Sukumar and Tarak Nath Adak (the only villager from Mamudpur who had responded to Sukumar’s pleas) to carry the body to the crematorium. There, the youths organised for wood, built the pyre and made all the arrangements. “It was a bitter yet important lesson in humanity. These men — Raibul, Mukhtar, Khokon and Milu — are my real neighbours. From today, they are my brothers,” Sukumar said after the cremation. Syed Milu said they had learnt about the distress and had walked over to help.  “That the person who had died was from another religion did not matter. We just wanted to help the grieving family. We were just being human. That is our identity,” he said. “We have to fight this scourge together. This man was not even affected by Covid. Imagine the plight of someone who dies of Covid. Let not this pandemic win over us by making us inhuman,” said Khokon Khan. Midnapore town Muslim committee secretary Abdul Wahed lauded the youths for acting like true human beings. “If everyone behaves like them, there will be no discord between communities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/muslim-youths-help-hindu-family-cremate-body/articleshow/82780027.cms||Sujoy Khanra

The platform will also not share the revenue it makes from such ads with the creators on whose content the ads are hosted. “You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your content on the service (and such monetization may include displaying ads on or within content or charging users a fee for access). This agreement does not entitle you to any payments,” reads YouTube’s new terms of service in India effective June 1. Before this, YouTube ad placements were only on content coming under its partner programme that only large creators (meeting certain thresholds of subscriber count and views) were a part of. Such creators also enjoyed a share of revenue from the ads under YPP. Further, in a move that could impact earnings of Indian YouTubers having viewers in the US, Youtube’s terms of service now say payments from YouTube to Indian creators will be considered “royalties” from a US tax perspective, and creators who make money from YouTube need to submit their tax information in Google’s AdSense portal at the earliest. In case of Indian YouTubers, if the creator submits the tax information, he/she can claim benefits under a tax treaty between India and the US that reduces the tax rate to 15% of earnings. However, if tax info is not submitted by May 31, Google may be required to deduct up to 24% of the total earnings as tax, the company said. Content creators and digital marketers TOI spoke to say that YouTube’s decision to monetize the content of small players on the platform and not share a cut with them may act as a bit of discouragement to content creators who are just starting off. “The reason Google had earlier set the minimum threshold for a video to be eligible for ads, was to bring brand safety and ensure that ads run on high quality videos which have been seen by a minimum set of users and hence has some quality measurement,” a digital marketing executive said. A Chennai-based content creator who runs a tech-centric channel on YouTube said the company was using its monopoly to monetize all popular content on the platform and not share the revenue with the creators. “I don’t monetize my channel and I am also not interested in having any ads on my videos but I have no say now,” the person said. In a third change to its terms, while YouTube’s policies always said that users cannot use “any data” from the platform that can help identify a person without their permission, the platform has now explicitly added “facial recognition” data to this- meaning no one is allowed to scrape YouTube videos for facial recognition purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/youtube-to-have-more-ads-as-company-revises-policies/articleshow/82780482.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Business||Banks to RBI: More Covid-hit companies may need recast of loans||MUMBAI: Banks have told the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that the extended restrictions due to the resurgence of the Covid pandemic have caused significant stress on businesses and a restructuring window may be required for more loans. Although the RBI did allow lenders to restructure loans for borrowers earlier this month, the facility was restricted to loans of up to Rs 25 crore. Since the measures were announced, the second wave of Covid emerged across the country, resulting in most parts of the country observing some form of a lockdown. Coronavirus: Live updatesOn Wednesday, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das met with the CEOs of public sector banks (PSBs) through a video conference. Acknowledging the role played by PSBs in extending various banking services including credit facilities to individuals and businesses during the pandemic, the governor asked them to quickly implement the Covid relief measures already announced. He also reiterated the need for banks to raise capital to increase the resilience of their balance sheet should further shocks arise out of the pandemic. The governor in the meeting sought feedback from banks on the state of the financial sector and credit flows to different sectors, including small borrowers and micro, small and medium enterprises. The governor also sought information on whether rate reductions by banks were in line with the RBI’s action to bring down the cost of funds. Bankers said that, while the first quarter is traditionally a sluggish period for credit growth, this year loan pick-up was even lower because of the lockdown. They said that the extended lockdown, while necessary to contain the pandemic, is hurting a large segment of the economy. There is a clear indication of collection efficiency being hit. While earlier the banks were more concerned about the survival of small businesses, they are now worried that larger companies may also start facing liquidity related issues as economic activities in non-essentials have been significantly hit. Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) have already asked the RBI for a moratorium for their borrowers and their borrowings from banks. Bankers say that in 2020, NBFCs shrunk their books and reduced debt and obtained cheap finance because of targeted long-term repo operations announced by the RBI, which helped them tide last year’s lockdown. This year, no such package has been announced so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-to-rbi-more-covid-hit-cos-may-need-recast-of-loans/articleshow/82782345.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Dehradun||For ‘Covid widows’, volunteers spring up online to help them||DEHRADUN: Ruchi, 30 (surname withheld on request), lost her husband to Covid on March 30, three months before the couple was to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. Even as she tries to come to terms with her loss, the young widow, who holds an MSc degree in Mathematics, is desperately searching for a job to run her household which now consists of her father-in-law and sister-in-law. She saw a glimmer of hope when she chanced upon an online initiative to help Covid widows like her. The initiative, covidwidows.in, aims to enable women who have lost their husbands to the pandemic find a job or upgrade their professional skills. Since it was launched on May 11, the platform has seen around 750 Covid widows --- from professionally qualified ones to housewives – register on it. The initiative has also seen over 4,500 volunteers from across the globe joining in, and trying to help the women in the form of skill development, speech training and facilitating jobs. Yudhvir Mor, country manager of a US-based software firm, who started the initiative, told TOI that he was moved when he learnt about the death of an ex-colleague who was the sole earning member in his family. “I began thinking -- what will happen to his family and kids now? It also struck me that there must be hundreds of such women who have lost their husbands to the pandemic. Who was helping them? Then I spoke to a few of my friends, reached out to ex-colleagues and industry leaders, and decided we will support these women get back on their feet,” said Mor, who is working on the project with Himanshi Tandon, who works as brand marketing head in a global sportswear company and Asim Farooqi who is in a senior role at an international professional services firm. The venture has also been endorsed by filmstar Kareena Kapoor Khan who recently praised the effort on her social media account by posting details of the initiative and writing, “ We can’t even begin to understand their pain (the women who lost their partners due to the Covid pandemic) but we can help them find their footing again.” Multinational firms like Zuora, Genpact, Capgemini, PayPal, Walmart and Celonis have extended support to the initiative by promising to hire the women who fit their vacancy requirements. Terming the initiative as “a big help”, Deepali Kalra, a HR professional from New Delhi who lost her husband in December last year, said that given the dismal job market situation currently, the support provided by the initiative was very welcome. In a similar vein, Susheela (surname withheld on request), who lost her husband on May 5, told TOI, “Even after having nine years of working experience with a multinational and having a BE degree, I wasn’t able to find a way to restart my career which I had left in 2017 to look after my in-laws.” She added that the volunteers of the initiative “ helped me regain my focus and get my confidence back.” Anju Jairam ---who is handling a team of 20 volunteers at the initiative, said, “We help the women to share their grief, get emotional support which they need at this time and also skill development training. We are actively sharing their CVs with multinational firms who have promised help and are also preparing them for interviews.” She added that “a few of the women have recently been shortlisted by a firm based in NCR.” “It will be a big moment of satisfaction for us if they finally get selected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/for-covid-widows-army-of-volunteers-springs-up-online-to-find-them-jobs-give-training/articleshow/82778012.cms||Ishita Mishra

After TOI reported the students’ initiative, officials got in touch with them and, after several meetings, it was decided that the group will provide KMC with verified leads on free services like safe homes, food delivery, oxygen facilities, telemedicine and volunteers. A senior government official said the Integrated Covid Management System was launched to provide up-to-date information related to hospital vacancy and admission, ambulances and oxygen across the state. “We approached the Dhoond team to help us with verified leads to upload on the government website so that all resources are in one place. This helps people to find what they need quicker,” the official said. Samriddho Ghosh, co-founder of Dhoond 1.0, said, “We are providing new sets of verified leads to KMC every day. The information on free oxygen facilities, safe homes, food delivery and telemedicine are being verified by my teammates before sending it. We are also trying to gather data of the districts so that we can verify them and help the government and KMC.” Another co-founder, Shrestha Baisnab, has lost three of her family members to Covid in the last six months. “We are happy to help the state with verified leads in the fight against Covid,” she said, saying that she hoped that collective participation of people from all sections of the society will help overcome this pandemic. The website — www.dhoond.epizy.com — has 30,000 users till date. The volunteers comprising Hridraj Biswas, Debanjali Mitra, Ishita Gupta, Sayak Dasgupta, Riya Bahety, Vedant Mozumdar, Aban Mondal, Sambhobi Bagchi, Subhosri Dhar, Ayushi Dutta and Arshia Roy are encouraged and are balancing both verifying leads for the government as well as for their own website so that the site remains updated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/students-help-kmc-update-verified-free-resource-data/articleshow/82780236.cms||Dipawali Mitra
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Civic plans for ‘Duare Oxygen’ in Salt Lake||KOLKATA: Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) and New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) are walking the extra mile to tackle surging Covid numbers. While the civic body is starting ‘Duare Oxygen’ services — at board of administrators (BOA) chairperson Krishna Chakraborty’s ward to begin with — from Thursday to help Covid-affected families, NKDA on Wednesday started enlisting names to start vaccinating 45+ age group domestic helps and ramping up Covid testing centres. BMC has also started vaccinating vendors and hawkers in the township. Chakraborty, the brain behind the ‘Duare Oxygen’ initiative, said that each of the nine blocks in her ward will have two oxygen concentrators ready along with masks in the block committee offices. Any resident of the blocks who would require oxygen would be able to hire the concentrators by contacting these offices. A dedicated civic team will be kept ready at the ward 29 office for any assistance. BMC authorities has also inaugurated a 60-bed safe house with 24-hour oxygen support for mild and asymptomatic Covid patients. The civic authorities have tied up with a healthcare organization as 30 beds will be free of cost and the rest will be paid beds. NKDA conducted vaccination drive on Monday and Tuesday to inoculate 60+ age group citizens in New Town and hawkers of 18+ age group with the first dose of vaccine. “We are trying to complete the first dose of vaccines for all senior citizens in New Town. Hawkers of 18+ age group have also been vaccinated and 45+ age group domestic helps are now to follow,” said an NKDA official. In Salt Lake, BMC officials said that vaccination for any age group residents could not be conducted in the last few days due to shortage and unavailability of vaccines. “Shortage of vaccine supply has been the biggest problem. We could run a few vaccination centres in Salt Lake and Rajarhat in the last couple of weeks as per availability of vaccine,” said a civic official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/civic-plans-for-duare-oxygen-in-salt-lake/articleshow/82780067.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Hyderabad||After time on the margins, Harish back in reckoning?||Hyderabad: Soon after Eatala Rajender was dismissed from the state cabinet on April 30, finance minister Thaneeru Harish Rao has been holding the fort of the all-important health ministry and chairing Covid-19 review meetings. Harish Rao even accompanied chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao during his visit to Gandhi Hospital on Wednesday, giving rise to speculations that he could be shifted to the health ministry from finance as and when the cabinet reshuffle takes place. A fortnight shy of his 49th birthday, Harish Rao seems to be back in action as he bis now holding key responsibilities in the party and also in the government. Not only is he attending review meetings on health and meeting officials along with chief secretary Somesh Kumar, he is also asked by the TRS leadership to look after party affairs in Huzurabad constituency which Eatala represents in the assembly. Harish Rao had to wait in the wings for nearly 10 months before he was inducted into the cabinet after being re-elected from Siddipet in 2018. He was mostly confined to his constituency and erstwhile Medak district and maintained a low profile while discharging his role as FM in his second stint in the TRS Sources said the CM’s move assigning Harish Rao with the key health portfolio at a time when the pandemic is surging ahead shows the confidence he reposes in his nephew. Technically, the health portfolio is still with the CM. There was speculation that KCR would induct former health minister and Jadcherla MLA C Laxma Reddy, but the proposed reshuffle has not taken place due to rise in Covid-19 cases. Senior TRS leaders said Harish Rao was never ignored by the leadership. “Our party chief decides whose services are required when and where and accordingly uses their services. Harish Rao is a taskmaster and KCR knows it well,” a senior leader said. Harish Rao handled the crucial irrigation portfolio in the first term (2014-2018) as KCR put all his energies on completion of Kaleshwaram irrigation project and other lift irrigation schemes. He was back in the reckoning when he was made party incharge of Dubbak byelection campaign in the later half of 2020. Though the TRS lost, KCR was impressed with Harish Rao’s efforts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-time-on-the-margins-harish-back-in-reckoning/articleshow/82782316.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Four held for stealing phones worth Rs 9 lakh||MUMBAI: A legal advisor with a leading private bank has been arrested along with three others for breaking into a store at Borivli and stealing 62 mobile phones worth Rs 9.5 lakh. One of the accused was an employee of the shop and provided the others with know-how on gaining access to the premises. All four men have been involved in crime for the first time, said the police. Ramlal Gupta, 27, who works as a legal advisor, had taken a bank loan two years ago and was finding it difficult to repay EMIs. He was close friends with Umesh Kumar and Yogesh Kanaujia. Kanaujia was to get married soon and was in need of money. Kumar had worked at a cellphone gallery at Borivli in the past and came up with the idea of carrying out a theft there. He reached out to Abhishek Pal, a current employee of the store, for inside information. The theft was reported on May 8 when the shop was closed for business. The police checked CCTV footage in the store but drew a blank. “It appeared the accused knew their way around very well. They had been careful to avoid cameras,” senior inspector Namdeo Shinde said. While checking other cameras with establishments close to the store, the cops were puzzled to find a grab of a man running away. They figured he was one of the thieves who accidentally entered a lane lined with cameras.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-4-held-for-stealing-phones-worth-rs-9l/articleshow/82783780.cms||---

The two-hour dramatic chase covered 60km finally came to an end near Jejuri, when the police managed to intercept the truck and arrest the driver (37) who had started accelerating from the Baramati MIDC. He was booked on the charge of murder attempt and other offences, an officer said. No injuries were reported. However, a pick-up vehicle and two shops on the road were damaged as the truck dashed past them. During the preliminary inquiry, the arrested driver — Baba Nazarkar (37) of Jalna district — told the police that he was angry with his employer, also a transporter, for not paying him money. He then got into the truck which, in fact, did not belong to his employer. “We are verifying Nazarkar’s claim,” sub-inspector Nitin Mohite of the Baramati Taluka police told TOI. Mohite said on Monday around 9.30pm, a truck driver had parked the vehicle near a godown in Baramati MIDC. “When he returned, he found that the truck was not there. The driver immediately alerted the transporter, who then informed us of the theft. He also told us that there was a GPS installed in the vehicle and it was moving towards Morgaon,” Mohite said. Mohite said the police team took the truck owner with them and began chasing the vehicle. A few ‘police mitra’ too joined them. “Within a few minutes, the police team located the truck, which was going at a normal speed. When the driver realized that he was being chased by the police, he accelerated the vehicle,” Mohite said. To stop the truck, the police tried to block its way by parking a pick-up vehicle. However, the driver dashed it and headed towards Jejuri. “We immediately alerted the Jejuri police,” Mohite said. Inspector Sunil Mahadik of the Jejuri police told TOI, “We immediately blocked the road at Morgaon Chowk in Jejuri. We parked a truck in the middle of the road. We had left a small space for the movement of small vehicles. The truck driver noticed the opening and drove at a high speed from that space, damaging two shops on the road.” The driver then headed towards Saswad Road (a state highway). “He was driving at a high speed on the highway,” Mahadik said. Mahadik said, “I somehow overtook the truck. I knew there was bridge, where the highway became narrower. We parked a container near the bridge. Seeing it, the driver slowed down and tried to jump out. The police and the people who were just behind, nabbed him. We then took him to the police station.” He said that the chase that began at 10pm on Monday, stopped after two hours around midnight. “The driver had travelled about 60km. He was not drunk and nor did he dash into any vehicle plying on the road,” Mahadik said An officer from the Pune rural police told TOI, “The probe so far revealed that the suspect Nazarkar was upset as his employer did not pay him the salary. Thinking it was his employer’s truck, Nazarkar decided to steal it. Our probe is on,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-nab-man-driving-stolen-truck-after-2-hour-chase/articleshow/82782353.cms||---

Dhote couple not only got the first dose of Covishield but also pick-up and drop from its Durga Nagar residence to police hospital at Takli. They were also greeted with a rose and a bottle of sanitizer. Their eyes welled up in gratitude. City police chief Amitesh Kumar aims at getting 5,785 senior citizens, including 212 living alone, enrolled as members in the special cell of the city police inoculated. “The drive shall continue and cover other elderly people needing our help. We are already extending various assistance to our senior citizen cell members round the clock,” he said. Manda, expressing her gratitude to cops, said her life was all about hardship. “We cannot even pay our rent during the lockdown as our son is the sole breadearner who doesn’t get much work now. When the landlord tries to evict us, it’s the police who help us get extension,” she said after receiving her first dose under the supervision of Chief medical officer of the police hospital Dr Sandeep Shinde. Twenty-two elderly people like Ramchandraji and Manda took the jab on the first day of the drive being conducted by Nagpur city police’s family counselling unit ‘Bharosa cell’ and ‘senior citizen cell’ on Wednesday. NMC also assisted city police undertake the drive that was co-ordinated and managed by API Rekha Sankhpal of Bharosa cell. “If any senior citizen is hassled with the vaccine issue, they may contact us on 1091,” she said. Manda added she could not have imagined getting vaccine without assistance from the police. “Our only son leaves home early to look for work and comes back late in the night. If we ask him to take us for vaccination, it would mean no income for us that day. We are a hand-to-mouth family and cannot afford to lose even a day’s income,” said Manda who had migrated with husband to Nagpur three decades ago from a remote village in Yavatmal to work as labourers. Manda, more articulate than her husband, said they cannot even afford any treatment, not just vaccine. “A doctor in the vicinity gives me some tablets and capsules without charging anything just as our son,” she said. Manda was elated and also surprised when a cop, who stayed in the vicinity, asked her whether she was keen to take the jab. Former government employee 85-year-old Sudhir Tupkar, who also contributed as freelance journalist, said he was not keen initially after having suffered Covid-19 but later decided to receive the vaccine as the cops approached him. Sukhdev Nagmote, another retired government employee and secretary to a minister, said he too was approached by the police with lot of courtesy that triggered an interest in him. Police constable Sonam Uke said the senior citizens were being requested to come along assuring them of being taken care of and also being helped with pick-up and drop service. “We told them there would be no hassle of registration and queue,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-escort-senior-citizens-to-police-hospital-for-jabs/articleshow/82780160.cms||Soumitra Bose

The MP shared a video clip on Wednesday appealing Congress and other opposition parties to stop defaming Hinduism and Kumbh Mela for coronavirus spread in the country. “Covid infection has spread all over the world, not through Kumbh. Please spare Hinduism and Kumbh Mela as there is no Kumbh Mela in other parts of the world but the entire world is facing the wrath of pandemic. Hence, defaming Kumbh fair and attacking Hinduism for Covid spread is wrong,” the MP added. In an appeal to Congress leadership, he said, “You have only been doing politics for the last 70 years, and if you’ll remain alive, you’ll do it in future also, but this is not the right time to play politics on dead bodies. Please don’t do politics on the pandemic and help save people.” “Go and ask those who lost their family members due to Covid, please help in saving lives instead of doing politics,” the MP added. “You are using toolkits to defame Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP government in this time of crisis. You and your allies, besides SP, BSP, Mamata ji’s party all are doing the same,” he said. “We all in BJP are here to serve people and our workers, MPs, MLAs, RSS and other organisations are continuously serving people,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/mp-ravi-kishan-slams-cong-says-dont-defame-hinduism-kumbh/articleshow/82780931.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh to adopt Covid orphans, task force to curb trafficking||LUCKNOW: Acknowledging that many children have lost both parents in the second wave of the pandemic, the UP government on Wednesday announced it would take up the responsibility of ‘Covid orphans’. The government has identified 60 children across the state who lost both parents to the pandemic and another 609 whose parents or guardians are affected by Covid and need temporary care. Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had issued directions for formation of a task force in each district to identify and adopt such children. “Till Wednesday, task forces were constituted in 70 districts and meetings were held in majority of them to hammer out a scheme for Covid orphans. Task forces will soon be formed in Firozabad, Auraiya, Pilibhit, Hapur and Saharanpur,” said Sehgal. In a letter to district magistrates last week, principal secretary, child development and nutrition department, Hekali Zhimomi, raised the issue of illegal appeals on social media by people seeking to adopt children who lost their parents in the pandemic or putting up such children for adoption. Asking all district magistrates to take cognizance of any report, story or information on children being put up for adoption or women being trafficked, especially on social media, Zhimomi said: “The second wave of the pandemic is at its peak, particularly impacting women and children. Children are finding themselves in perilous circumstances, especially those who lost both parents and are staring at penury. Unfortunately, criminal elements are trying to take advantage of the situation.” The government asked district magistrates to identify such children and those who need immediate assistance. The State Child Protection Society, under Section 6 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, has been tasked with establishing shelters for rehabilitation of children and coordinating with various agencies. Citing the law, Zhimomi said that a Covid Virtual Support Group is being set up at the district level along with a task force headed by the district magistrate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-to-adopt-covid-orphans-task-force-to-curb-trafficking/articleshow/82783784.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Vaccination centres prepare fresh jab schedule to prioritize recipients||KOLKATA: On a day when 2.1 lakh Covishield doses arrived in the state, the health department asked the government Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) to identify two categories of recipients who are yet to get their first jab. The department has also asked the centres and Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) to reschedule their vaccine programme in the context of the revised gap between two Covishield doses. In a couple of days, CVCs are expected to come out with a schedule for the first dose, second dose, age and priori-ty categories. KMC has decided to follow a new vaccination schedule from the coming week. The second dose of Covishield will be administered at KMC-run centres across the city only on Mondays. For frontline workers, Covishield will be administered on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Covaxin doses will be administered at 46 KMC-run urban primary health centres located across 16 boroughs. These exclusive KMC Covaxin vaccination centres will remain open on all weekdays. “Each CVC within the district or KMC will henceforth follow a systematic immunisation drive. Local administration would like to work on innovative ways of scheduling the drive, dividing days of the week between different age groups as well as separately scheduling/prioritising first/second dose,” said the order on Wednesday. On Wednesday morning, an Air India flight delivered the Covishield vials that the state government has purchased directly from the manufacturers. Another 2 lakh doses will be arriving in Kolkata from the Centre on Thursday. Most CVCs in government hospitals said they needed more clarity on the first dose — whether they should also start taking in people from the general population. Currently, the first dose is being given only to the priority group of healthcare and frontline workers from these hospitals. “Some more groups, apart from healthcare workers and frontliners, have been included in the category that should be given the first dose. Hopefully, we should get more clarity in a day or two on whether we can include general population as well for the first dose,” said a vaccination coordinator of a government CVC. KMC will follow the Union health ministry guideline on the Covishield second dose, said Atin Ghosh, the member of the KMC board of administrators (BoA). According to a KMC health department official, civic medical officers in charge of the CVCs are finding it difficult to carry on with the vaccination schedule under the Covid restrictions. “Vaccinators and paramedics are finding it difficult to reach the centres,” said a KMC official. The revised gape between two Covishield doses and the travel restrictions, coupled with vaccine shortage, have led to a massive dip in footfall in vaccination camps. Since the past four days, the number of doses administered per day has come down to about 60,000. “Most people coming to take the jab are travelling in their own cars. In the absence of public transport, it is difficult for people to reach the CVCs unless they live within a walking distance,” said a source at SSKM Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-centres-prepare-fresh-jab-schedule-to-prioritize-recipients/articleshow/82780216.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||India||Enough troops on Ladakh frontier to tackle any situation: Army chief||NEW DELHI: The Army has an adequate number of troops deployed on the eastern Ladakh frontier to tackle any contingency, Army chief General MM Naravane said on Wednesday, even as he expressed hope that the continuing military confrontation with China would be resolved through dialogue. The trust between the two armies ranged against each other in the high-altitude region has “built up” in the backdrop of neither side “violating” the troop disengagement pact on both sides of Pangong Tso since February, Gen Naravane said. He said the dialogue process between India and China, both at the diplomatic and military levels, had not come to a standstill. “It is a continuous process… it will take time,” he said, adding that around 50,000-60,000 Indian troops continue to be deployed along the frontier in eastern Ladakh. The People’s Liberation Army has so far refused to complete the stalled disengagement at Gogra, Hot Springs and Demchok as well as stop blocking Indian patrols in the strategically-located Depsang Plains, as reported by TOI earlier. Moreover, the PLA has also continued to upgrade its military infrastructure along the Line of Actual Control in terms of roads, troop shelters, helipads and surface-to-air missiles positions in ‘depth areas’. “We are doing the same. We are in no way behind in our infrastructure development,” Gen Naravane said, adding that India was closely monitoring the situation at a time when the PLA has launched its annual summer exercises in its “traditional training areas”. “This is an annual activity. We all come to our training areas during this particular period. China has also come to its training area. But there has been no movement in any area where we have disengaged from (Pangong Tso)… both sides have honoured the disengagement,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/enough-troops-on-ladakh-frontier-to-tackle-any-situation-army-chief/articleshow/82786686.cms||---
---||Pune||Private firm executive loses Rs 7.25L to tele-callers||Pune: A private company executive (47) from Tingrenagar has lodged an FIR with the Pune cyber police against unknown tele-callers for duping him of Rs 7.25 lakh on the pretext of helping him secure Rs 7 crore towards the maturity of his earlier investments. The suspects posed as representatives of a finance firm dealing in trading and mutual funds. According to the police, the tele-callers asked him to pay Rs 7.25 lakh as fees for processing and issuing Rs 7 crore demand draft (DD) on May 13. When the victim took the image of the DD sent by suspects to the bank, it turned out to be bogus. The company executive then approached the police on Tuesday, realizing that he has been duped. When TOI contacted him on Wednesday, he refused to comment on the case. “The suspects had called up the victim about eight months ago and proposed a short-term trading fund plan with a handsome return on investments. The victim invested Rs 62 lakh in the said trade fund then. This amount was invested properly,” inspector DS Hake of the cyber crime police said. Hake said, “On May 13, he received a call from tele-callers saying that his investment has matured and the company has prepared a DD of Rs 7 crore in his favour. The suspects then tabulated some fees and asked the victim to transfer Rs 7.25 lakh to get the DD.” “The suspect also sent an image of the DD with the details of the bank, date, sum and others. After going through the image, the victim transferred the asked amount to two different bank accounts provided by the suspects,” he said, adding, “The executive took the image of DD to a private bank’s office on May 14. The bank officials verified the image with the other bank and informed him that the image was fabricated and no such DD was issued.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/private-firm-executive-loses-rs-7-25l-to-tele-callers/articleshow/82782399.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Nitin Raut takes on deputy CM over quota decision||MUMBAI: The state cabinet sub-committee meeting on ‘reservation in promotion’ witnessed heated arguments on Wednesday. Energy minister Nitin Raut (Congress) expressed his anger at the state decision to cancel 33% reservation promotion posts, questioning deputy CM and chairperson of the sub-committee Ajit Pawar (NCP). Raut, a member of the sub-committee, demanded a stay on the decision to fill 100% promotion posts based on ‘seniority’ without any reservation. A senior official said a legal opinion has been sought from the law and judiciary department, which is expected in a week. In April 2021, the state government had decided to keep 33% posts vacant so that these could be filled by promoting candidates from backward classes, subject to the SC’s final verdict. On May 7, the general administration department headed by CM Uddhav Thackeray ordered that all posts be filled by promoting candidates only on the basis of seniority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-raut-takes-on-dy-cm-over-quota-decision/articleshow/82783819.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Allahabad||SRNH to have more beds given Covid third wave warning||Prayagraj: To enhance the infrastructure at the Swaroop Rani Nehru Hospital (SRNH), especially in light of the warning issued by health experts about the third wave of the pandemic, SRNH would soon be having 1066 beds for Covid patients. Of these, 702 would be ICU beds while the rest would be for those who need to be isolated due to Covid-19. Among the ICU beds, 85 ICU beds would be kept for kids as experts have warned that the third wave would prove dangerous for kids. SRNH is the sole Level-3 Covid-19 treatment facility of the district. In a recent meeting, the DM has also ordered the officials to also set up dedicated intensive care units (ICU)/Step Down Units (SDU) for coronavirus infected kids—one for children up to the age of 1 year (newborn intensive care unit) and a separate one for kids over the age of 1 year. “A proposal in this regard is being prepared by us and the same would be sent within this week. This specifies the need for staff and equipment etc. We plan to have these facilities ready on priority,” said Dr SP Singh, principal of Moti Lal Nehru Medical College (MLNMC). SRN Hospital is an associate hospital of MLNMC. Dr Singh said that at present the SRN Hospital has 314 ICU and 224 isolation beds for Covid-19 patients. “We plan to have a total of 702 beds of ICU/SDU for Covid patients in the hospital including 85 beds for kids besides an additional 364 isolation beds for the coronavirus infected patients in the hospital once the new plans get implemented. This would take out total bed capacity for Covid patients to 1066 including 388 new beds of ICU-SDU and 140 new isolation beds,” he explained. Explaining the concept of the step-down unit or SDU, Dr Santosh Kumar Singh, a member of the MLNMC team, said SDUs, which are often also referred to as transitional care units or intermediate care units care for patients whose condition is more severe than a ward patient but who do not need monitoring in an ICU. The idea is that an SDU takes the pressure off the ICU thus improving patient outcomes while boosting efficiency, he added. These preparations are being undertaken for the Covid-19’s third wave, which as per many leading medical experts and scientists, could be especially dangerous for children, said Dr Singh. In the last few days, SRN Hospital has received 100 new monitors for its Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 80 ventilators and 150 high-end multi-parameter monitors from the state government—all aimed at boosting its capability to meet the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, a decision to set up another 40-bed ward for Covid-19 infected children at Tej Bahadur Sapru (Beli) Hospital has also been taken. The DM in a meeting held with Beli Hospital officials on May 15 after due discussions instructed that a proposal in this regard be sent to the state government for approval as soon as possible. The divisional commissioner Sanjay Goyal has also ordered officials to start Covid-19 testing at SN Children’s hospital also as kids are feared to be especially vulnerable during the third wave of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/srnh-to-have-more-beds-given-covid-third-wave-warning/articleshow/82781090.cms||---

A sum of Rs 309.79 crore was collected by the Haryana Covid relief fund during the last financial year and Rs 1.54 crore was received this year till Monday. Currently, the finance department has Rs 197 crore. Officials said expenses on railway fare and bus fare paid to Haryana Roadways was part of the major component of Rs 122.60 crore spent out of the relief fund. The government has paid Haryana Medical Services Private Limited Rs 35.43 crore for medicines and other infrastructure. The state government has paid Rs 30.17 crore to Haryana Tourism for lodging doctors, paramedics, and nursing staff on Covid duty. Buoyed by the collections of the Covid relief fund, the chief minister’s office (CMO) is now largely making arrangements for health care infra through the CSR programme while setting up the godown-cum-headquarters at Gurgaon. “The CMO has monitored the spending. We had more donors this time as well. But we decided to have donations in material as well to ensure the required medicines and equipment reaches the beneficiaries as early as possible. A senior person is now monitoring the CSR donations,” said a senior CMO official. According to information, the Haryana government has received 1,369 oxygen concentrators, 100 oxygen cylinders, 13,250 pulse oximeters, 40 BiPAP machines, 126 ventilators, 2,000 thermal scanners, and one ECMO machine.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Over 15 crore people to get free foodgrains||LUCKNOW: Notwithstanding a steady decline in the number of Covid cases, the state government is set to face an enormous challenge to keep spread of virus under control when scores of people queue up outside around 80,000 public distribution system (PDS) shops to get free foodgrains under PM Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) starting Thursday. The mega scheme, which envisages free distribution of 5kg foodgrains — 3kg wheat and 2kg rice—to around 15 crore people, will span over a period of 12 days till May 31. During this period around 7.5 lakh metric tonnes of foodgrains will be distributed among 3.6 crore ration card-holders. Not surprisingly, the state government has decided to keep the scheme under a close watch of officials who would be deputed at PDS shops to ensure implementation of Covid protocols. To ensure social distancing a token system would be introduced at PDS shops and only five consumers would be allowed at a time. Besides, nobody would be allowed to use electronic point of sale (ePoS) machines without sanitizing his hands. Talking to TOI, food commissioner, Manish Chauhan said that district magistrates have been asked to depute a nodal officer at every PDS shop in their respective districts to ensure that Covid protocols are followed. Besides, he said, district authorities have been asked to conduct a thorough field inspection throughout implementation of the scheme. “The department (food and civil supply) has a supply inspector in every tehsil who would be keeping a close vigil on the distribution of foodgrains,” he added. The Centre had announced last month that it would provide 5kg of free foodgrains to millions of poor covered under the National Food Security Act 2013 in May and June under PMGKAY. This will be over and above the foodgrains distribution under the NFSA. The scheme aims to cover both categories of beneficiaries—Antyodaya Anna Yojana and Priority House Holders. The Centre will bear all expenditure on account of food subsidy and central assistance to states/ UTs on account of intra-state transportation. Officials said under the one-nationone-card scheme, the intended beneficiaries and migrants would be eligible to get foodgrains from any shop. The facility will be available from May 29 to May 31. Earlier in April 2020, when the state has undergone the first complete lockdown, the UP government had distributed around 60 lakh metric tonnes of foodgrains per month, a government spokesperson added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/over-15cr-people-to-get-free-foodgrains/articleshow/82783792.cms||Pankaj Shah

The statistics of the health department show that about 64% of the total 1,277 positive cases reported from May 12 to 18 were from rural areas. Officials said around 4,000 monitoring committees are covering each and every house in 1,540 gram panchayats of the district to trace Covid cases. Additional chief medical officer and nodal officer (Covid) Dr Rishi Sahai said, “The focus is on over 5,000 villages (1,540 gram panchayats) in 23 blocks of the district. Around 4,000 monitoring committees are conducting surveys to trace people with Covid symptoms.” The health department has launched a combing drive in all villages under which each and every house is being surveyed for tracing Covid cases and testing of suspected patients, he added. The monitoring team including ANM or ASHA and teachers are interacting with villagers to trace patients showing Covid-19 like symptoms. Each team has to cover at least five houses in a day. If anyone has Covid symptoms, the Rapid Response Team (RRT) is called for testing, tracking and treatment. The RRT members conduct antigen or RTPCR test and then decide on home isolation or admission to Covid hospital. The teams are also providing medicine kits to patients. As per data, 1,277 cases were detected between May 12 and 18, while 3,825 patients recovered in the same period. Health teams have also been testing migrants who recently returned to their native villages from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana and other states. Besides, people are being encouraged to get vaccinated. Primary health workers are interacting with villagers to dispel myths regarding vaccination and are encouraging people for vaccination. “Teams are spreading awareness about Covid-appropriate behavior and are sharing the dos and don’ts regarding the pandemic, said Dr Sahai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/share-of-cases-from-ruralareas-goes-up-vigil-hiked/articleshow/82781035.cms||---

Amid the incessant rain, the EMRI 108 service received a call about a 24-year-old pregnant woman who had started bleeding and needed immediate hospitalization. “A team of Sahdevsinh, Varun Ahir, and Junaid Ansari did not think twice and took the seven-month pregnant woman from an industrial plant at Moraiya near Bavla and drove her to Sola Civil Hospital,” said an EMRI official. “She had developed complications, and any delay could have been fatal. The nearby hospitals were not equipped to handle such cases.” While the majority of the population in Ahmedabad was indoors due to the heavy rainfall and howling winds, the EMRI 108 ambulances attended to 20-odd emergencies in and around the city. In all, the service received 395 calls in four days of which 164 were on May 18, 80 on May 17, and 90 on May 16 from different parts of Gujarat. “Of the total cases, injuries due to fall of a tree or a structure or any object accounted for 80% of the calls at 317, followed by crushing injuries at 62,” said the official. “The teams shifted 16 persons injured by building or structure collapse.” In another instance from Ahmedabad district, a 26-year-old youth sustained head and body injuries at Balas near Dholka when a wall collapsed.

---||Pune||Covid-19: Highest daily deaths, cases in rural, peri-urban areas, Maharashtra CM holds review||MUMBAI: The daily caseload in the state rose above 30,000 after two days when 34,031 Covid cases were registered on Wednesday. The number of deaths declined marginally to 594. In Mumbai, the BMC recorded 1,329 cases and 57 deaths—up from 961 cases and 44 deaths recorded on Tuesday. Although the state’s daily caseload dropped by almost half over the last 20 days, state government officials said many concerns remained: the death rate is not dropping as quickly as the cases, and Covid-19 continues to spread in peri-urban and rural areas. On Wednesday, CM Uddhav Thackeray took stock of the Covid situation from district collectors ahead of a virtual conference with PM Narendra Modi on Thursday. “Although Maharashtra and Mumbai are coming around, there are still many sick patients in hospitals. Right now, the focus is on creating e-ICUs, linking villages with towns and towns with cities in a bid to save lives in rural areas,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19. On Wednesday, the highest number of daily cases was reported from Ahmednagar city (2,878), while Satara district registered 2,598 cases, and Pune rural and Solapur rural saw 2,551 and 2,130 cases, respectively. Amaravati, Buldhana, Sangli and Pune Municipal Corporation areas recorded over 1,000 daily cases each. Joshi said the state is still two to four weeks away from stablising. “We cannot drop testing or it will lead to increase in positivity rate. Also, while taking decisions on reducing the restrictions, we have to ensure that people adhere to Covid-appropriate behavior,” he said. According to the state government update on Wednesday, the state's caseload is 54.7 lakh and toll is 84,371. In the state capital, the tally since March 2020 is 6.1 lakh and toll is 14,373 deaths. In the last 11 days, active cases in the state dropped significantly to 4 lakh on Wednesday, from 6.3 lakh on May 8. The city’s active cases too dipped to 29,445 from 52,874 on May 8. State public health minister Rajesh Tope said the recovery rate of the state has improved to over 90% and the daily growth rate has dropped to 0.5%. Tope also claimed that the number of cases dropped without reducing the testing. While five cities in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi, Palghar, Vasai-Virar and Mira-Bhayandar, recorded zero deaths on Wednesday, the highest deaths reported were in Kolhapur rural at 68, which is more than the Nagpur circle (53) and Mumbai city (57).

---||Chandigarh||‘Fire of defiance’ in fields||Ludhiana: Punjab’s stubble fires in the ongoing wheat harvesting season have been the highest in three years, even as farmers and farm unions have been demanding scrapping of new farm laws. In the meanwhile, farmer unions claim that they have been advising farmers against burning crop stubble in the fields but could do so not this time as they have been protesting against the agri-marketing laws for the last over six months. Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) used remote-sensing satellite data to count active fires in the Rabi (wheat) seasons of 2019, 2020 and 2021 and saw how the figure progressed from 6,022 to 7,652 and then 9,643. Each period is from April 16 to May 17. Many farmers said the figures were true. A farmer in the Malerkotla area of Sangrur district indicated that the farmers’ temper was too inflamed at this stage for the state government to risk touching them. He said: "On the ground, it does appear that more farmers have set their crop residue on fire but resentment against the centre is also a factor. Also, farmer unions are not telling us anything and a costlier diesel prevents us from transporting the stubble." Even progressive farmers see this defiance. Sukhjit Singh, a progressive farmer from Diwala village near Khanna, who has spoken against stubble-burning on international forums, said: "The anger factor is there. I don’t set my fields on fire for many years now and do benefit from it, as my requirement of fertilizer and manure has dropped significantly and the soil remains mineral-rich, which is not the case with burnt-up fields." Asked for his take, Bhartiya Kissan Union (Rajewal) national president Balbir Singh Rajewal said: "I neither see more stubble fires this year nor believe these to be a sign of resentment. For all the pollution, only the poor farmer is blamed, while no one speaks against the actual factors responsible—the vehicular and industrial pollution. Their carbon monoxide emission is 10 times harmful than the carbon dioxide generated from stubble fires. Don’t defame the farmers. Limit the number of cars." On why they stopped advising farmers not to burn crop stubble, Rajewal said: "For the past six months, we are sitting on a protest. How can we leave our ‘morcha’. But don’t blame the farmers when despite National Green Tribunal ‘s asking the government, they either didn’t get the balers or had to pay for those. He said the Supreme-Court-ordered compensation had also not come. BKU Lakhowal president Ajmer Singh Lakhowal said: "Pay us Rs 100 per quintal as bonus and we’ll stop burning the stubble and start making cardboard articles out of it if the units were set up." PPCB secretary Krunesh Garg said: "The farmers are in a defiant mode. Our inspectors are on Covid duty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fire-of-defiance-in-fields/articleshow/82782403.cms||Shariq Majeed

The incident took place in the afternoon after the medical team raided Biswas Arbindo Subol’s ‘Bengali clinic’. Preliminary probe has revealed that the quack has been running the clinic for the past 17 years. When caught red-handed, the suspect called the villagers for help and a large number of locals gathered in his support and manhandled medical officer Mohammed Yusuf Maniyar and his team members. The mob also assaulted a local scribe Shaikh Mohsin who had reached the spot to cover the raid. With the help of locals, the suspect quack, along with all the seized medicines and equipment, fled from the spot. It was only after the local area police intervened that the medical team was allowed to step outside the hospital. When contacted, Dr Maniyar said, “On reaching the clinic, the quack was found administering saline to patients. In all, there were five beds and we had seized some surgical equipment along with bulk stock of allopathic and ayurvedic medicines. He failed to produce any degree or medical registration.” Police said that no one has been injured in the incident and all five identified suspects, including the quack, have been booked. A manhunt has been launched to nab the suspects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/medical-officer-attacked-during-action-on-quack/articleshow/82775810.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Block development officer for Bhokar G L Ramod on Wednesday said that the Centre has taken a note of a measure using which Covid-19 patients with mild or no symptoms were quarantined at farms along with their acquaintances and supplied with medical aid kits. “Such quarantine arrangement worked very well and yielded results. Also, the district administration and health authorities carried out house visits of villagers to mobile Covid-19 testing and conducted daily tests. All villagers having comorbidities along with veterans were given special attention. The staff from Primary Health Centre (PHC) was deputed at hotspots. All these measures put in place have been appreciated by the Centre,” he said. Located around 35 km from district headquarters, Bhosi, with a population of 3,910, has reported only 134 cases and two deaths in last more than year since the outbreak of Covid-19. “The village did not have a single active case for several days during the current second wave until one villager contracted the infection. The credit goes to villagers and local leaders for actively joining hands with the administration in keeping a check on the pandemic,” Ramod said. Sarpanch of Bhosi village Tarabai Kalyankar said that the villagers had voluntarily observed janata curfew of 15 days in March during the second wave when 40 Covid cases were reported after a marriage ceremony. “Like many other parts, our village, too, witnessed reluctance by many for undergoing vaccination against Covid-19. After our repeated pleas for taking the vaccine fell on deaf ears, the anti-corona task force formed in the village is now working to expand vaccine drive,” she said. After such intervention, which is also appreciated by the Centre, Bhosi village has witnessed around 199 vaccinations so far till Tuesday. Five other gram panchayats from Maharashtra — Hivare Bajar and Bhoyare Khurde from neighbouring Ahmednagar district, Chandankheda from Chandrapur district, Khursapur from Nagpur district and Umbarpada Saphale from Palghar district have also received praises from the Centre for effective Covid-19 management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/nandeds-bhosi-village-appreciated-for-covid-management/articleshow/82775799.cms||Prasad Joshi

Currently, eight days of lockdown is imposed in Kolhapur district, which will end on May 23. The district administration ordered to shut all banking-related services to avoid gatherings and thereby prevent the spread of Covid. However, since the last couple of days, citizens are complaining about no availability of cash in the ATMs and also they could not get their cheques cleared. Most citizens need money to pay the bills. Also, the farmers who have received the funds from the government or through loans for agricultural purposes are unable to withdraw money. The agricultural activities have not been banned in the lockdown and the sowing season is about to begin. Bhausaheb Galande, the resident district collector, on behalf of district collector Daulat Desai, issued an order asking all banks to open the back offices of teams managing ATM services and open cheque clearing counters with not more than 15% staff. Galande said, “The lead bank authorities had received the demand to start these services. Based on the Covid guidelines in place, we have allowed the banks to carry out two services. The currency chest and the ATM managing offices will function. The banks, however, have to ensure no citizen is allowed in the bank since both services do not require the presence of the account holder in the bank.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-atm-back-offices-cheque-clearance-counters-allowed-to-function/articleshow/82775818.cms||---

Four of them are law colleges and one is a night college. Across state universities, the government has approved proposals for 190 new colleges. In Mumbai, five colleges, including a law college in Kandivli, has got permission. Others are proposed to come up in Ghatkopar, Kurla, Borivli and Govandi. Three more law colleges are proposed in Thane district, two of which are in Shahpur. Another law college will come up in Kalyan and will be run by the management of Birla College. Based on the perspective plan drawn up by the Mumbai university, proposals were sent to the state government, which has given its sanction. Many of the proposed colleges already run schools or junior colleges. In two separate government resolutions issued on April 15 and May 17, the state government has given a letter of intent to all the 190 colleges. While 166 have been given full approval, 24 have got a nod on conditional basis. Approval to the 24 colleges is subject to them fulfilling certain criteria, said a government official. Twenty-eight colleges across the state affiliated to SNDT Women’s University also got approval from the state. A senior official from the higher and technical education department said that the New Education Policy focuses on accessibility of education and the perspective plans of the universities have been designed accordingly. “There have been requirements in many districts, and we have given the letter of intent subject to the compliance of norms. Minor deficiencies were noted in some of the colleges, which will be fulfilled by the respective managements,” said the official. Mumbai University’s senate approved a perspective plan which proposed 36 colleges across its jurisdiction in Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Palghar and Sindhudurg. The state added 18 more colleges to the plan, taking the total to 54. Given the pandemic, however, not many were sure about educational institutions wanting to invest in a new college. With these 24 new colleges, an official said that the total number of affiliated colleges under the university will now cross the 850-mark, making it crucial for the state to bifurcate larger universities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-university-to-get-24-new-colleges-this-year-5-in-city/articleshow/82783966.cms||Yogita Rao

The farmer from Punjab’s Patiala district, Balbir Singh (50), had a fever, said the Sonipat district health authorities. Sources said the farmer, who was feeling unwell, was taken to a hospital on Tuesday evening where a rapid antigen test (RAT) was conducted on him. Sonipat civil surgeon Jaswant Singh Punia told TOI said that the farmer had a fever and he died on Tuesday night and added that his Covid report was found to be positive. The sources, however, claimed that two farmers at the Singhu had died of Covid-19 but the Sonipat health authorities only confirmed one death. The farm unions, which have been protesting at various Delhi border sites for almost six months now claim that the government wanted to spread fear among the protesters and the news of the farmer’s death by Covid-19 may be the outcome of that. Some of the farm leaders feigned ignorance about the farmer’s death due to Covid-19. Till now, only one Covid-19 death has been documented at the protest sites on the Delhi borders – that of a 25-year-old woman activist who died of Covid-19 on April 30. She was staying at the Tikri border protest site and was taken to a hospital on April 26 where she died.

---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Highest daily deaths, cases in rural, peri-urban areas, Maharashtra CM holds review||MUMBAI: The daily caseload in the state rose above 30,000 after two days when 34,031 Covid cases were registered on Wednesday. The number of deaths declined marginally to 594. In Mumbai, the BMC recorded 1,329 cases and 57 deaths—up from 961 cases and 44 deaths recorded on Tuesday. Although the state’s daily caseload dropped by almost half over the last 20 days, state government officials said many concerns remained: the death rate is not dropping as quickly as the cases, and Covid-19 continues to spread in peri-urban and rural areas. On Wednesday, CM Uddhav Thackeray took stock of the Covid situation from district collectors ahead of a virtual conference with PM Narendra Modi on Thursday. “Although Maharashtra and Mumbai are coming around, there are still many sick patients in hospitals. Right now, the focus is on creating e-ICUs, linking villages with towns and towns with cities in a bid to save lives in rural areas,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19. On Wednesday, the highest number of daily cases was reported from Ahmednagar city (2,878), while Satara district registered 2,598 cases, and Pune rural and Solapur rural saw 2,551 and 2,130 cases, respectively. Amaravati, Buldhana, Sangli and Pune Municipal Corporation areas recorded over 1,000 daily cases each. Joshi said the state is still two to four weeks away from stablising. “We cannot drop testing or it will lead to increase in positivity rate. Also, while taking decisions on reducing the restrictions, we have to ensure that people adhere to Covid-appropriate behavior,” he said. According to the state government update on Wednesday, the state's caseload is 54.7 lakh and toll is 84,371. In the state capital, the tally since March 2020 is 6.1 lakh and toll is 14,373 deaths. In the last 11 days, active cases in the state dropped significantly to 4 lakh on Wednesday, from 6.3 lakh on May 8. The city’s active cases too dipped to 29,445 from 52,874 on May 8. State public health minister Rajesh Tope said the recovery rate of the state has improved to over 90% and the daily growth rate has dropped to 0.5%. Tope also claimed that the number of cases dropped without reducing the testing. While five cities in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi, Palghar, Vasai-Virar and Mira-Bhayandar, recorded zero deaths on Wednesday, the highest deaths reported were in Kolhapur rural at 68, which is more than the Nagpur circle (53) and Mumbai city (57).

The portal, on which 8,283 farmers have registered to sell their sunflower crops, will be opened for one more day for farmers to register. Dushyant, who also holds the portfolio of food and supplies department, said the state government has set a MSP of Rs 5,885 per quintal for sunflower. The central government has also given approval to procure 25,000 quintals. He said, this time wheat procurement by the state government started on April 1 and so far 85,30,000 MT has been procured. As 82,10,000 MT of wheat has already been lifted from mandis, farmers did not have to face loss due to storm and rain. He said Rs 15,598 crore has been directly credited into the farmers’ bank account. Giving details of procurement in Haryana, said as committed, 9% interest was given to farmers for delayed payment. Thus, an additional Rs 77 lakh has been paid to farmers due to delayed payment which took place because of technical glitches or other reasons, he said. About mustard crop, he said this time the MSP has increased to Rs 4,650 per quintal and the state government did not have to procure a single grain of mustard at MSP as farmers were paid Rs 7,275 per quintal in the market. The JJP leader also congratulated the PWD officials for completing 500-bed Covid hospitals four days before the scheduled period of May 20. He reiterated the commitment to increase health facilities in rural areas, saying Rs 18.40 crore for 6,136 gram panchayats in the state with less than 10,000 population and Rs 4.90 crore for 98 gram panchayats with more than 10,000 population has been approved to build isolation wards in villages.

Late on Wednesday evening, the ward office, however, decided to discontinue the practise. The authorities claimed it was not a mandatory exercise and people were only being counselled to go in for a test at the centres. The BMC has not asked for any such test, though. Assistant municipal commissioner of the ward, Prashant Gaikwad, said it was voluntary and was being done only for the safety of people. “The move was to ensure vaccination centres do not turn into super-spreader events with asymptomatic Covid positive people walking in for jabs. There could be high-risk contact persons who are asymptomatic among the crowd,” he said, adding citizens in the 60-plus age group are vulnerable. The six centres in the ward started the antigen test on Tuesday, when walk-in vaccinations began for citizens in the 60-plus category. An advisory issued by the Centre specifies ‘there is no requirement for screening of the vaccine recipients by rapid antigen test prior to Covid-19 vaccination’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-2-days-d-ward-climbdown-on-antigen-test-for-vax-seekers/articleshow/82782479.cms||Yogita Rao

---||Gurgaon||Haryana vaccination: Nuh, Hisar, Palwal record over 10% wastage||CHANDIGARH: Haryana’s Nuh district leads in terms of wastage of Covid-19 vaccines as the district has reported around 11.8% wastage in the state. Nuh is closely followed by Hisar with 11.4% and Palwal district with 10.4% wastage of vaccine. The overall percentage of Covid-19 vaccination till May 13 in Haryana has been recorded as 5.1%. Importantly, the Nuh district is also at the bottom in the state in terms of coverage of Covid-19 vaccination, as only 58,942 persons in the district have been vaccinated till May 13. Nuh is followed by Charkhi Dadri with 110,114 people being vaccinated and Fatehabad at number three with 127,327 persons vaccinated among the districts with the lowest coverage of vaccination. Among the districts with the best coverage of Covid-19 vaccination, Gurgaon leads in the state’s 22 districts, as a total of 577,895 persons in the district have been vaccinated till May13. Faridabad with 453,960 and Ambala with 363,052 persons follows Gurgaon on the list. As of May 16, 80% of health workers and around 61% of frontline workers have been vaccinated in Haryana. These details about the vaccination coverage and wastage of vaccines was submitted to the Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday by Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, Haryana’s department of health in a status report about the arrangements being made by the state to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. Arora submitted that for the 18-44 years age group, the Haryana government has placed an order for 66 lakh doses with the vaccine manufacturers, and the doses are being supplied in installments as per the production of the vaccine. Haryana as on May 16 had a stock of 4,23,480 vaccines. Regarding the high percentage of wastage of vaccines in the state, Arora submitted that some wastage is inevitable, due to various factors, such as breakage, open vial, defective syringe, refusal, and hesitancy, etc. He informed the HC that initially the vials containing 20 doses were received in the state of Haryana and once the vial is open the same is to be used within four hours after which the residual has to be discarded. The current wastage in Haryana is 5.1%, which is however less than the foreseeable limit as per norms, Arora had claimed. The HC was also informed that at the beginning of the Covid-19 vaccination program, the permissible limit of wastage of vaccine as per the norms of the Union ministry of health and family welfare was 10%. However, now the ministry has asked all the states to bring it down to 1%. Sharing reasons for high wastage in Haryana, Arora submitted that in the initial phase, districts could not make all entries for vaccination on the portal due to the high rate of vaccination and also due to Cowin portal issues and some entries are still pending and the portal is closed for backlog issues, for which the Government of India has been requested several time through email, WhatsApp, during video conferences and telephonically to open utility for backlog data entries. According to Arora, the backlog entries would decrease some wastage. 20% vaccine to be saved for government staff:The Haryana government has taken a decision to vaccinate government employees under the “government workforce scheme” by creating workplace Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) for government employees at the state as well as district headquarters and 20% of vaccine procured by state would be reserved for the vaccination of government employees. Both the age groups 18-44 and above 45 years will be vaccinated department-wise. However, it would not be mandatory but on the individual's willingness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/haryana-vaccination-nuh-hisar-palwal-record-over-10-wastage/articleshow/82782461.cms||Ajay Sura

Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan said children whose parent(s) may have succumbed to Covid would be offered all help. “Children, whose parents are hospitalised and who may not have anyone to look after them, will also get help from the taskforce. Children facing any kind of Covid-related issues can contact the taskforce,” he added. The district administration has announced helpline numbers (1098, 7400015518, 8308992222, 9370003517) for the benefit of children affected due to the pandemic, an official release said. The district administration has also formed health teams to offer healthcare services at observation homes for children and issued an order to carry out vaccination of the staff at such facilities on a priority basis. Two CCCs for children soon Astik Kumar Pandey, the administrator of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), on Wednesday reiterated that the civic body is coming up with two Covid care centres (CCCs) for children. “Health experts have said children will need protection in the future stages of the pandemic. They said that some children may exhibit post-Covid symptoms for upto two months. Considering these alerts, the AMC has decided to set up a 100-bed CCC each at the MGM and on the premises of the Garware company,” he said. Attributing the current decline in fresh Covid cases to multiple factors, Pandey said self-discipline would be the key in the future to keep a check on the pandemic situation when the Covid-related curbs are lifted. “We have succeeded in arresting the spread of the pandemic during the second wave due to the existing restrictions, the ongoing mass vaccination drive and discipline observed by most citizens. Similar self-discipline will be needed in future too given that experts have predicted a possible third wave,” he said. Pandey said people should strictly avoid mass gatherings on weddings and other such functions and adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour including wearing of masks, maintaining social distance and ensuring hand hygiene.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/taskforce-formed-for-covid-hit-kids/articleshow/82775828.cms||---

NGRI scientist Ratnakar Dhakate said the study was carried out to understand fuoride contamination and its health risk assessment. He said people in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district still depend on groundwater for drinking purposes. The NGRI scientists found that 46.8% and 51.1% samples of pre- and post-monsoon respectively exceeded the permissible limit of fluoride. The researchers collected 47 — 28 ground water and 19 surface water — and 45 (28 ground water and 17 surface water) samples during pre- and post-monsoon seasons. Chinneru river basin, located about 30 km away from the east of Hyderabad, was chosen as study area. A water quality analysis data has revealed a higher concentration of fuoride in ground water and surface water samples. A scientist said: “The non-carcinogenic risk associated with fluoride contaminated water via ingestion has more risk. Children in the age group of six–12 months and six–11 years are found to be more susceptible to non-carcinogenic health risk when compared to that of other age groups.” Sharmirpet lake outfow originating from Shmirpet catchment area in the north after joining other streams grows into Chinneru river and finally meets Musi river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/high-flouride-content-in-water-from-yadadri-ngri/articleshow/82782456.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Four hours after they fled, building collapsed in Jamalpur||AHMEDABAD: As a four-storeyed building collapsed in Jamalpur, its 25 residents could not thank their lucky stars enough. Call it fate or sheer luck, they had fled the building just four hours before it came crashing down on Wednesday evening. The building was registered in the name of Yasin Farid Hookabaj. It was occupied by Mazsud Hanif Hookabaj and was in his possession since 1994. After Ahmedabad was hit by the cyclone on Tuesday evening, residents on the ground floor observed cracks in walls. They felt the building had begun to tilt and consulted a private engineer on Wednesday morning. “The engineer asked them to vacate the house immediately,” said sources. Realising their lives were in immediate danger, the residents fled the building around 1.30 pm, leaving most of their belongings behind. Four hours later, their houses had turned to rubble. The first floor caved in and the second floor fell to the level of the ground floor. The videos capturing the building collapse went viral on social media, leaving people shocked. What remained of the building leaned on nearby houses, but fortunately did not cause damage to them. No lives were lost nor was anyone injured. AMC officials claimed the building had been termed dangerous in December 2020 and residents had been issued notice after the top floor was constructed illegally. However, on condition of anonymity, a resident said, “The AMC officials pasted the notice declaring the building as a dangerous structure only on Wednesday”. Gaekwad Haveli Inspector Sajid Baloch said that based on AMC’s report of AMC, police will register a case in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/four-hours-after-they-fled-building-collapsed/articleshow/82782537.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Biology teacher poses as doctor to treat corona, nabbed||LUCKNOW: A biology teacher who impersonated as a doctor and duped families of Covid patients by promising to set up an intensive care unit (ICU) at their homes was arrested on Wednesday. Police arrested the accused Shashivendra Patel after a Covid patient P K Vashishtha, a resident of Chinhat, died and his wife lodged a complaint. Police probe revealed the racket Patel had been running. Patel, hailing from Unnao, had opened a medical firm providing treatment through ‘smart clinic’ and claimed to be its zonal manager and chief marketing officer. After coronavirus outbreak, he started duping people by claiming to be a doctor and having a tie up with a hospital. ADCP, East Zone, Qasim Abidi said Patel used to contact Covid patients seeking medical consultation and treatment at home. “He teaches Biology to students o f classes VI to X at a government school in Safdarganj, Barabanki. He used his basic knowledge of medical terms like oxygen saturation, pulse rate, blood pressure and other terms to impress patients and their attendants,” said Abidi. “He promised to set up a temporary intensive care unit at the residence of Covid patients and used to charge heavy fee for treatment and fleeced several innocent people. He used to wear a white apron like doctors to give the impression of being a medico. He never visited the house of a patient himself and always sent his driver for treatment,” Abdi said. Patel last treated one P K Vashishta, a resident of Omega Green Park, Faizabad Road, who died during treatment recently. The accused started pressuring the deceased’s wife to pay Rs 1.5 lakh as his fee and expenses on treatment but she refused saying her husband had died following which Patel started threatening her of dire consequences. Left with no option, she complained to police and investigation exposed the racket the fraudster has been running in the state capital. The ADCP said that several other persons are involved in the fraud along with Patel and police are collecting call detail records to identify them. Sources said Patel is also suspected to have committed a fraud in the education department earlier and police are looking into his past to trace his crime record.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bio-teacher-poses-as-doc-to-treat-corona-nabbed/articleshow/82783808.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Four cops shifted for failure to check funeral gathering||PUNE: Jalinder Supekar, additional commissioner (administration), Pune police, issued an order on Wednesday, transferring three officers from the Sahakarnagar police station, and one from the Bharati Vidyapeeth police to other units as "punishment" for failure to sense the ground situation and unlawful assembly at the funeral procession of a criminal on May 15. Around 200 men on two-wheelers followed the ambulance carrying the criminal’s body from his house to the Katraj crematorium in gross violation of Covid-19 restrictions. Police have arrested 104 of them who are now under magisterial custody in Yerawada jail. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said, "The officers concerned neglected their duties and failed to implement the law and order on the day. At the same time, they did not inform senior police officers about the illegal gathering and the motorcycle rally. After reviewing the entire situation, we decided to transfer these officers." Supekar issued an order transferring senior inspector Gautam Gambhire, crime inspector Rajendrakumar Kadam, besides a sub-inspector, all three from the Sahakarnagar police station, and a sub-inspector from the Bharati Vidyapeeth police to other units as "punishment". "A committee of senior police officers studied the entire incident before taking a call on the transfers," he said. When contacted by TOI, Gambhire, who has been moved to the economic offences wing, said, "I have nothing to say in the matter. I will follow the order." Senior inspector Swati Desai has replaced Gambhire at the Sahakarnagar police station. Inspector Kadam has been shifted to the crime branch, while the two sub-inspectors have been attached to the police control room. A senior police officer said, "Madhav Waghate (28), the slain criminal, used to reside in a place under the Sahakarnagar police area and his murder took place under the Bibvewadi police area. In such a situation, they should have kept their eyes wide open and taken basic steps to ensure law and order in these areas. The PSI from the Bharati Vidyapeeth was on nakabandi duty at Dhankawadi and did little to check the procession and unlawful assembly." Waghate was brutally beaten to death by 10 men at Bibvewadi around 1.30am on May 15. The funeral procession was taken out the same afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/four-cops-shifted-for-failure-to-check-funeral-gathering/articleshow/82782494.cms||Gitesh Shelke

At 15,480, Nashik district will get maximum number of doses followed by Ahmednagar (13,700), Dhule and Jalgaon (7,000 each) and Nandurbar (4,800). Deputy director of health P B Gandal said, “We are already in the process of distributing the vaccines to all the five districts.” However, delay in distribution of fresh stock affected the drive at majority of the vaccination centres in the district. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) had already declared that jabs would be given at two vaccination centres in the city due to unavailability of vaccines. Only two of 29 vaccination centres in Nashik city functioned on Wednesday and remaining 27 were closed. Similarly, most of the centres remained closed in rural areas for the same reason. All the vaccination centres are expected to be operational from Thursday following the distribution of stock to all vaccination centres by Wednesday evening. Only 42 out of over 200 vaccination centres in the district were operational and 3,676 beneficiaries were given the vaccination on Wednesday, out of which 2,682 beneficiaries took the first shot and 994 beneficiaries took the second dose. In Nashik city, 717 beneficiaries were given the doses at two vaccination centres. Additional health officer Ravindra Chaudhari said they have received the fresh stock and most of the vaccination centres will remain functional on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-division-gets-48000-vaccine-doses/articleshow/82776022.cms||Tushar Pawar

The patient count was, however, not specified by health authorities. “As many as 89,512 villages were covered in the rural surveillance drill and positive cases were found in 28,742 villages only. Health teams have already reached out to quarantined patients and ‘nigrani samities’ are keeping an eye on them,” said additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad on Wednesday.

---||Nashik||Nandurbar village gets overwhelming response for vaccination drive||Nashik: The Nandurbar district administration on Wednesday received an overwhelming response from the beneficiaries of remote tribal village of Bhagdari in Akkalkuwa taluka during a special one-day Covid-19 vaccination camp that it had organised. This village, with a population of over 5,000, was initially adopted by the previous state governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao and later by present incumbent Bhagat Singh Koshyari to ensure the village’s greater development in different sectors. Koshyari had visited the village in February last year. District collector Rajendra Bharud had recently started the Covid vaccination programme in the district on a mission mode under which health teams are reaching out to villages to inoculate the beneficiaries as they are not coming to visit the centres to get shots. The district collector took this initiative to organise these special camps in villages as the gullible villagers are fearful of the after-effects of vaccination. “We have been organising special one-day camps in various villages across the district to vaccinate the beneficiaries. The response of the beneficiaries from Bhagdari has been fantastic. We have been able to vaccinate around 813 beneficiaries above 45 years in the village in the day-long special camp that was organised on Wednesday,” acting sub-divisional officer (SDO) of Taloda Shahuraj More said. The total number of beneficiaries over 45 years in Bhagdari village is around 1,700. District officials said that usually in these day-long special camps not more than 300 beneficiaries come forward to get vaccinated, although in couple of villages the number had crossed over 400. Unlike the huge keenness among beneficiaries of cities, the local teams in Nandurbar have to sweat it out to convince the villagers to get vaccinated. “But in case of the state governor’s adopted village, the response from the beneficiaries has been highest so far in the district as far as vaccinating beneficiaries in the special camps are concerned,” said district officials. According to More, the district collector made six vehicles available to local teams to ferry beneficiaries from various padas (localities) of the village to the community hall where the vaccination programme was undertaken. Local tehsildar Ramji Rathord, taluka health officer Swapnil Malkhade and local Unicef coordinator Jitendra Valvi have been working to educate the beneficiaries of Bhagdari for the last six days about the imperative need to get themselves vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nandurbar-village-gets-overwhelming-response-for-vaccination-drive/articleshow/82775890.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

He is also serving as the principal secretary (agriculture). Along with the TSPSC chief, the government also appointed seven members to the recruitment body. This includes Ramavath Dhan Singh, retired as engineer-in-chief, Prof B Linga Reddy, professor in Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology (CBIT), Kotla Aruna Kumari, special grade deputy collector, Sumitra Anand, Telugu pandit, Karem Ravinder Reddy, retired government official, Aravelli Chandrashekhar Rao, practising Ayurvedic doctor and R Satyanarayana, former journalist. “The chairman/member shall hold office for a term of six years from the date on which he/she enters upon his/her office or attain the age of 62 years, whichever is earlier,” read a government order issued by Somesh Kumar, chief secretary to the government. The appointment of the TSPSC chairman was made almost five months after Ghanta Chakrapani completed his tenure in December, 2020. Three more members had retired with Chakrapani. The commission was left with only two members of which D Krishna Reddy was appointed as the acting chairman. After Reddy’s tenure concluded, the state government appointed the last member, Chintha Sailu, as the new interim chairman of TSPSC in March 2021. Sailu is also set to retire in August, 2021. Appointment of a bureaucrat has disappointed the unemployed youth who said that the government should have instead considered an academician for the post. “We condemn the appointment of a bureaucrat as the TSPSC chief. We are upset that no social balance was maintained in even appointing the members of the body,” said Manavatha Roy, president of Telangana Unemployed Joint Action Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/janardhan-reddy-to-head-tspsc/articleshow/82782476.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Kirpan ban: Oz Sikhs for amicable solution||Amritsar: The 56-organisation Australian Sikh Association (ASA) has called upon the New South Wales (NSW) government to withdraw the ban on kirpan, one of the five articles of Sikh faith, and consult the community for an amicable solution.  The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), has asked the Indian government to intervene. ASA secretary Pritpal Singh Tiwana told TOI: “We had called upon the decision-makers and influencers of the NSW state government to protect our freedom of religion. Sikhs are open to working with the government for further public awareness about the community. The consultation will ensure the safety of all residents of Australia, students especially.” He said the ASA had requested the NSW government not to take a decision without exploring the alternatives. NSW education minister Sarah Mitchell had on May 6 banned wearing of kirpan in the state’s public schools, after a 14-year-old baptised Sikh boy of Glenwood High allegedly stabbed a 16-year-old student twice in the stomach with his kirpan. Stating that Sikhs had lived in Australia since 1890 without any other incident where a kirpan had injured anyone in schools, Tiwana said: “Those who have spoken to the Sikh student’s family say he had reacted to bullying and harassment.” SGPC president Jagir Kaur said she had asked foreign minister S Jaishankar to speak with the Australian authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kirpan-ban-oz-sikhs-for-amicable-solution/articleshow/82782483.cms||Yudhvir Rana

A mishap was averted at the Nashik Municipal Corporation -managed Bytco hospital following a short circuit in one of the ventilators at the hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU) on Tuesday. The other four ventilators also stopped functioning thereafter. The hospital staff had immediately provided oxygen support to the patients in need. The health condition of these five patients on the ventilators were reported stable. Four ventilators were started immediately after an hour on Tuesday, while the fifth one was started on Wednesday. Jitendra Dhaneshwar, Nashik divisional medical officer and in-charge of Bytco hospital, said a team of technicians has arrived to inspect the ventilators. The exact reason for the short circuit in the ventilator can be known after the inspection.  The ventilators are continuously functioning since the outbreak of the second wave amid daily cases being reported and they had no standby ventilators. “It would have been a major relief if the ventilators under PM Care funds were operational,” said health officials. NMC has received 60 ventilators under PM Cares funds, but without proper equipment so they have been lying idle for the past three-four weeks. Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of NMC, said all the beds with ventilators are occupied and are continuously functioning. But one of the five ventilators developed a short circuit releasing smokes. No casualty was reported as the patients on the ventilators were immediately given oxygen support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/inspection-of-ventilators-at-bytco/articleshow/82775898.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Lucknow||Whacky weather: Rain & storm take a heavy toll on Malihabadi Dussehri in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Malihabadi Dussehri owes its taste, aroma, size and juicy flavour to the unique weather of Lucknow. It’s the loo (hot and dry summer winds) and the high day temperature that make Dussehri what it is. The fast changing weather pattern might cause inherent changes in the fruit in years to come. Dussehri, right from the start when panicles or `baur’ (cluster of flowers) appear to different phases of development, needs dry and hot weather to attain its taste and size. Occasional showers may be good, but not the incessant and heavy rains what Lucknow has been experiencing since Tuesday. If the rain persists, it will damage the fruit in ways more than one. Shailendra Rajan, director, Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture (CISH) said, “Sporadic rain is good for mango. It gets `rangat’, but incessant showers hit the fruit badly.” Rains in April-May have become a common feature every year. “Last year too the weather was the same which is not good for Dussehri,” he said. Lucknow’s orchards reported a good crop this year. Dussehri is expected to hit markets by Mayend or early June. “Favourable temperature, lack of thunderstorms and sporadic rains have made the crop flourish. We expect Dussehri to be ready in the next 20 days,” was what Insram Ali, president of the All-India Mango Growers Association had told TOI at the start of May. The rain, if continued, would expose the crop to fungal disease like anthracnose and pests like fruit-fly. “The humid weather might leave black spots on the fruit and the entire harvest may not mature,” said Rajan. On the other hand, mango growers are also apprehensive of a thunderstorm following the rains which would doubly hit the fruit. “Premature fruit drop is a regular, annual feature and losses depend on the frequency and intensity of winds. In the Malihabad region, 10-15% of matured raw mango fruits drop due to heavy winds and storms or other reasons every year,” said Rajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/whacky-weather-rain-storm-take-a-heavy-toll-on-malihabadi-dussehri/articleshow/82783857.cms||Neha Shukla

Vidhyadhar Nagar resident Ashok Saini said, “During the pandemic, when garbage should be picked up on time, vehicles are coming in two days. We have to keep garbage in our homes and wait for a day. As ours is a joint family, it gets difficult to manage if vehicles don’t come every day.”In Jhotwara area, many people have started throwing garbage in empty plots or nearby trash piles. People living in inner lanes are facing the brunt as vehicles usually pass through only main roads. Residents have to stand on the main road to dump garbage.Now, corporation is considering on terminating the contract of the firm responsible for door-to-door garbage collection. However, the firm has moved Rajasthan high court which ordered not to take any action against it for the next eight days.Ward 61 councillor Rakhi Rathore said, “It is need of the hour to remove the company contracted for garbage disposal. We need three vehicles for garbage disposal, but have two. If we can give the contract to someone else, it will be beneficial. The contract needs to be given to more than one firm to break monopoly.”The chairman of sanitation committee of JMC-Greater, Abhay Purohit, said they were in the process of planning for tenders of new contract. “We will not terminate the contract now, but have received proper legal advice from the lawyers. We will take some action and float new tenders soon once the matter is resolved in High Court. We are planning to give contract of different zone to different firms to break the monopoly,” said Purohit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/city-trash-collection-hit-amid-covid-jmc-receiving-50-complaints-a-day/articleshow/82782516.cms||---

The judge was dealing with a writ petition filed by S Suryabhan and S Ashok Kumar who filed an urgent petition questioning the action of the authorities. On inquiry, the judge was told by the counsel for the land acquisition wing that they did not acquire the land and made it clear that the question of either taking over the land or demolishingdoes not arise. However, the counsel for GHMC has informed the court that land was already acquired and they will soon demolish the building.

---||Chandigarh||Add Shahmukhi in census: Pak high commission to Canada||Amritsar: Nudged by Canadians of Pakistan origin, the Pakistan high commission in Canada has asked the American country’s government to include Punjabi Shahmukhi and Punjabi Gurmukhi as two separate entries for mother tongue for the Canadian Census 2021. The commission said has made the request, after it was by Canadians of Pakistan origin, even as Punjabi Shahmukhi script does not have any official status back home in Pakistan. In the letter, the commission have also sought inclusion of Urdu as a national language in Canada. Based on Perso-Arabic script, which is used to write Urdu, the Shahmukhi script is used to write the Punjabi language in Pakistan and is written from right to left. The commission announced the request in a press release it issued through its Twitter handle, @PakinCanada_, on Wednesday. Sources informed that the letter had been written to the Canadian department of foreign affairs, trade, and development wherein the Pakistan high commission had claimed that a large number of Canadians of Pakistani origin had approached them urging the inclusion of Punjabi Shahmukhi in the list of individual languages of Canadian Census 20121 for the recognition and celebration of the rich cultural heritage of Pakistan-origin Canadians. Reacting to the high commission’s request to the Canadian government, UK-based Harmeet Singh Bhakna, director of Punjabi Language Awareness Board (PLAB), said what answer would Pakistan high commission give if the Canadian government asked it about the status it had given to Shahmukhi. He said no doubt Urdu was the national language of Pakistan and had been serving as the medium of connectivity and cohesion in a culturally diverse national landscape of Pakistan, but he pointed out that Pakistan had till date not given any official status to Shahmukhi. “First, they should set their house right and then demand ask the Canadian government for the official recognition of Punjabi Shahmukhi,” said Harmeet. PLAB has been a campaign to bring back Punjabi language as the second most-spoken language in the UK during the census 2021 held in England and Wales in March, the result of which would be published in February 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/add-shahmukhi-in-census-pak-high-commission-to-canada/articleshow/82782521.cms||Yudhvir Rana

And on Wednesday, the state created a new record with its labs conducting more than 2.99 lakh tests in 24 hours — highest by any state so far — taking total tests done since onset of pandemic to 4.55 crore. “Testing is backbone of state’s strategy to flatten the pandemic graph in affected districts,” said Alok Kumar III, secretary to chief minister Yogi Adityanath. He also said, following CM’s orders to intensify testing coupled with efforts by health and medical education department, 1.03 crore tests were done in the second wave. 61.43L tests conducted at peak of Covid 2nd wave The cumulative figure of 1.03 crore tests since the onset of the second wave works up to 22.6% tests conducted so far since the pandemic struck in March 2020,” he said. Over 61.43 lakh tests were done at the peak of the second wave between April 1 and April 30. The highest daily count was reported on April 24, while maximum burden of active infections was recorded on April 30. New cases have been on a decline, while recoveries picked up thereafter. Still, testing has been ramped up. In fact, 41.69 lakh tests have been conducted since May 1. This means the average number of tests per day between April 1 and 30 was about 2.04 lakh, while the average for 19 days thereafter has been 2.19 lakh tests per day. Data from Indian Council of Medical Education indicated that UP accounts for about 14% of the total tests done in the country. As per a TOI assessment of ICMR data, Covid-19 testing has dipped in several states while it picked up in UP. As many as 29.07 lakh tests were conducted in UP in the fortnight between April 21 and May 4, which went up to 31.50 lakh in the subsequent fortnight of May 4-17. On the contrary, it went down in worst-hit Maharashtra from 34.9 lakh tests in April 21-May 4 to 32.33 lakh in the May 4-17 fortnight. Likewise, Karnataka clocked 17.40 lakh tests in the May 4-17 fortnight from 22.19 lakh in the previous fortnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-conducts-record-2-99l-tests-in-24-hrs/articleshow/82783875.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Kashyap (56), who was an MLA from Muzaffarnagar’s Charthawal assembly constituency, died after a prolonged battle with Covid-19 at a private hospital in Gurgaon on Tuesday. Braving rain and sidelining pandemic norms, a huge crowd turned up at the cremation ground to pay last respect to Kashyap in Saharanpur’s Nanauta village. An RSS man, Kashyap was minister of state for revenue and flood control in the UP government. According to family sources Kashyap had turned Covid-19 positive on April 20 and was taken to Medanta hospital nine days later.

Estimates by the civic authorities say that an average the city loses 700 trees every monsoon. Now, in just two days, three times this number were uprooted due to the cyclone. Jignesh Patel, director of the parks and garden department of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said, “Some 2,240 fully grown trees got uprooted due to the cyclone. If one considers smaller trees of about 10 feet height and a girth of about 10cm, the city lost at least 7,000.” “Usually when the wind velocity crosses 60 kmph it is not for a long duration. In this case, the city continuously experienced high wind velocity for three days,” Patel added. According to civic authorities, the most trees fell in areas such as Usmanpura, Ranip, Paldi, Naranpura, Navrangpura, Maninagar, Danilimda, Jodhpur, Bodakdev, Gota and Ghatlodia. “We aim to clear fallen trees from roads in 30 minutes so traffic is not hampered. We received many calls from housing societies and open plots where trees were uprooted. These will be the second priority,” said Mukesh Kumar, municipal commissioner, Ahmedabad. The wood from such fallen trees will be used as firewood at crematoria in the city, a senior AMC official said. According to civic authorities, several full-grown trees were uprooted on both banks of the Sabarmati. Full-grown trees also collapsed near Town Hall in Ellisbridge, outside the NID Campus in Paldi, near the Blind People’s Association in Vastrapur, among other places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tauktae-kills-2240-of-citys-green-lungs/articleshow/82782538.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Over 1,000 complaints of power line fault were received since Wednesday morning, most of which were resolved. JVVNL officials said these were minor complaints and no major feeder was switched off. On the outskirts of city where there are agriculture land with wells, 122 feeders out of the total 1,773 faced snags. According to officials, over 450 complaints were still pending at the call centres for power line default till 6pm on Wednesday. The city received 38.5 mm of rainfall from Tuesday evening to night. On Wednesday, mild to heavy rainfall continued throughout the day as it recorded 37.1 mm rainfall from 8.30 am to 5.15 pm. Mansarover, Sanganer, Jhotwara, Walled City areas received maximum rainfall. JVVNL superintendent engineer S K Rajput said, “The complaints received were not major and no 33 KV feeder faced any snags. The complaints received were mostly resolved within 15 minutes. At no place in the city, electricity was shut for more than that.” On Tuesday, five transformers exploded at Sanganer and Walled City, which were changed within two hours. Around 189 teams with 1,210 employees of JVVNL are working on field. These team members include 49 teams with vehicles who immediately rush to the spot where line fault complaint is received. The outskirts areas are so vast that it took time to resolve all complaints. Superintendent engineer Hariom Sharma said “We will restart the remaining 122 feeders by 8pm on Wednesday. There were many complaints received, but we resolved them immediately. We worked in record time.” Due to rainy weather, consumption of electricity went down by 20% in the city. Earlier, during lockdown, with the closure of commercial activity electricity consumption had gone down, but in the last two days the consumption further dipped as people are not switching on fans or air-conditioners due to cold weather.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cyclone-effect-city-records-1k-cases-of-power-disruptions/articleshow/82782531.cms||---
---||Dehradun||5,325 Covid deaths in U’khand since Mar 2020; death rate of the state 57% higher than the national average||Dehradun: Uttarakhand’s Covid-19 toll, since March 2020, reached 5,325 on Wednesday with 110 deaths reported in the last 24 hours. Eighty-three older deaths, reported by 18 hospitals across the state, were added in the cumulative figure today. These deaths took place in hospitals in six districts between April 23 and May 16 but were not shared with the Covid control room by the concerned authorities. According to the data provided by the government in the daily health bulletin, eight hospitals in Dehradun, five in Haridwar, two in Udham Singh Nagar and one each in Pithoragarh, Nainital and Uttarkashi have not reported Covid deaths on time to the Covid control room. The delayed reporting of Covid fatalities by hospitals has pushed Uttarakhand’s death rate to 1.77% -- 57% more than the national average (1.1%), said Anoop Nautiyal, member of the Social Development for Communities Foundation (an organisation closely tracking Covid-19 in Uttarakhand since its outbreak). “The fact that many government hospitals were unable to report deaths on time is a classic example of administrative collapse. We will never know all the reasons but this is indicative of a systemic rot. If we seek improvements, we need to make serious and sustained efforts,” said Nautiyal. A senior official in the health department informed that Haridwar based Baba Barfani hospital disclosed 65 covid deaths in bulk on May 14 while Raipur based Covid Care Centre (CCC) reported 27 deaths in bulk on May 15. On May 17, 87 old deaths were reported by three hospitals in two districts followed by 19 on May 18 and 83 on May 19. “This adds up to 281 old deaths reported to us in bulk in the past one week,” he said. The hospitals accused of hiding the data or reporting it late alleged that they could not update the deaths on the Covid-dedicated portal due to shortage of manpower and over-burdened staff between April 25 and May 10. Health department officials, on the other hand, claimed that data sharing was a critical task which the CCCs had been doing since the outbreak last year and workload can be no excuse now for omitting this critical step. “We have been taking details of each and every Covid case and death from the beginning of the pandemic. How come they are crying for things like data entry operators and staff not trained to share the data? They could have done it on Whatsapp, manually. But they took it for granted,” a senior official from the Covid control room told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/5325-covid-deaths-in-ukhand-since-mar-2020-death-rate-of-the-state-57-higher-than-the-national-average/articleshow/82778223.cms||Ishita Mishra

Department officials said the two accused have been booked under relevant sections of the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972, and the Indian Forest Act. A source added that besides the chinkara carcass, which was packed in a gunny sack, the accused were also carrying flashlights, a rifle and some rounds, as well as a motorcycle on which they were trying to escape. “The incident happened at a forest near the Bori village in the Indapur tehsil. Our patrolmen found some flashlights in the dark around 11.30pm on Tuesday. We chased those lights and found the two men with the gunny sack that contained the chinkara carcass. We arrested them and filed a case under the relevant laws, and seized the rifle and rounds, and the motorcycle,” Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forests (Pune division), told TOI.

---||Mumbai||Oxygen from Spain costly, Maharashtra sticks to local sources||PUNE: Maharashtra has decided to bank on its local sources for oxygen and not to get supply from Spain, as it found the rates quoted by the European country in response to the government’s global tender too high. The state had floated global tenders for oxygen, remdesivir and vaccines in anticipation of a third wave of the pandemic. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte had written to the Centre for allocation of an additional 200 tonnes of oxygen supply in the first week of May. “We have received about 500 tonnes of oxygen from various local sources after we had sent the letter to the Centre,” Kunte told TOI on Wednesday. Kunte, who also heads the committee for assessing the global tenders, said in terms of oxygen supply, the quotation from Spain was high. “The country was charging Rs 49 for a cubic metre of oxygen. Besides, there are transportation charges. But locally it is available for Rs 15.22 paise. With the additional transportation charges, the rate goes up to Rs 24. This is more viable. Moreover, France supplied 100 tonnes of oxygen as a goodwill gesture. This boosted supply for the state,” he said Maharashtra is also set to boost its oxygen production capacity to 3,000 tonnes from 1,250 tonnes through additional oxygen generation plants and pressure swing absorption plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-oxygen-from-spain-costly-state-sticks-to-local-sources/articleshow/82782549.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Of the 2,789 antigen tests conducted so far, 30 have tested positive. BJS has deployed its staff at the five centres to facilitate NMC in conducting rapid antigen tests. It hardly takes 20 minutes to get the result of the antigen test. Nandkishor Sakhla, project director of BJS for Nashik, who is monitoring the screening drive said the objective is to break the chain of Covid by detecting patients early. “Beneficiaries are rushing to get vaccine shots at the centres and if any beneficiary has contracted Covid then he or she may infect many. Hence, NMC and BJS have jointly decided to conduct the rapid antigen tests ,” said Sakhla. “The vaccination process has been affected due to lack of vaccines and most of the centres are closed for the past two to three days. But we will add more centres for screening once vaccination centres start functioning regularly,” he said. “We have plans to start screening at all 29 vaccination centres in the city shortly. Apart from beneficiaries, we are also planning to conduct antigen tests of any suspected Covid patient at the centre during the next couple of days,” said Sakhla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/30-tested-ve-at-5-vaccination-centres/articleshow/82776051.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Allahabad||Tauktae effect: Rain, overcast sky bring relief to denizens||Prayagraj: Tropical cyclone Tauktae has created havoc in states like Gujarat and Maharashtra, and also made its impact felt in Sangam City. Due to this cyclone, people in the city and its adjoining districts enjoyed cool and pleasant weather second day in a row on Wednesday. Since morning, the city witnessed an overcast condition and the received sporadic to heavy rainfall at regular intervals throughout the day. Although the weather did clear for a few hours in the noon, by the evening strong winds brought back dark clouds from the South-West direction. Because of the overcast sky, various localities of the city received heavy rainfall. Owing to these conditions, the maximum temperature of the city, as recorded by the met department of the Indian Air Force at Bamrauli, was 29.1-degree Celsius while the minimum was 24.6 degree Celsius. In the past 24 hours (calculating from 5:30pm on Tuesday), the city received 25.1 millimetre of rainfall, according to the met department. Because of the after-effects of the cyclone, wind speed over the city reached upto 20 knots although there was no major damage to life or property in the district. However, the sudden dip in the mercury did bring smiles on the faces of denizens, especially when the mercury was reaching around 40 degree Celcius. “Although we were not able to go out in parks and enjoy the weather, still in mid of the corona crisis, there was something to enjoy, which was a cool breeze from west,” said Pawan Agarwal, a resident of Civil Lines. However, the rainfall also created some problems in several localities. Waterlogging on the sides of some roads and power disruptions were the major reasons to make denizens complain. Tropical cyclone Tauktae had made landfall in western India’s Gujarat coast on the Arabian Sea around on the night of May 17. “The cyclone affected the weather at the Sangam city or for that matter the entire South-West side of the northern plain because of which moderate to heavy rainfall was witnessed at various areas. Although this is good for the preparations for the kharif crop, the standing crop of watermelon, muskmelon, etc., was adversely affected by the rains,” said deputy director agriculture Vinod Sharma. Commenting on the weather conditions, professor emeritus at AU’s department of Geography, Prof HN Mishra said, “The pleasant weather is because of the tropical cyclone that had hit the western coast of our country and the conditions would continue till Thursday evening after which the the cloud cover would move towards Himalayan regions and denizens should be prepared for rise in mercury.” He warned, “A low-pressure area is very likely to form over North Andaman Sea and adjoining east central Bay of Bengal on May 22 and intensify into a cyclonic storm. The system is very likely to move north-westward and reach West Bengal-Odisha coasts around May 26 and the same would have its effect in the northern plains at around May end.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/tauktae-effect-rain-overcast-sky-bring-relief-to-denizens/articleshow/82781145.cms||---

An aggressive jumbo Gajraj had killed chief accountant attached to head office of TATR, Pramod Gaurkar, in Botezari area in the core zone of the reserve on May 6. Demanding inquiry into the matter, NGO Prakruti Foundation had raised question over the presence of the officer in forest and the circumstances which led to his death. Tadoba officials had claimed that Gaurkar, accompanying ACF Ravindra Kulkarni, was on a visit to Botezari area on May 6. On the way, their vehicle got stuck in mud. As the officials were trying to pull the vehicle out, the aggressive elephant charged at Kulkarni and Gaurkar.

Claiming that the incident was result of human error, Prakruti Foundation president Deepak Dixit had demanded inquiry and action against those responsible for the officer’s death. In a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Dixit had questioned how did accountant Gaurkar go to the field while he was off duty due to curtailment of staff at office following Covid restrictions. He also alleged that the officials on field were under the influence of liquor and they had intentionally tried to go near the aggressive elephant.

---||Jaipur||Veggie prices to soar as untimely rain destroys crops||Jaipur: Heavy rainfall in the last three days has destroyed crops here and in nearby areas which might impact prices of vegetables in the coming days.Due to the impact of Tauktae, crops like tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, muskmelons, watermelons and brinjals have been destroyed in most of the areas around Jaipur city and across the state. These are all summer yields and as farms have been filled with water, almost all crops have been either destroyed or will rot in a few days.Pawan Kumar, a farmer near Shahipura area in Sanganer, said almost half of his produce had been destroyed. “Untimely rain is poison for crops. Most of my cucumbers, tomatoes and cluster beans have been destroyed. These are summer vegetables and they need warm temperature,” Pawan said. The retailers and vegetable market association members are also worried about the impact on prices. Vicky Mahawar, a retailer in Jaipur, said with crops being destroyed, prices will shoot up in the coming days, especially tomatoes, cucumber and musk-melon. Rahul Tanwar, president of Muhana Mandi Phal And Sabji Association, said, “Many of our trucks with fruits and vegetables reached the mandi, but were stranded as it was difficult to unload due to rainfall.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/veggie-prices-to-soar-as-untimely-rain-destroys-crops/articleshow/82782552.cms||---

In a government resolution issued on Tuesday, the department has appointed a five-member committee headed by Madhav Kale, director planning and transport of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation, to recommend how the government can monetise its land and raise funds for its various projects. The committee has been mandated to prepare a policy for implementing projects on a build-operate-transfer basis on land owned by the department. The GR stated that if the department develops its dilapidated dairies and hospitals in urban areas on BOT basis, it would not only get upgraded infrastructure free of cost, but also raise funds for other projects. The decision has been taken following a meeting held by minister Sunil Kedar in February.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/proposal-to-monetise-land-hosps-in-aarey-in-mumbai/articleshow/82783997.cms||Clara Lewis

The officer, Vijay Deokar, has lodged a case with the Panchavati police station. The police have arrested the accused — Mrunal Ghodke, a 33-year-old resident of Dwarka — under IPC section 353 for obstructing a government officer from discharging his duties, and also under the sections of the Maharashtra Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss to Property) Act, 2010. The incident occurred at about 2 pm on Tuesday. As there were 50 people in each lot, the testing and vaccination (plus observation) took time and, hence, there was a delay. The accused started arguing with the staff. “We had allotted the time of 12.30 pm to the woman. But the process takes a while,” Deokar said. “The accused removed his mask and hurled abuses at the staff and me. We called up the police,” he added. Assistant police inspector UR Gawali, who is the investigation officer, said the accused also parked his vehicle at the entrance of the hospital blocking the stairs. He was asked to remove the vehicle. The suspect has been remanded in two-day police custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-medical-official-abused-at-vax-centre/articleshow/82776102.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan declares black fungus epidemic, doctors must notify cases||JAIPUR: Following the increase in the number of mucormycosis cases, also known as black fungus, the state government has notified it as an epidemic on Wednesday. Since it has emerged as a new health concern, doctors have been directed by the state government to inform them about patients suffering from mucormycosis at their clinics and hospitals. As of now, the health department has no concrete figure on the number of mucormycosis cases. Principal secretary (health) Akhil Arora said the number of mucormycosis cases has been constantly increasing. "It has come as a side-effect of Covid-19. So, it has been declared an epidemic under the Rajasthan Epidemic Act 2020. Also, it has been declared a notifiable disease," he said. The Sawai Man Singh Medical College had set up a separate OPD and ward to treat mucormycosis cases on Monday. In just three days, 58 patients with the infection have been admitted to the hospital. While on the first day, one ward was dedicated for such patients, after the cases increased, the hospital has increased the wards to three. It will provide more space for such patients as per requirement. “In just three days, we have performed 20 surgeries, which is known as surgical debridement for cleaning the affected part. The patients had complained of bilateral diminishing vision. Almost half of them have lost their vision of one eye due to mucormycosis. A task force of allied branches such as ENT, endocrinology, ophthalmology and experts of radiation, pathology and microbiology are taking care of mucormycosis from diagnosis to treatment and surgeries at the hospital,” said Dr Pawan Singhal, professor (ENT), SMS Medical College. Not only SMS Hospital, some private and other government hospitals have also started surgeries for cleaning the affected part due to mucormycosis. “We conducted an operation on a 52-year-old patient who had mucormycosis today. Yesterday, a woman in her 30s underwent the surgery,” said Dr S S Ranawat, superintendent, Jaipuria Hospital. Since Liposomal Amphotericin B, a drug effective in treating mucormycosis, is hardly available in the market, the doctors have no other option but to conduct surgeries to save the lives of patients. But even after surgery, the patient may still lose the vision of one or both eyes depending on the extent of infection. Recently, health minister Raghu Sharma said that they had only 700 vials of Liposomal Amphotericin B. He said he had spoken to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and demanded 50,000 vials of the medicine. Besides, he said that they were in touch with eight pharma companies to purchase the drug. Also, they were in the process of purchasing 2,500 vials from the Serum Institute of India (SII).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-declares-black-fungus-epidemic-docs-must-notify-cases/articleshow/82782575.cms||---
---||Pune||O2 from Spain costly, state sticks to local sources||Pune: Maharashtra has decided to bank on its local sources for oxygen and not to get supply from Spain, as it found the rates quoted by the European country in response to the government’s global tender too high. The state had floated global tenders for oxygen, remdesivir and vaccines in anticipation of a third wave of the pandemic. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte had written to the Centre for allocation of an additional 200 tonnes of oxygen supply in the first week of May. “We have received about 500 tonnes of oxygen from various local sources after we had sent the letter to the centre,” Kunte told TOI on Wednesday. Kunte, who also heads the committee for assessing the global tenders, said in terms of oxygen supply, the quotation from Spain was high. “The country was charging Rs49 for a cubic metre of oxygen. Besides, there are transportation charges. But locally it is available for Rs15.22 paise. With the additional transportation charges, the rate goes up to Rs24. This is more viable. Moreover, France supplied 100 tonnes of oxygen as a goodwill gesture. This boosted supply for the state,” he said In the beginning of May, Kunte had in his letter to cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba ]sought allocation of an additional 200 tonnes of oxygen. He had also requested the Centre to allocate 10 liquid medical oxygen tankers to help the state procure its allocated quota from the steel plant at Angul in Odisha via the Roll On-Roll Off Oxygen Express. He had also sought enhanced allocation from Jamnagar in Gujarat, from the current 125 tonnes a day to 225 tonnes a day. Similarly, the state pitched for an increase in allocation from Bhilai to 230 tonnes from 130 tonnes. Maharashtra is also set to boost its oxygen production capacity to 3,000 tonnes from 1,250 tonnes through additional oxygen generation plants and pressure swing absorption plants. “This should be done in two to three months,’’said Kunte. In response to the global tender for remdesivir, the chief secretary said Maharashtra has received response from six countries and they were told to take import license to supply to the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/o2-from-spain-costly-state-sticks-to-local-sources/articleshow/82782567.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Nagpur||NTCA seeks status report on deer relocation in TATR||Nagpur: In a setback to state wildlife department, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) on Wednesday sought a status report on a project involving translocation of 100 deer from Jamni in Tadoba range to Botezari in Kolsa under Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) to augment prey base. NTCA AIG Hemant Kamdi said, “The report has been sought from PCCF (wildlife). The inquiry will be done only if a need is felt otherwise the PCCF report will be submitted to the NTCA headquarters in Delhi.” On April 26 & 28, 2021, TOI reported the relocation project from within the tiger reserve. The project had invited sharp criticism from wildlife conservationists demanding immediate stop of this “unwarranted experiment”. Taking cognizance of the TOI reports, Prakruti Foundation of Chandrapur president Deepak Dixit lodged a complaint with the NTCA, demanding cancellation of the project. The permission for the project is valid till August 31, 2021. Taking note of the complaint, NTCA deputy inspector general Rajendra Garawad has written to the chief wildlife warden seeking a factual status report. Dixit in his complaint asked about the status of deer that were already present in large numbers in the Botezari meadows. “Last summer, unsuccessful attempts were made by the TATR officials to translocate 50 deers in which the animals suffered heavy casualties. Lakhs of rupees went waste on the project and the outcome was zero. What happened to those deers?” he asked. “Now again the same project is being implemented without any scientific basis. Without a scientific study, how can you say deer needs to be shifted as there is no prey base in Botezari?” asked former Gadchiroli honorary wildlife warden Uday Patel. “There were hundreds of deer in the Botezari meadows a few years ago. Where are they now? It means villagers in the area are involved in poaching and there is no point in shifting deer without addressing this issue. Efforts should be made to expedite the relocation of villages instead of translocation,” Patel said. Conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar said, “Amazingly, the capture area of Jamni is famous for tigers, leopards and other carnivores which have spotted deer as main prey. The current population of deer in Jamni is not an ecological burden or risk to the habitat. Then why a need has been felt to remove these deer from their habitat?”. He further said, “Research theory regarding animal life cycle and their existence is always not as per the thumb rules. The home range theory has always been changed due to many biotic factors. For example, the chital population in Koradi thermal power station had to migrate to Nara forest depot towards Nagpur due to the construction of a new mega power plant. Even Nagzira-Navegaon corridor has same migration features.” On the contrary, TATR conservator (CF) & field director Jitendra Ramgaonkar said, “The project will not be cancelled but get delayed because of other reasons like Covid-19 and staff availability. We will take a call based on logistics and not because of any unsubstantiated opinions of so-called experts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ntca-seeks-status-report-on-deer-relocation-in-tatr/articleshow/82780561.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The duo started with 500 oxygen concentrators, but said more would be procured to help needy patients in other parts of the state.  “Our first lot of 500 oxygen concentrators have reached Mumbai. Covid positive patients who need these oxygen concentrators for an emergency situation can call us on 84518699785,” tweeted Zeeshan. He said a lot of people began enquiring soon after Bollywood actor Salman Khan retweeted it. Zeeshan added that his volunteers will reach out to the needy people as soon as they receive requests for the concentrators. The Siddiquis have reached out to 1,25,000 families with ration kits since the first lockdown in March 2020. “These concentrators are absolutely free. Once a patient has utilized it, we will have the concentrator collected and give to another needy patient after properly sanitising it,” said senior Siddiqui. Mumbai Congress Vice-Chairman (Minority Department) Haji Mudassar Patel, who has seen the Siddiquis work tirelessly during the pandemic, said oxygen concentrators are the need of the hour and more Samaritans should come forward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-mla-dad-give-free-o2-concentrators-to-needy/articleshow/82782659.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

He also appealed to the people to call on 1098, the Childline toll-free number, to seek help in cases required. “It is unfortunate that there are children who have lost both of their parents to the infection. The government and the administration will provide all the help through its schemes,” said Mandhare. The collector conducted the meeting of the women and child welfare department on Wednesday and announced the formation of a taskforce to ensure the security of the children, who have lost both the parents to the infection. “We are facing tough times amid the Covid situation. It is our collective responsibility to take care of such children,” said Mandhare. A girl, who lost both of her parents, has already been admitted to Shishu Griha, which is for children less than six years of age, he said.  The officer also pointed out that children from six years to 18 years of age will be admitted to Bal Griha and those who fall in the age group of 18 to 23 years (extended from 21 years during the time of Covid outbreak) will be admitted to Anurakshan Griha. The government offices and non-governmental organisations are working together for the well being of these children. The women and child department officials said there was no other way of adopting a child. “Many messages are going viral about some incentives being given by the government for registering to adopt the children. This is unfair and nobody should believe it. The adoption has to be a legal process, which will happen through the government office only,” said Yogiraj Jadhav, the probationary officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/govt-to-take-care-of-kids-orphaned-due-to-covid/articleshow/82776184.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Jaipur||Rain pounds southern dists, get prepared for more today||Jaipur: Cyclone Tauktae triggered heavy rainfall in southern districts of Rajasthan in the last 24 hours while it is expected to weaken in the next 12 hours, Met officials said on Wednesday.The cyclonic storm entered southern Rajasthan late on Tuesday night causing heavy rain in the region and it was centred 60km southwest of Udaipur on Wednesday morning, a spokesperson of the regional meteorological department said.In the next 12 hours, the cyclone is expected to weaken and turn into a low pressure area and move to northeast Rajasthan, he said.Anand Kumar, principal secretary, disaster management and relief, said, “No loss of life or property was reported due to the cyclone in the state.”“Tauktae lay centred at 0830 hours IST on May 19, near latitude 24.9°N and longitude 73.7°E over southeast Rajasthan, about 30km south-southwest of Udaipur. It is very likely to move northeastwards and weaken gradually into a well-marked low pressure area during the next 12 hours. The remnant of the system is very likely to move further northeastwards across Rajasthan to Uttar Pradesh during the next two days.”Similarly, a western disturbance lies as a cyclonic circulation over Jammu and Kashmir between 3.1 & 3.6km above mean sea level with trough aloft at 5.8km above mean sea level roughly along longitude 70°E to the north of latitude 27°N.Tauktae would interact with the above western disturbance. In addition, high moisture feeding from Arabian Sea is also likely over northwest India resulting in fairly widespread to widespread rainfall activity.The cyclone caused ‘heavy to very heavy’ rainfall at some places in the southern districts of the state in the last 24 hours, as per the Met department.Veja of Dungarpur recorded 232mm rainfall, Kanwa received 144mm rainfall, Deval 142mm, Dungarpur tehsil 139mm and 133mm rainfall was recorded in Dhambola. According to the Met department, light to moderate rain is expected in Ajmer, Jaipur and some districts of Bharatpur division in next 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rain-pounds-southern-dists-get-prepared-for-more-today/articleshow/82782585.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||‘Collapsing trees weakened by uncaring civic work’||Ahmedabad: The cyclone has spelt havoc on big trees in the city drawing public attention to the large number of trees uprooted, but experts say Ahmedabad has been losing its trees and green cover every year to uncaring civic work and construction. The root structures of large shade-giving trees that anchor them to the earth are weakened continually by remorseless digging for utilities and wall-to-wall hard carpeting. Trees which gave shade for half a century or more get uprooted in minutes as the strengths of their bases keep being eroded by civic work. Experts stress that the civic body has poor and inefficient planning and focus in managing and maintaining trees. There is lack of urban policy in Ahmedabad to enforce mandatory distance from trees while engaging in construction work or digging for utility lines, including storm-water drainage or water lines. At least 2 feet space from the trunk of a tree needs to be left undisturbed by any type of construction work, say experts. On top of the digging and carpeting, poor soil curing and compaction after digging of roads also leads to cave-ins and weakening of tree roots. An expert said that the National Green Tribunal has specified in its guidelines that there should be at least a distance of 3 feet between the base of a tree and any concrete construction. In 2013, the NGT had directed Delhi’s civic agencies to leave space of one metre radius from the bases of trees undisturbed, and directed a fine of Rs 10,000 imposed in case of each violation. However, the NGT’s guideline is not followed by civic authorities here, and trees are smothered by wall-to-wall carpeting. A senior civic body official said that trees need to be pruned and trimmed regularly to ensure the weight of the crown doesn’t exceed the load-bearing capacity of the root structure, but this is not done and so trees in the city get uprooted every monsoon. Ahmedabad has a high number of trees with big crowns, and with already weakened root structures due to poor civic work, they collapse even under winds blowing at 40-50kmph speed. A former forest department officer, who had worked in social forestry said the laying of storm-water lines was done too close to roots without any buttress work to support the trees and thus they get uprooted easily in heavy winds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/collapsing-trees-weakened-by-uncaring-civic-work/articleshow/82782637.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Freeing imports has made pulses cheaper, traders complain||Nagpur: The government’s move to free import of pulses like tur, moong and urad last week has led to a quick impact on the rates. Prices of raw pulses as well as dal (processed into edible form) have come down by as much as 10%. However, it may be too early for the general consumers to benefit, because the commodities have got cheaper only in the wholesale markets. It may take at least a week for the lower rates to be passed on by the retail traders. The move has also left farmers, who are still left with the produce due to Covid restrictions, worried, as they may get a lower price now. Tur dal, which quickly makes headlines due to its rates, was priced in the range of Rs92 to Rs106 a kg in the wholesale market. The retailers add a margin of Rs5 to Rs10. The wholesale rates now have come down to Rs88 to Rs92 a kg. The wholesale rates for urad dal are now down to Rs86 to Rs100 a kg as against Rs90 to Rs110. moong dal is also down by a couple of rupees at Rs86 to Rs103 a kg. The order issued on May 15 says import policy for tur, urad and moong has been changed with immediate effect. The status will continue till October 31, 2021. The move has caught the local traders surprised as farm activists say it would also affect the farmers, who are already in losses due to Covid. Pratap Motwani, secretary of Grain and Seeds Merchants Association, said the move was abrupt and will only leave local traders in losses. “The decision will benefit big importers, but only at the cost of small traders who operate in local markets. The traders are sitting on stocks purchased at high rates and freeing imports has brought down the prices,” he said. Farm activist Vijay Jawandhia said farmers have not been able to sell their entire stock of pulses due to the Covid curbs. The fall in prices will affect their profits when they sell the produce. Sudhir Kothari, director of an agriculture produce marketing committee (APMC) at Hinganghat, said raw tur was ruling at Rs7,200 a quintal when markets were open. Now as there are plans to open the market on Thursday, a fall of Rs400 is expected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/freeing-imports-has-made-pulses-cheaper-traders-complain/articleshow/82780605.cms||Shishir Arya

However, marine biologists and conservators have informed that a few nesting sites of this specie have been protected by the conservators at the Konkan coast, where they are waiting for the eggs to hatch soon. Environmentalists added that when compared to the eastern coast of Odisha, where over 1.48 crore baby Olive Ridley turtles had successfully hatched recently, the natural cyclonic calamity along the west coast is only a minor loss. Talking to TOI, the additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell) Virendra Tiwari said, “The intense rainfall due to Cyclone Tauktae did damage Olive Ridley turtle eggs at some of the nesting sites looked after by the Mangrove Foundation in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts. However, the updates I am getting is that some of these sites have been protected and we are hopeful of the eggs hatching soon.” Marine biologist of Mangrove Foundation, Harshal Karve, said, “As many as 2,000 turtle eggs in the 29 monitored nesting sites in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg were damaged.” Officials said the number of nesting sites of Olive Ridley turtles was higher (over 450) this year along the Konkan coast but the cyclone spoilt the situation just days before the eggs could hatch. “ But it is good to note that more number of nesting sites have appeared in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg over the years, which indicates a healthy biodiversity,” said environmentalist D Stalin of Vanashakti NGO. Incidentally, the two dolphins which had stranded near Alibaug coast during the cyclone were safely directed towards the Arabian Sea by forest officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-2000-olive-ridley-turtle-eggs-destroyed/articleshow/82784206.cms||Vijay Singh

Even on May 1, the positivity rate was 24%. The strict restrictions announced by the state government restricting the movement of the people since then has helped improve the rate of infection. “The fact that the positivity rate has come down to about 8% is major relief to the administration, the health departments and even patients. They can now easily find hospital beds, even oxygen beds,” Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare said. “The number of daily fresh cases in the district had dropped to 1,073 on May 18 — a drastic fall from 3,412 on May 1. This is not just ensuring that the patients are treated better, but the rate of recovery is also on the rise,” civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat said. As per the data provided by the district administration, the number of people affected by the infection in the past fortnight was 64,983. Of them, 627 died and 45,863 were discharged. There are 18,493 active cases now. Between April 18 and May 1, the total number of infections across the district stood at 1,02,262. As many as 600 patients had succumbed, 63,576 were discharged and 38,086 remained under treatment. “The case fatality rate, however, was slightly higher then given that many serious cases during the later half of April were presented in the beginning of May. The situation is better today when the number of people being discharged is increasing and the serious cases are on the decline,” said Anant Pawar, the resident medical officer at the civil hospital. The curve has been declining.

Mohammed Ahmed, TDP, minority vice-president, said he has registered complaints online and on Twitter, but the problem persists. “Many complaints have been made to the officials concerned, but to no avail. If the trend continues, it may have serious consequences for patients who are dependant on artificial oxygen supply. I request the higher authorities of TSSPDCL to take a serious note of the issue,” said Mohammed Ahmed. A power officials told TOI that the complaints have been noted, and the problems were being solved. “Due to overloading, heavy rains or maintenance work, power supply might be disrupted.

The division bench of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Satish Kumar Sharma gave the direction on a PIL filed by lawyer Vijay Pathak on unused ventilators in the state provided under the PM Cares fund. The petitioner said that last year, ventilators were provided to every district headquarter and subdivision headquarter using the Prime Minister's Cares Fund. But these have neither been installed nor training imparted to health professionals on how to operate them. In Karauli district and Hindaun subdivision headquarters, more than 150 people died over the past 25 days. Many of them could have been saved if the ventilators were operational, the petitioner alleged. Not only Karauli, the situation was similar across the state. Despite the availability of ventilators, they were not being used in the pandemic situation, he said. Advocate general M S Singhvi told the court that ventilators have been installed by the state government to the maximum extent possible. He said 18 out of 34 ventilators have been installed in Karauli district, while the government has taken up the the issue of rectifying technical defects with the remaining 16. While disposing of the petition, the bench directed the state government and the department of medical and health to ensure that all life-saving devices, including ventilators, are operational throughout the year and not just during the pandemic. The court also directed the government to frame a policy to maintain these ventilators and life-saving devices and keep them functional throughout the year for the benefit of patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ensure-life-saving-devices-arefunctional-around-yr-raj-hc/articleshow/82782648.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae: 26 bodies found in sea, 49 still missing||MUMBAI: Bodies of 26 personnel on board Barge Papaa (P-305) that sunk amid the fury unleashed by cyclone Tauktae were recovered from the Arabian Sea by Indian Navy warships engaged in search and rescue operations through Tuesday and Wednesday. The bodies were found floating 50-60 nautical miles ( 90+km) off the Mumbai coast. 49 crew members are still missing, while 186 were rescued. A total of 273 personnel were earlier said to have been on board, but the ONGC, which had deployed the barge, revised the count to 261 on Wednesday. The search operations for the missing 49 will continue, officials said. Five Navy ships—INS Kochi, Kolkata, Beas, Betwa and Teg—P8I maritime surveillance aircraft, and Chetak and Sea King helicopters have been engaged in the search at sea which began on Monday, with 1,500-plus personnel pressed into service. The Navy said they were still hopeful of finding survivors. The operation began after four vessels—two barges off the city’s coast and a barge and drill vessel off Gujarat’s Pipavav port—went adrift. A total of 638 people had been rescued by Tuesday evening. Navy officials said INS Kochi reached Mumbai harbour on Wednesday with four bodies and 125 survivors before sailing back to join the rescue effort. INS Kolkata was to enter Mumbai harbour late Wednesday night to disembark the other survivors and bring back bodies of other victims. 11 people on another tug may have drowned, say 2 pulled out by NavyThe four bodies brought back—of crew members Nilesh, Jamish Joseph, Amol Raj and Vishal Kardhare from Ratnagiri—were taken to JJ hospital for a panchanama. Yellow Gate police registered an accidental death report, said senior inspector Suhas Hemade. Inspector Dinesh Sawant said the deaths were due to drowning and added that police had sought details from the barge company (Afcons, belonging to the Shapoorji Pallonji group) of the deceased to inform their family members. Commander Mehul Karnik, chief PRO, defence, told TOI, “Apart from the five warships, INS Talwar has also been diverted for the SAR (search and rescue) operations. There are nine aircraft and helicopters at the spot that will continue the SAR till all members of the crew are located and rescued.” All the four vessels that were stranded in the sea on Monday were engaged in ONGC’s revamp of its unmanned offshore platforms off Bombay High in collaboration with a Afcons-led consortium. Apart from the personnel on P-305, there were 137 personnel on board the barge GAL Constructor that ran aground off Colaba coast, 220 on board barge Support Station-3 which drifted north-west off Pipavav port and 101 (including 38 ONGC employees) on board the ONC-owned drill vessel Drillship Sagar Bhushan which too went adrift off Pipavav. All the personnel on these other three vessels were rescued on Tuesday and were brought back on shore, officials said. Two survivors of a tug, Varpradha, were also rescued by the Navy. A source in the Navy said that while INS Kolkata was conducting its search for P305 personnel, they found two survivors from the tug in the sea and rescued them. “The two survivors told us there were 13 people in the tug. They said the 11 others might have drowned. The two were able to climb on to the life raft,” sources said. TOI spoke to some survivors from P-305 who said they had a horrendous time in the sea waters and seriously doubted whether they would survive. One crew member said, “Some of the personnel had spoken to their families before the barge sunk, and the families must have spent a harrowing time thinking about their kin stranded in the waters and prayed for their safety. We spent hours floating in the rough sea with gusty wind and bad weather. We are praying for the safety of those still missing.” However, the crew member added, “Looking at the weather conditions in the sea and the salinity of the water, it is going to be not easy to survive for 50 hours.” Afcons said in a statement, “We are anguished and deeply distraught by the loss of lives and share in the grief of the bereaving friends and family members. Our immediate focus is to locate and rescue the remaining missing personnel as quickly as possible. The safety and wellbeing of our people are our topmost priority, and we’re doing everything possible to address this unprecedented crisis. We know nothing can ever compensate for the loss of a loved one, but we will extend our fullest support including financial assistance to the bereaved families in this hour of their need.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/26-bodies-found-in-sea-49-still-missing/articleshow/82784139.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand to convert 300 Ayush hospitals into 24X7 Covid care units||Dehradun: To bolster its healthcare facilities, the Uttarakhand government has decided to convert 300 Ayurveda hospitals in the state into 24X7 Covid-19 care facilities. It has also been decided that Uttarakhand Purv Sainik Kalyan Nigam Limited (UPNL) will fill the vacant contractual doctor posts in these facilities by recruiting eligible ex-Armymen (or their wards with relevant degrees). The move, according to officials, will help the state in containing the spread of Covid-19 in rural areas of hill districts. According to the health department data, the sample positivity rate of five hill districts in Uttarakhand has been recorded at over 20% in the past week. These districts are – Pauri (28.31%), Tehri (24.95%). Pithoragarh (22.84%), Rudraprayag (22.69%) and Almora (21.03%). Speaking on the issue, Uttarakhand Ayush minister Harak Singh Rawat said, “It is not easy to set up hospitals at the drop of a hat and therefore, we have decided to convert our existing Ayush hospitals into advanced Covid care facilities. At present, we have around 550 Ayurveda hospitals in Uttarakhand. Among them, 300 facilities have their own buildings. Thus, we have decided to convert these into fully functional 24x7 10-bedded Covid care centres. Five among the total 10 beds in a centre will have oxygen support.” Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat has directed officials to ensure that each of these Covid care centres have at least two doctors, pharmacists, ward boys and nurses. More people are likely to be recruited to operate the oxygen-supported beds in these Covid care facilities. “These centres will be activated at an estimated cost of Rs 5-10 lakh and till the time the UPNL recruits contractual doctors for these facilities, Ayurvedic doctors will be deployed at the centres. They will be paid Rs 40,000 per month,” added Harak Singh Rawat. In another significant development on Wednesday, the Ayush department inaugurated an Ayurveda centre with four-oxygen-bed capacity in Dehradun's Shahstradhara. The Uttarakhand government also announced free treatment for public employees earning less than Rs 21,000 per month and daily wagers in government and private medical facilities under the Employee State Insurance (ESI) scheme. The step, say officials, will benefit at least 30 lakh families in Uttarakhand. Earlier on Monday, Harak Singh Rawat had become teary-eyed while launching the Ayush Rath scheme aimed at the distribution of free immunity booster kits. He said, “The (healthcare) condition in the remote areas is pathetic. At least 60-70 of my acquaintances have lost their lives to Covid-19.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-to-convert-300-ayush-hospitals-into-24x7-covid-care-units/articleshow/82778333.cms||Shivani Azad

Dr Arun Joshi from the hospital said that the man, a resident of Sitarganj, had been brought to the hospital on Tuesday. “The patient was Covid positive and also had symptoms of black fungus. His culture report is yet to arrive so we cannot say for sure if his was a confirmed case of mucormycosis,” he added. So far, Uttarakhand has recorded 46 cases of black fungus, most of them (42) were detected at AIIMS Rishikesh. Meanwhile, Sushila Tiwari is left with low stocks of Amphotericin B, the drug used for black fungus treatment. The hospital admitted another patient with black fungus symptoms on Tuesday. “Government has assured us to send stocks of Amphotericin B by Friday,” an official from the hospital, who did not wish to be named, said. Meanwhile, 12 new cases of black fungus were reported at AIIMS Rishikesh in the last 24 hours.

Notably, Mansera’s appointment had raised a few eyebrows as he had been critical of the BJP government at the Centre during his stint at a television news channel where he covered the Kumaon region. Meanwhile, the senior journalist took to Facebook on Wednesday and wrote that the appointment was based on his journalistic experience and performance which he said, “did not go down well with some people" who did not even know him. He further said — “I decline to accept the post” — while pointing out that he didn't want to be surrounded by people who wouldn't let him work. He added that the decision of CM Tirath Singh Rawat was questioned even as "I was named for the post on the basis of my experience in journalism, talent and good work done for the people.” Besides being a scribe, Mansera has also been a prominent social activist in the Nainital district. Mansera, along with his team, runs a Thaal Seva drive near Dr Susheela Tiwari Hospital in Haldwani. Under the drive, quality food is provided to people for just Rs 5. Mansera and his team prepare food for around 1,000-to-1,200 people every day.

---||Delhi||Actor Huma Qureshi gives Covid care plan fresh breath of life||NEW DELHI: Actor Huma Qureshi, in collaboration with Save the Children Foundation, donated 70 oxygen concentrators to a South Delhi Municipal Corporation hospital in west Delhi’s Tilak Nagar where the plan is to set up a 100-bed Covid treatment facility with all essential amenities that would focus on women and children. The actor, who is a Delhi native, was shocked by the problems faced by citizens when the Covid resurgence hit the city. Pragya Vats, head of campaigns at Save the Children, said the organisation had received 700 oxygen concentrators from the its branches in member countries. These were dispatched to 11 locations in India. “We received 70 of these in Delhi on Wednesday and we gave them to the SDMC hospital. We find that women and children are often ignored in Covid care, so the hospital has promised that they will start a special unit for women and for newborn children,” said Vats. “It is an established hospital, but we are amping it up to serve as a special care unit. Since the hospital had beds but no oxygen concentrators, we started a fundraiser in which Huma Qureshi joined us.” Vats claimed that Qureshi’s presence helped the NGO crossed the halfway mark of the required funds. She said, “Huma has been associated with Save the Children US for many years. When the second wave hit Delhi, she was pained by what was happening and she wanted to do something tangible. She wanted to give back to her home city. We have been planning for nearly a month about what to do in the capital. It was Huma who suggested the step we should take.” Vats added that the organisation planned to assist other hospitals and also equip hospitals for women and children. Tweeting about the campaign on Wednesday, Huma Qureshi posted, “Days of hard work finally bore fruit. We would like to share with you the location of the 100-bed hospital — Tilak Nagar. Through tie-ups between our individual donors, corporates and government we will pool in our collective resources to run this facility. Truly a #citizenscollective.” The actor further tweeted, “At Tilak Nagar, we will establish a Covid care unit including a children’s ward, a paediatric ICU & a neonatal ICU. Today was a small step in this direction.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/actor-gives-covid-care-plan-fresh-breath-of-life/articleshow/82813142.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

---||Kolkata||After e-pass glitch, Kolkata cop nod for commute with genuine reasons||KOLKATA: Faced with criticism over difficulties in obtaining e-passes to commute during the Covid-induced restrictions, the police top brass have asked traffic cops to ensure that those out for genuine reasons and those in emergency were not prosecuted.  The advisory came on a day police seized 324 vehicles till 8pm on Wednesday. Officers at Lalbazar asked the men on duty on the roads to allow everyone with valid documents and ID cards and not demand e-passes, virtually acknowledging the problems that made obtaining the formal police e-permission rather difficult. Among those exempted from the travel ban during the restrictions were medical staff, bank employees, media personnel and other essential service providers, such as those working for electric supply and KMC water supply. All of them were required to carry the ID card issued by their organisations, an officer said. Lalbazar has also decided to issue special permission for Covid work volunteers. “We have asked our men to go through the state orders rigorously and make note of those who are allowed to travel with their ID cards. We would like to state that all persons out for essential work, including going for vaccination, will not need the e-pass if they have valid documents. The e-pass will be necessary for vendors and grocers who transport perishables and essential goods and do not have a valid ID card issued by any authority, citing the work they do,” said an officer. Among those who complained about harassment was Urmimala, who said her e-pass application was rejected despite her father requiring dialysis thrice a week. Police said medical bills and prescriptions would be enough for her to make the trip. Unlike last year, e-passes are meant only for vehicles this year. “Those cycling or walking to work will not need an e-pass. They will just need documentary proof. Most of the vehicles that are being seized are two-wheelers. They are not on the e-pass list but those in the exempted category can use two-wheelers,” said DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha. The most common excuse, an officer said, that two-wheeler owners cited was they were out on medical grounds. When questioned, police found out they resided in another part of the city and had nothing to prove any emergency. Those people were prosecuted, police said. For Covid volunteers, Lalbazar is issuing special permission. “We are issuing vehicle e-passes for them. Volunteers need to contact us with documents at Lalbazar,” said Sinha. Those who were unable to procure the e-pass could produce patients’ prescriptions or show the medicines or food they were carrying, with their vehicular documents, to be let through, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-e-pass-glitch-cop-nod-for-commute-with-genuine-reasons/articleshow/82780675.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Soil from Kargil heights brings solace to martyrs’ kin||CHANDIGARH: Most parents of the Kargil War martyrs’ have made it to the Drass War Memorial for the annual Vijay Divas function. Some like Capt Keishing Clifford Nongrum (MVC) and father of Capt Vijayant Thapar (VrC) even made it to the towering peaks where their sons’ blood had seeped into the eternal snow and soil. But for the parents of the tortured and mutilated Lt Saurabh Kalia, 4 JAT, it is an urn of soil from the forbidding peak where their son laid down his life that must suffice as a symbol of solace and remembrance. The Kalias of Palampur in Himachal Pradesh have not been able to make it to the Drass function all these 22 years since the Army scripted a peerless chapter of high-altitude warfare. “Neither my parents nor myself have been able to go despite invitations from the Army every year. So, we put in a request through the JAT Regiment to the Army that if some soil from Bajrang Post (17,386 feet), Kaksar LOC sector, can be sent to us. A battalion of the Dogra Regiment was deployed at Kaksar much after the War and they obliged us with a bottle of the soil,” said Lt Saurabh’s brother, Vaibhav. Lt Saurabh’s parents, N K Kalia and Vijaya, have in turn shared a part of the soil from Bajrang post with Sunita Dhonkaria, sister of Capt Amit Bhardwaj, the gallant officer who led a fighting patrol of 30 men to locate the missing Lt Saurabh and the five men of his surveillance patrol. Capt Bhardwaj and his buddy Hav Rajivir Singh from Bhiwani, Haryana, laid down their lives near Bajrang post on May 17, 1999, while ensuring that the rest of the fighting patrol, including eight wounded soldiers, could evacuate to safety. The legendary camaraderie of regimental officers that ensures they embrace battle and death without flinching followed them much after their pyres had cooled. At the Kalias’ Saurabh Smriti Kaksh (museum of mementos) in Palampur, photo of Capt Bhardwaj occupies the pride of place along with that of their son, both commissioned into the 4 JAT. Due to the efforts of Vikas Manhas, who has done remarkable work to provide relief to the martyrs’ families, we recently met sister of Capt Bhardwaj and shared a part of the soil with her as Capt Bhardwaj had selflessly undertaken the mission to rescue Saurabh, but laid down his life in the process,” said Vaibhav, who is a faculty member at the CSK HP Agriculture University, Palampur. A grateful Sunita, who waged many a battle against the “system” to secure the honour and endowments due to her late brother, took the soil back to her parental home in Jaipur. “Though our traditions forbid it, we have also retained a part of Amit’s ashes in an urn. The soil from Bajrang post added to that. My mother, Sushila, looks after the urns containing the ashes and the Bajrang post soil every day as if she was taking care of her child. As far as I am concerned, I do not believe Amit has ever left us. I refuse to garland his photograph in my lobby as per the traditions for the dead because I firmly believe he lives amongst us in our hearts and souls,” Sunita told the TOI from Jaipur. The capture of Lt Saurabh’s patrol on May 14, 1999, near Bajrang post, subsequent torture and mutilation of their bodies attracted global condemnation. Pakistan had returned the six bodies of Lt Saurabh’s patrol on June 9, 1999, 26 days after it went missing. Capt Bhardwaj and Hav Rajvir’s bodies could only be retrieved on July 13, 1999, 56 days after they laid down their lives at Bajrang. The 4 JAT troops could see the bodies lying between the boulders and weapons firmly clutched in hand, but could not retrieve them due to intense fire from the intruding enemy, which had occupied the Indian Army’s Bajrang post. Here lies a tale of a heroic and stoic sister. “I was told by an Army officer soon after that Amit had died on May 17, 1999. But I chose not to tell my parents as the body could not be retrieved. It would have generated pressure on the Army to retrieve his body at the cost of the troops, who were battling intense enemy fire and shelling and could not move towards Bajrang. So, I bore it quietly and ensured that for 56 agonising days I revealed no sign to our parents that he is no more. When his body came on July15, 1999, we opted not to see it as it was blackened by prolonged exposure to high-altitude and it would have forever marred our happy memories of him,” said Sunita.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/soil-from-kargil-heights-brings-solace-to-martyrs-kin/articleshow/82782702.cms||Vikram Jit Singh

Nanded, Nandurbar, Bhandara, Hingoli and Chandrapur have registered a three- to six-fold jump in their weekly CFR in the past one month. The state, too, has seen a near doubling of the weekly CFR—from 1.1% between April 21 to 27 to 2.2% in May 12-May 18. Nanded has seen one of the steepest rises in CFR. From 3.8% on April 21-27, it has seen a near three-fold jump to 9.2%. Similarly, Chandrapur has seen a sharp rise from less than 1% CFR to nearly 5% in the past one month. Nandurbar’s CFR has jumped from 1.7% to almost 8% in the week that ended May 18, while the death rate of Hingoli has risen from 1.5% to 5.4%. Nandurbar civil surgeon Dr Raghunath Bhoye said deaths now have declined to single digits. He said the district on Wednesday recorded three deaths and 69 cases. “During the April peak, we used to have 10-12 confirmed deaths daily. Now, the active cases have reduced and so have new detections. So, even a handful of deaths is increasing the CFR,” he said, adding they are now seeing deaths in people who got hospitalised towards the beginning of May. Bhandara district health officer Dr Prashant Uikey concurred, saying the district was recording 80-100 cases now from a high of 1,700 in a day. “From 17-18 deaths daily in April, we are now seeing one, two or nil on some days.” Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said some of the districts are seeing a rise in fatality rates since their new case detections have gone down. “The deaths seen now are of admissions that had happened two to three weeks ago. Since new cases have reduced in many of these districts, the denominator against which deaths are calculated has declined too, pushing up the death rates,” he said. He, though, added deaths are still reviewed in these districts so that CFR can be brought down further. On Monday and Tuesday, the state added 2,291 deaths, of which 1,096 were from previous weeks. Reconciliation could also be increasing the death rate, said a district official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-weekly-fatality-rate-jumps-in-5-districts-nanded-rise-steepest/articleshow/82778425.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Delhi||Jaypee: Vote on Suraksha offer next wk||New Delhi: Sudhir Valia-promoted Suraksha has emerged as the sole bidder “compliant” to take over beleaguered Jaypee Infratech, with its resolution plan to be put to vote next week. Voting is due to open on Monday and close on Thursday. Subsequently, the committee of creditors (CoC) will meet before the case heads back to the Supreme Court. On Thursday, after discussing Suraksha and state-owned NBCC’s proposals, the CoC of Jaypee Infratech, comprising lenders and homebuyers, settled on Suraksha amid differing legal opinion about the public sector company’s offer. While NBCC had suggested that its offer was compliant under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, for which it had taken an opinion from a former Supreme Court judge, a diametrically opposite view was presented by homebuyers, a source familiar with the deliberations told TOI. The CoC concluded that NBCC’s offer was non-compliant as it did not provide sufficient funds or security to cover the entire demand of dissenting creditors. This was the third time that Suraksha and NBCC were engaged in a direct contest to take over Jaypee Infratech, which is yet to deliver 20,000 apartments, villas and plots to homebuyers who booked as far back as 2008-09. In addition to the real estate projects, the company has large land tracts along the Noida-Greater Noida and Taj expressways, as well as Jaypee Hospital. Although the case was among the first dozen “top priority” ones to be sent for insolvency action by the Reserve Bank of India and the government, it has been a laggard, with multiple cases delaying a decision. In the past too, Suraksha has emerged as the preferred bidder before being displaced by NBCC. But this time, it is different as the PSU construction company’s offer has been adjudged to be non-compliant by the CoC. Suraksha has offered to hand over all apartments and villas in 42 months with a penalty of Rs 5 per square feet in case of delay of over 12 months. Besides, it is offering a discount on maintenance charges and has proposed to arrange for working capital of Rs 3,000 crore. Unlike earlier rounds, when homebuyers were more comfortable with a public sector player, this time they are more open to Suraksha, although the outcome will only be known next week when they submit their vote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jaypee-vote-on-suraksha-offer-next-wk/articleshow/82813174.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Neeri’s Covid-19 testing through gargling samples gets ICMR nod||NAGPUR: Collecting samples for Covid-19 testing through nasal and throat swabs can soon be done away as the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) has come up with a path-breaking innovation. The new technique of collecting samples through gargling and then testing it under RT-PCR is a world first. It has got approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Under the new technique, no RNA extraction is necessary as is the case with existing testing of samples. Even though the RT-PCR procedure remains the same, potentially the suspected patient can get the test result faster. Krishna Khairnar, the scientist who brought about this innovation, informed that this is a simpler and faster technique for RT-PCR testing. “We have been working on this technique since almost a month. Gargling is one of the commonly used methods to tackle upper respiratory infection. We thought why not use the same method to trap the virus,” he said. Khairnar is a scientist and head at environmental virology cell at Neeri. The technique is completely non-invasive which eliminates the need of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, and finally a viral transport medium. “A person coming for the test will be given a wide-mouth conical tube with 5 millilitres of sterile saline in it. He has to gargle the saline for 15 seconds and then rinse for another 15 seconds. After this, he has to put the liquid back in the tube and shut the lid properly,” said Khairnar. The RNA extraction process is costly and hence it made the overall test cost higher. The gargling method is expected to make the RT-PCR test “significantly cost-effective”. Neeri has prepared a special buffer medium in which the collected sample is mixed. “After this, the sample is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and then heated for six minutes at 98 degree Celsius. This gives a reasonably good RNA template for direct RT-PCR,” said Khairnar. Compared to the existing method in use for RT-PCR collection, this technique is faster and equally effective. “Trained healthcare professionals are not needed for sample collection. It is a very patient-friendly technique which aims at minimising long queues at testing centres. Apart from this, waste generation during sample collection is also reduced,” said Khairnar. As per various predictions, a third wave is expected to hit the country which will put children at more risk. “Taking samples of children through gargling method will prove to be much easier,” said Khairnar. As recently reported by TOI, Neeri has been a torch-bearer in conducting RT-PCR testing using the dry swab technique. The institute’s lab has been the fastest in the country in producing results. “Under the gargling technique, the time taken in laboratory procedures will nearly be the same as dry swab which is less than three hours. However, this technique will significantly reduce the overall time of collecting individual samples and then dispatching them to the lab,” said Khairnar. Neeri is in talks with the local administration regarding adopting the new technique. The process at testing centres*A wide-mouth conical tube with 5 millilitres of sterile saline is given. * Take the saline inside your mouth and gargle for 15 seconds. * Then, rinse for another 15 seconds. * Put the liquid back in the tube and close the lid properly. In the lab* Sample is mixed in a special buffer medium innovated by Neeri. * Sample is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. * Then, it is heated for six minutes at 98 degree Celsius. * A reasonably good RNA template for direct RT-PCR is ready. Benefits* Nasal, oral swabs and viral transport medium not required * Trained healthcare professionals not needed for sample collection * Non-invasive and patient-friendly sampling * Waste generation during sample collection minimized * Time-saving technique, long queues at collection centres can be reduced * Cost-effective method as RNA extraction kit not required * Results will be available faster Watch Covid-19: Neeri’s testing through gargling samples gets ICMR nod||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/neeris-covid-19-testing-through-gargling-samples-gets-icmr-nod/articleshow/82780743.cms||Manka Behl

The BJP legislator was surrounded by some of the residents who accused him of letting them down and not doing any developmental work. Karanwal reached Bhagtowali village in Jhabreda at 10:30am, when he was surrounded by a group of people. In a video that has surfaced on social media, a man can be seen saying to Karanwal, “You are no good. The respect you receive is because of your position. We are saying this on behalf of the entire village, the day you are voted out, you will be nothing.” The villagers in the video demand to know why a small drainage line in a lane, a long-standing demand, had not been met. In his defense, Karanwal called the incident “staged”. “One of my rival groups in Jhabreda planted the dissenters, looking to make political gains in the upcoming assembly elections. I am, meanwhile, visiting village after village in my constituency, not caring about the pandemic,” he said. Notably, Karanwal had tested positive for Covid-19 in September last year.

Bhagat allegedly had an altercation with the CMS over the 'delay' in making the blood bank functional at the medical facility. In response to the 'heated' remarks made by the minister, the CMS said that he is no criminal and should not be treated like one. After the episode, the doctors and the staff members of the hospital held a peaceful protest holding placards in their hands. The placards had slogans like — “Kehte Dharti Ka Bhagwan, Nahi Karta Koi Samman” (they call us Demigods but no one respects us), Mareej Ki Zindagi Doctor Ke Haath, Doctor Ki Zindagi Kiske Hath (Doctors look after the lives of the patients but who looks after the safety of doctors?), among others. The protest went on for 30 minutes, however, the functioning of the OPD was not disrupted at all. The hospital is run under the Public-Private Partnership model by the Uttarakhand government and Shubahm Servam Medical Projects Limited. Speaking on the issue, Dr Anmol Thacore, administrative head at the hospital, told TOI that the protest of the doctors didn't impact the medical services. “All they wanted is some sympathy from the government. We do not have any personal grudge with the minister. He was only misguided by the locals,” he added. Meanwhile, Bansidhar Bhagat couldn’t be contacted for his comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/medical-staff-at-ramnagar-hosp-stages-protest-after-bansidhar-bhagat-misbehaved-with-the-cms/articleshow/82778428.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Delhi||Urdu poet Tarannum Riyaz dies of Covid||New Delhi: Urdu poet, critic and author Tarannum Riyaz passed away in a Delhi hospital on Thursday due to Covid-19. Her husband, Riyaz Punjabi, who was former Kashmir University vice-chancellor, had passed away in the city last month. Born in Srinagar in 1960, she was a fiction writer, critic and a former newscaster with All India Radio. She was also a recipient of the SAARC Literature Award. In 2015, she was part of a panel of Urdu writers and poets from India and Pakistan. Salim Saleem, editorial member of Rekhta, said that “she was a well-known figure in the world of Urdu fiction. She penned over 15 books in which she spoke from the perspective of women in a male-dominated society. Her short stories like ‘Shahr’ and ‘Hum to doobe hain sanam’ were great works of literature. She left way too early.” He added that Tarannum’s nazms were fantastic and “would speak about the evolution of human and how the innocence of man changes due to the environment. She was one who wrote with a post-modernist treatment with books such as ‘Ababeelein laut aayengi,’ ‘Chashm-e-naqsh-e-kadam’ and others to her credit.” Professor Amitabh Mattoo tweeted: “An exceptional Urdu poet and great human being, Tarannum Riyaz, wife of the late Prof Riyaz Punjab passes away. ‘We do not know how to nurse grievances, we are people rooted in love,’ she wrote. RIP” Mattoo told TOI that “her nazms and shers were brilliant and she was someone who stood out as a poet of Urdu literature. I knew her and her husband, Riyaz Punjabi, who was a fine academic, and found her to be an affable and soft-spoken person.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/urdu-poet-tarannum-riyaz-dies-of-covid/articleshow/82813212.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Cyclone Yaas may hit Bengal next week, warns Met||KOLKATA: It’s the month of May and another cyclonic storm is brewing over the Bay of Bengal. Though weather scientists are yet to predict the date, time and place of landfall and its intensity, the met department has indicated that the low pressure that is forecast over the east-central Bay of Bengal may intensify into a cyclone early next week, a year after Kolkata and vast swathes of the adjoining areas bore the brunt of Super Cyclone Amphan. The Indian Meteorological Department issued a warning on Wednesday that a low pressure is likely to form over north Andaman Sea and adjoining east-central Bay of Bengal around Saturday and intensify gradually into a cyclonic storm over the next 72 hours. It is likely to move northwestwards and reach West Bengal and Odisha coasts around the evening of May 26. Rains are likely to commence from May 25 evening with significant increase in spatial extension and intensity subsequently. Squally wind speed reaching 50-60 kmph gusting to 70 kmph is expected from May 23 and further evolve into a gale wind between May 24 and 26. Super cyclone Amphan that had struck the city on May 20 last year had winds gusting at 165-185 km per hour during its landfall and had left behind a trail of devastation after it passed over the city. “Conditions like sea surface temperature, wind shear, cloud formation over the sea, moisture condition and a cyclonic circulation which are conducive for the formation of a cyclonic storm prevail,” said GK Das director (weather) at RMC Kolkata. The weather office is closely tracking the development of the low pressure area. If the existing low pressure is turned into a cyclone, it will be called Yaas, named by Oman. “It is too early to predict where the cyclone will make its landfall, the timing and intensity as to whether its magnitude will be greater or lesser than Amphan. We will keep issuing bulletins on the development from time to time,” said Das. But what looks certain now is that rain is likely to lash coastal districts by evening of May 25, says the met office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/met-eyes-cyclone-early-next-week/articleshow/82780692.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

With the doctors prescribing lung transplant, which will cost Rs 70 lakh to Rs 80 lakh, his family is seeking help for his treatment. Harjinder Singh of Punjab Police has served in Ludhiana commissionerate as SHO of Daresi and Koomkalan police stations. After promotion, he was posted in Ludhiana Central Jail as deputy superintendent. His brother, Hardeep Singh, said, “On April 6, Harjinder contracted the virus and was admitted to the Covid ward of SPS Hospital till April 21. Thereafter, he was shifted to a non-Covid ward. Though he defeated the virus, it badly affected his lungs. On April 28, we received reports that confirmed his lungs were damaged. On May 10, the doctors again tested him after medication, but there was no improvement.”“The next day, I approached commissioner of police (CP) Rakesh Agarwal and told him that SPS Hospital doctors have prescribed my brother a lung transplant. The CP forwarded his case to a panel of doctors in Chandigarh. On Wednesday, I again sent the letter of SPS Hospital doctors to the CP,” he added. “The transplant will cost about Rs 70 lakh to Rs 80 lakh and Harjinder will be shifted to either Mumbai or Hyderabad. The hospital will arrange for the donor also. But we cannot afford this treatment and need help. Harjinder is on oxygen support and doctors say there are 70% to 80% chances of successful transplant. I request the police administration to help us in this tough time,” said Hardeep. Agarwal said, “I am in touch with Harjinder’s family. We had approached the management of SPS Hospital, who have not charged a single penny from him for the treatment. In future also, we will help him in every possible way. Harjinder’s case has been sent to PGI doctors.” Balkar Singh Bhullar, superintendent, Ludhiana Central Jail, said, “The department has provided Rs 2 lakh aid to the DSP. By Thursday or Friday, he will be shifted to PGI, where doctors will examine him. Thereafter, we may ask senior officials of the prison department to provide more aid.” Won many an accoladeHarjinder Singh, who hails from Mohali, was the SHO of Koomkalan police station in 2017.

The department officials insisted that no lions went missing from the coastal areas of Amreli, Gir Somnath, and Bhavnagar following precautionary steps taken by the department in wake of the impending cyclone. “From Mangrol to Mahuva and Talaja, lions are found in the coastal areas of Saurashtra. Lions have made their home in Amreli, Gir Somnath, Bhavnagar and Junagadh. Following the cyclone alert, steps were taken for the safety of the lions. The animals were constantly monitored. During such monitoring, it was noticed that lions in Rajula had moved to a safer location,” said D T Vasavada, chief conservator of forest, Junagadh (wildlife) in a letter issued on Tuesday. “The forest department does not support reports of 18 lions missing from the coastal area,” Vasavada clarified. The official said no lions were reported to have gone missing from Rajula, Jafrabad, Una, Kodinar or Mahuva coastal areas. “All lions in Gir and Greater Gir area are safe and no death of a single lion has been reported so far. Constant monitoring is being done for the well being of the lions,” wrote Vasavada. Deputy Conservator of Forest (Bhavnagar) Sandeep Kumar clarified that “the lions are safe and as of now no damage had been reported or observed due to the cyclone in Bhavnagar district”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lions-are-safe-no-harm-reported-in-cyclone-forest-dept/articleshow/82780749.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Post cyclone Amphan: Botanic Garden saves most trees, loses some||HOWRAH: A year after Cyclone Amphan devastated the 234-year-old Indian Botanic Garden at Shibpur, the authorities have managed to nurse it back to life. Most of the giant trees, uprooted by the cyclone, have been replanted. However, some over two-centuries old trees have been lost forever. Also, some damaged parts around the 300-year-old Great Banyan Tree, the most precious tree in the garden, could not be saved. The storm caused damage to 1018 trees belonging to 195 species, of which 350 trees had been uprooted. Many of these have been restored but some extremely old and precious trees like ten 200-year-old mahogany trees are now lost forever, rue garden scientists. It took months to address the damage caused to the 44 prop roots of the Great Banyan Tree and despite the best efforts of the scientists, 20 of the oldest and heaviest prop roots could not be saved, while the remaining have been healed now. “We could not take cranes underneath the canopy and so the huge ancient props could not be saved. We are keeping an eye on the wounds so that fungal infection doesn’t spread,” said botanist Basant Singh. The garden authorities, however, are happy to revive the 40-tonne heavy Kalpavriksha or Baoab tree, uprooted by the Amphan. Heavy duty cranes from the Metro Railways and a careful transplantation process has also helped in reviving 100 more rare and ancient trees like the African Sausage Tree, Rudraksha, Malabar Mahogany, Ceylon Satinwood, Sandalwood etc which are endemic and IUCN red listed trees. “Huge dead trees still line up our avenues and we have requested the Howrah Municipal Corporation for removal because this is blocking our restoration process. The HMC is yet to do so,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/botanic-garden-saves-most-trees-loses-some/articleshow/82780734.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 11 people on another tug may have drowned, say 2 pulled out by Navy||Mumbai: The bodies of four of the P-305 victims brought back to the shores on Wednesday—crew members Nilesh, Jamish Joseph, Amol Raj and Vishal Kardhare from Ratnagiri—were taken to JJ hospital for a panchanama. Yellow Gate police registered an accidental death report, said senior inspector Suhas Hemade. Inspector Dinesh Sawant said the deaths were due to drowning and added police had sought details from the barge company (Afcons, belonging to the Shapoorji Pallonji group) of the deceased to inform family members. Commander Mehul Karnik, chief PRO, defence, told TOI, “Apart from the five warships, INS Talwar has also been diverted for the SAR (search and rescue) operations. There are nine aircraft and helicopters at the spot that will continue the SAR till all members of the crew are located and rescued.” All the four vessels that were stranded in the sea on Monday were engaged in ONGC’s revamp of its unmanned offshore platforms off Bombay High in collaboration with a Afcons-led consortium. Apart from those on P-305, there were 137 personnel on board the barge GAL Constructor that ran aground off Colaba coast, 220 on board barge Support Station-3 which drifted north-west off Pipavav port and 101 (including 38 ONGC employees) on board ONC-owned drill vessel Sagar Bhushan which too went adrift off Pipavav. All personnel on these other 3 vessels were rescued on Tuesday and brought back on shore. Two survivors of a tug, Varpradha, were also rescued by the Navy. A source in the Navy said while INS Kolkata was conducting its search for P305 personnel, they found two survivors from the tug in the sea and rescued them. “The two survivors told us there were 13 people in the tug. They said the 11 others might have drowned. The two were able to climb on to the life raft,” sources said. TOI spoke to some survivors from P-305 who said they had a horrendous time in the waters and seriously doubted whether they would survive. One crew member said, “Some personnel had spoken to their families before the barge sunk, and the families must have spent a harrowing time thinking about their kin stranded in the waters and prayed for their safety. We spent hours floating, with gusty wind and bad weather. We are praying for the safety of those still missing.” However, the crew member added, “Looking at the weather conditions in the sea and the salinity of the water, it is going to be not easy to survive for 50 hours.” Afcons said in a statement, “We are anguished and deeply distraught by the loss of lives and share in the grief of the bereaving friends and family members. Our immediate focus is to locate and rescue the remaining missing personnel as quickly as possible. The safety and wellbeing of our people are our topmost priority, and we’re doing everything possible to address this unprecedented crisis. We know nothing can ever compensate for the loss of a loved one, but we will extend our fullest support including financial assistance to the bereaved families in this hour of their need.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-11-people-on-another-tug-may-have-drowned-say-2-pulled-out-by-navy/articleshow/82782745.cms||Mateen Hafeez

During the resumed hearing in the high court related to the Covid-19 management in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, senior advocate Anupam Gupta had pointed out on Tuesday that the security payment of Rs 10,000 prescribed by UT administration was on a higher side. On this, the UT senior standing counsel, Pankaj Jain, had submitted that these issues shall be examined by the department concerned at the earliest and this court shall be apprised of the same accordingly. On Wednesday, while reducing oxygen cylinder security amount, the UT administration has clarified that the security amount has been prescribed on the insistence of the private vendor, which was engaged by the UT administration, so that he gets back his cylinders in time and continue with the supply of medical oxygen to all the needy persons. However, if the vendor is satisfied, then he may provide the cylinder to a person without any security or on the basis of some undertakings etc., reads the order issued by the UT administration. A senior UT official said they have reduced the security amount of B-type cylinders, which is being used for patients under home isolation. The security amount of D-type cylinders, which is mostly used by hospitals, is kept same i.e. at Rs 25,000. Meanwhile, UT administrator V P Singh Badnore also reviewed oxygen position in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/o2-cylinder-security-rate-reduced-to-rs-8k/articleshow/82782739.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The power department managed to restore and charge the 33 kv Sancoale line where the towerline had collapsed. All three workers, including one department linesman, who suffered injuries in Curtorim and Sangolda have been discharged from hospital, he said. Workers from Kolhapur have been helping restore power in the state. A team of 15 workers arrived from Rajasthan by air and another team is expected from a power distribution company from Hubali on Thursday. However, the team from Kolkata couldn’t arrive as their flight was cancelled. Some others have declined to come due to the Covid-19 raging across the state. Keni, meanwhile, said that repair and restoration work will continue for another 10 days. Of the 4,000 linestaff employed by the electricity department, around 300 staff or their family members have been affected during the second Covid wave, he said. Keni further said that this time, the coastal areas were more affected than the hinterland. “The damage along the coast, between Pernem and Canacona, was on a higher scale as compared to the hinterland. This time Ponda, Sattari and Sanguem were slightly less hit.” Areas with underground cabling – Margao, Fatorda, Curchorem, Panaji, parts of Porvorim, Loutolim and Nuvem - did not suffer power outages after the cyclone, Keni said. “Wherever we have overhead lines and a tree branch comes into contact with it, it is always a challenge. One tree falling brings down with it six to seven poles.” When asked about underground cabling, Keni said huge funds are required to convert all overhead lines to underground and that this cannot be done overnight. Further, he said that an underground cabling network will be laid across Mapusa town area after the monsoon at a cost of Rs 123 crore after which the department is looking at taking it up in Vasco.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/plaints-of-power-woes-continue-chief-engg-claims-connections-restored-to-96-of-state/articleshow/82782776.cms||---

It was the state’s first reported fatality from the rare fungal infection amid the rising cases of black fungus in the last couple of weeks. The patient was earlier undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at a private city hospital where the doctors had diagnosed him with mucormycosis. The man was admitted to AIIMS-P on May 17 and died within 24 hours. “He was suffering from lungs infection and developed black fungus during treatment at the other hospital. He was also diabetic. As mucormycosis is an opportunistic fungal infection, it easily latches on the patients whose immunity levels are heavily compromised due to the viral disease,” AIIMS-P nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Sanjeev Kumar said. The relatives of the deceased said the man had tested positive on May 1 and was undergoing treatment at home in Aurangabad before coming to Patna. Dr Sanjeev said indiscriminate use of steroids during Covid-19 treatment was one of the reasons behind the fungal infection. He urged the hospitals to use the steroids only during the respiratory phase of Covid patients. “Besides, nasal cannula of Covid-19 patient should be changed frequently as the black fungus usually starts from jaw and nasal passage. People should maintain hygiene and immunity after recovery from Covid,” he said. The number of mucormycosis patients at AIIMS-P increased to 32 on Wednesday while 21 such patients were undergoing treatment at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS). IGIMS head of regional ophthalmic centre, Dr Bibhuti Prashun Sinha, said mucor cases are not something new. “It mostly affect the immune-compromised individuals, especially those on medications for cancer treatment and using steroid for a long period. The added factor is that the Covid patients’ immunity is also compromised when the steroid is given to moderate to severe patients. It not only reduces the immunity of the patients but also increases the blood sugar level,” he said. Dr Sinha underlines three immediate effect of steroid — high blood sugar, immuno-suppression and increase in ferritin level (blood protein that contains iron). “The three conditions are very conducive for the growth of mucors,” he said. Indian Medical Association (Bihar) secretary Dr Sunil Kumar said several patients were diagnosed with black fungus during their Covid-19 treatment. “It can happen because of two reasons -- the excessive use of steroids and use of non-sterilised humidifier while giving oxygen to patients. The hospitals need to take care of Covid patients during their treatment,” he said. “Diabetics and immuno-compromised patients are vulnerable to the black fungus. Prophylactic dosage of antifungal medicines should be given to diabetics when early symptoms of mucor are seen,” he added. Dr Amit Kumar, a diabetologist, said as diabetics are more vulnerable to the black fungus infection, they need to maintain their sugar level post-Covid recovery. “In fasting, the sugar level should be between 100 and 120 and it should be less than 200 after meal, as it was seen that back fungus occurred in such people who recovered from Covid and have poorly controlled diabetes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aiims-p-reports-first-black-fungus-death-cases-on-rise/articleshow/82778509.cms||Faryal Rumi

Some university teachers are also supporting the group by providing financial assistance, said a member of the committee. “We check oxygen levels of the patient via a video call and after getting a doctor’s prescription, we provide oxygen cylinders to those in home isolation,” Aamir Mintoe, one of the committee’s members, said on Wednesday. Mintoe added, “We have hired a technician who visits the patient's house to set up the oxygen cylinder. Each patient’s requirement levels are different.” The entire operation is being conducted from the varsity's Aftab Hall. Mintoe said that they have 51 cylinders, including 22 with a large capacity of 40-46 litres. “Cylinders are provided on the basis of the patient's requirement,” he said, adding that they refill cylinders from nearby districts and transport them to Aligarh to help the patients. “We had bought these cylinders from various places and so far we have helped at least 1,000 people irrespective of their religion, caste and creed,” he claimed. “Some students from the group even stand in long queues outside the gas agencies for hours to get refills to help the poor and needy patients during the pandemic,” he said. Last year, during lockdown, AMU students distributed raw food materials to the needy daily. “We had provided pulses, flour and potatoes to people who lost work due to the lockdown and it was continued for months,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/amu-students-distribute-free-o2-cylinders-to-needy-covid-patients/articleshow/82771401.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Party decided on new team: Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan stated that the decision to introduce a completely new team in the second term of the LDF government, even exempting former health minister K K Shailaja, was a collective decision of the party. He said that such a decision was taken after finding that giving a chance to new faces has been welcomed by the public right from the finalization of candidates during the elections. Refusing to acknowledge that Shailaja was the only person who actually deserved an exemption, the chief minister said that if a decision is taken to give exemption to one person, there are many who deserve it. He said that there are many leaders who displayed exemplary performance, but could not be given a seat to contest. It does not mean that they have not performed, he said. However, he said that the front is thankful to all those who felt that Shailaja should have been given a second chance as such criticism is proof that they admired the good work done by the government. Vijayan also ruled out rumours that the CPM central leadership is not happy about excluding Shailaja, and said that her absence would not mean that the work will suffer as all decisions were taken and would be taken collectively. He said that even though a change of team would also mean that the chief minister could have been changed as well, the party has decided to retain him. Shailaja a reluctant minister, party prodded her: Jayarajan Meanwhile, senior CPM leader and party Kannur district secretary M V Jayarajan said that health minister K K Shailaja had reservations on accepting the health portfolio when she was offered the ministry as a first timer in 2016. Speaking at the observance of the 17th death anniversary of former chief minister E K Nayanar in Kannur on Wednesday, he said that it was the strength given by the party which made Shailaja an excellent minister. “Shailaja teacher who has won accolades from the public was a first timer when the party selected her as health minister in 2016. When she was offered the health ministry, she went to party state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and said she had no prior administrative experience and asked whether she should be entrusted with the health department which had several issues. At that time, the party secretary extended his support to her and it was the strength given by the party which made her an excellent minister,” he said. Jayarajan said that it was not an individual but the organization which drives a government and added that individuals are ‘symbols’ of the organization. He said that it was not only Shailaja but other ministers like T M Thomas Isaac, T P Ramakrishnan, K T Jaleel and others who were not in the new cabinet and they too have done exemplary work. “It was the strength given by the party and the people which made them perform well. Otherwise, LDF would not have come to power again,” he added. Jayarajan said that only LDF can provide such opportunities to fresh faces. There was no reason for concern about the newcomers as they will show their mettle with the experiences they have amassed as part of their party work, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/party-decided-on-new-team-cm/articleshow/82780809.cms||---

People are lying to police that they did not get salaries or have lost jobs and need help. On inquiring, cops have found many claims to be false. On the directions of the state government, the city police had started home delivery of cooked food and dry ration on May 14. For two days, the cops received eight to 10 calls a day, including those of Covid patients and families in need. Suddenly thereafter, they started receiving 50 to 80 calls in a day. The maximum were from families who claimed that they have lost jobs due to lockdown or were not getting salaries. Ashwani Kapur, deputy commissioner of police (law & order) who is also the nodal officer for Hunger Helpline (an initiative of the state government), said, “There was a sudden spike in the number of calls and more people were demanding dry ration. Some of them initially claimed to be Covid-19 positive. I asked the officials to first check their reports and then deliver cooked meals. However, they were not found to be Covid-19 infected.”“One caller claimed that he had been sacked from job and another said he was not getting salary. We approached their employers and found that they were getting good salaries. We have warned them not to repeat it. Officials have now been instructed to first verify if the person calling at the Hunger Helpline is genuine and then provide meals,” Kapur added. He said, “We are providing meals and dry ration to needy families, including Covid-affected ones. In these testing times, people should not try to take advantage of the situation.” On whether the police plan to take action against those misleading them, Kapur said, “It is not required as the cops will now first verify and then provide aid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/callers-fake-penury-covid-to-get-food-and-ration-aid/articleshow/82778501.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae: Probe begins, Coast Guard asks why warning ignored||MUMBAI: After the Union ministry of petroleum and natural gas on Wednesday asked a high-level committee led by the Director General of Shipping, Amitabh Kumar, to inquire into the sequence of events leading to the stranding of ONGC vessels in cyclone Tauktae, the DG Shipping initiated a “casualty inquiry” into the incident that resulted in the drowning of 26 crew members of Barge Papaa (P-305). The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) also raised the question of why the accommodation barge, anchored near Heera Oil Field at Bombay High around 70 km away from Mumbai’s shores, which went adrift and sank on Monday, had not been moved to a safe location when they had relayed the high alert about the cyclone from May 11. Four vessels of ONGC with more than 600 people on board were stranded in offshore areas during the cyclone. The committee led by the DG, Shipping, has, as its other members, S C L Das, director general of hydrocarbons, and Nazli Jafri Shayin, joint secretary, ministry of defence. The committee may co-opt any other member and take the assistance of any person it deems necessary, the ministry said. It has been told to submit its report within a month. The committee will look into whether the warnings issued by the meteorological department and other statutory authorities were adequately considered and acted upon, whether standard operating procedures for securing the vessels and dealing with disaster management were adequately followed, and if there were lapses and gaps in the systems, leading to the stranding and drifting of the vessels. It will also give recommendations to prevent recurrence of such incidents. Afcons officials said the extremely severe cyclonic storm Tauktae caused damage to several vessels that were deployed, including barge P-305. Its marine crew was owned and operated by M/s Durmast Enterprises Ltd. “The barge had a full complement of safety equipment, including life jackets and life rafts for all persons on board. They have followed safety measures and the barge was anchored to safety and was nowhere near the way of the cyclone,” officials said. The Coast Guard had put all the ashore, afloat and aviation units on high alert by the time Tauktae formed in the Lakshadweep seas. Coast Guard ships and aircraft had already alerted state administrations, fisheries authorities, port authorities, fishing boats as well as merchant vessels in the cyclone path. Coast Guard inspector general Anand Badola told TOI, “The ONGC and the barges company should answer why they did not take the alert warning seriously. The barges remained at Bombay High despite the aerial announcement relayed by the helicopters and by the ICG vessels.” Watch Cyclone Tauktae: Probe begins on lapses, warnings ignored||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-probe-begins-coast-guard-asks-why-warning-ignored/articleshow/82782761.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

Our primary estimates suggest all the functional plots in the shipbreaking yard has suffered losses to the tune of Rs 70-80 crore,” said Haresh Parmar, secretary, Ship Recycling Industries Association of India (SRIA). “Most importantly the electricity supply and communication networks have not been restored in the Alang shipbreaking yard. As a result, the yard remains totally cut off from the rest of the state. Even the oxygen generating plants have not be able to function due to power outage,” Parmar added. Alang currently has 135 operational plots and there are 70-80 ships beached at the yard for dismantling.Meanwhile, Sintex Industries Limited’s plant located at Jafarabad in Amreli has suffered severe damage due to the cyclone. “The expected quantum of loss or damage due to Cyclone Tauktae and estimated impact on the production and operations is under process of determination,” the company informed the stock exchanges . tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ship-breakers-suffer-rs-80-crore-damage/articleshow/82780785.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae: ‘Jumped in sea at 6pm, saved next morning’||MUMBAI: Dahisar resident Sunilkumar Madhesia can never forget Monday, May 17, the day he along with other 11 friends jumped into the sea one by one to save themselves when their barge, P305, began sinking. “I was carrying my passport, bag, Aadhar card, mobile phone, but lost everything. I can’t tell you what we went through. Two people who had jumped along with us have not been found yet,” a tired Madhesia recalled. He, along with 185 others, were rescued by the defence forces in what they termed as ‘one of the most challenging rescue operations in recent years.” “Prayers, hope, struggle in the waters and memories of our loved ones brought us back,” was the reaction of many survivors. The Navy used its divers, life-guards, radar, searchlights, microphones and other equipment during the rescue ops. Madhesia (22), who originally belongs to Kushinagar in UP, was to return home by the end of this month. “We thought we would die during the cyclonic storm. The waves were as high as 8-10 metres and the weather was rough. I swam and saw a ray of hope when the Navy began rescuing us. I was wearing a life jacket when I jumped into the waters at around 6 pm on Monday; I was rescued the next morning. I am thankful to the Navy for saving our lives,” Madhesia said. While one survivor said, “I just want to go back home,” some other survivors said they were not keen on returning to work in the sea. Almost all the rescued personnel blamed the management of P305 for not taking the decision of evacuating them before time. “We were informed about the disaster the cyclone had created. What could we do in two hours before our barge began sinking? It was the duty of the captain and barge rep to make plans. Many colleagues have lost their lives and dozens have still not been found. Who is responsible?” asked one crew members. He added the management had released two boats with crew a few days before the cyclone hit the barge. Indrajit Sharma (33), a Nerul resident, who worked as senior engineer, said he jumped into the waters on Monday evening and swam for 8 hours before being rescued. “I was swimming and INS Kochi noticed and rescued me,” he said. Sharma, who has a four-year-old daughter, added the barge had eight anchors of 7 to 10 tonnes each. The anchors had reportedly broken. A survivor broke down while sitting in the Navy bus. “The Navy saved us,” he said. Another survivor, Shailendra Mishra (27), said, “I was on the first floor of the barge and jumped into the water after it began sinking. Many people died due to hopelessness and fear.” Kolhapur resident Manoj Gite (19), who worked as helper, had joined the barge only last month. He has lost all his documents in the waters. Mathew Thomas (50) said he has been working on oil rigs for 22 years but had never experienced such a terrifying incident. Originally from Kerala, Thomas, father of two, was in the water for around 14 hours. Ram Sureman, a young workman who came from Mau in UP to work on the barge, said he was in the water for 10 hours. “A rope was thrown from INS Kochi. I caught hold of it and they pulled me up. Similarly, 10 people after me caught the rope and were pulled up,” he said. “We were tired and had no energy to hold the rope. But to save life we do everything,” he said. Some workers were pulled up through a helicopter, said a survivor. Mithlesh Kumar (34), from Bihar, said he struggled in the water for 3 hours before being rescued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-memories-of-our-loved-ones-brought-us-back-says-survivors/articleshow/82782782.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The police rescued him on Tuesday evening from his father and uncle, who were allegedly forcing him to sell illicit liquor. The action was taken after a cop discovered a purported video where the minor can be seen selling liquor to the customers. Upon investigation, the police found that the minor has stopped going to school because of the lockdown and his father beats him if he refuses to sell liquor. The accused father has been arrested and FIR registered against him under sections of the JJ Act and the Excise Act. SHO Nighsan police station, D K Singh, told TOI, “We just had a viral video and after conducting a brief investigation, we managed to find that a family in Kripakund village sells illicit liquor through their daily needs shop. When we raided the village, the boy’s parents were sitting at the shop while the boy was serving liquor in a small ‘bar’ placed just behind their shop. His uncle was manufacturing illicit liquor inside their house. The boy’s father and the uncle were arrested along with 115 litres of illicit liquor.” Senior superintendent of Police, Kheri, Vijay Dhull said that the family had been running this business for the past two years and had two ‘pucca’ houses in the village. “The boy is the youngest among two brothers and a sister. As is the rule, he was handed over to the Child Welfare Committee. His father and uncle were booked under sections 60/2 and 272 of the Excise Act and section 78 of Juvenile Justice Act,” said Anoop Kumar Saxena, chairperson of CWC Kheri, said, “This is the first such reported case in Kheri in the past five years where a minor was rescued while serving liquor at a commercial establishment. Also, it is for the first time that we invoked section 78 of the JJ, which can lead to imprisonment up to seven years with Rs 1 lakh fine. The boy wasn’t aware that he was doing any crime. He was forced to do it by his father and uncle,” said Saxena. The CWC, however, made an exception and handed the boy back to his mother on Wednesday because she was not made an accused by the police. “The Childline team will keep an eye on the children and we will try to enrol the boy under a beneficiary scheme where there is a provision of Rs 2,000 every month,” added Saxena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/forced-to-quit-school-during-lockdown-10-year-old-boy-in-kheri-pushed-into-selling-illicit-liquor-by-family/articleshow/82776562.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Kolkata||Frontline Cov worker gets married amid restrictions||Kolkata: A 30-year-old pharma executive, who had delivered lifesaving drugs to a hospital the night earlier, got married on Wednesday with 35 invitees attending the wedding. This was one of the first weddings to take place amid the Covid-induced restrictions across the state since the beginning of this week. Deferred twice since last year, Beliaghata resident, Tanmoy Ghosh, tied the knot with his beloved, Chumki (26), who worked with an NGO, at her Duttapukur house. The select guests and the priest, who solemnized the wedding, were asked to stay inside the house from before to ensure that the Covid-safety protocol was not violated. Sanitizer bottles and masks were distributed to every guest. The wedding was initially slated for December last year and then the date was deferred to January this year. However, the two wanted to get married when the pandemic situation would come under control with all restrictions on the turnout of guests being lifted. So, they had deferred the date again to May 19, hoping the infection would minimize by that time. “But we got it entirely wrong. Not only has the situation aggravated but a lockdown like situation has also been imposed in the state now. But we couldn’t defer it any further and decided to get married amidst all the restrictions only,” said Tanmoy, a frontline Covid worker himself. The families have cut down the number of guests to 35 — 15 fewer that what has been allowed by the state and they are not holding any major function. “The sudden imposition of the restrictions has turned the entire wedding plans topsy turvy. While one of our relatives was supposed to get my dhoti and kurta another relative was to bring a necklace for the bride. None of them could come and I had to make emergency arrangements between the 7am-10am slot on Wednesday,” he said. Since the bride has a bigger house at Duttapukur, around 17 of them had reached there on Wednesday morning. The cook and the priest had also reached early and so did the groom and his family in two cars. “We have cut down on all non-essential activities like photographers, electricians, caterers and flower decorators. The guests include some close relatives and friends,” he added. The bride, who had to do most of her makeup by herself, said it felt a little odd to get married under such circumstances but she added that the arrangement was the best they could manage, considering the current situation. “It feels a bit weird to get married during a lockdown like situation. But I am happy that at least we are finally getting married. Perhaps, we can celebrate our anniversary with much fanfare next year,” said Chumki, whose Gangtok honeymoon has also been called off now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/frontline-cov-worker-gets-married-amid-restrictions/articleshow/82780822.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Delhi||One lynching an invitation to the next, says court||New Delhi: Rejecting the bail plea of three men accused of lynching a man after suspecting him to be a child lifter, a city court said if the accused were released, it would “constitute a failure of the court to begin the pushback against those locked in a battle with liberal and democratic ideals”. Additional sessions judge Vishal Gogne observed, “Much like incidents of dowry deaths and offences against women are unhesitatingly identified and commented upon in judicial orders as a reflection of social malaise, the act of lynching must also be recognised as an expression of a creeping social reality. This reality indubitably is intolerance.” The court also observed that action in such an incident was never taken in the heat of the moment and was “evidently conscious, premeditated and executed till the gory end”. It added that mob violence was an identifiable factor in determining aggravated gravity for the courts to decide the bail plea. The judge also underlined that one lynching was an invitation to the next. “The courts cannot countenance any such othering or hate and must apportion their social sensitivity and judicial time to clamp down on this crime,” Gogne observed. Dharmender, Munesh and Gajender had sought bail in a case filed under IPC Section 302 (murder) stressing their alleged roles in the lynching of 35-year-old Vijay Kumar shouldn’t be construed as one that led to the victim’s death. However, the order pointed out that the “macabre spectacle” was witnessed by at least 50 people and captured with “gruesome clarity” on a CCTV camera barely a few yards away from the place of incident. Kumar was presumed by the accused and local residents in Delhi’s Durga Vihar to be a child lifter. The victim had been left to die. When police arrived, it took 15 minutes to untie him. No effort was made to check whether he was alive or to provide him first aid as police apparently treated him as a child lifter too and accepted his summary fate, the court observed. “The video reveals the body to be stiff as it is lowered to the ground. It was still the gumption of the investigating officer to have stated in the chargesheet that the unconscious victim was taken to the hospital and declared dead on arrival,” the court said. DCP (Southwest) was directed by the court to report whether steps had been taken for protection of the victim’s family members or witnesses. Besides, a notice was issued to Delhi government to report whether any scheme for compensation/interim compensation to the victims or next of kin in cases of mob violence/lynching had been framed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/one-lynching-an-invitation-to-the-next-says-court/articleshow/82780883.cms||Aamir Khan

Governor Arif Mohammed Khan would administer the oath of office and secrecy to chief minister-designate Pinarayi Vijayan and other minister-designates. Vijayan told reporters on Wednesday evening that only less than 500 people are expected to attend the event. The event at the specially-designed pandal would strictly adhere to Covid-19 protocols. The invited guests, said chief secretary VP Joy, should arrive at the stadium by 2.45pm. The attendees should produce RT-PCR TrueNat/RT Lamp negative test papers or Covid vaccination certificate at the entrance. The event is expected to finish by 5pm and after that ministers and their family would attend a high tea at Raj Bhavan, the official residence of the governor. Meanwhile, in a statement released to media on Wednesday, Vijayan said the objective of the new government would be to build a ‘New Kerala’ on the foundations of the achievements of his first government. “The immediate focus of the new government would be the fight against Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. Vijayan said people-centric alternative development model propounded by Kerala has earned national attention. The new government would strive to establish a development model by leveraging the widespread infra development initiatives the last government had undertaken. “We are committed to create a productive economy that can generate a sizeable number of job opportunities in the next five years. Kerala has the potential to become the skilled labour hub of India. Our aim is to improve the living conditions in Kerala to the level of developed countries in the next 25 years,” he said. “Like the previous government, this government too would humbly try to function according to the aspirations of people,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/covid-19-fight-to-be-top-priority-pinarayi/articleshow/82780876.cms||---

Out of four kiosks at the food street, one kiosk was vacant for more than a year as it had some legal issues as well. “We received the unexpected offer, especially during the pandemic. Now, all four kiosks are rented out. The time to time inspection and surprise visits will be done and the kiosks runners have been asked to follow the norms and maintain proper hygiene there,” a MC official said. The one-year period of three kiosks, which were rented out over a year ago, ended over couple of months ago, but they were given one year extension by increasing 10% rent fee. The renters are eligible for two extensions according to the laid down norms. The kiosks at food street are one of the key sources of revenue for the civic body authority. As the food street received financial loss last year due to the pandemic, the general house of MC waived-off the monthly license fee of kiosks from March till June last year. The move had come following the request of the kiosk runners to the Estate Branch of the MC, which was placed before the general house for the decision. According to the records of the civic body authority, the waived-off amount was around Rs 8-10 lakh, as three kiosks were allotted to the eligible bidders that time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-rents-out-remaining-kiosk-at-food-street-for-rs-1-35-lakh/month/articleshow/82784261.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It was earlier located at the Candolim football ground. Candolim primary health centre (PHC) medical officer Dr Roshan Nazareth said they had to shift the vaccination centre from the ground because of the sudden rain on Sunday and the approaching monsoon. While the club house at the ground was used as the vaccination centre, people coming to get vaccinated would await their turn while sitting in a temporary pandal set up on the ground to maintain social distancing. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rain-forces-candolim-to-shift-vax-centre/articleshow/82782779.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar tops doctor deaths in second wave: IMA||PATNA: Bihar has reported the maximum number of deaths of doctors in the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country, followed by Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. Altogether 90 of the 280 doctors, who have died across India are from the state, according to the Indian Medical Association (IMA). Among the reasons attributed for the high fatality rate by the IMA and other doctors in the state are fewer doctors, which led to exhaustion due to continuous work for over a year now and lack of social distancing and other Covid appropriate behaviour in the state. IMA’s national president-elect Dr Shahjanand Prasad Singh said the deaths due to Covid among doctors are spread across Bihar and in all age groups, though the majority were above 50. "Doctors come in close contact with patients, thus their viral load is normally high. When the second wave was bad a few weeks ago, many doctors in Patna could not even get oxygen for themselves owing to scarcity," Singh said. IMA’s Bihar branch’s acting state president Dr Ajay Kumar said 39 doctors died in the first wave of the pandemic last year and a whopping 90 doctors succumbed to the disease in the second wave this year. "Most deaths occurred between March 1 and May 19," Dr Ajay said. According to him, an inadequate number of doctors in the state is the foremost reason for the high fatality rate when the pandemic was reaching its peak, leading to tens of hundreds of hospitalised patients every day. "The national patient-doctor ratio is 1.4 doctors per 1,000 patients but the corresponding ratio in Bihar is one doctor for 2,400 people. Roughly, there are around 30,000 registered doctors in the state against the population of 12.5crore, out of whom 18,000 work in the government sector and the rest do private practice," said Dr Ajay. He added, "As per a hypothesis, the doctors did not get any rest for more than a year while facing the pandemic from very close. Consequently, they were exhausted, which adversely affected their immunity, which led to the severity of the disease in many cases." Incidentally, the state health department is in the process of hiring 1,000 doctors on a contract basis. Dr Ajay claimed that at least 50% of the doctors in the state have taken vaccination against Covid-19 so far. Former state IMA president and principal of the Madhubai Medical College, Dr Rajiv Prasad Ranjan claimed that the Covid fatalities among doctors in institutionalised or government healthcare facilities were comparatively less. "The government facilities mostly have young junior and senior resident doctors on duty, who can sustain the infection with mild or moderate illness. But old doctors, many with co-morbidities, doing private practice succumbed to the infection," Dr Rajeev said. He further claimed that lack of proper medical infrastructure in the state has been another major cause of Covid deaths. "Not all, severe patients can be accommodated at super-speciality facilities like AIIMS-Patna or IGIMS. Thus, even doctors struggled to get beds and a few of them had to be taken to other cities for treatment," he said. "Doctors across the country are dedicated professionals but we feel in Bihar, doctors are more emotional and continue to work for patients even in the most adverse conditions. It is for this reason that all clinics in the state are still open despite the massive second wave of the pandemic," IMA’s president-elect Dr Shahjanand said. Paras HMRI regional director (east) Dr Talat Halim concurred. "There are multi-factor reasons for more deaths of doctors due to Covid. One hypothesis is that doctors in Bihar jump out to save patients. Besides, crowding at hospitals and lack of social- distancing among people in the state made the doctors more vulnerable," he said. The state government has announced compensation for doctors and healthcare workers, who succumb to Covid-19. As per a decision taken by the state cabinet on May 1, if a doctor or healthcare worker dies due to coronavirus infection picked up on duty, the salary due for the remaining period of his or her service will be paid to the surviving family in the form of special family pension. In another option, a government job is given to one member of such family. Dr Prabhat’s remains reach city from Hyderabad:Cardiologist Dr Prabhat Kumar's mortal remains arrived from Hyderabad on Wednesday. According to sources, Dr Prabhat was suffering from Covid-19 and undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Hyderabad for the past couple of weeks. Several doctors, including IMA office-bearers, were at Patna airport when his mortal remains arrived around 11.45am. "Dr Prabhat’s last rites were done at his village in Siwan," Dr Ajay said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/death-toll-of-doctors-highest-in-bihar-ima/articleshow/82778663.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Hit by passing vehicle, tigress dies in Mala range of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve||BAREILLY: A carcass of an adult tigress was found near a road that passes through the Mala range of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) in Uttar Pradesh's Pilibhit district on Wednesday. Officials suspect the tigress was injured after being hit by a speeding vehicle and later succumbed. The carcass was first spotted by a local near Bhairo beat of Mala range early on Wednesday. There were injury marks on the head possibly caused by an SUV or a mini truck. It was continuously raining in the area, so the tyre marks have disappeared, an official said. After getting information, field director Javed Akhtar along with deputy director Naveen Khandelwal and veterinarian Dr Daksh Gangwar rushed to the spot. Khandelwal told TOI, “The incident occurred late on Tuesday when the tigress was crossing the road. The autopsy was conducted by a panel of expert veterinarians on Wednesday afternoon at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute according to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) guidelines. We also conducted a Covid-19 test which was negative." The tigress was around 13-year-old and all her body organs were found intact so the possibility of poaching has been ruled out, Khandelwal said. “We have registered an FIR against an unidentified driver under relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act. We are trying to trace the vehicle and its driver. The locals have been alerted and we are hopeful of a breakthrough soon," Khandelwal added. This is the fifth such tiger death in the state in the last three months. Earlier, an adult tigress was found dead in Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Lakhimpur Kheri district on April 13. On March 21, an adult tiger was found dead in the same sanctuary. Also, an adult tiger was electrocuted in a field near the social forestry area of Lakhimpur Kheri district on March 1, when it came in contact with electric fencing laid by poachers. On March 15, the carcass of an adult tigress was found in PTR's Mala forest range. Its four cubs were rescued and shifted to Lucknow zoo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/tigress-hit-by-passing-vehicle-dead/articleshow/82776582.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The nursing staff claimed that the food and the rooms they were given were unhygienic, and four staff members were being made to live in one room even though they were deputed on Covid duty. Punjab medical education and research minister Om Prakash Soni, however, hit out at the nursing staff, saying they had cheated their own profession by protesting amid the Covid-19 pandemic and, by doing so, abandoned people at god’s mercy. The nurses from AIIMS had been deputed at the Patiala facility to overcome the spike in Covid-19 patients requiring hospital admission. Groups of 50 nursing staff members from AIIMS, Bathinda, had recently been sent to government medical colleges in Punjab and one suce group had come to Patiala. The nursing staff claimed to have reached Patiala by Monday evening, but they said the authorities failed to provide them hygienic accommodation and food. Officials of GMC and Rajindra hospital said they arranged the accommodation for these nurses in the government women’s hostel of Professor Gursewak Singh Government Physical Education College, Patiala. “We were forced to stay in improper and unhygienic conditions, despite the fact that we have to remain on the front and serve Covid patients. Four of us were staying in one room having untidy and unhygienic washrooms. In case one of us gets infected, the other three roommates will also get infected. Pigeons were in all corners of rooms, which exposed the pathetic conditions. Food being served to us was unhygienic and chapatis were half-cooked. We have no issues with serving Covid patients as we have been on the same job at AIIMS. We had only sought proper stay arrangements and food. We were being ferried from the hostel to Rajindra hospital for duties in the ambulance which was being used to ferry Covid patients,” said male nurse Mohit, who along with others had refused to enter their accommodation and eat breakfast on Wednesday. Rajindra hospital medical superintendent Dr H S Rekhi refuted the allegations. and said the AIIMS staff nurse were not willing to render services for COVID patients following which they raised petty issues. He said these nursing staff members were sent back to AIIMS Bathinda. The minister described the objections raised by nursing staff as a “crime against humanity”. “When everyone is engaged in saving humanity, the nursing staff of AIIMS, Bathinda, which was sent to Rajinder Hospital in Patiala to take care of Covid patients, deliberately endangered the lives of people by staging unethical protests,” said Soni. Soni said when Patiala district administration knew about the arrival of staff nurses from AIIMS, it arranged accommodation for nurses in government women’s hostel of the physical education college, Patiala, and all necessary arrangements were made for the accommodation such as cleaning, sanitation and hygienic facilities. He said all facilities were checked by the warden in the presence of Patiala SDM, principal of government medical college and medical superintendent. The minister said nutritious food was also being provided to these nurses in the hostel mess, the quality of which was checked by the principal of government medical college and the medical superintendent. The minister said the rest of the demands of nursing staff were met on the spot. “They demanded coolers and fridge in every room and an air-conditioned bus to ferry them to Rajindra hospital, and the department and the district administration are trying to arrange these things too,” he added. Soni said when these nurses were taken for duty, male staff told them that they could not wear PPE kits and showed inability to take samples while on duty in the ward. They also misbehaved with higher authorities, he said. Issuing instructions to send back the male nursing staff, the minister said it seemed the episode was politically motivated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/aiims-staff-on-covid-duty-complain-of-unhygienic-food-lodging-sent-back/articleshow/82791181.cms||---

Candolim has the highest number of volunteers, 60, because of the large number of cases, he said, while Calangute has 30, Saligao 20 and other panchayats lesser. “This has also helped reduce the load on the Candolim PHC staff, and has brought down the number of cases being referred to the GMC and other hospitals,” Nazareth said. Making sure people in home isolation do not have to mix with others has also been possible because of the helping hand given by the panchayats and their volunteers, the medical officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/volunteers-check-in-on-home-isolated-at-calangute/articleshow/82782784.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Online fraud during pandemic a crime against humanity’||New Delhi: Online fraud during a pandemic is an offence against humanity, said a sessions court, denying bail to a man who allegedly cheated a person by taking his money and not providing him with an oxygen cylinder. The victim had posted a request for an oxygen cylinder on Facebook to which the accused responded by calling him up. He demanded Rs 26,000. The victim transferred half the amount to an account. The accused, however, demanded the rest of the money too prompting the victim to realise he was being defrauded. The bail order passed by additional sessions judge Ajay Kumar Jain held, “The main accused was found to have contacted the complainant, pursuant to which Rs 13,000 was transferred into the account of the co-accused. The oxygen cylinder was also not delivered. The present accused with the co-accused was found to be involved in online fraud in this pandemic time, which is an offence against humanity.” Advocate Rakesh Malviya earlier sought bail for 22-year-old Rahul Chadda, saying he had no antecedents and hadn’t received the money as it was transferred to the account of co-accused Kulveer Singh. Chadda, his lawyer said, was ready to pay Rs 13,000 back. He further submitted that the accused had been in custody from May 13, 2021 and there was no one else to look after his aged parents in the current pandemic situation. Accused is no longer required for investigation, therefore, he could be released on bail, he argued. Additional public prosecutor Ravindra Kumar, however, maintained that the complainant was duped by Chadda and the co-accused. The court was also informed that Chadda’s cellphone, with which he communicated with the complainant, had been seized after his arrest. “The main accused is yet to be arrested,” he submitted. The prosecutor also highlighted that the accused wouldn’t benefit from the high-powered committee guidelines relating to decongestion of jails as the case pertained to a fraud committed over a Covid-19 resource – oxygen cylinder. The court took note of the prosecutor’s submission and stated, “Considering the nature of offence, I am not inclined to release the accused, Rahul Chadda, on bail and hence, the present application is dismissed.” On the basis of the complaint, Delhi Police’s special cell booked a case under sections 420 (cheating), 120B (criminal conspiracy), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence or giving false information), 34 (common intention) of IPC and 66D (punishment for cheating by personation by using computer resource) of the information Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/online-fraud-during-pandemic-a-crime-against-humanity/articleshow/82780894.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Ludhiana||Hit by lockdowns, city inc warms up to online selling||WINDS OF CHANGELudhiana: Due to tough times being faced by the industrialists in the wake of frequent lockdowns in states that are big consumers of their products, they have started looking for other solutions. Online selling and e-commerce platforms, which have become most sought-after modes of sales in the country, were unfortunately not opted by a lot of Ludhiana factories so far. The ones that have taken to this model are of the view that though online selling is challenging, they will have to adapt to it. Industry associations of the city are also taking initiatives to help local units sell their products online. According to Komal Kumar Jain, chairman of Duke Fashions Limited, “We have been using online platforms for selling our range of garments and footwear for quite some time now, and about 10-15% of our total sales come from this mode. Online selling is very challenging, especially for manufacturers, as there is a requirement for huge stock and variety. Besides the circle of order placing and payment realisation is very big and there is a high rate of return and exchange. Regardless of all these factors, one has to change the business strategy with time and those who are capable of adapting to this change, must do it for their own good.”Some business associations are using social media for connecting buyers and sellers. Upkar Singh Ahuja, president of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), says, “Keeping in view the changing times when lockdowns have become frequent, people are turning more to online mode of shopping. So, we started a Facebook group called ‘Make In Ludhiana’ in August last year during the first wave of coronavirus. This group now has 30,000 members from all over India and even other countries. Products made by Ludhiana factories and services offered by the local companies are advertised free of cost in this group. Purchase queries are posted by customers from all over India and abroad. A big number of business queries have matured in the group as people can get to multiple suppliers and have competitive rates without spending any fee or commission.”Ahuja adds, “To make local businessmen aware about online selling, we have been organising interactions with experts. Online selling is not easy, but sooner or later businesses will have to adapt to this medium for their survival.”Narinder Bhamra, president of Fasteners’ Manufacturers’ Association of India, says, “In the ongoing situation when people are afraid to go out to shop, online shopping has caught up. Manufacturers also need to adapt to this mode. Running a website with payment gateway and other features is costly at present and the other option of selling goods through e-commerce platforms attracts huge commission. But it is an effective tool of sales, so Ludhiana factories need to shift to it. But as far as those manufacturers are concerned who supply their goods to original equipment manufacturer (OEM), online selling or e-commerce do not have any utility.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/hit-by-lockdowns-city-inc-warms-up-to-online-selling/articleshow/82778699.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Goa||Fatorda politics heats up over credit for superior power||Margao: A political power play over assuming credit for uninterrupted electricity supply amid the cyclone is on full display on social media between the two power centres of Fatorda. A seemingly innocuous yet loaded tweet by Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai over the fairly good power situation in Fatorda despite the devastating cyclone Tauktae has unfolded into a full-blown war of words, with BJP general secretary and former MLA Damodar Naik targeting Sardesai, accusing him of claiming false credit for the underground power supply project in Fatorda, and the latter retaliating by making some foot soldiers of his party launch a diatribe against Naik. “Trees don’t fall on underground power cables. In #Fatorda today, we’ve 100% underground cabling. Not because we foresaw #Tauktae, but we dared to imagine a future-ready Fatorda, and worked towards creating infrastructure equipped for any eventuality,” Sardesai had tweeted on Tuesday, which fuelled the controversy. Taking offence at Sardesai’s attempt to derive political mileage over the power scenario in the constituency, Naik, in a video clip posted on Facebook, slammed Sardesai for spreading “falsehood” and “distorting facts”. Naik claimed that the underground power supply was former chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s dream project and that he had initiated it in 2004. Work was completed in 2012. “I was the MLA then, and despite being in the opposition, I pursued the project with the government and ensured its timely completion. It was my vision to make Fatorda an uninterrupted destination.” Naik said and advised Sardesai not to “fool or misguide people” over social media. The BJP general secretary went on to challenge Sardesai to show him a single project that he brought in Fatorda during his stint as MLA over the past seven years, “despite being in the government and occupying the post of deputy chief minister”. Not to be outdone, Sardesai, with a view to treating Naik’s outbursts with sheer contempt, entrusted the nine councillors he recently got elected from Fatorda with the task of defending their political master. At a press conference convened at the GFP office on Wednesday, all the nine councillors launched into an acerbic broadside against Naik and sang paeans to Sardesai for “taking Fatorda forward”. “The development done by the Fatorda MLA is there for all to see,” said MMC ex-chairperson Pooja Naik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fatorda-politics-heats-up-over-credit-for-superior-power/articleshow/82782831.cms||---

Schools, both private and aided, have to reserve 25 per cent seats for students (between ages 6 and 14) based on economic status or caste-based reservations. The fee is reimbursed by the state. The admission is done online. For the academic year 2020-21, the fees for RTE students have been fixed at Rs 8,000, said director, primary education, Dattatray Jagtap, in an official statement. In 2019-20, the fees was Rs 17,670. Last year, over 14,000 applications were received for 7,000 plus seats under the 25 per cent quota. Around 5,000 seats were filled. These schools will now get Rs 8,000 per student. Parents said that with this move of the government, the burden will fall on non-quota students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-reduces-school-fee-for-rte-students/articleshow/82782818.cms||Sandhya Nair

In a step to ramp-up bed capacity in the state, the Punjab government took initiative to grant approval for setting up of temporary Covid-19 hospital and issuing no objection certificate within 24 hours of submission of application. The first such in-principle approval to immediately start construction was granted to M/s Mohali Medical Group Private Limited for setting up 80-bed temporary hospital. Sharing the details, Rajat Agarwal, CEO of Invest Punjab, said Invest Punjab facilitated expeditious approval of the project by coordinating with all the departments concerned and all the required NOCs were made available to the department of health for granting the same within 24 hours. “All the departments have been working together to battle the Covid-19 crisis and have ensured that every NOC is granted on priority basis,” he said. He said a person or a group, who intends to open a temporary hospital, can apply at Invest Punjab by simply filling an application form and submitting self-declarations. This is the first such project in Mohali which got NOC within 24 hours of submission of application based on selfdeclarations. To ensure hassle-free clearances, government departments have come up with relaxed standard operating procedures for encouraging people to set up makeshift hospitals across the state. Department of health, local government, housing and urban development department, Punjab pollution control board (PPCB), public works and labour departments have been involved in the project. Invest Punjab has been made the nodal office to facilitate issuance of all the requisite NOCs or in-principle approvals from the departments concerned. This has been done to ensure that any person or a group desirous of opening a makeshift hospital doesn’t need to visit multiple offices and can get clearances in a time-bound manner. The final authority to issue in-principle approval lies with the department of health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-to-get-80-bed-temporary-hospital-soon/articleshow/82782789.cms||---

The GCCI has asked the government to prepare a vaccination plan as per priority for frontline workers and to keep dedicated stocks of the vaccine for retailers. GCCI president Manoj Caculo said that despite retailers and distributors ensuring continuity of essential supplies, they have been left to fend for themselves with no policy support or acknowledgement as frontline workers. “The government has recognised the work of healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers and we do appreciate this gesture, but the current scenario is also a humanitarian crisis and it is heartening to see several unsung heroes from retail and distribution have equally contributed by risking their lives and braving the logistic hardships and odd working hours,” Caculo said in the letter. The GCCI has pointed out that retailers meet around 50 to 100 customers on a daily basis and have a high chance of getting infected as they cannot ensure stringent and consistent Covid protocols at all times. The industry body said that while most people have the opportunity to work from home or work in shifts, retailers and distributors have to work continuously.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gcci-seeks-priority-inoculation-for-store-owners-distributors/articleshow/82782809.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The facility can cater to 500 people per day. The vaccination centre is open for civilians above 45 years. Senior naval personnel have encouraged people to come forward and get themselves vaccinated. “Very few people are coming for vaccination. Only 40 people came on Wednesday, but the facility can cater to 500,” a source said. “The vaccination centre is operational from 9am to 4pm on all days, except Sundays. Beneficiaries can register through the CoWin portal or walk-in for on-the-spot registration,” the navy said in a statement. Individuals can opt to get the jab by reporting for the vaccination along with the Adhaar card or any government issued identification. The navy has been helping out the state in combating the Covid-19 pandemic. The Goa Naval Area had offered to take in Covid-19 patients who need oxygen support, and also offered to supply medical oxygen to government-run hospitals in Goa. Naval authorities with the Goa Naval Area headquarters said that INHS Jeevanti had earmarked some beds for civilian Covid-19 patients where oxygen can also be provided to such patients whose oxygen levels drop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/navy-sets-up-500-capacity-vaccination-centre-at-dabolim/articleshow/82782822.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Restrict number of attendees at oath-taking: Kerala high court||KOCHI: The Kerala high court on Wednesday asked the state government to restrict the number of attendees to the swearing-in ceremony of cabinet ministers and MLAs on Thursday. The present situation does not permit a large gathering of 500 persons, the court said. A division bench comprising chief justice S Manikumar and justice Shaji P Chaly pointed out that states like West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, which have a higher number of legislators, conducted their ceremonies with lesser attendees. Kerala, which is a forerunner in Covid-19 management, should restrict the numbers to avoid spreading of Covid, the court said. There is no substantial change in number of infected persons since the government’s order of May 6 and there has been an increase in number of deaths, the court noted. Ordering for strict adherence to Covid protocols, the court asked political parties to decide whether MLAs have to be present at the ceremony. Spouses and relatives of MLAs and ministers are not required to participate and they can view from home, the court said. The court turned down the government’s contention that it is a constitutional function and has to be held in a dignified manner. The governor, officials attached to his office, ministers, and personnel required to assist the performance of the programme are required to attend, the court said in the judgment. Dignity will not be lost when the ceremony is witnessed from home, the judgment stated. Government’s contention that only those with negative RT-PCR test results are allowed to attend was dismissed by the court. If such a contention is allowed, even marriages and final rites of persons can also be allowed with 500 persons having negative RT-PCR test results, the court said. Government function cannot be converted into a public or political function, said the court. Though government made a an effort to defend its decision by alleging that the petition, filed by Thrissur-based Chikithsaneethi, is politically motivated, the court said held that public interest is involved in it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/restrict-number-of-attendees-at-oath-taking-hc/articleshow/82780899.cms||---

---||Delhi||Cyclone Tauktae: Incessant rain brings Delhi's maximum temperature to 23.8°C, 70-year low||NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded the highest ever rainfall in a single day in May on Wednesday when the precipitation surpassed the record of 60mm. The capital, which usually experiences scorching temperatures in May, also experienced the coldest May day in at least 70 years on Wednesday after the maximum dipped to 23.8 degrees Celsius, 16 degrees below normal. The remnants of cyclone Tauktae brought rain and strong winds in the region and Wednesday became the wettest May day after Delhi’s base station, the Safdarjung observatory, logged 60mm rainfall between 8.30am and 8.30pm. The India Meteorological Department records have Delhi receiving 60mm of rain in 24 hours on May 24, 1976 for the highest precipitation in a single May day. “On Wednesday, the 12-hour rainfall was equivalent to the 24-hour average of May 24, 1976. As it is still raining, the 24-average for Wednesday is likely be much higher than the earlier record,” said a Met official. According to IMD, Safdarjung recorded 1.8mm rain till 8.30am, 31.3mm from 8.30am to 5.30pm and 28.7mm rainfall from 5.30pm to 8.30pm. Najafgarh, SPS Mayur Vihar and Palam, respectively, recorded 57mm, 39.5mm and 36.8mm of rainfall between 8.30am and 8.30pm. The incessant rain helped bring down the day temperature to the lowest maximum since 1951 recorded at Safdarjung laboratory in May. The incessant rain and strong winds under the influence of cyclone Tauktae brought relief and people could afford to switch off their air conditioners during the day. The maximum temperature remained low at most stations, with Jafarpur and Mungeshpur reporting the lowest at 22.6 degrees Celsius.  The minimum temperature in the city also remained on the lower side at 21.4 degrees Celsius, five below normal. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “The maximum temperature dropped sharply due to the rain and cold and strong winds, plus the absence of sunlight. The remnants of cyclone Tauktae caused heavy rain in Rajasthan and moderate rain in Delhi-NCR, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh.” Strong winds at 40kmph were recorded during the day. Another Met official said an active western disturbance was also influencing weather in the region. Very light rain or thundershowers are predicted till the first half of Thursday. “The day temperature is expected to remain around 30 degrees Celsius while the minimum may touch 20,” predicted a Met official. IMD said the mercury is set to rise from May 22 and reach a maximum of around 39 degrees Celsius that day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mayday-70-year-record-broken/articleshow/82780922.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Chicken sellers now offer home delivery in Panaji||PANAJI: With markets shut due to Covid curfew, and the demand for chicken spiking after cyclone induced power cut, chicken traders in Panaji have started home delivery of the white meat in an effort to meet consumer demand. “Chicken suppliers from other states continue to send consignments each day. Hence, we have resolved to carry out home delivery of the meat,” Alfredo Dias, a chicken seller from the Panaji market, said. “Senior citizens who cannot venture out of their homes and restaurants that are open for takeaway are my main clientele.” The demand for chicken suddenly saw a spike after people that had stored meats in their respective refrigerators prior to the Covid curfew had to discard or consume it due to a state-wide power outage caused due to Cyclone Tauktae. “We have especially tied up with a home delivery cum parcel service to execute the task of delivering chicken to people’s doorsteps,” Salhauddin Shaikh, a chicken seller who personally delivers to clients in St Inez, Panaji and Taleigao, said. Some, however, have no choice but to wait until the restrictions are lifted in order to resume their business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chicken-sellers-now-offer-home-delivery/articleshow/82782862.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Retail traders’ forum to appeal for extended market timings to avoid overcrowding||Kolkata: In the last four days since the restrictions over conducting business have come in, traders have noticed huge crowds in community markets, with people queueing up outside the markets even before the opening time of 7 am. The shops are crowded even at 10 am when it is time to shut the markets and cops start doing the rounds. According to representatives of market committees, each market caters to such a high population that even if one fifth of it comes every day to purchase supplies, it is bound to create congestion leaving no space for social distancing. The Federation of Traders, an umbrella body of retail traders in the city, have decided to write to the government to extend the timings of the markets by at least an hour or two so that the crowd of customers can be controlled. “We have discussed it internally after speaking to representatives of the market committees, who have told us the gathering is because the window to keep shops open is only 3 hours. It is becoming difficult for everybody to tackle the crowd. Many traders are even scared to open the shops,” said Tarak Nath Trivedi, secretary of FTO and of the traders’association in Entally Market. “We have decided to approach the government with the plea to extend the market timings by an hour or two to prevent crowding and congestion,” said Trivedi. According to officials of FTO, markets like Entally, Park Circus, College Street, Maniktala, Gariahat and Lake Market cater to around 12,000 to 15,000 people in the immediate neighbourhoods. “Even if one tenth of people come to the market everyday it is impossible to cater to them within three hours following Covid appropriate behaviour. Due to restricted timings people are purchasing in bulk which means others have to wait that much longer. Most markets are keeping only one or two gates open due to the restrictions which is creating bottle necks,” said Abhik Majumdar, agrocery store owner in Lake Market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/retail-traders-forum-to-appeal-for-extended-market-timings-to-avoid-overcrowding/articleshow/82780915.cms||Zeeshan Javed

While most of such schools are run by heads of other schools, bearing additional charge, the responsibility of many schools are yet to be given to anyone. In many schools there is a shortage of teachers too and some teachers are now doing the additional duty of HMs. With many heads of schools retiring by this month end, the numbers of schools without a dedicated HM is likely to be more than 1,500. The situation and its impact are not visible because the schools are currently remaining closed due to the pandemic. But once they reopen, things can be really chaotic. Hundreds of teachers who have passed the departmental tests and have become eligible to be HMs are yet to be appointed. They allege that the state government has not implemented the high court- approved eligibility criteria and still favours the old convention of appointing teachers aged above 50, who are not required to pass the eligibility test. The legal battles between the eligible teachers and those HMs appointed as per the ‘50-plus rule’ continues. The matter is now under the consideration of the Supreme Court. Citing this, the government has stopped the appointment process. This has forced many eligible teachers to retire without getting a chance to be HM. According to the Kerala Test Qualified Primary Teachers Union (KTQPTU), the government is ignoring the rules and is favouring those HMs who have not been appointed as per the eligibility rules. The rules mandate that a teacher should have 12 years of teaching experience and should qualify the PSC departmental test (account test-lower) and KER test to be appointed as HM. “In February, the Kerala Administrative Tribunal stayed a circular issued by General Education Department that favoured the 50-plus rule. The government can proceed with the appointments as the SC has not stayed the June 2020 order by HC division bench, which upheld a single bench’s order to follow the eligibility criteria recommended in Right to Education Act, 2009. They can fill the existing vacancies based on the eligibility rule and wait for the SC order on the appointments done earlier without adhering to rules. If the issue is not sorted out at the earliest, the functioning of lower primary schools will be affected,” said A N Faizal, a member of KTQPTU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/over-900-lower-primary-schools-in-state-functioning-sans-hms/articleshow/82780923.cms||---

Fortunately, there were no casualties. The culvert is being built on NH 66 stretch at Barcem on the way to Canacona as an alternative to the existing Portuguese-era culvert for easing traffic flow. The existing culvert is narrow and cannot service two vehicles at a time. The whole deck with the centering material and steel gave way and landed into the rivulet blocking the flow of water. Labourers were trying to retrieve the material from the debris. Environmentalists have expressed concern over the possible impact of the disaster on the marine life of the rivulet that flows into river Saleri in Canacona. Canacona assistant engineer Subash Pagi said the work on this culvert, along with two others —at Goddeaval and at the foot of Karmalghat—have been undertaken by the PWD as part of the ongoing highway improvement work. The work on these culverts began two years back and is expected to ease the load of the traffic, he said. Pagi said that the three culverts are being constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 3.9 crore. He said the impact of Cyclone Tauktae was responsible for the upper portion deck slab collapse. However, the collapse occurred on Monday, while the cyclone impacted Goa during the preceding weekend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/under-construction-culvert-falls-pwd-blames-cyclone/articleshow/82782833.cms||---

The locals said action was yet to be taken to restore functionality to the tower. They said the damage had left villagers of Pilerne, Sangolda and Saligao without mobile phone connectivity. Locals said the Pilerne fire station personnel had also not made a round of the villages to clear the damage caused to their houses, after a number of trees and branches crashed on residential structures during the cyclonic winds. Power supply was yet to be restored in some parts of Pilerne as numerous uprooted trees, that have damaged poles and overhead power lines, were yet to be cleared. “People are facing major issues as trees have uprooted and fallen on houses, and with no proper phone connectivity they could not make calls to the fire station office. As no personnel turned up to clear the damages despite knowing the impact the cyclone had left, we were forced to visit the Pilerne fire station to lodge our complaints,” said a local.

Goldman Sachs picked up this stake by acquiring shares that were earlier held by ChrysCapital as well as some other existing shareholders, Aragen Life Sciences said. While the company did not specify any transaction details like the quantum of stake acquired or the investment made, sources said it could be a little over 30% stake. With this, ChrysCapital, which was invested in the company for over five years and held close to 17% stake in Aragen Life Sciences as on March 2020, has exited the Hyderabad-based CRO player. Goldman Sachs’ other healthcare investments in India include Biocon Biologics, BPL Medical Technologies, CyteCare Hospitals, Max India and Nova Medical Centers. “We believe this new investment at this important juncture in our company’s development underscores the tremendous opportunity ahead. Working with Goldman Sachs, we are well-positioned to address the opportunities in front of us to become a leading, global player with comprehensive end-to-end solutions for drug discovery and development,” said Manni Kantipudi, CEO, Aragen Life Sciences. Rajat Sood, a managing director at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said Aragen was well positioned to benefit from the secular trend of increased outsourcing by the life sciences industry. “As an experienced global investor in the healthcare sector and India, we look forward to leveraging our worldwide network and experience to help expand Aragen’s portfolio of differentiated offerings and client base to accelerate the company’s growth,” said Michael Bruun, a managing director at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

Chacko, who had quit the Congress after falling out with the party leadership, replaces T P Peethambaran as the state president of the NCP. A section of NCP activists had been demanding the replacement of Peethambaran, and the national leadership of the NCP decided to appoint Chacko as the new president. NCP national president Sharad Pawar’s decision to appoint him as the NCP state president was officially communicated to the local leadership by national general secretary of the party Praful Patel, on Wednesday. Responding to the portfolio allocation for the NCP in the LDF ministry, Chacko said that the party is satisfied with the forests and wildlife portfolio as it is an important department. The party was holding the transport portfolio in the last LDF ministry. He said that there would be no sharing of portfolio with the party’s second MLA and former NCP leader’s brother Thomas K Thomas, and A K Saseendran would be the minister for the full five-year term. He said that there is no discussion going on regarding re-inducting Mani C Kappan back into the NCP. He added that Kappan had acted against the party’s line that NCP should continue in the LDF. Chacko said that in the coming days, more leaders from the Congress will join the NCP. Chacko, who had been an MP multiple times on Congress ticket from the state, had left the party before the assembly elections citing that there is intense groupism in the party and all the assembly tickets were divided on the basis of groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/chacko-named-ncp-state-chief/articleshow/82780935.cms||---

The situation is the same for most other slum dwellers.Now, Rotary Club of Nagpur Vision (RCNV) has pitched in to help residents of this slum by raising funds to buy ration kits for them. On Wednesday, they distributed kits to the slum dwellers, comprising ration and other items of daily use.A fortnight after Maharashtra’s current Covid-19 restrictions came into force, TOI had reported on the plight of city’s slum dwellers as they have begun to go hungry again.Like in 2020, this year too the city witnessed lockdown like restrictions from March, but there were no arrangements for free ration kits or cooked food for people staying in city’s slums. Dwellers were asking whether daily supply of even khichdi could be arranged as was done during the 2020 lockdown?After TOI’s report, some citizens felt the need to do something to provide ration kits to dwellers of Siddeshwari Nagar slum.Donations poured in from various quarters, even working adults, children and friends of some TOI readers from abroad, contributed with open hands. Members of RCNV raised a handsome amount. Center for Sustainable Development volunteered to help manage distribution of grocery kits.Jatin Sampat, president, RCNV, and Leena Buddhe of Center for Sustainable Development, were present to oversee the distribution of grocery kits to people of Siddeshwari Nagar slum.The coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdown has affected us in many ways, but it has affected the poor and marginalised sections of the society the most. “It has resulted in an economic crisis, resulting in loss of livelihoods of daily wage workers and migrant labourers,” said Buddhe.Kabir Madavi and other dwellers from the slum expressed gratitude to RCNV members for their generous help.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-toi-report-rotary-club-gives-ration-kits-to-slum-dwellers/articleshow/82776681.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Authorities at the private hospital suspect the incident could be linked to a decision to drive ambulances out of the hospital premises as its drivers — all residents of Jadavpur or Sonarpur — were found to be involved in multiple malpractices. The damaged vehicles belong Sukumar Sarkar. Police are investigating the case. Trouble has been brewing in the hospital premises after the hospital lodged a complaint with police against malpractices a week ago. Cops subsequently busted an oxygen meter flow gang that was selling the device for Rs 9,000 after purchasing them for Rs 1,200. The hospital thereafter issued an order on parking of ambulances within the complex from 12 to just four. Three of them parked on Tuesday night belonged to Sarkar. “The attack was predetermined. The drivers were involved in the oxygen flow meter work for an individual who owns seven ambulances that used to be parked in the hospital. He suspects I had complained against him and thus the revenge,” said Sarkar. Police are reviewing CCTV footage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ambulance-hearse-van-damaged-in-hosp/articleshow/82780932.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Goa||After joining hands with oppn, PMC chief to stay with BJP||Panaji: Former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Ponda block president Shantaram Kolvenkar on Wednesday rushed to meet party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade and chief minister Pramod Sawant to clarify his stand. On Tuesday, Tanavade had expelled Kolvenkar from the post of Ponda block president. Kolvenkar was expelled after he defeated his own party candidate to win the position of chairperson of Ponda Municipal Council (PMC). Kolvenkar joined hands with opposition parties Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and Goa Forward Party (GFP) to defeat BJP candidate Ritesh Naik. On Wednesday, Kolvenkar met Sawant at his private resident in Sakhali followed by a visit to Tanavade’s residence in Tivim. Kolvenkar clarified that he has no intentions to part with BJP. Kolvenkar had shared the stage with MGP’s Ramkrishna Dhavalikar, which may have raised doubts over his intentions to continue with BJP. Ritesh, son of Ponda Congress legislator Ravi Naik, had recently joined BJP. He was favoured for the post of chairperson by BJP, while Kolvenkar had also expressed interest. On Tuesday, BJP Ponda block president Shantaram Kolvenkar joined five MGP-backed councillors and two GFP-backed councillors to win the post with eight votes against seven votes of Ritesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-joining-hands-with-oppn-pmc-chief-to-stay-with-bjp/articleshow/82782867.cms||---

A MSEDCL staffer, Manohar Pawar (42), died while repairing a feeder at Vasai. However, several areas in Palghar and Sindhudurg had restoration work “in progress” and many consumers were still without power supply on Wednesday. Some residents said that they were without electricity for more than 53 hours. State energy minister Nitin Raut has directed MSEDCL to deploy additional staff from Kolhapur, Baramati and other zones to expedite restoration in two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-power-back-in-85-of-affected-areas-in-mmr/articleshow/82782880.cms||Somit Sen
---||Goa||All eyes on May 27 special meet to elect Margao’s civic chief, deputy||Margao: The special meeting of the Margao Municipal Council (MMC) to elect the chairperson and vice-chairperson will be held on May 27. A notice to this effect was issued on Wednesday by the director of urban development Gurudas Pilarnekar. The meeting will be presided over by the inspector general of prisons Srinet Kotwale. The meeting to elect the chairperson and vice-chairperson was earlier scheduled to be held on May 10. However, as several of the newly-elected councillors were infected by Covid-19, the meeting was postponed. With the Margao Civic Alliance forged between Goa Forward Party (GFP) and Congress winning 17 of the 25 seats of the Margao Municipal Council (MMC), all eyes are now on which of the alliance partner claims the coveted post of the chairperson. With GFP’s Fatorda Forward panel winning nine seats, one more than the tally of seats won by Congress’s Model Margao, GFP president is likely to make the first move over the choice of the candidate for the chairperson, sources said. However, the Congress panel is also determined to have one of its veteran councillors elected as chairperson. Sources said that negotiations were being worked out, and one of the proposals being discussed was to have the chairperson and vice chairperson’s posts rotated alternately between GFP and Congress candidates during the five-year term. Though names of a couple of councillors were making the rounds, no official word has come out from either of the two alliance partners so far. In the 2015 elections, where a similar alliance was formed by GFP and Congress, 11 candidates from GFP’s had won, while Kamat’s panel ‘Model Margao’ had won in six wards. The power sharing formula between GFP and Congress had resulted in GFP-backed Babita Angle Prabhudesai getting elected as chairperson, and Kamat-backed Dorris Texiera as her deputy. However, following a change in political equations after GFP joined the BJP-led government in 2017, GFP’s Tito Cardozo replaced Texiera as the vice-chairperson, allowing GFP to have complete dominion over the Margao municipality. Sardesai managed to assert his supremacy over the council throughout the term despite his ouster from the BJP-led government in July 2019. A change of guard saw Pooja Naik holding the reins of the council from November 2019 until the end of the tenure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/all-eyes-on-may-27-special-meet-to-elect-margaos-civic-chief-deputy/articleshow/82782868.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The worst hit are kids who may face losing out a seat in their schools as the surviving parent tries to cope on a shoe-string budget in the near future.To protect the academic future of such students, a unique initiative in Nagpur has been started by a group of ‘good Samaritans’ who have pledged to fund education of kids whose families have been hit hard due to Covid-19.And, they wish to remain anonymous for now.Despite being anonymous, the way they will still reach out to those in need is by collaborating with a Nagpur-based principals’ association, which will help identify kids who are in desperate need of funding for either school or junior college fees.School Headmasters Charitable Association (SHCA), an association which represents aided schools from English, Hindi, Marathi and Urdu medium, will collect data from their members regarding students who have lost the sole earning parent. Zafar Khan, founder-president of SHCA, said, “It’s a wonderful initiative which has been started by a group of responsible Nagpurians. We will provide all the necessary information and even contemplate creating funds from our side too.”Ashnarayan Tiwari, executive member of the association, said, “We will be actively collecting information from all nearby localities and slums to screen for genuine candidates.”This screening of candidates will help the Samaritans focus simply on funding the kids’ education. One of the members of the donor group said, “With the principals’ association being involved, it will help us tremendously as our entire groundwork is now taken care of. We will get information on who is the candidate, what are the requirements and following this, we will take necessary steps.”Though the initiative started just a few days ago over a few phone calls from friends, they have already started looking at candidates who require help. “We have received information about an auto driver who passed away and his wife does not earn. So, we are now working on helping the children continue their education. Our focus in on such single parent children who fall through the cracks in the system. Apart from this, we are also open to helping those who parents have lost their jobs and are unable to pay fees,” said the member.All funding will be done for the end receiver and no cash shall be given to family. “This is to maintain transparency and accountability. So, we will deposit fee directly with the school rather than handout cash to family members,” said the member.But with all the donors chosoing to be anonymous, how can general Nagpurians help? “If you know about such a child, then please contact his/her school principal who will then inform the SHCA, and ultimately we will get to know about it,” said the group member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/good-samaritans-to-help-fund-education-of-kids-from-covid-hit-families/articleshow/82776692.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Goa||Power dept staff have no safety gear: Cong||Panaji: The electricity department and the fire and emergency services have done an outstanding job in helping the state recover from Cyclone Tauktae, but the ministers have shirked their responsibility, said Congress on Wednesday. The party said that power minister Nilesh Cabral, PWD minister Deepak Pauskar and agriculture minister Chandrakant Kavlekar have been missing when they were needed the most by people. Congress general secretary in Goa Amarnath Panjikar said that the widespread devastation caused by the cyclone has paralysed life, and has proved that the BJP government’s disaster management plan is dead. He also said that it is shocking to see power department staff working without basic equipment while toiling at night to restore electricity. “The electricity department is suffering from paralysis with no manpower, no vehicles, non-availability of ladders, cranes and other electrical equipments and raw material. There are no electricity poles available in stock to replace those which have collapsed in the cyclone,” said Panjikar. The party has demanded that Cabral must accept responsibility and step down immediately. Pauskar and Kavlekar are not traceable, said Panjikar, while pointing out that farmers have lost their crops and incurred huge losses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/power-dept-staff-have-no-safety-gear-cong/articleshow/82782877.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The crew members Arun (36), S Francis (58) and Surender (64) were rescued from the Indian fishing boat (IFB) Badhriya in a search and rescue (SAR) operation carried out by the personnel onboard ICG ship Vikram. Though they were rescued on Saturday night, they were onboard the ship for four days under medical treatment to recover the trauma. They were handed over to the fisheries officials from Thalassery after the ship reached New Mangalore Port on Tuesday. The boat was stranded at high seas during cyclone Tauktae and the CG located them during an aerial search. They were provided counselling too onboard the ship. CG is continuing its air-sea coordinated operations in the Arabian Sea for SAR operations to find missing fishing boats and fishermen. Several fishing boats from other states were provided shelter along Kerala and Lakshadweep coasts. Indian Coast Guard control room at Kochi has been coordinating all operations for providing timely help to fishermen at sea and can be contacted at at 0484-2218969 and email dhq4@indiancoastguard.nic.in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cg-bring-three-rescued-fishermen-to-shore/articleshow/82780979.cms||---

Sources said Baijal reviewed the management of Covid situation, along with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia, chief secretary, municipal commissioners and Delhi Police officers. While expressing satisfaction at the improvement in the overall situation in Delhi, Baijal said the guard cannot be lowered and necessary measures and preparedness to deal with any eventuality should be undertaken. The LG also asked officials concerned to ensure that distributors and retailers of drugs and equipment related to Covid are made to mandatorily display their stocks and prices. Sources said it was felt that regular monitoring and status update of distribution of free ration and money disbursal to labour under the schemes announced at the beginning of the lockdown would ensure their effective delivery to the people in need. Baijal instructed that compressed timelines for setting up of oxygen plants in hospitals that can be monitored, apart from other related infrastructure should be put in place immediately, they added. According to sources, the LG said that testing, especially RT-PCR, should not go down, since owing to the lockdown, the number of rapid antigen tests had naturally dipped. He stressed that preparedness of hospital infrastructure to deal with future eventualities should take into account all possible scenarios.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lg-ensure-availability-of-drugs-display-of-covid-equipment-stock/articleshow/82782885.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covid curbs shadow over ongoing Metro projects in West Bengal||KOLKATA: The ongoing restrictions have cast a shadow on some crucial Metro projects that were headed for commissioning early or the middle of next year. Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), implementing most of the city’s Metro corridors, has written to various government authorities, seeking leeway under the current close down. Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), too, is planning to write to the government so that Metro constructions can be clubbed with essential services. The implementing agency of the Rs 8,575.9 crore East-West Metro project hurriedly completed the tunnelling at Bowbazar on Saturday to beat the restrictions. The agency was eyeing on an extension of the East-West Metro that will eventually join Sector V and Howrah Maidan, till Sealdah by the end of the year. But the current restrictions may affect the continuity of the constructions. To extend the 7km Sector V-Phoolbagan stretch by another 1km till Sealdah and add more riders, the Metro station coming up inside the Sealdah railway station should be completed. A part of the railway station is still uncovered while the tunnel borer and other equipment, used for the tunnelling till Bowbazar, need to be extracted through the Sealdah Metro station shaft. “In the absence of labourers, this can’t be done. The overall project has also slowed down. This may also affect June 2022 deadline of the entire 16km corridor,” said a KMRC official. RVNL, too, is in a fix. “The ongoing restrictions would defer our plans to open the 5km New Garia-Ruby section of the New Garia-Airport Metro,” a senior official said. The construction of the Kavi Sukanta station at the Abhishikta crossing off EM Bypass has come to a standstill. The filling of the viaduct gap leading to the station has also been halted. Work of the terminal, Kavi Subhas station, has also stopped. Work on the Joka-Taratala section of Joka-Esplanade corridor has also met the same fate. The construction of the terminal at Joka has been stalled from Sunday. “We have written to various agencies, including Kolkata Police and KMDA, to exempt Metro constructions from the restrictions. If the restrictions are not lifted for our sector, all these sections, which were headed for early or mid-2022 commissioning, are going to be affected. It’s not easy to bring back the same momentum after a lull period,” said a senior RVNL official. The restrictions have also cast a shadow on the Noapara-Barasat via Airport corridor, which had been progressing at a renewed pace over the last few months even during the pandemic. Metro Railway, the umbrella organization for the city’s rapid transit system, had hoped to commission Phase 1 (Noapara-Bimanbandar stretch), covering 7km, in the next two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-curbs-shadow-over-ongoing-metro-projects/articleshow/82780975.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

But now a mushroom species, touted to be one of the costliest in the world, has also turned out to be of medicinal value. Scientists at Kutch-based Gujarat Institute of Desert Ecology (GUIDE) have successfully cultivated – ‘cordyceps militaris’ – a mushroom species that traditionally found its use in Chinese and Tibetan herbal medicines. The scientists grew the mushrooms in 35 jars in a controlled environment in a laboratory within 90 days giving 350 grams yield. The mushroom is valued at Rs 1.50 lakh a kg. The institute which has found it useful in treating even breast cancer has decided to provide training to entrepreneurs at a very nominal fee as a livelihood option to cultivate mushrooms at laboratory scale. “C. militaris is known as Himalayan gold. It has a multitude of health benefits and can potentially prevent a wide range of lifestyle illness. The fungus is club-shaped and the surface appears roughly punctured. The inner fungal tissue is whitish to pale orange. It is now possible to cultivate it in labs under controlled conditions,” said GUIDE’s director V Vijay Kumar. The institute has studied the antitumor element of this mushroom variety in detail. “We explored the in-vivo anticancer activity of the extracts against breast cancer in animal models. This was done in coordination with Nirma University, Ahmedabad. The preliminary investigation reveals extracts of this mushroom can provide significant results in terms of reduction in breast cancer tumour,” said K Karthikeyan, senior scientist and head of environment laboratory division at GUIDE. The institute has sought regulatory permission to carry out clinical trials on humans. “We are also studying its effect on prostate cancer but it has been delayed due to Covid-19 induced pandemic,” he said. Plans are to test anti-viral and anti-cancer properties of this species in Indian conditions. “With proper awareness, we can make this wonderful nutritional and medicinal supplement available to a broader population,” said V Vijay Kumar, adding that GUIDE scientist G Jayanti and professor Jigna Shah from Nirma University were also part of this study. Training of mushroom cultivation at laboratory scale costs as high as Rs one lakh a week. But GUIDE will provide this training at a normal charge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/guj-scientists-grow-one-of-costliest-mushrooms/articleshow/82778792.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Goa||Tejpal case verdict deferred yet again||Panaji: Within a span of 3 weeks, the additional sessions court at Mapusa deferred for the third time the pronouncement of verdict in the alleged rape case against Tehelka founder editor Tarun Tejpal. Judge Kshama Joshi fixed May 21 for passing the order. Speaking to TOI, special public prosecutor Francisco Tavora said that due to power cuts in view of Cyclone Tauktae, the case was adjourned. On April 27, the court deferred the passing of judgment to May 12. However, on May 12, it was announced that the court will pass an order on May 19. The case witnessed many twists and turns. On November 7 and 8, 2013, Tejpal allegedly sexually assaulted a woman at an event organised by Tehelka at a starred hotel in north Goa. On November 22, Goa Police lodged a suo motu FIR against Tejpal. Tejpal turned up in Goa on November 28, 2013 and was arrested on November 30 after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected. He was granted interim bail on May 19, 2014 to attend the cremation of his mother and since then, had been out of jail. In July 2014, Tejpal was granted bail. In September 2017, a Mapusa court framed charges against him for allegedly raping a junior colleague in November 2013. Tejpal had pleaded not guilty, paving the way for a trial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tejpal-case-verdict-deferred-yet-again/articleshow/82782882.cms||---
---||Kochi||Southwest monsoon likely in Andaman Sea by Friday||KOCHI: India meteorological department (IMD) has said that the southwest monsoon is likely to advance into south Andaman Sea and adjoining southeast Bay of Bengal around May 21. Even as the conditions are becoming favourable for the entry of the southwest monsoon, a cyclonic circulation is forming over southeast Bay of Bengal. It could form into a low-pressure area around May 22 and likely intensify gradually into a cyclonic storm during the subsequent 72 hours. It is very likely to move northwestwards and reach West Bengal and Odisha coasts around May 26 evening. It will be a rainy week all through for Kerala with thunderstorms and lightning accompanied by gusty wind speed reaching 30-40kmph very likely in a few places in the state till May 23. On Wednesday, Manjeri and Thalassery recorded the highest rainfall of 5cm each while Neyyattinkara, Kollam and Idukki got 4cm. Perumbavoor and Irikkur received 3cm rainfall. Squally wind speed reaching 40-50kmph gusting to 60kmph is likely over southwest Arabian Sea. The IMD had forecast that this year, the onset of the southwest monsoon over Kerala is likely to be on May 31. Last year, the IMD had forecast the onset on June 1 whereas the actual onset was on June 5. Private weathercaster Skymet had forecast the likely onset to be on May 30 with a model error of two days. It had said that ‘Tauktae’ will vacate the Indian region by May 22, following which the westerly winds and cross-equatorial flow will strengthen over the Arabian Sea. This will be assisted by the MJO (Madden Julian Oscillation) entering the Indian Ocean with moderate amplitude. Pre-monsoon showers will be intense and hefty over Kerala. Skymet officials said that they expect the upcoming monsoon to be ‘healthy normal’ to the tune of 103% of the long period average (LPA) of 880.6mm from June to September. This would make it the third-consecutive year of normal or above-normal monsoon. “The present weather in Kerala itself is indicative of the pre-monsoon conditions, especially the wind pattern. The Bay of Bengal system could help the formation of the southwest monsoon,” said S Abhilash, associate director, ST-radar centre, Cochin University. “As of now, there are no indications of any cyclone formations during the monsoon period, unlike last year. However, there will be depressions and low-pressure systems as the southwest monsoon begins its journey from Kerala on to the rest of the country,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sw-monsoon-likely-in-andaman-sea-by-friday/articleshow/82781049.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

The number of Covid deaths was low at one in SECR and 13 in Central Railway.“In the first wave, there was no vaccine and facilities like RT-PCR testing and Covid beds with railway hospitals were not available, but still cases were less. In contrast, several facilities are in place and vaccine is also available, yet there is a huge rise in the number of deaths and infection cases,” said Gour.Another reason for increase in cases during the second wave is the operation of passenger trains. Even though trains are being operated with restricted movement, many frontline staff like TTEs and station masters have been infected by the coronavirus. Gour said, “As per All India Station Masters Association, 2,000 railway frontline workers (FLWs) and over 140 station masters have died due to Covid-19. Last year, there was complete lockdown and only freight trains operated.”Citing all these factors, Gour has demanded expediting vaccination of railway employees. As per RTI, only 50% employees have been vaccinated. There are over 27,500 employees in both SECR and Central Railway divisions.“However, only 16,400 employees in both the divisions have been vaccinated with the first dose. We are not talking about vaccinating family members of the employees. Despite being declared FLWs, vaccination of the staff is going at a snail’s pace. The RTI figures speak for themselves. Vaccination of staff should be done on war footing as Covid-19 has spread in rural areas alarmingly,” said Gour. The CMS of Central Railway Hospital, Dr Champak Biswas, said, “Availability of doses is not an issue. Second dose is being delayed as the government has extended the gap between two doses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-deaths-cases-up-in-rlys-amid-2nd-wave/articleshow/82776723.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Utpal Bhadury’s daughter has moved West Bengal Human Rights Commission against this “shocking and disrespectful” behaviour. A COPD patient, Bhadury was admitted on May 12 with Covid symptoms. “He would tell me how they kept him in soiled sheets and did not help him eat, not bothering that he can’t see,” said daughter Priyanka, a part-time faculty of stress management at Jadavpur University. On Tuesday, according to her complaint, the hospital released the patient without clothes. “With shops being shut, we couldn’t buy anything. The staff refused to let him wear hospital clothes and discharged him without pants. Our ambulance driver helped with a bed cover,” the complaint read. Chairman of the commission Justice Girish Gupta said, “If true, this is a gross insult to human dignity, but we will have to investigate.” The hospital denied charges. “There is a CCTV footage that shows he is being wheeled out in hospital clothes. We asked them to send the clothes back… they left the clothes outside the ambulance… there was gross misunderstanding. Can we release anyone without clothes?” said hospital CEO J Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/patients-kin-allege-medical-negligence/articleshow/82780981.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Hyderabad||Masks at home must for recovered Covid diabetics||Hyderabad: Diabetic Covid-19 patients who have recovered still need to wear masks even at home for few months, top health officials said. Recovered patients, especially immunocompromised ones, mostly in cases of diabetes have low immunity levels, and steroids can make them more vulnerable, according to experts. “It is better to use mask for at least two months as fungal particles will be in air, especially where there is dust,” Dr Ramesh Reddy, director of medical education (DME) said. Dr Reddy however made it clear that black fungus is not contagious it can attack only patients whose immunity levels are compromised. If the fungus reaches beyond mucous and lungs and brain, the chances of survival are less. “It is better to observe symptoms like facial pain, then it can be treated quicker,” Dr Reddy said.  A three-member expert committee will also decide the treatment protocol and injections for black fungus patients. All private hospitals treating such patients will have to apply to the committee and based on their permission, they can procure injections from private stockists. Now, the health department is prescribing two injections for treatment of black fungus, followed by medicine for some more time. Amphotericin is being preferred over traditional variety of similar injection which was in existence since more than seven decades. “The traditional version of amphotericin has more complications after usage” Dr Ramesh Reddy said. Experts said that contrary to the popular perception that just injections are enough to treat black fungus, treatment requires prolonged medical care. “It takes one or two months more with regular follow up,” Dr Karunakar Reddy, vice chancellor of Kaloji Narayan Rao, University of Health Sciences added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/masks-at-home-must-for-recovered-covid-diabetics/articleshow/82782686.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Out of funds, patients land up at Koti hospital for black fungus treatment||Hyderabad: Unable to afford the treatment at private facilities, an increasing number of patients suffering from mucormycosis fungal infection (known as black fungus), are landing up at the Government ENT Hospital. On Wednesday too, several family members of those affected were seen waiting at the hospital in King Koti, to get their kin admitted. “We came to Hyderabad from Karimnagar 15 days ago to get my cousin treated for Covid-19. While he was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Banjara hills, he developed black fungus. Now, he has to undergo a surgery for it but we cannot afford to get that done at the private facility, where we have already paid Rs 7 lakh for his Covid-19 treatment. So, we have come here for the procedure,” said the patient’s relative, Suresh Bollam. Another patient’s attendant, Naveen Kumar, was also seen waiting at the government facility to get his brother operated upon. He said the family, who came from Nanded, had spent around Rs 5 lakh so far on his brother’s Covid-19 treatment and tests for mucormycosis. “After we exhausted our resources, we came here,” said Kumar. Doctors at the hospital admitted to a rush of patients from neighbouring states over the last few days. “We are seeing many patients coming all the way from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh for treatment. Many patients who have been under treatment at private hospitals in the city so far are also coming here now either for injections or seeking admission after being turned away by other hospitals,” said Dr Manish Gupta, resident medical officer at the Koti hospital. “At this rate, the load of patients at the hospital is expected to go up from the current 50 to 200 over the next two-three days,” he added. The fast depleting stocks of the crucial liposomal amphotericin injection prescribed for the treatment of black fungus, meanwhile, is becoming another reason for concern. “With the present stock we can manage for another day, but unless it is replenished it will become a problem,” Dr Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/out-of-funds-patients-land-up-at-koti-hospital-for-black-fungus-treatment/articleshow/82782662.cms||Amrita Didyala

All companies approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) are allowed to participate in the process, aimed at procurement of around one crore doses in a six-month span. Companies can prepare their bids from May 21 while technical bidding will close by 6 pm on June 4. Details of the process will be available on Telangana e-tenders website. The date for opening of financial bids is yet to be finalised while the date of completion for examining financial bids will also be announced later. Through a process of competitive bidding, the company quoting a lower price will be selected which will then have to supply 15 lakh doses a month. The government has proposed free-of-cost vaccination for frontline workers, people with co-morbidities, senior citizens and those aged over 18. Telanagana has already purchased four lakh vaccine doses from private companies but the vaccination drive in the state is still on hold. Officials explained that the state is looking at more supply of vaccine doses in order to ensure a uninterrupted drive once it resumes. “There are three lakh people who need the second dose of Covaxin in the state. After the supply from Centre improves, everyone will be given the second dose,” said state finance minister T Harish Rao. He said that there was no emergency requirement for Covishield doses as the schedule had been adjusted. The minister added the state does not have a shortage of oxygen, ventilators, and remdesivir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-floats-global-e-tender-for-procurement-of-vaccines/articleshow/82782743.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Delhi||Delhi: 242% rise in registered April deaths from last year||NEW DELHI: The comparison of death registration data for April 2020 and 2021 reveals a large increase of 242% between the two years. The three municipal corporations reported 4,441 death registrations in April last year, while there were 10,750 registrations this year with the city facing an onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic. North Delhi Municipal Corporation recorded 2,388 death registrations in April last year and 5,168 this April. Similarly, the death registration figure in SDMC increased from 1,383 last year to 3,351 this year. In EDMC too, there was a big increase in death registrations from 670 to 2,231 between April last year and this year. Cumulatively, an additional 6,309 deaths were registered this year, around 2.5 times the figure of last year. The actual increase is likely to be much higher. Senior corporation officials said that the real divergence between the two periods will become fully clear when the Covid infection rate diminishes and the situation normalises to an extent. It is then that families of Covid victims will be able to apply for their death certificates. “The peak of Covid funerals was apparent in the last week of April. The families affected at that time would have applied for death registrations only after that, so the death numbers will be reflected in the May report,” explained an official. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash attributed Covid fatalities for the big increase in death registrations this year. “We saw an increase in both Covid and non-Covid funerals in recent months,” he said. “The actual increase in death in comparison with last year will only become clear after things normalise and families are able to complete the process of registering the deaths in their families. Right now, only those who need the death certificate for some purposes would have applied for them on an urgent basis. We estimate that around 20,000 funerals took place in April and May.” The difference in the death registration figures of two years gives an indication of the human toll in the massive second wave of Covid intensity in Delhi. “Around 65% of deaths in this period are likely due to Covid. Never in recent history have we registered more than 10,000 deaths in a single month,” an official said. The number of Covid-protocol funerals peaked on April 29, when 717 final rites were conducted that day. Currently, there are 300-350 Covid funerals per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/242-rise-in-registered-april-deaths-from-last-yr/articleshow/82782947.cms||Paras Singh

Your lease for the space should be cancelled and you should be disbanded. You are here just to publish your names in the media. We will direct your office space to be handed back to the government, as you are a defunct body not helping out in the pandemic,” the judges said.The bench directed Nagpur and Amravati divisional commissioners to obtain the entire information regarding the availability of CSR funds with all Vidarbha companies through District Industries Centre (DIC) joint director after verification.“We direct both to make a request for the CSR funds to all these companies and submit their responses during the next hearing. The response that HC has received so far from these companies isn’t encouraging. If these companies haven’t so far responded to the call given by HC, we would have to issue necessary directives for waking them up and answer the call of their duty,” the court warned.Condemning the attitude of companies that failed to respond to VIA’s communication, the judges called on to remove them from the list of industries if they couldn’t come forward even for noble causes.“The people are dying due to lack of medicines, oxygen and beds. The medical fraternity has been working tirelessly since over a year. They have forgotten their holidays, festivals, public functions and even their families. We need to help them. VIA should have called an emergency meeting and told directors of the company regarding HC’s directives. This is the best opportunity to spend the CSR funds,” the justices said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/judges-pull-up-via-on-inability-to-get-csr-data-from-members/articleshow/82776738.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Hyderabad||Govt: Covid +ve report not mandatory for admission||Hyderabad: The Telangana government, on Wednesday, issued orders mandating all hospitals to admit Covid-19 patients — or even those suspected to have contracted the coronavirus — and begin their treatment, including oxygen therapy, without any preconditions. “Requirement of a positive test for Covid-19 virus is not mandatory for admission into a health facility. A suspect case shall be admitted into the suspect ward as the case may be,” the order, issued in compliance with the National Policy for Admission in Hospitals of the centre, stated. According to it hospitals can no longer refuse services to any patient on any count. “This includes medications such as oxygen and essential drugs, even if the patient belongs to a different city. No patient shall be refused services on the ground that he/she is unable to produce a valid identity card , that does not belong to the city where the hospital is located,” the directive added. The move that comes close on the heels of a recent incident where ambulances from Andhra Pradesh were turned away from the boarder, is likely to bring much relief to patients — even those from other cities — scrambling for beds in the state, especially in Hyderabad hospitals. The latest order states that admission in hospitals must be based on need and it should be ensured that beds are not occupied by persons who do not need hospitalisation. Also discharge has to be done in accordance with the revised discharge policy of the centre, the order specified. “All DMHO (District Medical and Health Officer)s are directed to see that the following guidelines are followed by all private hospitals managing Covid-19 patients, for admission into hospital,” the order added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-covid-ve-report-not-mandatory-for-admission/articleshow/82782705.cms||Amrita Didyala

It has now become clear that the water we use does have a role,” said a senior doctor from a corporate hospital in the city. The state health department, through a recent of guidelines, has also stressed on the need to use sterile water for oxygen supply. “Often mucormycosis is reported due to poor maintenance of humidifiers. Hence the standard operating procedure prescribed for strict adherence is to always use distilled or sterile water, never use un-boiled tap water nor mineral water. Water level should be checked twice daily and topped up if necessary,” read the guidelines issued by public health director, Dr G Srinivasa Rao. The guidelines also mandate filling water up to around 10 mm below the maximum line and not let the water level drop below the minimum line. The water in the humidifier should also be changed regularly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sterile-water-must-in-o2-humidifiers/articleshow/82782728.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Kurukshetra JBT teachers oppose Covid duty||Kurukshetra: Junior basic training (JBT) teachers in Kurukshetra district have opposed their duty being placed in Haryana villagers general health check-up scheme (HVGHCS). They say that they are not trained and vaccinated to provide services in pandemic-related schemes of the government. As per information, on May 11 Haryana directorate school education’s assistant director (AD) (academic) Kuldeep Mehta had instructed all district education officers (DEOs) of the state to depute science post graduate teachers (PGT) and trained graduate teachers (TGT) staff for patient care assistant under HVGHCS and national skill qualifications framework (NSQF). Accordingly, the DEOs were instructed to coordinate with the district chief medical officers (CMOs) by providing them a list of teachers, so that they can be added to the teams going to rural areas of Haryana for assisting in health check ups of the residents. “It should be assured that the teachers added in the health teams will provide full contribution in making the HVGHCS successful,” reads the instructions given in Hindi to DEO by the education directorate on May 11. Following on May 17, 2021, AD (academic) Kuldeep Mehta wrote a letter to director general (DG), health services, Haryana for including the teachers in Covid-19 vaccination. “The TGTs/PGTs of the school education department have been deputed for the implementation of HVGHCS. These teachers are required to deal with the public and perform duties as front line workers in the prevailing situation of pandemic. Keeping in view their health, you are requested to vaccinate these teachers on priority,” said the AD (adademic) to DG (health) Haryana. However, the JBT teachers in Kurukshetra alleged, “The department had instructed the DEOs to depute science subject teachers in the category. They were provided the training to work under HVGHCS and were also vaccinated. But to fulfill the number, the duties of JBTs are also being placed. This is being done despite the fact that the JBTs have not been providing any training and neither are they vaccinated like TGTs or PGTs.” As per sources, a list of 312 teachers was prepared in Thanesar, Babain, Pehowa, Shahabad and Ladwa blocks of Kurukshetra district, which included JBT, PGT and TGT teachers. As per the list, of the 312 teachers listed, 85 are JBTs. Irked over the decision, the Rajkiya Prathmik Sikshak Sangh Kurukshetra gave a memorandum of demand to Kurukshetra DEO and demanded that the duties of JBT teachers should be taken back from HVGHCS. The matter also reached the director of education, Haryana at Panchkula. Following, the director of school education, Haryana has issued another instruction to all the DEOs on Wednesday. “Under the HVGHCS and NSQF, the duties of PGTs and TGTs were placed but Rajkiya Prathmik Sikshak Sangh Haryana in its letter dated May 19, 2021, informed that apart from trained TGTs and PGTs, the JBTs are being forcibly deputed in the field and the government and administration are being misinformed. You are again instructed to place duties as per the instructions given on May 11.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kurukshetra-jbt-teachers-oppose-covid-duty/articleshow/82782909.cms||---

The lockdown and strict adherence to Covid-19 protocols are the major reasons behind this decline in cases. The decline in Covid-19 case numbers has been observed during the past one week across testing centres at Bolarum Cantonment General Hospital, Trimulgherry, Picket, and Bowenpally dispensaries. Officials said that earlier, on an average, around 70 to 100 persons would be tested every day at each centre of whom at least 40 would test positive. “Now, after the lockdown and other measures, around 10 people are testing positive every day,” said the in-charge of health officer at Picket. The health officer pointed out that while they are keeping centres open up to 4 pm, lockdown and other measures has resulted in a reduction in number of people coming for testing. Another health official explained that another reason behind the dip in cases is people staying indoors and social media platforms educating them on Covid-appropriate behaviours which are to be followed in order to keep themselves safe during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-cases-on-the-wane-in-cantonment/articleshow/82782859.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Scared of swabs? Now, Covid testing is just a gargle away||HYDERABAD: Scared of giving your nasopharyngeal (mouth and nose) swab for Covid-19 test as the process is irritating or painful? Soon, you can collect your own mouth sample comfortably and gargle your way for the Covid-19 test. Saline water gargle RT-PCR test, which was developed in the US and other countries during the first wave of Covid-19, is now available in India, thanks to the clearance given by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). This new test method is easy. Just take a few millilitres of saline water from a small glass container with a lid and gargle it for about 30 seconds. After gargling, put it back into the container and close the lid. The gargle sample will be analysed for the presence or absence of the genetic material of the novel coronavirus. This is a non-invasive method. There is no need for the sample collector or lab technician to wear a PPE kit. It also eliminates the process of cold pack transportation. The test works on the simple method i.e. collection of saliva through the gargle sample. It also brings down the duration of the test result. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation for the saline water gargle RT-PCR test, developed by an US company, in September last year. Nagpur-based environmental virology cell (EVC) of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) developed the test in India. “The ICMR has approved for the use of saline gargle RT-PCR test developed by NEERI for Covid-19 detection and advised NEERI to train other Covid-19 testing labs,” the EVC tweeted on Wednesday. Earlier, a group of researchers from the department of pathology and laboratory medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, published a research paper in preprint server ‘MedRxiv’ in October 2020 stating that the gargle direct coronavirus test method developed by them is “operationally simple, minimises pre-analytical sample processing and is potentially implementable by most molecular diagnostic laboratories.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/scared-of-swabs-now-covid-testing-is-just-a-gargle-away/articleshow/82782783.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Nagpur||Regulate production, distribution of black fungus drugs: HC||Nagpur: Concerned over the exponential rise in mucormycosis cases across India, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday asked the Centre to regulate production and distribution of its medicines from all 26 manufacturing companies to avoid shortage.A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote also requested the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) to issue directives for reducing prices of its medicines.“Mucormycosis cases have risen alarmingly and its treatment may be out of reach of several patients. There is yet another problem arising from the short supply of all drugs used for its treatment. It’s necessary that some steps are taken by the government to bring down the prices to an affordable level,” the bench stated.After intervener’s counsel M Anil Kumar furnished the Maharashtra government’s Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for mucormycosis treatment, the bench further directed to issue a detailed and more specific SOP that should include medicines that are inadvisable by the doctors.“On going through the present SOP, it’s seen that it does take care of the concerns expressed by the experts regarding toxicities of some of the drugs. However, considering the fact that some of them are highly toxic and affect kidney, it’s necessary that the detailed SOP for their prescription and use is issued.”While hearing a suo motu PIL based on TOI report where Shreerang Bhandarkar was appointed as amicus curiae along with Nidhi Dayani, the judges noted that medicines used for treating mucormycosis patients are quite costly and very high quantity of doses are required.Earlier, IMA counsel Bhanudas Kulkarni filed an application seeking directives to the respondents in view of black fungus affecting several patients after recovering from Covid-19.“In the last 15 days, 43 eyes have been removed and 26 deaths have taken place due to this disease. In the last two days, 109 new cases have been reported. IMA has obtained information from experts in the field and after collating it, has summarized those opinions in this application,” he said.Government pleader Ketki Joshi then submitted May 18 GR that included mucormycosis patients for availing the benefits under Mahatma Jyotiba Fule Jan Arogya Scheme.Kulkarni further pointed out from the report that although the spores of this fungus are present in the air, they badly hit the patients whose immunity has been reduced considerably, including weakness which develops after recovering from Covid-19 and due to misuse of steroids.‘Start awareness campaign to prevent spread’The HC directed Nagpur and Amravati divisional commissioners to immediately start an awareness campaign in Vidarbha to acquaint the public with the cause, effect and preventive measures to be taken to tackle black fungus.“IMA has already furnished guidelines to be followed to safeguard patients from the disease. The commissioners shall ensure that these guidelines are given wide publicity in Marathi, Hindi and English, their posters be pasted at different places, and those should be circulated in social media through public information officers,” the justices said before adjourning the hearing till May 27.The orders came after IMA contended that time has come now for the government to launch an awareness campaign regarding cause and symptoms and issue an advisory on precautions which can be widely published and also issue modified SOP for treatment of this disease. It also submitted that it’s necessary that all the hospitals are directed to maintain stricter norms of hygiene.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/regulate-production-distribution-of-black-fungus-drugs-hc/articleshow/82776755.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

They tried to pacify the groups who were pelting stones at each other. Some miscreants from both groups pelted stones on the two policemen, injuring Yashvantsinh. “The cops at the spot immediately called in additional force to quell the rioters,” police said. It took the cops an hour to bring the situation under control. “Both groups are neighbours living in Macchipith and are engaged in selling fish in the local market,” police said. “Though the exact reason behind the clash was not immediately known, but witnesses said that members of both groups were fighting over space on road to set up stall to sell fish and other items,” police added. Earlier, Morbi municipality had issued notices to the fish sellers asking them to vacate the road. Soon after the violence, police along with Morbi municipality officials razed over 40 road-side encroachments belonging to members of both the groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/tiff-over-space-to-sell-fish-leads-to-clash-four-injured/articleshow/82778937.cms||---

A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court on Wednesday found the accused, Shravan Rathod, a farmer, guilty of aggravated sexual assault. The maximum sentence the offence attracts is seven years’ imprisonment. Special Judge A D Deo also fined the man Rs 1,500. “The accused is informed about his right to appeal. The amount of Rs 1,000, if recovered from the accused, be given to victim as victim compensation,” the court said. It further said a copy of the judgment is to be given to the accused free of cost. The court added the time he has already served will be set off against the sentence. Rathod has been in jail since his arrest on May 10, 2018. His bail plea was denied this January. He was produced before the court through video-conferencing on Wednesday. Special public prosecutor Jyoti Sawant cited the evidence of three witnesses to seek the accused’s conviction. The child and her mother both deposed. The girl identified the accused in court. The FIR registered at a suburban police station said the mother was the informant in the case. It was submitted when the mother and the child were returning home around 8.15pm after a walk, holding each other’s hands, the accused approached them from the opposite direction. It was further alleged while he was passing them, he molested the child using both his hands. The mother immediately nabbed him and raised a hue and cry. A man who was passing by helped her keep a hold on the accused. The mother immediately took the accused to the police station, where she learnt his name and lodged an FIR against him. The accused denied the allegations and said he was falsely implicated in the case. The trial in the case commenced on February 22 this year and the mother was the first witness to depose. The child’s evidence was recorded four days later.

Civic solid waste management labourers removed trash weighing 62,010 kg from the city’s seven beaches (see box), almost 87% more than that collected barely two days ago on May 15 (33,110 kg). Interestingly, some beaches like Dadar had much more garbage than usual, while some like Juhu had much less. Citizen activists said more than the location of the beach, the direction of the tide mattered as it brought in the garbage. “These were not southwest monsoon winds and therefore, the tide and wind direction were different. So it is possible beaches which otherwise do not have garbage being thrown out in large amounts did so now,” said Zoru Bhathena, activist, adding that from his home in Juhu, he did not notice much garbage coming to the shore. The sea has only expelled what was accumulated within it, Bhathena pointed out. “With almost all drains open in the city, any garbage on the roads that is not cleared eventually lands in the sea. A simple solution would be to ensure that drains are well covered to protect litter from entering it,” he said. “Recently, during a visit to the pumping station, we noticed garbage entering the sea whenever the pumping station gates are opened. This is the same garbage that has been accumulating in the nullahs,” said Zahida Banatwala from the Juhu citizens welfare group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sea-piles-87-more-trash-on-7-beaches-on-day-of-cyclone-in-mumbai/articleshow/82784643.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Delhi||Lockdown prevents jams in face of waterlogging||New Delhi: While desilting of drains still remains a work in progress, the incessant rain all through the day under the cyclonic impact led to waterlogging on many arterial stretches in the city on Wednesday. While some buildings collapsed partially, the municipal corporations also recorded a few cases of tree felling. North Delhi Municipal Corporation says waterlogging complaints were received from Himmat Garh, Sita Ram Bazar, Humdard Road, Asaf Ali Road, Ravidas Colony and Sarai Pipal Thalla among other places, while tree felling was reported at Crime Branch Road, sectors 8 and 18 in Rohini, and Lake View Apartment near Sector 9. Three cases of partial building collapse have been reported from Police Colony near Idgah Road, Kishan Ganj in Gulabi Bagh and Rani Bagh in Shakurpur. Waterlogging was also reported on the regular defaulting stretches such as Rohtak Road, Najafgarh Road, Pankha Road and parts of Dwarka. Because of the Covid lockdown, no traffic jam was reported despite waterlogging. The civic report only includes only those cases in which complaints have been made and inner colony roads often remain out of it despite acute waterlogging. South Delhi Municipal Corporation claimed no incident of waterlogging had been reported while the east corporation recorded only one incident in Harsh Vihar in Mandoli. However, while the monsoon is still away, the blame game has started. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said while he had directed officials to clear the drains, Delhi government should also order the irrigation and flood department and the public works department to clean bigger drains. “Even the smaller drains under the corporations have outfall in bigger drains and if these are blocked, people will be inconvenienced,” he added. A PWD official said that during the last monsoon, suction pumps were installed at all waterlogging points. “Those machines have been helpful in clearing the roads today as well. It took us a few hours to clear out all the roads from where waterlogging was reported,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lockdown-prevents-jams-in-face-of-waterlogging/articleshow/82781246.cms||---

But in the middle of the second wave of the pandemic, many people in Hyderabad are being forced to haggle and pay hefty amounts to crematorium caretakers to have the final rites of their family members performed. The government rules are clear. Final rites of a person who dies in a government hospital are conducted for free. For those who die in private hospitals, not more than Rs 8,000 can be charged at cremation grounds. And yet people are paying anywhere between Rs 25,000 and Rs 70,000 for each cremation. The money is, of course, paid in cash and there is no receipt.

In normal years, it was“My father died a day after he was admitted to the hospital. When we enquired about cremation at the hospital, they quoted Rs 70,000,” said the man, a resident of Yousufguda. “People were indeed charged up to Rs 25,000 for Covid-19 cremations until last month, but we recently organised a meeting and asked the crematorium workers to not collect more than Rs 8, 000 in case a person died at private hospitals,” said R Upender, zonal commissioner, LB Nagar. “For those who died at government hospitals and unclaimed bodies, cremations are conducted for free. We have also directed them to conduct cremations free of cost to those hailing from economically backward families by using donated wood or gas crematoriums.” But NGOs, helping families with Covid-19 final rites, say that they still receive quite a few calls from families enquiring about cremations saying that they can’t afford to pay exorbitant amounts.

All these slots have been reserved for the second-dose beneficiaries to complete their vaccination. However, if sufficient vaccines are available, the first dose will still be administered to those above 45 years who will book a vaccination slot through the CoWin portal. “Keeping in view the limited allocation of Government of India stock of Covaxin for the remaining part of the month of May, it has been decided that in the government Covid vaccination centres for 45 years+/HCWs/FLWs, all the on-spot slots be reserved only for second-dose beneficiaries with effect from May 19,” an order issued by the health and family welfare department on Tuesday stated. A district immunisation officer said the order reached them on Wednesday afternoon. By then, many first-dose walk-ins were already allowed, but it was immediately stopped. Many beneficiaries who had turned up for the first dose were asked to go home, the officer added. “From Thursday, no walk-in will be allowed for first-dose beneficiaries.” Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi said vaccination for 18-44 age group would be halted two days from now as Covishield’s stock would last only three days and Covaxin’s stock was already over. For those above 45 and healthcare/frontline workers, Covaxin’s stock is left for one day and Covishield’s for three days, she added. Delhi government will have to temporarily shut down nearly 350 centres administering Covishield after two days, Atishi said, claiming neither the Centre nor the vaccine manufacturers had said anything about fresh supply for the 18-44 age group. On Tuesday, 1,05,357 vaccines, including 88,332 first doses, were administered. Delhi has administered 48,00,705 doses till now and 10,94,619 people have received both shots.

---||Delhi||AAP government was not serious about oxygen needs of patients: BJP||NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, leader of the opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and two MPs on Wednesday accused the AAP government of oxygen mismanagement and claimed that it cost many lives. Saying that Delhi’s oxygen consumption as per population was far higher than the rest of the country, they demanded an oxygen audit. The BJP functionaries asked how the requirement of oxygen in Delhi suddenly decreased from 976MT to 582MT as soon as the Supreme Court pointed towards the oxygen audit. “When INOX was supplying oxygen to 45 hospitals in Delhi, it was ordered to supply only to 17 hospitals instead,” Gupta claimed and asked the government to explain. Gupta said while states like Maharashtra, Gujarat and MP, which had 70,000-80,000 Covid cases, were able to treat people with about 230-300 MT oxygen, Delhi was demanding 976 MT oxygen when there were around 1 lakh active Covid cases. Bidhuri claimed that the AAP government was not serious about the oxygen needs of the patients in Delhi. “It appointed a nodal officer on April 9 to set up oxygen plants, which shows the lack of seriousness of the Kejriwal government towards the lives of Delhiites,” he said. BJP MP Manoj Tiwari claimed that the AAP government did not plan in advance to ensure oxygen supply for hospitals. “The central government allocated oxygen in line with Delhi’s demand, but the Kejriwal government neither had a tanker arrangement to carry oxygen nor any facility to store it,” Tiwari said. Pravesh Sahib Singh, another BJP MP, said that on April 27, Kejriwal promised that he would set up 44 oxygen plants in Delhi within a month, import 18 cryogenic tankers from Bangkok and 21 oxygen plants from France, and airlift oxygen from Odisha, but nothing happened. No reaction from the AAP government was available despite TOI’s attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-was-not-serious-about-oxygen-needs-of-patients-bjp/articleshow/82781290.cms||---

The total case tally has thus risen to 25,772,440 while 3,874 deaths were recorded in last 24 hours, the lowest since May 15. The overall death toll due to the“As the number of affected youngsters is higher this time around, we are seeing more complications, longer ICU stays and deaths in this age group,” said Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the state government’s Covid death audit team. A meeting of the death committee on Friday will analyze the reasons for mortality among the younger age group, but the morbidity patterns among them has doctors worried. Read AlsoAerosols carrying Covid-19 virus can travel in air up to 10 meters: CentreAerosols and droplets are the key transmission mode of the virus. Aerosols can be carried in the air up to 10 meters. These are the latest guidelines from the office of the principal scientific adviser cautioning people to maintain social distance to prevent the transmission of the Covid-19 virus. Firstly, in the second wave, there are more youngsters in ICUs. The average age of ICU admissions was 50-plus in the first wave, but now, doctors say, it is not uncommon to find people less than half that age in ICU. Dr Vasant Nagvekar, an infectious disease expert and member of the state task force, said young women, who were not so severely affected in the first wave, have needed ventilator support. “The youngest patient on ventilator at this point in Bandra’s Lilavati Hospital is a 21-year-old man,” said Nagvekar, who consults there. Secondly, the length of stay is longer and the damage more extensive. Dr Rahul Pandit, who heads the ICU in Fortis Hospital, Mulund, and is a member of the state Covid-19 task force, said the average stay in ICU has risen to 14 to 15 days as against eight days in the first wave. “Patients, including younger ones, are coming in time, but are more hypoxic (low on oxygen),” he said. Even after discharge, Supe said, youngsters require oxygen support for a few weeks. “Without support, their oxygen concentration levels drops to 90,” he added. Thirdly, complications in the 20-40 group are severe. “People are in hospital for longer, and they get severe complications such as microthrombi (clumps of blood components) or pneumothorax (collapse of lungs). Not surprisingly, recovery is slower,” said a doctor from a BMC-run hospital. Doctors feel mutations in Covid are the likely cause for the severity among 20-40s. “Mutations may have a role to play,” said Nagvekar, but pointed at two other factors: patients coming late as well as the rapid progression of the disease. Dr Sushant Meshram, professor and head of pulmonary critical care at Government Medical College, Nagpur, said they have had patients coming with a HRCT score of 2 and 3, which rapidly jumped to 9 and 10 in a span of days. “Such rapid progression of the lung disease was certainly not seen last year,” he said. He, too, believes mutations have had a role to play. “Besides the rise in absolute number of patients, the rapid course of the disease also probably explains why the need for medical oxygen was so high this time,” he added. At the rural level, delay is more the reason. “Young people still don’t think they can get serious Covid. They come to hospital after an average of 8-10 days with an HRCT score of 20 and above,” said a district official from Amravati. Nagvekar said a red flag should be persistent high fever of 100-101 for five days. “One should get hospitalised immediately,” he said.

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is expected to visit the affected areas on Friday. “The cabinet has decided to dispense relief under the NDRF norms but many ministers felt it would not be enough. For a comprehensive relief package, more details will have to come in from panchnamas conducted locally,” said a senior officer. NDRF norms provide compensation worth Rs 6,800 per hectare for unirrigated crops and Rs 18,000 per hectare for horticulture crops. Officials said Raigad and Sindhurdurg districts in the Konkan region, where 18 people were killed, have been the worst affected. The districts of Palghar, Ratnagiri and Thane have also been affected. Officials said around 5,500 hectares of crop, mainly mango and cashew, have been impacted. The worst hit is Sindhudurg, where 3,300 hectares of crop have been damaged according to preliminary assessment. Around 2,500 hectares have been affected in Ratnagiri, 1,500 in Raigad, 1,269 in Palghar and 186 in Thane.

---||Hyderabad||Nitrate pollution in Krishna river a grave risk to kids: NGRI study||HYDERABAD: The National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) has stumbled upon the presence of high levels of nitrate in groundwater in upper Krishna river basin in Telangana, posing a grave risk to children’s health. NGRI scientists warned that infants and children are at higher risk owing to nitrate ingestion through drinking water. Researchers said fertilizer leachate is seeping into aquifers and a majority of groundwater samples analysed by them were unfit for consumption. NGRI scientist Rama Mohan Kurakalva said people who are utilising the water in Mahbubnagar and other districts of upper Krishna river basin are at risk. “We did studies on water quality in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon to find out variation. We found the groundwater nitrate-rich and fluoride-rich. We did a risk assessment study based on US Environmental Protection Agency guidelines,” he said. The study was conducted in two seasons to confirm consistency of contamination and to measure increase or decrease in nitrate and fluoride content. Researchers collected a total of 116 groundwater samples from an intensive agricultural region of Wanaparthy area in Mahbubnagar to evaluate seasonal variations. As per the water quality index, 36.2 per cent samples in pre-monsoon season and 60.3 per cent in post-monsoon fell in poor to unfit category (drinking water). “The hazard quotient values of nitrate were greater for infants and children. They are in more danger of non-carcinogenic ingestion of nitrate contaminated groundwater than adults,” the study said. Rama Mohan blamed indiscriminate use of fertilizers in agriculture production for high nitrate content. “Usually, nitrate content goes up in urban sewers contaminating the area or sees a spike due to agricultural fertilizer usage. There are no industries and no urban sewerage in the study area,” he explained in the study which was published in Science Direct Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety Journal. He said an agriculture area is prone to nitrate contamination and shallow aquifers are more vulnerable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nitrate-pollution-in-krishna-a-grave-risk-to-kids-ngri-study/articleshow/82784750.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The CM’s tweet had drawn criticism from the Centre. “CM Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday pointed out that the third wave of Covid-19 might unravel on young children and alerted the central government against this. However, instead of preparing or taking any action against this important news, the Centre has shown condemnable behaviour by playing dirty politics of blame and lies,” Sisodia said addressing a digital press conference. “He rightly notified two facts to the public, first on the development of a new strain in Singapore and, second, on how this strain might affect children and how we need to be careful,” the deputy CM said. “The Centre, instead of showing any concern towards the danger our children might be in, gave more attention to building its diplomatic image in Singapore.” “The new form of corona that has come to Singapore is being said to be extremely dangerous for children, in India, it may come as a third wave,” Kejriwal had tweeted on Tuesday and urged the Centre that air services with Singapore be cancelled with immediate effect and options for vaccinating children prioritised. “Singapore Government called in our High Commissioner today to convey strong objection to Delhi CM’s tweet on "Singapore variant". High Commissioner clarified that Delhi CM had no competence to pronounce on Covid variants or civil aviation policy,” Arindam Bagchi, official spokesperson, ministry of external affairs, tweeted on Wednesday morning. Quoting the statement, external affairs minister Dr S Jaishankar mentioned in a tweet that "Singapore and India have been solid partners in the fight against Covid-19" and that "Delhi CM does not speak for India." “The unabated ridicule by BJP of CM Arvind Kejriwal only indicates that BJP and the central government are more worried about Singapore and how Singapore views us, instead of worrying about how this new strain in Singapore may adversely affect our children, if it is brought to India,” Sisodia said. He said that Indian doctors and scientists were warning the nation against the new strain. When asked about the statement by the CM, Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said that there was a ‘different strain’ of coronavirus spreading in Singapore. “There are many strains of coronavirus in India at present. Their presence is ascertained through genome sequencing. It is a different strain indeed. Whether it is from Singapore, Delhi, America or London, what’s important is that the strains are different,” Jain said. “It is wrong to say it is not a different variant.

Last year, when the city came to a standstill during the lockdown, he somehow made it back to his village in Uttar Pradesh. But with no work there for him, he had to return to his lodgings in Badarpur. His earnings were picking up when the current lockdown was announced. This year, however, he didn’t have to worry about his return home; Abdullah and his eight friends have reached their village after the Chittaranjan Park J Block residents’ welfare association paid for their travel. “The young man and others regularly came to our colony and so people used to occasionally give them money,” said Apoorvi Sethi, who first noticed the plight of Abdullah and eight other balloon and flute sellers. “I found that they were not even earning Rs 20 per day. That is when we sought the help of colony residents to finance their home journey and everyone contributed generously.” From the pooled amount, Rs 15,000 was enough for nine tickets in a private bus going to UP’s Basti district. Sethi also handed the youths Rs 2,000 for any expenses on the way. This proved handy for the men. As Abdullah said, “We had used up all our savings on food. So the money we got was a big blessing for us.” The 31-year-old Abdullah was so touched by the RWA’s help that with the help of his neighbour, he made a phone video thanking Sethi and the do-gooders of J Block. In the clip, he introduced each member of his family, who individually offered thanks to the RWA members for their generosity. “Their help was so important, especially since my wife was due for delivery. Even though I don’t have much money right now, reaching home itself is a big relief,” said Abdullah over the phone. “I wouldn’t have been able to pay the rent or provide food to the family.” It hasn’t ended with Abdullah’s exit from Delhi. Three more itinerant sellers like him have also sought the help of the colony RWA in returning home. Sethi said, “From the money we collected, there is still some left. We will spend that on sending other hapless people home to villages in UP. I am verifying their antecedents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cr-park-rwa-makes-journey-of-9-flute-sellers-back-home-possible/articleshow/82783245.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Agra||Backlog of 5,000 surgeries in Agra due to second covid wave||AGRA: Since the second wave of the pandemic started in the first week of April, hospitals have halted elective surgeries. Now, the health department officials estimate there’s a backlog of 5,000 elective procedures in both government and private hospitals. This figure is based on the number of such surgeries being done earlier. A majority of this backlog consists of surgeries for kidney stones, appendix, piles and cataract. Elective surgeries are planned in advance and have no emergency requirement. Doctors say some elective surgeries can be postponed for up to six months, but caution that some procedures if delayed a lot can complicate cases or even turn fatal. According to official estimates, the three major government hospitals – S N Medical College, District hospital and Lady Lyall hospital -- altogether used to conduct an average of 30 to 40 elective surgeries daily before the second wave of Covid-19. These numbers are in addition to the emergency cases. However, after the surge in April, hospitals restricted the number of non-Covid procedures because of diversion of resources to Covid care, and risk of infection to patients. In government hospitals a backlog of at least 1,000 surgeries has been created in the past 45 days. Similarly, a backlog of 4,000 elective surgeries exists in around 200 registered hospitals and nursing homes. Chief medical officer of Agra district, Dr R C Pandey, said, “Following the second wave of Covid-19 elective surgeries were not taking place at the government centers in the district. Earlier, 30 to 40 surgeries used to take place every day at the government centers. Government hospitals will be rescheduling elective surgeries on priority after the second wave subsides and normal functioning starts. Patients with complicated issues will be operated first.” President of Indian Medical Association, Agra district unit, Dr Rajeev Upadhyaya said, “Doctors are in regular touch with patients and counselling them on the phone. Those whose ailments are in advance stages will be operated on priority basis once the elective surgeries begin in full swing. Till then patients are advised to strictly follow directions of the doctors to avoid developing any serious complications.” Meanwhile, the district administration has allowed non-Covid hospitals to admit patients with negative RT-PCR reports. Elective surgeries can be performed on such patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/backlog-of-5k-surgeries-in-agra-due-to-second-wave-of-covid/articleshow/82774239.cms||Deepak Lavania

Why has the state witnessed more cases of the fungal infection compared to other states and the earlier Covid surge? Experts said factors such as a high number of diabetic patients, indiscriminate use of steroids and negligence of oral and nasal hygiene during Covid treatment are some of the major reasons. Dr Rajesh Vishwakarma, a senior city-based ENT surgeon, said Gujarat is considered the diabetes capital of India. “Pre-Covid, the only patients who used to come with the fungal infection were diabetic. The Covid infection not only aggravates the condition, but also increases blood sugar levels of those who don’t have a history,” he said. “The fungus, commonly found on kitchen waste and rotting wood, enters the human body as microscopic spores, and start proliferating in a conducive host with low immunity.” “Another factor is negligence towards oral and nasal hygiene,” said Dr Neeraj Suri, an ENT surgeon with Gandhinagar Civil Hospital. “Gargling is sometimes ignored when patients are on a ventilator or BiPAP. This gives a way for the fungus to grow. Likewise, distilled water used in assistive breathing is sometimes not changed which can worsen nasal hygiene,” she said, adding that all medical equipment used for Covid patients must be cleaned regularly. It has also to do with the indiscriminate use of steroids, especially in the early phase of the Covid infection, said Dr Ruchir Shah, a city-based ENT surgeon. “We have seen in some patients that the prescription meant for one patient based on his or her condition is termed standard and circulated on platforms such as WhatsApp. This practice should stop, as steroids are not advisable for all,” he said. “Compared to the last surge, the use of steroids has increased manyfold. This time around, patients of mucormycosis are coming from almost all adult age groups.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/maintaining-oral-nasal-hygiene-key/articleshow/82781346.cms||Parth Shastri

Worried about rising mortality among Covid patients above 60 years, the district administration has come to the conclusion that priority for vaccination must be given to citizens falling in this age group. Around 70% of Covid patients who succumbed to the infection were above the age of 60. During a meeting with health officials on Tuesday, Desai said, “Let the first vaccination dose for citizens above 60 years be completed with the available stock. Once that is done the focus should be on comorbid citizens above the age of 45.” Currently, the death rate in Kolhapur district is around 3.2% — among the highest in the state. There are around 5.10 lakh citizens in district above 60 years of age, out of which first dose has been given to 3.95 lakh citizens which is around 77% of the total beneficiaries. The district has a stock of 9,000 doses and more are expected arrive in a few days. Around 1.15 lakh doses will be required to complete vaccination of all citizens above 60 years. The health department will soon issue a statement informing people that only those above the age of 60 will be vaccinated. Farukh Desai, district vaccination nodal officer, said, “We will appeal citizens below 60 years to wait for some time. The decision has been taken to reduce district’s mortality rate. We are gathering details of senior citizens who are yet to get their first dose through our ground level staff such as ASHA workers and anganwadi staff. They will play a major role to bring the citizens above 60 years to vaccination centres.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/vaccinate-60-on-priority-kolhapur-district-collector/articleshow/82779186.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: This group is helping Covid-hit with free meals and dry ration||NEW DELHI: Tragedy struck a family in Rohini when three children aged two, four and six years lost their father to Covid-19 while their mother was also hospitalised. The children’s grandmother was shattered with the news of the death of her son and was not in the condition to feed her grandkids.  After some people learnt that the kids were hungry, they sent a message to the helpline of an NGO, Social Organisation for Conquering Hunger (SOCH). Members of the NGO immediately sent milk and other food items to the children. In the wake of the recent surge in Covid-19 cases, the calls received on the NGO’s hunger helpline— 9807084084—have doubled in the last one month. People associated with the NGO said the helpline was earlier receiving an average of 25 calls per month, but over 60 calls were made in the last one month. The hunger helpline, which is active from 10am to 7pm, was launched on July 1 last year. Most of the calls received in the last one month were from people who did not have food due to lockdown or were seeking help for children whose parents were either hospitalised or had died due to Covid. The NGO provides free food or dry ration after verification of the calls. SOCH chairman and founder Pramod Aggarwal said, “We are regularly receiving information about people who are hungry and need food. The complaints are made by the needy or their relatives, friends or passersby. We verify the information and when we are satisfied with the needs of the person, we send ration or readymade food to him or her.” We want to ensure that no one goes to bed hungry, he added. In another case, a delivery boy for a food-related app, who had lost his job recently, sought help. The NGO provided a ration kit to his family. Rajnish Verma, one of the co-founders of SOCH, said, “We are also providing dry ration to the poor living in Mayapuri Industrial Area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/this-group-is-helping-covid-hit-with-free-meals-and-dry-ration/articleshow/82783296.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

In his FIR, Nirav Shah, who runs a unit manufacturing X-ray machines in Changodar, said one of his dealers from Odisha informed him on May 5 that a company named ‘Atomdas’ in the Anandnagar area of the city was providing oxygen concentrators at reasonable prices. Shah checked about the company and called a number on which a person named Ankit Vala responded. Shah said Vala told him a concentrator of five litre per minute capacity would cost Rs 25,000 and those of 10 litres would cost Rs 50,000, stated the FIR. Shah told Vala he would buy 1,000 of each type. Vala told him that they would cost Rs 7.50 crore of which 10% will have to be paid in advance. Shah also told a dealer of his, Kaushik Shah, about the availability of concentrators. Kaushik Shah also placed an order for which he paid Rs 7.50 lakh to Vala. Nirav Shah said Vala told him the concentrators would be moved from Gandhidham in Kutch to Changodar in Ahmedabad. Before paying him the advance, Shah told Vala to show him his company premises and a sample of the oxygen concentrators after which he would pay the advance. Vala then made a video call to Nirav Shah and showed him some packed boxes, telling him he was about to dispatch these oxygen concentrators to other persons in Ahmedabad city. Nirav Shah said he was then convinced about Vala and sent him advance of Rs 75 lakh while Kaushik Shah paid him Rs 38 lakh. The two thus paid Rs 1.13 crore to Vala on May 10. He said that when he called the number again, another person answered it but said he was Vala but as Nirav Shah found the voice to be different, he began asking about his stock. The person then disconnected the call and switched off the phone. Nirav Shah said he then sent an aide to Gandhidham to the address Vala showed as his godown, but no godown was found at the spot. Nirav Shah then approached filed a complaint for cheating along with charges under the IT Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/traders-cheated-of-rs-1cr-in-oxygen-concentrator-deal/articleshow/82781411.cms||---

---||Delhi||No wave from Singapore, we have our own variants: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Wednesday cautioned the Delhi government from stretching further the issue that the third wave of Covid-19 could be coming from Singapore or some other country.  “Let’s be clear, there is no wave from Singapore and we don’t need any other country, we have our own variants,” said a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh. The court interjected when the counsel for the government expressed fear that the next wave could come from Singapore and maximum citizens in the capital should be vaccinated before that. Following the court’s comment, senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, said, “From wherever…the second variant is from India only.” He explained that he was stressing on the need to vaccinate as many persons as possible, including judges, to prevent the third wave’s impact. The court was hearing a plea over the condition of subordinate judiciary’s judicial officers who are at risk of contracting Covid-19 owing to the nature of duties. When the government’s standing counsel Santosh Tripathi claimed it had set up Covid Care Centres at each court, the bench noted that these are only for mild patients with hardly any facilities. “Governments find it very difficult to accept their failure and inability as it is not in their veins,” the bench said. “We have lost three judicial officers already. Look at the number of judicial officers and their families being infected, it’s staggering. Because of the nature of their job, they have to expose themselves so we need to protect them…You don’t expect a judge to discharge his duty when his son, daughter, wife or any other family member is seriously ill. Take steps on your own, you (government) don’t need to wait for orders on this,” it said. The court was not convinced by the submission of the government that nodal officers have been appointed in each district to coordinate with the judges and ensure timely medical aid to their kin. “Let us not get into this. That has not delivered,” the bench observed, saying that a system has to be put in place now. The court took note of the submission by Mehra that Delhi Judicial Services Association, which has filed an application raising certain issues, including that facilities on ground are an eyewash, may submit a representation to the Delhi chief secretary who shall consider it and also convene a virtual meeting with the members of the association. It asked the judges and the chief secretary to conduct a virtual meeting while asking the government to file a status report by next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-wave-from-singapore-we-have-our-own-variants-hc/articleshow/82781518.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Hyderabad||Ande ka funda! Egg & chicken sales ride on Covid-19 wave in Telangana||HYDERABAD: The poultry industry had suffered a Rs 250 crore loss every month during the first wave of Covid-19 last year. This was largely because consumption of chicken and eggs had dipped due to bird flu rumours and other misconceptions. In the second wave, however, consumption has spiked, as people see chicken and eggs as immunity boosters which would help fight Covid-19. Egg consumption has gone up nearly 20% in one year in Greater Hyderabad alone, says National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC) zonal chairman at Hyderabad, G Chandrasekhar Reddy. Normally, the state capital consumes 80 lakh eggs daily, but consumption has gone up to roughly one crore eggs during the second wave. Experts attributed the increase to growing awareness among the people about eggs being a good source of protein and other essential nutrients besides, besides containing vitamin-A, vitamin B-12 and selenium which are key to keeping the immune system healthy. Despite the price of eggs fluctuating daily, experts expect turnover to cross Rs 130 crore in May. Last year, egg consumption had dropped nearly 50%. “Four crore eggs are produced daily in Telangana of which 1.75 crore are consumed in the state and the remaining are sent to Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and other states where the production is not much,” Reddy said. Telangana Poultry Breeders Association president and TRS MP G Ranjith Reddy said nearly 3 crore kg chicken has been consumed every month in Telangana during the second wave Covid so far. “This is a healthy trend compared to dismal sales during the first round of pandemic last year,” he said. He also attributed this trend to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao telling the people that consumption of chicken improves immunity. Municipal minister KT Rama Rao along with other ministers had openly ate chicken to dispel fears and bust myths, he added. Sources added that the only dampener in recent times is the night curfew and the latest lockdown. With hotels and restaurants shut, demand has dipped by around 15%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ande-ka-funda-egg-chicken-sales-ride-on-covid-19-wave-in-telangana/articleshow/82784797.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Corona medicine sales down 50%||AHMEDABAD: As Covid-19 infections began to reduce across the state, a drastic fall was recorded in the sales of medicines used to treat the disease. Estimates of the Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists’ Association (FGSCDA) suggest that the sales of Covid medicines have dropped by 50% in terms of volumes. These include medicines such as favipiravir, azithromycin, ivermectin, doxycycline, and even paracetamol. There has been a decline in the sales of steroids such as dexamethasone as well. “The sales of Covid medicines have gone down sharply amid a decline in the cases in Gujarat,” said Alpesh Patel, president, FGSCDA. “The demand for these medicines dropped by at least 50% in the second week of May against the last week of April.” Patel added: “With restrictions being imposed across the state, fresh cases of Covid began to dip. Consequently, the demand for medicines too went down.” The medicine demand was so high at one stage that many people had hoarded drugs spurred by shortage fears. “Inventory days of medicines had gone down from seven days to a single day. This means medicine stocks which used to sell in a week were off the shelves in a day due to the unprecedented rise in cases,” said an Ahmedabad-based chemist. “The sales of anti-infectives and antibiotics and other medicines used for Covid treatment had reduced by close to 40% till last week,” said Ankur Aggarwal, founder, Medkart. “With a reduction in cases, the demand has gone down. However, the sales of medicines for mucormycosis have gone up in the past couple of weeks.” As the situation began to ease, the panic buying of medicines reduced to a great extent. Currently, the demand is largely seen from rural areas across the state. Patel said, “There is no shortage of demand anywhere at this point.” He added: “A lot of patients from nearby talukas and districts are getting admitted in hospitals in Ahmedabad and other urban centres.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/corona-medicine-sales-down-50/articleshow/82781483.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Mumbai||Jab at doorstep: Bombay HC seeks BMC’s decision today||MUMBAI: The Bombay HC has asked the municipal commissioner to apprise it on Thursday whether it is possible for BMC to conduct door-to-door vaccination for the elderly and the disabled, despite the Centre’s disinclination. “We request the municipal commissioner or the additional municipal commissioner to apprise us whether disinclination of the central government to formulate door-to-door vaccination policy for elderly and disabled citizens notwithstanding, the corporation is prepared to introduce it for such citizens and undertake measures for their vaccination upon making them aware of the consequences, under proper medical care and upon obtaining consent of either such citizens (if they are in a position to accord such consent) or their near relatives, for being vaccinated in pursuance of the order of this court,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni in its order on Wednesday. The HC was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocates Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari for doorstep shots to the elderly and bedridden, a helpline to register and jabs for the homeless or others without ID cards. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Centre said a special expert panel headed by Dr N K Arora, chair Covid working group committee, met on May 15 to discuss the door-to-door jab issue. The panel recommended among other things making transport arrangements to help take the elderly and the disabled to vaccination centres. The panel proposed that “based on the learnings from Routine Immunization, a Community based Outreach Session (COS) will be organized to provide COVID 19 vaccines to a defined population.” These COS will be organized specially for target population while vaccination for all other age groups will continue at designated CVCs, according to the panel. Singh said standard operating procedure (SOP) for the elderly based on the expert panel’s discussion is “under consideration”, hence no order be passed at this stage. The CJ observed orally that the experts are “academically brilliant but they have zero knowledge of ground reality.” The CJ said, “I do not know about Mumbai, but I can tell about my parent city, old (North) Calcutta. There are buildings where even a stretcher cannot be taken inside…if there is no room to bring them, how will you transport them?” Justice Kulkarni said that there are narrow lanes in Mumbai too. Singh said there are many such places in India where lanes and entrances are narrow, including Varanasi. “There are many such households in our country. People cannot step out…How do you cater to the needs of those people?” asked the CJ-led bench adding, “You must cover maximum people in society.” Singh said, “We are also concerned. If people are totally bedridden, the new SOP to be issued will consider the issue…This (lack of door-to-door policy) is not a permanent guideline …it is temporary, considering the present situation.” The HC noted that it had used “strong language’’ in its April 22 order when it had asked the Centre to take a relook at its stand. Kapadia pointed to a news article to argue that the BMC claimed to have written to the Centre for permission to conduct door-step vaccinations and cited a civic officer saying 1.5 lakh old and bedridden people in Mumbai could have been vaccinated. “The corporation ought to make its stand clear,” the HC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/jab-at-doorstep-hc-seeks-bmcs-decision-today/articleshow/82784870.cms||Swati Deshpande

Police said charges of cheating and forgery have been registered against the hospital authorities. Anklesh Pawar (40) died on the night of April 21, but his family was informed about it on April 24, only after the bill was paid. His widow has alleged that she was even told to get medicines from him while he was dead. The widow, Shubhangi, was taken aback after seeing the date on the death certificate and approached police, who allegedly refused to take her complaint. She then moved a local court, which ordered police to register a case. Taking cognizance of the incident, district collector Vipin Itankar has ordered a high-level committee to probe the incident and submit a report. Sub-inspector Vishwadeep Rode of the Shivajinagar police station said the offence is based on the court’s directives. “According to the widow, the hospital asked her on April 21 to pay the money. She was given time till April 24 as she could not arrange it. Finally, she paid Rs 90, 000 on the morning of April 24. A couple of hours later she was informed that her husband was dead,” he said. “We received directives under 156 (3) of CrPC from the court and an offence has been registered,” added the officer. The woman has stated in her complaint that her husband was admitted to the hospital on April 16, when his RT-PCR score was 7 out of 25. “The hospital management continued to portray that he was under treatment and made me purchase medicines. I was given time till April 24 to clear the bills and hid his death from me.” She has stated that the hospital charged her Rs 1.40 lakh, a part of which she had already deposited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hosp-in-dock-for-hiding-covid-patients-death/articleshow/82779244.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Delhi||Toolkit to spread confusion, says BJP||New Delhi: BJP on Wednesday lashed out at Arvind Kejriwal saying the chief minister’s comments about a “new strain of coronavirus in Singapore” is part of his “toolkit to spread confusion and anarchy”. Citing external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s remarks in which he termed the CM’s comments as “irresponsible”, BJP spokesperson Gautam Bhatia alleged that Kejriwal is indulging in petty politics so that no one can question him. “Kejriwal is seeking political mileage at the cost of India’s image with his irresponsible tweet,” Bhatia said at a press conference and added that the CM keeps making “hue and cry” over one issue or another so that nobody questions him on his “all-round failure” in dealing with the pandemic in the city. The BJP member also accused the AAP chief of “serious violation” of constitutional propriety by speaking on matters of foreign affairs and alleged that Kejriwal’s “irresponsible” statements are not only jeopardising the lives of Indian citizens but also friendly relations with countries that are coming forward to help India. “Kejriwal has presented his toolkit of spreading confusion and anarchy and seems to be competing with Congress in propagating lies and destabilising the country,” he alleged. In a tweet, Kejriwal had said on Tuesday, “A new form of coronavirus in Singapore is said to be very dangerous for children. It could reach Delhi in the form of a third wave.” Bhatia alleged the AAP government believes in the PPP model of “publicity, cheap politics and panic”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/toolkit-to-spread-confusion-says-bjp/articleshow/82781562.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Harbingers of monsoon make early landing in western Maharashtra||KOLHAPUR: The pied crested cuckoo from Africa and migratory birds from other parts of India have already arrived on the banks of the Krishna river in Sangli district, taking experts by surprise as they generally land in mid-June, celebrating the onset of the monsoon. “Cyclone Tauktae could be the reason for the early arrival of the birds. The strong winds may have aided the feathered guests in reducing their flight timings. The reason for birds from other parts of India, such as Goa, arriving early could again be the cyclone and heavy rain. They may have got confused that the monsoon is already here,” Sandip Nazare, a bird watcher from Sangli, told TOI. The birds migrate to parts of western Maharashtra between June and August. “I spotted a pied crested cuckoo on the banks of Krishna at Amanapur village in Palus taluka of Sangli yesterday (Tuesday). I had spotted it on June 1 last year. The bird is called ‘chatak’ and according to Hindu mythology, it waits for the rain to quench its thirst. The bird also comes here for breeding purpose. It is believed that these birds use the monsoon winds to assist their flight during their migration,” said Nazare. According to him, local birds like Asean Koel, Indian Pitta, Indian Robin, Grey-bellied cuckooo, known as singing birds, have also started chirping for early arrival of the monsoon in parts of western Maharashtra. Sujay Kumbhar, a bird photographer from Kolhapur, said the monsoon migratory birds like pied-crested cuckoo, vernal hanging parrot, Indian pitta and oriental dwarf kingfishers arrive in the Kolhapur and Sangli region hinting the arrival of monsoon. “These birds are also found in southern India around the year and must have migrated to western Maharashtra due to the heavy rain over there due to the cyclone. They usually arrive between May and June with the onset of the monsoon and are therefore known as harbingers of monsoons,” he said. Onkar Sumant from ELA foundation in Pune, said the feathers of the pied-crested cuckoo are black and white and is around 12-inch long. “The adults have crest on the head like a crown and elongated tail with white border. Except the Indian koel, rest of the birds from the cuckoo family are migratory and act as bio-indicators,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/harbingers-of-monsoon-make-early-landing-in-western-maha/articleshow/82779286.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

He was the fourth MLA in the state to have died owing to Covid complications since October 2020. Meena was admitted to the multi-speciality wing of MB Hospital in Udaipur on May 16 after his condition deteriorated in his hometown Pratapgarh. The three-time MLA is survived by wife and four sons. Doctors said his condition worsened on May 18 and was put on a ventilator. “Despite all efforts, he breathed last at 9am on Wednesday,” said a doctor. His body was taken to his native village. He made his electoral debut in 2003 by winning assembly elections. He lost assembly polls in 2008 and again won in 2013 and 2018 polls. Three other MLAs who died due to Covid in the state were – Kailesh Trivedi (Sahara), Kiran Maheswari (Rajsamand) and Gajendra Singh Shaktawat (Vallabhnagar). Expressing condolence, CM Ashok Gehlot tweeted, “I am deeply saddened to hear the death of Gautam Lal Meena due to the infection. I pray to the almighty to give strength to the family and his supporters to bear the pain of his death.” BJP state president Satish Poonia remembered him as a loyal soldier of the party who has always raised the voice of the poor and the downtrodden. “We have lost a notable voice in the tribal region,” said Poonia. Former CM Vasundhara Raje released a video expressing her condolence. “It’s a personal loss for me. The three-time MLA has done several developmental works in his region. He will be remembered for his contribution to the party. Om Shanti.” The death of Meena has further reduced the strength of BJP MLAs to 71 while the ruling Congress has 106 MLAs with the death of Shaktawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dhariyawad-bjp-mla-gautam-lal-meena-dies-of-covid/articleshow/82781573.cms||---

---||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi government readies shield for a possible third wave||NEW DELHI: Amid concerns that a third wave of Covid-19 will hit the country and children will be the hardest hit by it, the Delhi government has decided to form a special task force (STF) and started making advance arrangements for additional hospital beds, increasing oxygen allocation and other medical infrastructure. If the prediction comes true, then it will require a massive paediatrics healthcare infrastructure boost focusing on management of the viral disease. In a meeting with senior officials on Wednesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal charted out plans to avert the third wave of the novel coronavirus and make necessary arrangements to fight if it strikes. The STF will comprise paediatricians, experts and senior IAS officers as a part of Delhi government’s efforts to protect children.  The officials were directed to start working in advance to procure sufficient oxygen tankers and ensure proper functioning of oxygen plants for optimum supply to hospitals. After reviewing the current situation, the CM discussed with the officials measures that could be taken to prevent the third wave. While it would be the third wave for the country, it would be the fifth for the capital. Delhi was one of the worst affected centres during the first and second waves, while the third wave also caused havoc in the capital.  During the peak of the fourth wave, up to 28,000 cases were reported in a single day and fatalities had risen to 412 in a day. Currently, the fourth wave is on a rapid decline. “If the third wave of corona emerges, we must be prepared in advance to fight it. Took some important decisions today in a meeting with the officials. 1. To create a special task force to protect children from the third wave 2. Adequate beds, oxygen and better management of essential medicines,” tweeted Kejriwal. The nodal minister for Covid response and deputy CM Manish Sisodia and health minister Satyendar Jain were also present in the meeting, besides the chief secretary and other senior officials engaged in management of the disease and officials from the health and revenue departments. During the third wave, 40,000 oxygen-equipped beds may be needed. Delhi government is also making preparations to set up 10,000 ICU beds. Along with the beds and organising oxygen, management of drugs was also discussed in the meeting. A committee comprising officials will be formed to overlook the availability of medicines, oxygen and beds. “Increased number of beds also require more oxygen allocation to hospitals. We need to keep enough oxygen tankers at hand to curb shortage. We also need to ensure optimum storage and proper functioning of oxygen plants,” Kejriwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-readies-shield-for-a-possible-third-wave/articleshow/82781626.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Rajkot||Tauktae takes wind out of Nava Bandar’s sails||Nava Bandar (Una): “The damage to our houses is not the major issue. We are labourers. We will repair it somehow. The loss Tauktae caused to our boats is a direct hit on our stomachs,” — said Somvar Majethiya the village Sarpanch. And he has reasons to despair — almost each of the 700 boats in this quaint fishermen’s hamlet has been damaged, while 80% of the roofs of the 4,000 houses blew away with the cyclonic wind. Only houses that could stay intact in Nava Bandar are the ones that had kaccha roofs (Naliya). The remaining houses are a testimony to Tauktae’s night-long fury on the village located barely 10km away from Una town of Gir Somnath district. Nava Bandar is one of the few villages that is worst affected by cyclone. Its 20,000 population is engaged in fishing activity, while the financial losses from the cyclone pushed them a decade back. The smell of drying fish greets you when the village located exactly on the seashore, where the noise of crashing waves can be heard over the din of the local fish market, while the sealine is dotted with colourful boats of all colour and sizes. Generally people gather at Danga (the place where traders purchase fish) every evening, but post cyclone the markets are now eerily quiet while the roar of the waves serves as a grim reminder of the misfortune. Every fisherman today is busy repairing either his ravaged house or the fishing boat. It’s a unique sight to see such huge numbers of boats aground, as generally many are kept afloat on the water except those needing repairs that are brought to the ground during off season. Majethiya said “While five boats totally damaged, almost all the boats, costing around Rs 40 to 50 lakh a piece, in the village have been more or less damaged. Boat repair is costly needing Rs 7 to 9 lakh per boat.” “Boats anchored bounced and dashed on the ground during the cyclone. Two boats got slit and two others are missing. It’s a huge loss and we don’t know how to manage now,” said Palgesh Bambhaniya whose uncle’s boat too has been damaged. The summer (March to June) period is the peak season for fishing though generally it starts from September-October. Nearly 70 percent of the catch comes in this summer period. The season has been getting delayed for the past few years owing to excessive rain from climate change. Mukesh Bambhaniya a villager said that for the past two years they had been subjected to inclement weather fetching them less catch. Again, the fish processing factories in Veraval too were closed owing to the lockdown which hit the export business tremendously. Now, we don’t know how the community will cope up with this fresh disaster,” Bhambaniya said. “The fishing season has ended for us this year, as no boat is in the condition to venture out in the sea. Officially there is a month’s time for the season to end, but all our boats need repair and for that we will need money as well as time. We are looking forward for financial assistance from the government,” Majethiya added. Babu Solanki another villager rued that the village also doesn’t have a jetty which forces them to anchor their boats in Diu. “It’s our long pending demand to construct a jetty here, but we don’t know if we will ever get it,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/tauktae-takes-wind-out-of-nava-bandars-sails/articleshow/82779385.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The health authorities have revealed that two patients were admitted to a private hospital and undergoing treatment for black fungus while three of the six suspected patients were undergoing treatment at Government Rajindra Hospital. The authorities at Rajindra hospital have revealed that two Covid-19 patients, who were also having complaint of black fungus, died as they were suffering from pneumonia and lung infection. The officials said one patient facing black fungus infection had been referred to the PGI, Chandigarh, following complications while three others were still undergoing treatment at Rajindra hospital. Rajindra hospital medical superintendent HS Rekhi said they had enough stock to treat black fungus patients as for now. However, Patiala civil surgeon Dr Satinder Singh said there was no medicine available in the market for the treatment of black fungus, but soon these medicines would be procured and supplied to private hospitals at a price fixed by the state government. He said, “There has been a dearth of drugs to treat black fungus. Some private hospitals also had informed us about the unavailability of these drugs as two patients are getting treatment from a private hospital. We have received government instruction on Wednesday to procure these drugs and also supply it to private hospitals at rates fixed.” Sources in the health department revealed that in the last one week, some people from other states, including Delhi, had purchased huge stocks of drugs from Patiala, Ludhiana and other districts amid rising cases of black fungus in their states. However, drug officials in Patiala and Fatehgarh Sahib said there was a dearth of the injection vials meant to treat patients with black fungus. A drug official said purchase of equipment related with oxygen cylinders by residents of outside state was done from Patiala, but claimed to be unaware of any drug purchase done by people from outside state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/patiala-short-of-drugs-to-treat-black-fungus/articleshow/82783335.cms||Bharat Khanna

The state government plans to set up 105 oxygen plants in 59 urban limits within two months. While the directorate of local bodies (DLB) issued work order to two companies to set up 58 oxygen plants in 48 small cities, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has taken up a task for remaining 47 oxygen plants in 11 urban improvement trust (UIT). The work order has also been issued for the same. An UDH official said, “This committee will conduct weekly reviews of work and will send a report to the DLB. Third party testing will be done before final certification of the plants.”The committee scope of work will be to identify the location for setting up a plant in the hospitals. It will be headed by the commissioner or executive officer of the local body. An official said, “The incharge of the government hospital in which aplant will be setup will also be the member of the committee. Apart from this, it will comprise an executive or assistant engineer.” The committee will also be responsible for fitting of pipelines to supply oxygen in hospital wards. Moreover, it will ensure arrangements for smooth supply of electricity when the plant is set up on hospital premises.The companies setting up plants have to complete the work in phases. As per the schedule, there will be four phases and 25 % work has to be completed in each phase. An official said, “As there is paucity of time, these committees are constituted to ensure that plants are made operational at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/panel-to-monitor-oxygen-plant-set-up/articleshow/82781567.cms||---

They along with other co-accused have been booked for obtaining 123 remdesivir injections from SVP Hospital.The court was told that of the 123 injections, Lohiya and his accomplices got 30 injections by using a forged letterhead of Shifa Hospital. As per investigation, the accused faked doctor’s prescription for their personal gain and played with lives of four patients in whose names the injections were obtained, the court was told.After hearing Lohiya’s case, the judge said, “This court is well-aware of the fact that remdesivir Injections are given to a patient whose condition is extremely critical. Due to shortage of these injections, people have to purchase the same by paying a higher price than prescribed by the government.”The court further observed, “It needs to be mentioned here that such kind of incidents are on the rise in the society. Therefore, it is necessary to curb this menace and maintain deterrence in the society. Therefore, no leniency is required to be shown towards the applicant.”In the case of Shaikh, the judge wrote, “This court is of a candid opinion that custodial interrogation of the present applicant is a must to enable the investigation agency to reach to the core of the matter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/illegal-remdesivir-sale-hc-denies-bail-to-two-accused/articleshow/82781632.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi records 3,846 new Covid-19 cases, 235 deaths||NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded 3,846 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, the third day in a row that the figure remained below 5,000-mark.  The fresh cases were reported from 66,573 tests carried out in the last 24 hours, with a positivity rate of 5.78%, which is the lowest since April 6. The number of Covid-19 fatalities remained high at 235. Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said that ever since the lockdown was imposed again, a downward trend in cases can be seen, which is a hopeful sign. He said that cases have dropped from 28,000 per day to less than 5,000 now. “We cannot afford complacency and must follow Covid-appropriate behaviour by all means,” Jain said at a press meet. “Even though the situation is slightly better currently, our target should be lowering the trend further to 2%, and certainly proceeding to 0%. Nonetheless, we cannot say anything concrete about when the lockdown will be lifted at this stage,” he added. With 9,427 patients recovering from Covid-19 on Tuesday, more than double the number of new cases reported in the last 24 hours, the number of active cases stood at 45,047, compared with 50,863 on Tuesday. The steady dip in Covid-19 cases and positivity rate has also resulted in hospitals in Delhi seeing fewer new admissions compared with the number of patients getting discharged since May 13. On Tuesday, 1,326 patients got discharged, while the number of new admissions was 806. With more people recovering from the disease every day than the number of new cases reported, the number of active cases have dipped by 54.8% from the all-time high number of 99,725 reported on April 28 to 45,047 on Wednesday. Out of these active cases, 31,197 patients are recuperating in home isolation. Delhi government’s health bulletin said the number of patients admitted in hospitals is 13,368 and 10,921 beds out of the total 24,289 Covid beds are vacant. Out of the total 6,811 ICU beds, 5,465 were occupied and 1,346 vacant at 9pm on Wednesday, according to the government’s corona dashboard. Meanwhile, Jain said that more cases were reported from the rural belt of the city, such as areas in southwest district. “We had increased the tests in the district, wherein 10-12,000 tests were being done in a single day,” adding that of late, cases from rural areas have also been on the decline. Jain also said that while plasma convalescent therapy has been dropped from the specific methodology of Covid treatment, it can be initiated on the suggestion of doctors. “It depends on case-to-case basis, and will be done only after the recommendation of a doctor,” he added. “The recent wave was an unprecedented one, and it spread at a very fast pace, which became detrimental for us. Now, if we are informed about the third wave, we will certainly prepare for it through our efficient policy making,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/positivity-rate-dips-to-5-78-jain-says-cant-be-complacent-aim-to-lower-it-to-below-2/articleshow/82781748.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Goa||Fourth day of outage, citizens forced to discard food, insulin||Panaji: On Wednesday, Warren Rodrigues discovered the food in his fridge began to stink, and so he emptied it. “Everything was bad and completely wasted,” he said on the fourth day of power outage in Mapusa. “If we knew it would take so many days to restore power, we’d have opened the fridge and cooked some of it on the first day itself. This is unprecedented.” His woes are echoed across Goa in pockets that still haven’t had their power restored. Many in Aldona and Moira told TOI that it was not just food that was spoiled, but insulin too. “For the fourth day now, we have been struggling,” a senior citizen said. “Nothing works. Everything in our fridge, including insulin, had to be thrown out. It’s not possible for seniors to live like this, I couldn’t bear it so I moved to my daughter’s place. My insulin was all wasted, but what’s the use in complaining.” In Mapusa, Rodrigues’ family spent sleepless nights trying to put their baby to sleep, and has had to carry buckets of water up to the third floor. While he and his neighbours empathise with the linesmen, he said more transparency could be appreciated. “It’s not difficult to keep citizens informed about the work being undertaken with all the different forms of social media available to them today,” he told TOI. “We are not asking for a personal postcard. If you tell me it will take a month, I can plan accordingly, but every day I hear it will be restored by morning, by evening, by tomorrow.” In Merces, Akshata Bhat has been staying awake till 2am every morning for three days, filling up water in every container she can find. “We get PWD water around midnight till 7am, but there’s no assurance that it will remain till 7am, so I have been filling it at night,” she told TOI, adding that he appreciated the linesmen working tirelessly. When her nine-year-old got cranky at having no power supply, she showed him pictures of house rooftops that were blown away and how people in Gujarat had to be relocated as a precautionary measure. “I told him we live on the ground floor so we have direct water supply and can have a bath, but there are people who have lost their entire homes,” she said. “He has been quiet after that.” In Verem, among the several residents who moved out when the power situation got unbearable was Nomita Saldanha, who shifted into her brother’s empty flat 2km away. Although there was no direct power supply in that flat either, there was some respite as the colony had a generator running. “I managed at home for some days, and then I just couldn’t cope, as there was no more clean water,” she said. “It’s not possible to manage without water. The least the electricity department can do is pick up their phones when people call to inquire about power restoration.” Another senior citizen couple in Mapusa said they have been going to a neighbouring colony to charge their phones. It’s the same story in Moira. “The government says restoration work is on on a war footing, but I don’t see it,” said the eminent pianist Jason Quadros. “The electricity department doesn’t have proper equipment to do their work efficiently. There are no mobile lights to help them work at night. I still feel the methods used to carry out repairs are inefficient, and far from what the government says.” However, on Facebook, residents stuck without power began to take a humorous look at the situation. “77 hours completed without electricity in Taleigao,” wrote Rohan Govenkar on Facebook. “Our closest contender is now Mapusa, at 80 hours. Let’s see who wins.” The comments too had several comedic gems, with one commenter going: “The award for height of hope goes to Mapusa — ‘Aiz yetali, sanjhe yetali, rathchi yetali, na na, falya yetali again and again, pun yetali’”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fourth-day-of-outage-citizens-forced-to-discard-food-insulin/articleshow/82783360.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Jaipur||HC restrains police from arresting criminals with punishment of less than 3 years imprisonment||Jaipur: The high court directed police not to arrest persons for offences where maximum punishment is less than three years in light of the pandemic condition.The single bench of Justice Pankaj Bhandari gave the direction while hearing a bail plea for offence under the IT Act. The court said there is a huge pendency of bail applications and as many as five benches of the court are hearing bail matters in addition to miscellaneous petitions and criminal appeals assigned to them.The court said police have the right to arrest an accused for both cognisable and non-cognisable offences.But the court said considering the grave conditions of the pandemic, lockdown and various guidelines issued by the state government to restrict the number of employees attending offices, there needs to be some restraint from all sides.The court noted that since police are also busy with the more important task of lockdown, it is directed not to arrest an accused charged with offence punishable with a term of less than three years till the situation normalises.The court said the arrest of persons in cases where imprisonment extends up to three years and are triable by first class magistrate under the present circumstances will prove counter-productive. If a person arrested and produced before the magistrate and thereafter sent to jail is an asymptomatic carrier of the Covid virus, the inmates may be put to risk.So the court directed the DGP to issue directions to the effect that restrains police from the arrest of persons with offences where maximum sentence is less than three years of imprisonment and thereby their bail plea at sessions and high court be avoided till July 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-restrains-police-from-arresting-criminals-with-punishment-of-less-than-3-years-imprisonment/articleshow/82781630.cms||Joychen Joseph

The MIDC has developed the new industrial estate on over 500 acre and is ready with infrastructure like road, water supply, streetlights, internal and approach roads for the past one-and-a-half years. Meanwhile, industrial associations have requested the MIDC to immediately start land allotment and give an extension for the concessional rates by another three months.

At around 11:30am, the 15-year-old was going to her uncle Dinesh’s home when the four accused started to harass her with their vulgar comments on her dress. The scared minor girl returned home and told her father Ghanshyam Jadav (45) about the incident.A few minutes later, Jadav, a resident of Udaynagar along with his brother Dinesh confronted the accused protesting their constricted minset and lewd remarks. In a brutal backlash over being reprimanded, the four attacked them with knives, stabbed them repeatedly. So brutal was the attack that the intestines of the girl’s father were ripped out after being stabbed, said the police, adding that the accused thereafter fled the spot. Ghanshyam, who works as a tailor, was rushed to the Rajkot Civil Hospital, while Dinesh was first taken to a private hospital but was later shifted to the civil hospital. Though Ghanshyam underwent a surgery on Wednesday afternoon, his condition remains critical, sources said.“A complaint of attempt to murder has been filed against the four youths. Primary probes suggest that all those involved in this crime were in their 20s. We have launched a manhunt to nab them,” a police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/four-stab-girls-father-uncle-for-resisting-sexist-remarks/articleshow/82779465.cms||---

The government should place an order to purchase more liposomal amphotheracin B injections. There was a supply of only 60 vials of the drug by Cipla a couple of days ago (for trade) which would meet the requirement of only one patient. We receive only one or two lots of the drug from a single company per week,” the official added.Health minister Raghu Sharma had earlier written to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and demanded 50,000 vials of liposomal amphotericin B for the state. The government is yet to place an order for posaconazole and isoconazole, which are substitute drugs for liposomal amphotericin B.Meanwhile, the Centre has increased the allocation of Remdesivir for the state to 3.76 lakh vials up to May 23. “Earlier, the hospitals used to desperately demand for Remdesivir, but now they have sufficient stock of the drug. So, this is a relief,” said an official. Also, the state has received around 4,400 vials of life-saving injection Tocilizumab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-yet-to-receive-drug-to-treat-black-fungus/articleshow/82781663.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Governance should be decentralised: Cong MLA||Jaipur: A day after veteran Congress MLA Hemaram Choudhary sent his resignation to the assembly speaker, another ruling party legislator Ved Prakash Solanki on Wednesday came out in the open claiming that Congress workers in the state were demoralised lot as they were not given their due in governance. He called for decentralisation of power and party workers taken in to confidence and given more opportunities.Like Choudhary, Solanki belongs to the Sachin Pilot camp and was among 19 legislators who had rebelled against chief minister Ashok Gehlot in 2020.Choudhary sent his resignation letter on Tuesday, but it has not been accepted yet. He had not given any reasons for his resignation and the party leadership has been trying to pacify him. “I urge the chief minister to give opportunities to the Congress workers as they are disheartened. They are not getting responsibilities in the organisation or the government, which they should have got in the last two-and-a-half years. It was because of the workers’ hard work, the party had come to power,” Solanki said.“I had said earlier, too, that power should be decentralised so that maximum people get opportunities,” he added.Solanki urged Choudhary to take back his resignation and said he wanted the Congress to remain strong.“But at the same time, the party high command must look in to the reasons for his resignation,” he said.“Choudhary is our ideal, messiah of the poor. There is no honest leader like him in Rajasthan,” Solanki said.“His demand or reason for resignation should be looked into by the party high command. May be his patience is running out and he resigned,” he added.Solanki alleged that the bureaucracy is dominating the state government due to centralisation of power.“There should be decentralisation of power and involvement of maximum people in governance. Due to the centralisation of power, bureaucracy is dominating,” Solanki told reporters.He also said many departments were functioning without ministers for long.He said it was not that all that governance had come to a standstill due to Covid. There were political appointments even during Covid, but he said that people who got appointment was a matter of debate. He said the party organisation is rudderless. He said there were no appointments in the block or district level committees and the workers were feeling let down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/governance-should-be-decentralised-cong-mla/articleshow/82781677.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fr Stan Swamy to be taken to JJ Hospital for check-up today||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court told Taloja prison superintendent take Elgar Parishad accused Fr Stan Swamy to JJ Hospital on Thursday, reports Swati Deshpande. The HC also instructed the JJ Hospital dean to form a panel comprising doctors, a neurophysician, ENT specialist, orthopaedic and general physician, to examine Swamy (84) and submit a report on Friday. The bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade passed the order while hearing an appeal by Fr Swamy, who is alleged to be a Maoist, seeking medical bail on grounds that he has Parkinsons, hearing loss in both ears and lumbar spondylosis. He was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in October 2020. But a report submitted by additional government pleader Jayesh Yagnik said he has had no fall in the prison so far, and he is not eligible for emergency Covid-19 bail under the May 2020 guidelines of a high-powered committee. On May 4, the HC directed the state to file a medical report. The report, prepared by a medical officer of Taloja prison, said Fr Swamy was admitted to the prison hospital, his vitals were monitored daily and he was being given medical treatment. The HC, however, noted, that “nothing was mentioned about his abdominal pain and leg pain due to spondylosis”. Opposing the plea, additional solicitor general Anil Singh, with advocate Sandesh Patil for NIA, said the report also noted that Fr Swamy has “never complained of anything and has expressed satisfaction with all facilities provided to him by the prison administration”. Senior counsel Mihir Desai, appearing for Fr Swamy, disputed the report and hence the HC said it was directing examination by a JJ panel of doctors. The HC told Taloja prison officials to produce Fr Swamy on Friday 10.30am via videoconferencing if it has the facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fr-swamy-to-be-taken-to-jj-for-check-up-today/articleshow/82785075.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||India||Number of youth hit by Covid 2nd wave doubles in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: Covid-19’s second wave in Maharashtra appears to be more brutal to the young, affecting more people below 30 years of age than the first wave did in 2020. Maharashtra government’s statistics show that 651 people in the under-30 age group died between January and May 9 this year. In comparison, 1,117 below 30 years of age died in the state in 10 months between March and December last year. “As the number of affected youngsters is higher this time around, we are seeing more complications, longer ICU stays and deaths in this age group,” said Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the state government’s Covid death audit team. A meeting of the team on Friday will analyse the reasons for mortality among the younger age group, but morbidity patterns among them has doctors worried. The second wave has seen more youngsters in ICUs these days. The average age of ICU admissions was 50-plus in the first wave, but doctors say it is not uncommon to find people less than half the age in ICU this year. Dr Vasant Nagvekar, an infectious disease expert and member of the state taskforce, said young women too, who were not so severely affected in the first wave, have needed ventilator support. “The youngest patient on ventilator at this point in Bandra’s Lilavati Hospital is a 21-year-old man,” said Nagvekar. Doctors also say the length of stay is longer and the damage more extensive this time. Dr Rahul Pandit, who heads the ICU in Fortis Hospital, and is a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said the average stay in ICU is 14 to 15 days as against eight days in the first wave. Even after discharge, Dr Supe said, youngsters need oxygen support of three litres every day for a few weeks. “People are in hospital for longer periods and they get severe complications such as microthrombi (clumps of blood components) or pneumothorax (collapse of lungs),’’ said a doctor from a BMC-run hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/number-of-youth-hit-by-covid-2nd-wave-doubles-in-maharashtra/articleshow/82787249.cms||---

---||Delhi||As Covid-19 strikes at lungs, specialists warn recovered patients to take extra precautions||New Delhi: Lung specialists in Delhi are looking at a rise in the number of bronchitis or asthma patients with breathing problems after recovering from Covid-19. These experts advised recovered patients with pre-existing pulmonary issues to take extra precautions since even the slightest weather change could cause discomfort. “We have seen even people without pre-existing lung issues complaining of chest problems with a change in weather leading to wheezing, stiffness in chest and other conditions,” said Dr Puneet Khanna, head of pulmonology and respiratory medicine, Manipal Hospital, Dwarka. “In Delhi, where pollution is a big headache, those with existing lung problems need to take more care. I think by the time winter approaches, the number of people with such problems will be at a high because pollution and cold will together make things worse.” Other doctors said that it’s not just those with previous respiratory concerns that needed to be extra cautious, but everyone who has a post-Covid breathing problem. They advised patients with breathing issues especially to avoid social gatherings for some time. The experts categorised the setbacks into two types: the first in which people have pre-existing lung problems or their lungs are compromised and don’t work to full capacity and second, those in which people didn’t have pre-existing respiratory illnesses but following Covid infection are experiencing discomfort. In most cases, such problems are arising in people who had moderate and severe Covid experiences. Dr Vikas Maurya, director and head of pulmonology at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, stated that even last year there was a big rise in people having problems with respiration and lungs last winter. “There were more people suffering from pneumonia, low respiratory tract infection and other lung-related problems in the winter months,” he said. “Pollution also has an adverse effect on the lungs that are already dealing with new problems. And then there are seasonal allergies occurring with a change in weather. I think the most important thing is to maintain a healthy diet and monitor yourself from time to time. Breathing exercises and protein-rich food also help. Thankfully, people are much more conscious about Covid-related behaviour now than last year.” Dr Anant Mohan, head of pulmonary medicine at AIIMS, felt it was key for individuals to remain in touch with their doctor and to go for regular check-ups. “Adverse environmental factors are already prevailing in the city. One needs to be careful because all these factors are always present,” Mohan cautioned. “One has to be vigilant, be in touch with the doctor and seek medical advice if one is facing any problems.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-covid-19-strikes-at-lungs-specialists-warn-recovered-patients-to-take-extra-precautions/articleshow/82781785.cms||---

Sawant said that it would take at least two more days to clear road blocks and restore power and water supply, to bring normalcy back to the state. “Until now, we were pegging the losses at Rs 22 crore,” he said. But on actual estimation, the losses are set to touch Rs 35-40 crore. Due to power supply disruption, I am aware that people are also struggling with water shortage issues. Bardez is severely affected, and electricity in some areas will only be restored by Thursday.

We have brought in manpower from other states, those efforts are on. I have directed deputy collectors and mamlatdars to use funds marked for disaster management. In Bardez alone, 135 houses have been damaged,” said Sawant. Each person whose house has either suffered minor or major damage will receive compensation, he said. “We will make efforts to ensure that they get the compensation at the earliest. We are ensuring that normalcy returns to the state within two days,” said the CM. Sawant also announced that compensation of Rs 4 lakh would be provided to each family who has lost a family member due to impact of the cyclone. “We are extremely saddened by the loss of lives due to Tauktae in Goa. The government has sanctioned financial assistance of Rs 4 lakh for every family of the deceased due to the cyclone in the state. My thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved families in this time of grief.” At least four lives have been lost in Goa due to the cyclone. Earlier in the day in Bicholim, Sawant directed all government officials to urgently submit a report of losses borne by villagers and told them to expedite the release of compensation. He directed officials to ensure that no application for damages remains pending. He similarly told agriculture officers to prepare and submit a detailed report of all the losses suffered by farmers in order to compensate them at the earliest. At Mapusa, Sawant instructed the deputy collector and mamlatdar to utilise disaster management funds to deploy additional labour to assist the fire and emergency team to clear the broken trees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-says-cyclone-loss-at-rs-40cr-labour-crunch-hit-power-work/articleshow/82783453.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Use steroids judiciouly to counter mucormycosis cases, says expert||JAIPUR: While taking part in a video conference headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the current Covid scenario in the country with eminent doctors, state advisory board for Covid management member Sudhir Bhandari raised the issue of mucormycosis and appealed to doctors to ensure judicious use of steroids for treatment. Bhandari said, “The whole medical fraternity should pledge before the prime minister to ensure optimal use of steroids as per protocol and total control of diabetes during Covid and post-Covid treatment time.” At the video conference held on Monday, Bhandari said Mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, swas a growing issue in the country. Bhandari apprised Modi that SMS Medical College was the first institute of the country to have used tablet hydroxychloroquine to treat Italian Covid patients in March 2020 and investigation and management protocol of SMS were recognised and appreciated all over the world. SMS Medical College is the institute which has been using HRCT for diagnostic purposes alongwith RTPCR tests and was first of the few institutions to have started using injection tocilizumab and plasma therapy. Throwing light on state’s battle against Covid, he said since February 2020, chief minister Ashok Gehlot and health minister Raghu Sharma had been continuously monitoring the situation and conducted more than 200 video conference meetings to monitor Covid management programme throughout the state. He informed the PM about the infrastructure developed for healthcare of Covid patients including oxygenation and ventilator supported beds, free availability of drugs like remdesivir and tocilizumab in all government hospitals. Bhandari said SMS Medical College is the nodal institution for implementation of Covid management in the state and they were managing 3,000-bed Covid facility in the four Covid hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/amid-rising-mucormycosis-cases-states-health-expert-appeals-to-doctors-for-judicious-use-of-steroids/articleshow/82781783.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Love & emotional bond helped families overcome Covid crisis||LUCKNOW: After failing to get a hospital bed in Lucknow, Sarvesh Goel had to rush his younger brother, critically ill with Covid-19, to Delhi on April 8. He succeeded in hospitalising his brother but he too tested positive the next day and had to isolate himself. In Lucknow, his two daughters also caught infection, aggravating the crisis. Though physically apart, their emotional bond helped the family overcome the challenge. When hospital beds and oxygen had become prized commodities in mid-April due to the overwhelming surge in coronavirus pandemic, it was the family bond and motivation that made many families like Goel’s display extraordinary willpower to survive against all odds. “I desperately searched for a hospital bed for my younger brother, Manoj (42), after he tested positive, but when I could not find one and his blood oxygen level dropped to 80, I decided not to waste time in Lucknow and rushed him to Delhi. With the help of some friends, I got him hospitalised, but I was also diagnosed with Covid-19 the next day,” said Goel, the chairperson of GD Goenka Public School, while recalling the struggle. Goel had mild symptoms and he took a room on rent in Delhi to isolate himself. “Then came the news that my two daughters and niece have also tested positive in Lucknow,” he said. Though fatigued by the disease, Goel’s immediate concern was his brother in hospital and joint family in Lucknow that included his wife, daughters, parents and brother’s wife and kids. While staying in isolation, he coordinated help through friends for his brothers and in Lucknow for his family. “I was sick but had to push on because all were dependent on me,” he said. After 15 days, when both Sarvesh and Manoj recovered, they returned to Lucknow to take care of the family. Alka Ratnakar (45) and her husband Ratnakar Srivastava (49) got infected on April 21. While her husband had mild symptoms, Alka’s oxygen saturation levels dipped to 65%. After trying for hours, she got a bed in Balrampur hospital. “I was scared out of my wits when the doctors told me that she is critical and if she doesn’t respond to medication in 48 hours, she would have to be shifted to ICU. Thankfully, she recovered in eight days,” said Ratnakar, who, despite being infected managed things at home and regularly visited his wife in the hospital. The couple did not involve their 20-year-old son because he had tested negative and they did not want to put him at risk. However, he was always there for emotional support. Gyanendra Sharma (61), president of the Queen’s College Management Committee, remained hospitalised for 15 days in a high dependency unit after getting infected on March 24. “My daughter Sonal saved my life. She took me to five hospitals in search of a bed, but when we could not get one, Sonal coordinated with my friend RP Mishra, former principal of Queen’s College, and got me admitted to Era’s Lucknow Medical College and Hospital,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/love-emotional-bond-helped-families-overcome-covid-crisis/articleshow/82783469.cms||Mohita Tewari

President of the chemist and druggist association of Goa Albert D’Sa said that the antifungal drug isn’t available. He said that when the cases cropped up in other states, he contacted Sun Pharma to procure the drug, but the company too didn’t have it in stock. “I had anticipated the problem and had approached Sun Pharma as well as other stockists, but even then, none had it.” D’Sa told TOI. Two days ago, Goa Medical College (GMC) dean Dr S M Bandekar confirmed six cases treated by the hospital. Besides, TOI reported two cases treated at two different private hospitals in South Goa. Prasad Tamba, a pharmacist from Panaji, said that he has seen about five prescriptions for Amphotericin B, but they don’t have the stock. “Apart from GMC, I don’t think any chemist has stock,” he said. In the last two days, D’Sa said six people approached him, but he had to turn them down as they don’t have the antifungal drug which was hardly in demand prior to the black fungus cases. Companies had no reason to ramp up their production of Amphotericin B vials until last month, he said. On Monday, Bandekar had told reporters that the government had procured the drug for the treatment of the six patients. D’Sa said he’d have to speak to Bandekar to find out if GMC had stock. D’Sa said that even if pharma companies want to ramp up production of Amphotericin B, they can’t do it in a day or a two. The speedy production will depend on factors such as availability of raw material and logistics, he said. The misuse of steroids in Covid-19 patients, and those having high diabetes, is said to be causing black fungus. He said there has been a growing tendency among people to self-medicate by following forwards on WhatsApp. Some may be misusing steroids too, he said, though pharmacists do not sell steroids without a prescription as it is not an over-the-counter medicine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/crucial-drug-to-treat-black-fungus-out-of-stock-in-state/articleshow/82783532.cms||---

Lobo said he is “sad and angry” that large parts of his constituency of Calangute have gone without power for the fourth day in a row in the aftermath of cyclone Tauktae. The state government has neither the equipment or the manpower to restore normalcy, he said. “I feel sad that I am a minister, and for the fourth consecutive day, our people do not have power. At least 150 poles in Calangute and 100 poles in Candolim are damaged,” he said. “We have ourselves purchased cables and are trying to pull them across long distances to provide single line connections to people.” He slammed claims of the state administration that power has been restored to over 90% of the state. “The damage in Calangute, Candolim, Arpora, Nagoa, Parra and other parts of North Goa coastal belt is running into crores of rupees,” he said. “A lot of damage has been caused to houses, boats, and traditional fishermen. Fifty percent of Calangute is still in darkness. I saw in the news claims that 95% of connections have been restored. The people making the claims seem to be doing so sitting at their homes.” Lobo said the state government is severely lacking in manpower and equipment to handle disasters. “Our junior engineers are doing a good job. But in such a situation, we should have been given additional manpower. The disaster management team that the government says it has is non-existent. I personally called up the chief minister to tell him that we need to have three-phase saws with our disaster management teams to clear up trees that have crashed. But we do not have them,” said the minister. It is sad that a large banyan blocked a road in Parra, but there was no equipment to clear it, Lobo said. “We should have at least 12 of the large saws, which need to be distributed to the fire stations across Goa. There is no disaster management team in place. These were cyclonic winds. But even if some strong winds cause any minor damage during the monsoon, the government is not prepared to tackle it. I ask the chief minister to therefore put the required system in place,” said Lobo. “We do not have either electricity poles or wires or manpower. Nothing has been restored. It is sad,” he said. Lobo also said that he has told the chief minister that a pittance should not be paid to those affected in the name of compensation. “I have told CM that at least 50% of the amount claimed for damages to homes, etc, should be provided to those affected,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-govt-cant-handle-disaster-im-sad-lobo/articleshow/82783494.cms||---

The order passed last week clearly stated that these quacks need to be identified and reported to police.Jitendra Soni, district collector, Nagaur, said since the beginning of the second wave, quacks have become active by providing unscientific advice to those suspected Covid patients. “They are taking advantage of the fear which has crept into the rural areas with the rise in infections. The misleading advice and medicines are aggravating the situation and often the person is losing his/her life due to the delay,” said Soni.The administration has decided to book these fake doctors under the epidemic act. Another measure taken by the administration is the counselling of all 500 sarpanchs in the district over relying on the healthcare system for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nagaur-collector-asks-people-to-report-quacks/articleshow/82781824.cms||---

In the last 45 days, around 6-8 pregnant women have died triggering concern among obstetricians calling for close monitoring of all expectant mothers. The Udaipur district administration has embarked on a special campaign to ensure that pregnant women do not suffer from complacency. Special focus is on expecting mothers whose risks of developing serious illnesses is manifold compared to others. “A special campaign, including intense door-to-door survey, to reach out to pregnant women has begun and four woman officers have been given the complete charge of safety protocols for them. Zila parishad CEO Manju Chowdhary, a gynaecologist herself, is leading the campaign, while DSP Prem Dhande, district supply officer Jyoti Kakwani and SDM Girva Aparna Gupta are the nodal officers,” collector Chetan Ram Deora told TOI. According to sources, there are some 84,000 pregnant women in 20 blocks of the district and in the past four days, some 12,600 women have been reached. “Considering the risk factors during the second wave, especially on pregnant women, we have started a district-wide campaign that calls for expectant mothers to follow home quarantine strictly and to avoid unnecessary visits, including to hospitals. It will be implemented alongside the Covid prevention and control measures,” Dr Manju told TOI. A control room has been set up at district level which will take reports from the control rooms at all blocks. DSO Jyoti Kakwani has been given charge for the compilation and updation of received data. It is an integrated effort with the medical teams, ASHA workers, school teachers, block development officers, sarpanchs and ward members and even police and RTOs are involved, the officer said. Three categories Red, Yellow and Green have been identified and expecting mothers would be put in these categories as per their medical conditions. Those with influenza like illness (ILI) or anyone symptomatic in the house, would be in the yellow category while corona positive pregnant women or those with serious ailments like hypertension, thyroid, diabetes etc., would fall in the red category. “ASHA workers and ANMs would provide necessary medicines at their doorsteps so that they do not need to go to hospitals for periodic check-ups until the pandemic situation normalises as hospitals are becoming hotspots of the disease,” SDM Aparna Gupta said. Speaking about the role of police department, DySP Prem Dhande said beat constables, especially women, would keep vigil on households having expecting mothers. “Police checkposts would be intimated of the vehicles carrying pregnant women to hospitals and if required, green corridors would be created for hassle-free movement of such vehicles,” Dhande said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/4-lady-officers-for-safety-of-pregnant-women-in-udaipur/articleshow/82790552.cms||---

During a crucial meeting of the Trust held via video-conferencing on Wednesday, the members expressed concern over non-issuance of tax exemption for donors to the mosque project under Section 80G of IT Act. “This is impeding flow of donations to the project,” said IICF chief Zufar Farooqui, who chaired the meet. In another significant decision, the Trust will be launching a charitable ambulance service in Ayodhya district to mitigate suffering of Covid patients. IICF secretary Athar Husain and 10 Trustees, including Captain Afzal Ahmad from Ayodhya discussed pending issues, including submission of the project blueprint to the development authority and a follow-up on FCRA norms after 80G tax exemption by income tax department. Captain Afzal Ahmad, who is pursuing sanction of the project blueprint, said, the Ayodhya Development Authority vice-chairman has assured early approval. The Trust also expressed concern at the demolition of a century-old mosque at Ram Sanehi Ghat in Barabanki, barely 45km off the new mosque site at Dhannipur. The razing of the mosque violated a court stay on any demolition during the pandemic and the structure should be rebuilt, said IICF members. Talking to TOI, IICF secretary Athar Hussain said, “We request the state and Central governments to provide necessary clearances to enable us to begin work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mosque-trust-seeks-additional-20acre-for-medical-facility/articleshow/82783498.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Rape accused acquitted after baby’s DNA matches him, not accuser||AHMEDABAD: A special Pocso court in Nadiad has acquitted a man of the charge of raping a minor because the child alleged to have been born to the accuser was found not to be hers. Besides, all the witnesses had turned hostile. The child’s DNA sample did not match with the accuser, though it matched with the accused, Rasik Solanki. He was acquitted on May 4. In this case, a woman had registered an FIR with Kapadwanj police accusing Solanki, 24, of seducing and raping her 15-year-old daughter repeatedly. The complainant said he had impregnated her daughter. She said when the minor delivered a baby girl, the child was abandoned under a tree. The minor allegedly delivered the child on October 28, 2020, but the FIR was lodged on January 6, 2021. The family told the cops that the fear of social stigma was the reason for the delayed FIR. Solanki was booked for rape under IPC and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. However, when the trial began after a few months in a Nadiad court, all the witnesses and the accuser turned hostile. She denied having an affair with the accused or having been forced into a physical relationship. She even retracted her statement recorded earlier before a judicial magistrate under the provisions of Section 164 of the CrPC giving it the weight of material evidence. She told the court she had made that statement at her mother’s behest. The court did not have any human evidence to nail Solanki. Then the analysis received from the Forensic Science Laboratory was even more startling. Kapadwanj police inspector and the investigating officer of this case, Hardeepsinh Zala, told the court that the DNA sample of the girl child matched with the accused, but not with the accuser. The court concluded that the child had not been born to the accuser. This complete absence of evidence led additional sessions judge D R Bhatt to acquit Solanki. The accused has been released on a Rs 10,000 bond till the appeal period is over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rape-accused-acquitted-after-babys-dna-matches-him-not-accuser/articleshow/82781815.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Bhilwara villagers keep slippers tied in front of houses to keep Covid at bay||Jaipur/Ajmer: Meandering through the deserted alleys of dusty Dantra Bandh village in Bhilwara, you can’t miss shoes and slippers tied at the doors. The village, which has recorded 28 deaths in the last 31 days mostly due to influenza like illness (ILI), is following the diktat of a ‘bhopa’ (quack) of keeping the virus at the bay. He warned the 500 households that Covid has set on the earth to revenge for the killings made by their ancestors.“Tying sleepers or shoes at the doors would scare the virus from entering your house. This method has been successful in saving our lives and those who have died are those who mocked it,” said Mohan Lal Khateek, a villager, who has lost three of his relatives due to what he claimed ‘unknown’ reasons. He firmly believed that those who go to the hospital will return dead in a PPE kit. The pandemic has thrown a light on how quacks and sect leaders govern the life of the villagers is costing dearly in the pandemic. They are working overtime suggesting ways and activities based on ‘superstition’ to protect people from Covid while giving them an alternate to healthcare system. From placing sleepers at doors to burning coconuts outside the house and to forming mustard oil circles around the houses to wearing neem and tulsi trees around the neck, several strange ‘remedies’ are being suggested by the quacks.The people of Umand village in Kapasan, Chittorgarh, are having a hard time for the last two days due to incessant rain. Rainwater is flooding their houses as for the last 20 days, every household here is not closing the doors. Reason: The village tantrik, who is also a local priest, has asked the villagers to not lock their houses as he is burning sacred wood to eliminate the virus. “The smoke of the wood would kill the virus,” said Pabba Lal, a villager, who said they guard outside the house every night fearing the entry of stray and wild animals. The village has a population of 2,500 people who say the visuals of people in big cities dying for want of beds and medicines have made them believe that they have no place in the government healthcare system. For the last seven days, the villagers of Lacchipura village in Pisagan village in Ajmer are busy singing carols and hymns around a fire at the centre of the village. They believe that Covid is an evil spirit that will be eliminated by the sacred fire and worshipping Goddess Mata Rani. “Neither PM Modi nor the CM Gehlot would save from the misery of Covid other than our deities. If we keep our deities happy, they will ensure our happiness,” said Dinesh Kumar, a villager. The villagers have kept the trolley full of wood in advance to make sure the ritual runs uninterrupted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bhilwara-villagers-keep-slippers-tied-in-front-of-houses-to-keep-covid-at-bay/articleshow/82781829.cms||Shoeb Khan

The incident, which happened on Sunday, came to light on Wednesday when Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi put up a video of the driver on Twitter demanding action against the cops for their alleged errant behaviour. In a series of tweets on Wednesday, Owaisi alleged that DCM van driver Subhan was detained and beaten up by traffic cops. The Hyderabad MP also mentioned that the police abused Subhan referring to his religion, and he was let off on Tuesday after his intervention. “Every cop who participated in these criminal activities should be suspended immediately, and punished severely. There can be no excuse for torture,” Owaisi said in the tweet. However, police said that Subhan misbehaved with a traffic home guard near the vegetable market and assaulted him. RGI Airport traffic inspector, Y Ramakrishna, said: “Home guard Srikanth Reddy was clicking photos of traffic violators, and Subhan picked up an argument thinking Reddy had clicked a photo of his vehicle.” The inspector said, “He was forcing the home guard to show the photos, and even held his collar. Another home guard, Prabhu Lingam, joined Reddy and they brought Subhan to the police station. Subhan continued to abuse the Home Guards and the duty constable, Mallesh. Based on their complaint, a case was registered against Subhan for assaulting a public servant.” While agreeing that Reddy slapped Subhan, the inspector said that Subhan was neither tortured nor detained. “We have not abused Subhan referring to his religion,” the inspector said. RGI Airport ACP V Bhaskar said that no arrest has been made in the alleged assault case, and they are inquiring into the allegations made by Subhan against the police personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/van-driver-alleges-assault-by-cops-asad-demands-action/articleshow/82783543.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||For the disabled, food is a bigger worry than Covid||New Delhi: I don’t even know how to get myself vaccinated, says Sonu with a shrug. An accident in 2013 cost him both his legs. He used to be a factory worker in Jahangirpuri but is jobless now. His impoverished family of four live in a one-room home and Covid vaccination is far from their thoughts when daily life itself is a daunting proposition. “There is news that there aren’t many vaccines available in Delhi anyway,” shrugs Sonu. “When the rich are unable to get themselves vaccinated, can people like me even think of the jab?” His shoulders droop when he adds that none of his family has ever had proper healthcare. A public interest plea in Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought the central and Delhi governments’ priority help for persons with disabilities, with special provisions for vaccinating them against Covid irrespective of their age. The PIL, filed through advocates Siddharth Seem and Joicy, contends that both the governments’ failure to accord priority status to such people in the vaccination programme was violative of the Constitution. But food worries 41-year-old Mangu Singh more than protection from the coronavirus. He is the sole earning member of his family of wife, child and ailing mother even though his lower body is paralysed. “The government has promised us a lot of things, but we don’t even have essentials like food and water,” said Singh. “We rely on NGOs that distribute food every now and then. Of course, the situation is not as bad as last year when we went without food for days, but it’s not good either. My heart breaks when I have to put my kid to sleep without food.” Singh wondered how, when they weren’t even assured of a full meal a day, they could even imagine having access to healthcare. Like him and Sonu, persons with disabilities are having a particular difficult time dealing with the anxieties about Covid. As Ravi Kishan, 35, said, “I earned around Rs 10,000 a month and with that sum had to take care of my family, including my ailing mother and my tot. Now that I am jobless, where can I get the money? All I have for our survival is my small savings.” His thoughts were about those who did not even have this tiny cushion of savings. The resident of Savda Ghevra in northwest Delhi’s Khanjhawala revealed there were at least 2,000 people with disabilities in the colony, all of them handicapped by having nobody to take care of their medical needs. “Some cannot speak and others can barely get out of beds on their own. They used to have attendants, but the latter no longer come because of the danger posed by the coronavirus. "These people don’t even get their usual medicines,” Singh claimed. Jitender Singh, 40, has weak kidneys and has suffered psychiatric setbacks. “I live alone and don’t have anyone to get me my medicines,” he said. “On some days, people get me some food, but there are days when I sleep on an empty stomach. The government isn’t doing much for people like me who are neither rich nor privileged.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/for-the-disabled-food-is-a-bigger-worry-than-covid/articleshow/82781831.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

The child panel also asked the NGOs to come forward in helping the children during the pandemic for bettering the facilities in the shelters.“I held a discussion with various NGOs working for children’s welfare. We came to know that there were certain issues for distribution of sanitary napkins to the girls and for the same, I have written to the principal secretaries of health and education. Last year, a similar issue had cropped up and we want to ensure that all girls have access to basic hygiene,” said Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights.Apart from this, Beniwal also appealed to the organisation to come forward in spreading awareness about precautions to be taken during the pandemic and ensuring that the children shelters have adequate resources like oximeters, sanitisers, thermometers and others.The commission is regularly monitoring the situation in the children’s shelters in anticipation of the third wave of Covid which might affect children. Recently, it was found that a two-month-old boy and a three-day-old girl from an infant shelter were admitted to JLN hospital in Nagaur after being infected with coronavirus. This had led to prompt action by the commission who wrote to the district collector of Nagaur who set up a dedicated Covid ward for children with separate nursing staff for them. Both the children are recovering well and the situation is being monitored, said officials.The commission had issued guidelines to all the district collectors about precautionary measures to prepare for the anticipated third Covid wave which might affect children. This includes not only strengthening the existing infrastructure, but also setting up of dedicated Covid centres/wards for children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/child-panel-writes-to-health-edu-secys-for-distribution-of-sanitary-napkins/articleshow/82781835.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rural Jodhpur surpasses city in positive cases, Covid mortality||Jodhpur: Covid infection has preceded the prevention plans of administration in rural areas, causing an abrupt spike in positive cases in villages. The rate of infection, which was far less in rural areas in the first 10 days of May, has now shot beyond 50% of total infections in Jodhpur district, surpassing even 60% mark on certain days.The spike prompted the district administration to shift its focus to rural areas from urban, where the condition has reasonably improved with daily positive cases falling below 1,000 for the past few days, with the number of testing also declining.In a video conferencing on May 16 with the SDMs and sarpanchs, district magistrate Indrajeet Singh had insisted upon activating the gram panchayat level committees recognizing their role in breaking the chain of infection.Till then, according to Singh, 6 lakh door-to-door surveys had been done in rural areas of the district and 45,000 medicine kits had been distributed among the villagers. Recently, in a Divisional level meeting, the administrative officials had claimed that 100% survey in Jodhpur district had been done.Stressing on early detection and early treatment, Singh had also asked to activate Covid control centres at panchayat level.But according to a senior officer from the Medical and Health department, these steps should have been taken parallel to the focus on the city.“But unfortunately, it took both the government and administration to swing into action only after the situation started deteriorating in rural areas,” he said adding that had it been done, the unmanageable load on the city hospitals could have been avoided and some lives could have been saved.Even the worsening situation prompted the revenue minister Harish Choudahry to hold a meeting with the administration on Saturday to review the situation and preparations in rural areas.Due to this delay, an approximate mortality rate of rural patients has almost touched 65% in the district in the ongoing month according to the sources, thereby turning the villages into new hotspots. Though, the administrative officials have been frequently visiting the rural areas in commensuration with the surge in cases, but still the arrangements in the PHCs and CHCs are largely dependent on the donations and charities by the donors, philanthropists and charitable organisations, and now the funds from public representatives, who have been providing oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators in the villages.“We have been working towards setting up at least one oxygen generation plant in each sub division and have been ensuring oxygen and beds availability so that the patients could be treated in the village itself,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rural-jodhpur-surpasses-city-in-positive-cases-covid-mortality/articleshow/82781866.cms||---

In exchange, the IAF has been allotted a similar size of land parcel by Jodhpur Municipal Corporation.Defence Estate Officer (Jodhpur Circle) Abhinav Singh said the Air Force dismantled all its establishments on this land before finally handing over this land parcel to the civil airport for expansion.“In all, 2.42 acres is forest land and for the diversion of this land, the AAI would be undertaking procedure according to the conditions of MoU,” said Singh.This land will facilitate the airport to further expand its facilities to accommodate more passenger planes.This transfer of land is the result of an MoU signed in 2017 among various stakeholders as per which, 37 acres of land was to be transferred by the IAF to the airport in return of same size land to the Air Force by JMC.Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who contributed in accelerating the process of the transfer of land so that the required expansion of the civil airport could be done fast, said that taxiway and apron have already been built and with this transfer of land now, the AAI will begin the construction of a terminal building.“This expansion will help in the parking of 9-12 passenger planes as against four planes currently and about 500 passengers at the airport at a time,” Shekhawat said.A PIL had also been filed in the high court by a voluntary organization LIBRA India stressing on the need of expansion of the Jodhpur airport citing lack of adequate connectivity, facilities and availability of flights at night.Intervention of the court then led to installation of Instrument Landing System (ILS) to facilitate night landing of planes followed by construction of a taxiway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/iaf-barters-land-for-expansion-of-jodhpur-airport/articleshow/82781863.cms||---

Tharayil was admitted to state-run GT hospital for Covid-19. He also suffers from an eye infection with no MRI angiography done yet though advised on May 13, his counsel Yug Chaudhry submitted. Tharayil was arrested last July by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Justice S P Tavade passed the order to transfer him while hearing a petition filed by Tharayil’s wife, Jenny Roweena, for urgent medical bail to treat his eye infection. The petition said he “is suffering from an undiagnosed acute eye infection that due to the utter callousness and neglect of the officials of Taloja Central prison has resulted in an almost complete loss of vision in his left eye”. The infection, it added, has led to inflammation, blood clotting in an ophthalmic vein and “creation of an abnormality in the carotid artery which significantly endangers the brain.’’ The petition, through Chaudhry and advocate Payoshi Roy, said mandated diagnostic tests to detect mucormycosis have still not been conducted. It added that even a single day’s delay may cost him his eye “or even his life”. It added that “fungal swab” required to rule out mucormycosis could not be conducted at GT Hospital. The NIA sought to oppose his plea on the grounds that it could set a precedent. The bench said given the present situation, he deserved to be treated at a hospital of his choice. At the hearing via videoconferencing, the HC spoke to Tharayil who said he was getting treatment at GT Hospital, but his lawyer said certain required tests cannot be conducted at the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shift-hany-babu-to-breach-candy-hosp-to-treat-eye/articleshow/82785121.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Hyderabad||JNTU-H to hold online exam for BTech, pharmacy||Hyderabad: In the wake of the second wave of Covid-19, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTU-H) has decided to conduct an online proctored examination for final year BTech and B Pharmacy students. A decision to this effect was taken during the academic senate meeting held on Tuesday. The university is set to conduct the final year exams for close to 40,000 students from June 14. For the first time ever, students would appear for the examination from their home. To appear for the examination, each student would need either a laptop or a smartphone with internet connectivity. For those who don’t have access to either of them, the university would make arrangements in nearby affiliated colleges. “It will be a two-hour examination, wherein students will be expected to be online with their cameras on. We will be sending the question paper to the students through mail/WhatsApp. Once they receive it, they will have to write the answers on a sheet of paper in front of the invigilator, who will be monitoring them through their cameras,” JNTU-H director, evaluation Kamakshi Prasad said. Once the students complete writing their answers, they would have to create a PDF and upload it on a URL the university would share with them. To ensure that no student indulges in malpractices, the university has not only decided to have a proctored examination but has also made changes in the question papers. “Just like IITs and NITs, where an open book examination is allowed, the questions would require more descriptive answers. We have asked our faculty to adopt problem-oriented and concept-oriented questions and not something that is straight out of the textbooks,” Prasad added. The university has also decided to keep ratio of invigilators and students at 1:12 for the online proctored exam as against 1:24 for the conventional one. “The invigilators will be monitoring the students. If the invigilator finds any suspicious activity, he/she can recommend cancellation of the examination,” Prasad said, adding the university was in the process of identifying and finalising an agency that would enable the conduct of the examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jntu-h-to-hold-online-exam-for-btech-pharmacy/articleshow/82783624.cms||Preeti Biswas

The protests were held in sectors15, 21, 22, 29, 44 and 45. The major demand of traders was to allow the opening of shops dealing with non-essential items either on oddeven basis of Punjab pattern or even for specific hours in a day. The second demand was immediate tax relief from different government bodies, as almost all the businesses are under lockdown and are suffering huge financial losses. CBM president Charanjiv Singh said traders followed social distancing and other Covid protocols while staging protest. “We as traders community also support UT administration’s move in the fight against Covid. But the UT administration should understand the difficulties faced by traders. We are not against lockdown, but UT should allow opening of non-essential items shops for some specific hours or on odd-even basis,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/traders-want-opening-of-non-essential-shops-on-odd-even-format/articleshow/82783622.cms||---

The CM spent almost one hour in the state-run hospital by going around wards and interacting with Covid-19 patients. He assured them that the government would provide them the best Covid-19 treatment. He went around ICU, emergency, out-patient and general wards where Covid-19 patients are being treated and spoke to them. Apart from asking about their well-being, the CM sought to know from the patients if they were getting proper treatment from the doctors. He also inquired about quality of food served and other facilities offered to them. The CM quickly responded to some of the problems raised by the patients and gave instructions to medical officers to attend to them immediately. The CM was accompanied by finance minister T Harish Rao, who is now looking after the health portfolio, chief secretary Somesh Kumar and senior officials during his whirlwind visit. Gandhi is the biggest hospital run by the government in the state with 1,200 beds, including 700 ICU beds, and also the nodal hospital treating Covid-19 patients ever since the pandemic broke out last year. KCR also examined the oxygen plant being set up at the hospital and checked with hospital superintendent Dr M Raja Rao on its functioning. The plant is set up following the instructions of the CM to supply 2,000 litres of oxygen per minute to the patients. Recently, the government had decided to set up oxygen plants in all the 48 government hospitals in the state. The CM spoke with senior doctors, contract nurses and junior doctors and complimented them for offering services to Covid-19 patients putting their own lives at risk. The CM said his government will resolve their grievances and advised young medicos to stand by the affected patients in these turbulent times. “In these difficult times, you are doing a great job by serving the people. Continue these services. In case you have any problem or difficulty, please contact me directly. I will extend all cooperation to you,” the CM told the doctors. The CM also instructed the medical and health officials to send proposals to resolve the problems of junior doctors and nurses. It may be recalled the chief minister and his son, municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao had tested positive for coronavirus last month and resumed duties recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-visits-gandhi-interacts-with-patients/articleshow/82781955.cms||---

The government cited a set of norms while calculating this number. According to a statement by the state's basic education department, "election duty starts when an employee reaches the training centre and ends after he completes the polling or the counting and leaves the booth". If someone dies in this period, he or she is eligible for a compensation of Rs 30 lakh and a government job for a kin. . Teachers unions reacted sharply to this and threatened a stir. They said this leaves out all those teachers who contracted Covid during the poll process but either died at home or hospital. UP minister of state (independent charge) for basic education, Satish Chandra Dwivedi, said that all the deaths (1,621) cannot be attributed to the elections. The unions reiterated that all 1,621 teachers got infected with Covid-19 during their panchayat election duty and subsequent ballot counting. They have demanded Rs 1crore compensation for the families of the dead teachers. President of Prathmik Shikshak Sangh, Dinesh Chandra Sharma, slammed the UP government’s “highly irresponsible and insensitive” statement. “(The) fight will continue until all 1,621 teachers who died due to the state’s careless decisions get justice,” he said. Prathmik Shikshak Sangh had released an extensive list which they said contained the names, employee numbers and other details of teachers who had died of Covid-19 which they got during the poll process. It said that most deaths took place in May. Sharma had told TOI earlier that "we have shared the names and contact numbers of the family members. Chief minister (Yogi Adityanath) can get the data verified. Many teachers who died because of election duty were the sole earning members of their family. Many children are orphans now. Many women are widows. But there is not a single word from any government official or politician for them".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/unions-say-1621-teachers-died-in-poll-duty-up-govt-only-3/articleshow/82777693.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC stays axing of trees at Tata Garden for coastal road project||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday restrained till Friday, the BMC from implementing a January 6 order of the civic tree authority to fell 61 trees and transplant 79 others in and around Tata Garden at Breach Candy to make way for an interchange at Bhulabhai Desai Road for the Mumbai Coastal Road project. The HC bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade passed the interim order while hearing a public interest litigation by the NGO, Society for Improvement, Greenery and Nature, through its secretary Nilesh Baxi to challenge the tree authority’s permission to remove 140 trees from inside and outside the garden for a parking lot and road-widening. Tata Garden was opened in 1985 on a civic land with more than 300 trees, most of them over 34 years old and some donated by local residents. It provides a play area and safe green zone for residents and some coming “from as far as Byculla, Grant Road, Tardeo, Peddar road and Nepean Sea Road”, said the PIL. The NGO’s counsel Ankit Kulkarni said the petition is urgent as the BMC sent its tree-cutters at the site. He further claimed that their objections and a proposed alternative arrangement to ensure “minimal destruction” of trees have gone unheard by the BMC, which in February 2020 had issued a not-ice for the tree-cutting and invited objections and suggestions. Senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, A Y Sakhare with advocate Joel Carlos for the BMC said the PIL was filed last March and despite the tree authority passing a final order in January and uploading it on the website on January 19, it was never challenged. However, they said that now when the cutting had begun, the petitioner seemed to have woken. But Kulkarni said they had sought hearing several times, to no avail. The BMC reply was filed in February and served on the petitioner too, said its lawyers. But Kulkarni said the reply was received on Wednesday, and it doesn’t mention where the trees are to be transplanted. The HC noted that the BMC was unable to show any acknowledgement of prior service of its reply and allowed the NGO to amend its PIL to now challenge the final order of the tree authority. Chinoy asked why there should be a stay now. He also said the matter cannot be kept beyond vacation as the coastal road project would be delayed. He sought a Friday hearing next, which the HC agreed to. The BMC, in its reply, cited a July 2019 HC judgment to show that the court had already held that the civic body has good reason to fix the location of the interchange at Tata Garden and hence, under a bar in law, the same issue cannot be gone into again by the HC. The BMC also said that 250 emails were received to its tree-cutting notice and four people attended a public hearing on February 28, 2020. It added that the tree authority ’s order was passed after compliance with the procedure and hence the PIL must be dismissed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-stays-axing-of-trees-at-tata-garden-for-coastal-road-project/articleshow/82785161.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Coimbatore||Now, a temple for ‘Corona devi’ in Coimbatore||COIMBATORE: The current situation more or like resembles the one in the early 1900s when the district was badly hit by the plague, which took a heavy toll by revisiting the district again and again. While the residents turned to Plague Mariamman Temple then, the present generation has set up a temple for the “Goddess Corona Devi” to contain the contagion. Set up by the authorities of Kamatchipuri Adhinam, the temple has come up on their premises at Kamatchipuram near Irugur on the outskirts of the city. This is the second shrine to come up for “Corona Devi” in South India. In June last, a temple priest from Kadakkal in Kollam district in Kerala had installed the idol of the deity in a makeshift shrine attached to his house to ward off the fear of the virus. A source with the Kamatchipuri Adhinam said, “When people were suffering from the plague and other deadly diseases a few centuries ago, they had started worshipping the god, who they believed could only help them during the difficult times. Later, the place where they worshipped the god was turned into a temple. Similarly, we have created and consecrated “Corona Devi” - a black stone idol that is about 1.5ft long. We strongly believe that the goddess will protect people from Covid-19.” While the consecration ceremony was conducted on Tuesday, poojas were performed from Wednesday. The source said they would be performing special prayers for 48 days. However, devotees and general public would not be allowed to participate in the prayers because of the pandemic situation. In a video released by the Adhinam, Sri Sivalingeswara Swamigal urged the public to follow all the government guidelines - stay at home, consume healthy foods and cooperate with the government to contain the virus spread. “Following in on the footsteps of our ancestors, we have installed an idol of “Corona Devi” because we believe god will help the hapless.” He asked the public to pray from their houses. The Plague Mariamman Temple, which is located between Big Bazaar and Raja Streets, is more than 150 years old. When the city was affected by plague, seeking divine succour, people had reportedly offered prayers at the temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/now-a-temple-for-corona-devi-in-coimbatore/articleshow/82782014.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The suspect has been booked under sections 420 (cheating), 464 (making a false document), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 472 (making or possessing counterfeit seal) of the Indian Penal Code. “In 2018, the suspect had taken Rs 70 lakh from the complainant under the pretext of helping him get a licence to start and restaurant & bar and also open a liquor shop,” an officer from the Chikhali police said, adding, “The suspect also staged an accident of the complainant’s car and took additional Rs 4 lakh for saving the complainant of ‘legal trouble’.” The suspect also took Rs 19 lakh from a relative in Sangli district under the pretext of securing admission for his son in a private college and help him get his pension money. “When the complainant did not return the money despite continuous follow-up, his uncle filed the complaint,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-dupes-relatives-of-rs-93-lakh-booked/articleshow/82782017.cms||---

Researchers also found that tigresses, especially pregnant big cats, have more stress than tigers. Scientists studied the presence of stress-related hormone in the big cats’ faeces. LaCONES scientist Govindhaswamy Umapathy said: “Our studies are carried in the wild in the undisturbed area and in the non-tourism period when there is no anthropogenic pressure. In zoos like Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad, which is well planned and properly managed, there is no significant difference in the stress levels. However, at one of the zoos in South Africa where there is no planning and proper management, the stress levels are high.” He said the female tigers have more stress levels than males. “A pregnant tigress has the highest stress levels. Tigresses undergo a lot of stress due to physiological changes. There is no seasonal variation in stress as we studied them in difference seasons,” he said. Scientists monitored and compared stress-related faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations of tigers housed at different locations like Nehru Zoo and free-ranging big cats in natural tiger reserves such as Kanha. The project aimed at better understanding of the impact of extrinsic factors on adrenocortical function as a measure of stress. The study is published in the recent edition of ‘General and Comparative Endocrinology’ journal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tigers-in-well-maintained-zoos-have-less-stress-than-those-in-unplanned-ones/articleshow/82783636.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Regional transport officer Thiagarajan, district social welfare officer Devakumari and Ooty tahsildar Kuppuraj coordinated with the district administration for the initiative.The administration had distributed grocery and vegetable kits to street vendors two weeks ago. “Volunteers and NGOs are requested to come forward to help the needy,” the collector said.“The Nilgiris has been witnessing an increase in Covid-19 cases for the last two weeks. Gatherings at markets and public places pave way for transmission of the virus. People should follow the lockdown protocol and cooperate with the government to contain the transmission of the virus,” Innocent Divya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/nilgiris-administration-distributes-grocery-kits-to-auto-operators/articleshow/82782003.cms||---
---||Pune||Farmers upset over 45-60% increase in fertilizer prices||Pune: Farmers in Pune district are upset over a 45-60% hike in the prices of various fertilizers, ahead of the crucial sowing season in June. These fertilizers were mostly used for increasing the crop yield.Many farmers said they were not in a position to purchase fertilizers because of the present Covid situation and the government needed to take an immediate cognizance of their problem. They said their cultivation expenses were bound to grow by at least Rs10,000 to Rs12,000 per acre in the wake of the hike.Prices of fertilizers such as ‘Diammonium Phosphate,’ which is used by sugarcane and onion growers , have gone up by around 58%. A 50kg bag was being sold at Rs1,900 as against Rs1,200 before the hike. Similarly, the cost of other complex fertilisers had increased significantly. Another fertilizer, ‘10:26:26’ which was sold at Rs1,175, was now being sold at Rs1,775.Ajit Navale, secretary of the Kisan Sabha organisation, said, “The fuel price, tractor and transportation cost have already driven up the farming expenses over the last two months. Now, the fertilizer price hike will make matters worst. A large number of farmers have faced huge financial losses as they could not sell their harvest at a good price owing to the Covid restrictions. The government needs to take appropriate steps to control the prices at the earliest.” Shankar Pawar, a pomegranate farmer from Kadbanwadi in Indapur tehsil, said, “Farmers will simply collapse under the weight of such constraints.” Agriculture activist Sachin Holkar said, “Farmers are already debt-ridden and the price hike will further weaken them financially and force them to migrate to the cities in search of livelihood.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/farmers-upset-over-45-60-increase-in-fertilizer-prices/articleshow/82782039.cms||Sandip Dighe

The Mohali police on May 6 launched the pick and drop service for senior citizens of the district for vaccination. The police personnel have already asked the health officials to vaccinate senior citizens while they remain seated inside their vehicles where possible. According to the Mohali police, the senior citizen who was vaccinated at her home is 82-year-old Parmpal Kaur, a resident of Phase IV, Mohali. Her granddaughter, Manreet told TOI, “I saw the poster regarding the drive through vaccination centres and I contacted them and told them that my grandmother needs the vaccine but at home as she is not able to travel. They claimed that they are not operational yet, but three days later I got a call from Mohali police who asked our address and came along with the health officials.” Deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Guriqbal Singh, the nodal officer, said “On May 14 Parmpal Kaur was vaccinated at her place. Till date, 152 senior citizens have availed our service. Out of these 152, 99 are males and 53 are females. Even in the future, if any senior citizen who is not in a condition to travel and wants to be vaccinated at his/her place, we are ready to help them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/senior-citizen-gets-jab-at-home-thanks-to-mohali-police/articleshow/82783627.cms||---
---||Pune||Monsoon unaffected by cyclone in Bay of Bengal||PUNE: The possibility of another cyclonic storm, this time brewing over the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal, is unlikely to impact the monsoon’s onset over Kerala on May 31 negatively, weather experts from IMD and Skymet told TOI on Wednesday. While the likely formation of a low pressure area over north Andaman Sea and adjoining east-central Bay of Bengal around May 21 may bring the monsoon to Andaman Sea and adjoining southeast Bay of Bengal, the system’s intensification gradually into a cyclonic storm is unlikely to disrupt the monsoon flow or onset over the mainland, as per current updates from weather models, experts said. The exact place of its landfall and day is awaited. The second cyclonic storm may not be as strong as Tauktae, and the system will be moving northwestwards fast, detaching itself from the monsoon flow, which would have enough time to reorganise itself for a timely onset after the cyclone’s passage, IMD officials said. D S Pai, scientist and head of climate research and services, IMD, told TOI, “The low pressure system will help bring monsoon to the Andaman Sea a day earlier than the normal date by May 21. Thereafter, since the system is likely to move fast, it would get detached from the monsoon flow, while the monsoon will linger over Andaman for a while before moving forward.” He said the system is likely to intensify gradually into a cyclonic storm in the next few days and move northwestwards and reach West Bengal–Odisha coasts around May 26 evening. “After the passage of the cyclone, the monsoon current may have sufficient time to reorganise,” Pai said. Cyclone Tauktae had a long ocean travel which helped it strengthen significantly, but the brewing system over Bay of Bengal may not have such a long ocean travel and is likely to move landwards in a short time. “It may thus not become a strong system or cyclone. We are constantly keeping a watch on what the models are indicating to see if the low pressure system would turn into a cyclone or not. As of now, it does not appear the system will affect monsoon onset over Kerala and further,” Pai added. Skymet Weather Services president G P Sharma said, “We feel that the system brewing over Bay of Bengal may not strengthen much. Any system to affect a phenomena like the monsoon has to be strong enough and sustain for days together. Though a cyclone formation over the Bay of Bengal before the onset usually isn’t detrimental (as against a similar system over the Arabian Sea at that time which can corrupt the monsoon current), but it can still negatively impact the monsoon current if the timing is wrong. However, the brewing system over the Bay of Bengal may lose steam by May 27, and monsoon current will have plenty of time to recoup before the onset over Kerala.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/monsoon-unaffected-by-cyclone-in-bay-of-bengal/articleshow/82782004.cms||Neha Madaan
---||India||Covid-19: Goa leads positivity chart with 43%, K’taka second||NEW DELHI: With a positivity rate of 32%, measured over a 14-day period between May 4 and 17, Karnataka has jumped eight spots to become second, after Goa (43%), in the list of states with high infection rates. Karnataka also had the most (5.7 lakh) active Covid-19 cases in the country as on Wednesday, ahead of Maharashtra’s 4.2 lakh and Kerala’s 3.4 lakh. A high positivity rate is indicative that a state is testing only the sickest and needs to do more in tracking and treatment of a larger infected population. As evident in the current wave of Covid-19 cases, even a week’s delay in treatment could substantially increase the fatality rate. TOI’s fortnightly study (for May 4-17) showed that West Bengal, with a positivity rate of 30%, has trumped Delhi (18%) in becoming the third state after Goa and Karnataka in terms of infection rate. Kerala is ranked fourth with 27% positivity rate, up from 24% in the previous fortnight, even though its active cases are falling. Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh have largely been successful in containment efforts with positivity rates declining to around 8% in the last fortnight from a high of almost 15% during April 21-May 4. The better ones with declining positivity rates include Haryana, Delhi, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, UP, Gujarat and Telangana. There are 11 states where the positivity rate is at 20% and above. Countrywide, the all-India positivity rate has declined marginally from 21.4% during April 21-May 4 to 19.5% in the last fortnight. But it continues to be in the danger zone with 2.6 lakh cases being reported every day. Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir and Assam are states and UTs where the pandemic is getting worse with doubling and tripling of positivity rates over the last three fortnights. Maharashtra, which has reported the highest number of 54.3 lakh cases so far, registered a marginal decline in positivity rate at 18% in the last fortnight as against 23% in the previous one. Similar is the case in Delhi where the rate declined from 32% to 18% in the same period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-goa-leads-positivity-chart-with-43-ktaka-second/articleshow/82787289.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||Pune||Centre to send Maharashtra over 37 lakh vaccine doses till June 15||PUNE: The state on Wednesday received its first ‘advance visibility’ of vaccine doses till June 15 with the Centre allocating nearly 30 lakh Covishield and 7.29 lakh Covaxin doses for the period. ‘Advance visibility’ is an early look at how many doses will be available during a specific period for a region. But officials said Maharashtra will need more than this supply to better cover the 3.86 crore people who’re in the 45-plus age group in the state. All central supply is for this beneficiary category as well as healthcare and frontline workers. State immunization officer, Dr DN Patil, said, “As per the allocation, the state can buy an additional 15.96 lakh doses of Covishield directly from Serum and 4.75 lakh Covaxin doses from Bharat Biotech till June-end. This is the limit for the state’s direct purchase from companies in June.” Offering a break-up, Dr Patil said, “The Centre has allocated nearly 15.56 lakh Covishield doses and 2.78 lakh Covaxin doses to Maharashtra for the May 16-31 period for the 45-plus age group, HCWs and FLWs. From June 1-15, the state is likely to get nearly 14.97 lakh Covishield doses and 4.51 lakh doses of Covaxin from the Centre. All the central supply is for the 45-plus age group, health workers and frontline staff. Wednesday was the first time we received an advance estimate like this for a fortnightly period,” said Patil. Dr Archana Patil, director (family welfare) with the directorate of health services, said, “The allocation has been made as per the state’s population data. But if we have to cover the maximum number of beneficiaries during the coming months, we’ll need more doses. Of the 3.86 crore beneficiaries aged 45 and above in Maharashtra, only 32.43% have received their first doses till May 18.” A state official said that the 30.53 lakh Covishield doses set to be sent from the Centre till mid-June (including the Covaxin supplies as well as what is directly purchased from vaccine companies by the state in June) may be insufficient as 68% of the nearly 4 crore population above 45 are yet to get their first shots. The official said, “The central quota allocated for Maharashtra till mid-June is also less than the average of 50 lakh doses per month the state has so far received since the drive began (considering nearly 2 crore vaccinations in Maharashtra undertaken in the last four months).” The state health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said Maharashtra has a much higher daily vaccination target than availability. “We once had more than 5.3 lakh vaccinations in a single day, and we can easily reach 7 lakh to 10 lakh daily if we get sufficient doses,” Dr Vyas said. Meanwhile, the pace of Covid-19 vaccination coverage continued to be across the district on Wednesday. A total of 10,681 beneficiaries were covered across the district. Pune rural administration recorded 3,877 recipients. In PMC limits, vaccine drives covered 935 beneficiaries. And in Pimpri Chinchwad, officials with the PCMC recorded 5,869 vaccinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centre-to-send-state-over-37-lakh-doses-till-june-15/articleshow/82782046.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Coimbatore||Deaths surge by six-fold in 19 days||Coimbatore: The district has recorded more than 199 deaths since May 1, which is more than six times (29 deaths) recorded through April.But scenes in mortuaries and crematoriums suggest that the actual death figures could be at least five times more than what is officially recorded.The spike in death figures has occurred exactly around two weeks after the surge in cases, as epidemiologists predicted. The worrying factor is that some of the victims this month are aged between 20 and 40.On Wednesday, four out of the 17 deaths were people aged below 40 and four out of the 19 deaths recorded on Tuesday were less than 35. Only one of them had comorbidity.On Saturday, out of the 20 deaths, three of them were aged between 29 and 40 years. None of them had any co-morbidities either.Epidemiologists say this an indicator of the increased virulence of the virus, thereby calling for ramping up of vaccination drive and putting in precautionary measures against getting infected.Former director of public health Dr K Kolandasamy said, “We had predicted that deaths will start rising two weeks after cases spike because that is when the severe patients among new cases will lose their lives. We had also predicted that the death rate will be much higher during the second wave because it will penetrate the community and hit the vulnerable like non-vaccinated people with comorbidities or low immunity.” He said that was why they pushed for people to get vaccinated soon.Doctors’ handling Covid-19 patients also attribute the growing number of deaths to non-vaccination.“Most elderly are vaccinated and take precautions knowing they are vulnerable,” a senior ESI doctor on Covid duty said. “We have not lost a single patient who has received both the shots,” he said.“But some under 50 years, who are not vaccinated, often get admitted with a CT score of 0/25, but progress to 21/25 within a week despite us administering all drugs, and die a week later,” he added.“Many youngsters ignore the initial fever and fatigue because it subsides after a day. Then they come a week later with significant lung lesions and breathing difficulty,” Dr A Murali, the Covid-19 nodal officer at PSG Hospitals, said. “There is an increase in the incidence of Covid-19 cases with lung lesions than the first wave.”Doctors say at the current rate of spread, any symptom like fever, cough, sore throat, tiredness, and headache for a day is Covid-19 until proven otherwise. “They have to start monitoring themselves closely with a pulse oximeter and if it falls below 95 after a three-minute brisk walk, take immediate medical action. Most of the deaths among youngsters are due to late hospital presentation,” Dr Murali said.Meanwhile, the district recorded 3,250 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday taking the total number of cases to 1,25,151. Though 2,012 people got discharged, the number of active cases continued to grow to 27,189. The district recorded 17 deaths due to the virus taking the toll to 922. With the number of people discharged growing to 97,040, the recovery rate dropped to 77.5%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/deaths-surge-by-six-fold-in-19-days/articleshow/82782051.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Now, private hospitals to enrol online for Covid services||LUCKNOW: Private hospitals in the city willing to provide Covid-19 services will be able to apply online on government websites for empanelment from Monday. The new system will replace the manual process which was being followed so far. The move is expected to cut short the process of getting registered as Covid care facility, increase Covid beds and prevent overcharging by private hospitals. The new system has been put in place on the recommendation of Lucknow’s Covid-19 nodal officer Roshan Jacob in view of the warning that the third Covid-19 wave could be more severe than the second, which left the city devastated with Covid-19 patients struggling to get hospital beds and oxygen. While some had to manage on their own at home, many who got beds in private hospitals later complained about being charged several times more than the rates fixed by the government. Some patients died due to lack of enough facilities. As of now, of 691 private hospitals and nursing homes in the city, only 59 are designated as Covid facilities by the authorities. According to district administration officers, when the pandemic surged in April, some families with critical Covid-19 patients opted for non-Covid hospitals out of desperation after failing to get a bed in Covid facilities. Some of these non-Covid private hospitals took advantage of the situation and admitted patients with Covid-19 symptoms for treatment without getting them tested for the disease. These hospitals avoided the test because it would have made it obligatory for them to send patients to a Covid facility. Instead, they continued to treat patients and later charged them excessively. Further, since these private hospitals were not designated Covid facilities, the rates fixed by the government did not apply on them. As a result, officers also couldn’t take any action against these facilities. Besides, there were hospitals which had applied for being empanelled as a Covid-19 facility, but are yet to be approved by the chief medical officer’s office. “Simplification of the registration process will encourage more private hospitals, which have required facilities and are willing to join the battle against Covid-19, to get themselves empanelled. This, in turn, will increase the total bed strength available for Covid care in the city at the time of third wave of Covid-19. Also, when more private players will be around, it will increase competition and hospitals will be compelled to keep the cost of treatment low,” Jacob told TOI. Now, private hospitals can apply online for empanelment at www.dgmhup.gov.in and upload all the required documents. Approval will be given online and a physical verification of facilities will be done later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/now-pvt-hosps-to-enrol-online-for-covid-services/articleshow/82783670.cms||---

The state government has ordered an investigation against him in the alleged Urban Land Ceiling (ULC) scam that he probed when he was Thane police commissioner in 2017. Police sources said the home department has assigned the task to a special investigation team under DCP (Thane crime branch), Laxmikant Patil. A senior official from the home department clarified that it is not an inquiry but an investigation as an FIR has already been registered in 2017 in the case. Singh was unavailable for comment. TOI has learnt the police have already started recording statements of various officials connected with the case. The investigation was initiated after whistle-blower, builder Raju Shah from Mira-Bhayander, last month wrote to the CM, home department and DGP Sanjay Pandey. He alleged that in 2017, Thane police under Param Bir Singh as commissioner had taken money from accused builders while probing the ULC scam. TOI was first to report this in its May 12 edition ‘Fresh trouble for Param Bir Singh, builder makes extortion claims’. Complainant Shah, who has even filed a writ petition, alleged that in 2017 Thane crime branch arrested five builders, including a well-known builder, Shyamsunder Agarwal, for not surrendering excess land to the government under the ULC Act. This is the fifth inquiry against Singh since he was shunted as police chief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-now-param-bir-faces-probe-in-extortion-case/articleshow/82783726.cms||Ahmed Ali

Other crops such as bajra, tomato and green vegetables, too, have been affected. District agriculture officer Dnyaneshwar Bote said, “The panchanamas of the damaged farms are being carried out by the agriculture and revenue officials of respective tehsils. We will need a week to complete the process. Mango plantations in Bhor and Velhe tehsils have been badly hit.”As per a government resolution, farmers will receive a compensation at Rs18,000 per hectare for fruits plantation and Rs13,500 per hectare for green vegetables. “This paltry amount will not even cover 50% of our expenditure. We had planted the crops using mulching cover. The government should assess the situation and release compensation at the earliest,” said Ramdas Karande, a farmer from Kathapur village in Ambegaon.Sandesh Pote, a farmer from Junnar, said, “We have lost a crucial flower season as there was no demand due to closure of temples and lowkey marriage ceremonies.

All sports colleges and hostels are shut since March 2020 due to which the players are neither getting proper diet nor are they able to practice properly. Besides, trainers are also facing difficulties in sustaining their livelihood due to closure of camps. In a letter to the CM, general secretary of Uttar Pradesh Olympic Association Anandeshwar Pandey said, “Players who live in hostels and colleges mostly come from poor families. Due to the financial crisis, they are not getting proper diet which is also affecting their practice.” “The Government of India, Sports Authority of India and the Olympic Association of India have formed a committee to help players during pandemic. “We request the government to form a similar committee in UP in coordination with the Sports Directorate and Uttar Pradesh Olympic Association,” he said. He said the committee would play an important role in providing financial assistance to needy sportspersons. “Expenditure is incurred on sports hostels and colleges and on sportspersons living in camps. If the government transfers the amount spent on diet of players to their account, they will be able to arrange for their diet and practice on their own,” he said. Pandey said the coaches were also unemployed due to the closure of training camps and requested the CM to provide them financial assistance through the State Sports Promotion Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/upoa-seeks-financial-aid-for-players-coaches/articleshow/82783713.cms||---

As of now, these shops are allowed to operate between 7am and 11am from Monday to Friday. “The kharif season is crucial for farmers. They need to buy fertilizers, seeds and other items in large quantity to complete the season’s work. The existing timing may lead to a chaotic situation at shops. This could prove risky in the prevailing pandemic situation. Keeping this in mind, we have extended the timing by three hours,” said Deshmukh. He has directed the district agriculture office to make available fertilizers, seeds, pesticides and other required agriculture items to farmers. “They can utilize e-commerce platform and make available supply in groups at the village level. We have told them to make necessary planning in the district,” Deshmukh added.

---||Pune||Pune: Controls placed on key injection to stop hoarding||PUNE: After remdesivir, the supply of key anti-mucormycosis drugs — such as liposomal amphotericin B — has been brought under the control of the Pune district administration to prevent hoarding and black-marketing. Soon after the move came into effect in the PMR from Wednesday (May 19), 25 private hospitals collectively registered a requirement of 1,200 vials. “We received a collective requirement on Wednesday evening. A hospital treating patients with mucormycosis has to furnish its daily requirement in a prescribed format every day by 5pm,” said Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner (drug), FDA. On Wednesday, shortages continued with no vials of liposomal amphotericin B available with the six stockists of the drug in the Pune district. “Not a single vial was available with any stockist. After the stockists get the vials, we will convey availability to the district civil surgeon, who has to ensure its equitable distribution to treating hospitals as per their requirements,” Pratapwar said. There are nearly 300 patients with mucormycosis currently undergoing treatment in hospitals in the PMR. A patient will need an average of six vials of amphotericin B in liposomal formation every day. This means the daily average requirement of the district is 1,800 vials. And families of patients are getting increasingly desperate. Doctors have also urged the Centre to cap the retail price of the liposomal amphotericin B to stop it going the remdesivir way. Price control of a drug is within the purview of the Centre. Because amphotericin B is now scarce, the injectable is now being sold in the black market here for anywhere between Rs 4,000 and Rs 7,000; actual price is between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,000. One injection vial contains 50mg of the drug — a patient would need 5mg per kilogram of body weight. So the daily cost of amphotericin B for a patient weighing just 40kg can be as high as Rs 28,000 for four vials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/controls-placed-on-key-injection-to-stop-hoarding/articleshow/82782066.cms||Umesh Isalkar

We are ready to cooperate if the government wants to tighten lockdown restrictions by reducing business hours further,” said M Rajendran, president of Coimbatore TK Market Anaithu Motha Vyabarigal Sangam.Footfall of consumers in the market has come down, Rajendran said. “We are encouraging only wholesale business to help retailers, mainly grocery shop owners, to sell vegetables to buyers in their locality. It would reduce the number of people visiting the market.”Traders in Anna Market close shops by 9.30am, half-an-hour before the permitted time. “We have been procuring only 50% of vegetables while the remaining is stocked at the farm. It would be collected two days later. This in turn would help reduce wastage. Some traders feed rotten or overripe vegetables to cattle or sold them to dairy farmers at a low cost,” a trader said.After the lockdown was imposed, traders are doing business on a rotational basis. Of the 370 shops in the market, 120 to 130 shops function a day.Many farmers have reduced area under cultivation, said Subramani, a farmer who sells at the Singanallur farmers’ market. “We manage to sell completely as we have been bringing only reduced quantity to the market. Leftover is taken back to the farm and fed to cattle. We are more worried about our health than the business. Some have stopped visiting the market as it is a high-risk area. Only if we survive the pandemic and stay healthy, would we be able to resume work after the lockdown is lifted,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/vegetable-traders-hit-hard-by-lockdown/articleshow/82782048.cms||Nivedha Selvam

No extra money is required to admit Covid patients to civic-run hospitals. Three of the man’s relatives, including his mother and two brothers, succumbed to the virus during treatment at the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital (YCMH) in Pimpri. The suspect returned Rs95,000 to the teacher on May 13 after the intervention of the sarpanch of Ale village. When he did not return the remaining Rs85,000, the teacher filed an FIR on Monday. The Alephata police have arrested suspect Amol Pawar under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code. “Pawar has been remanded to police custody for four days,” sub-inspector Satish Duale told TOI. Daule told TOI that on April 23, the complainant’s mother and two brothers tested positive for Covid-19. “As three of them did not get oxygen beds in Sinnar, the complainant also tried searching for beds in neighbouring districts. He got Pawar’s cellphone number from a relative,” he said. Pawar had promised three oxygen beds to the teacher in the PCMC-run New Bhosari hospital.

Issuing global tenders is one of the key initiatives for it. We have told the civic administration to float the tenders at the earliest,” said Ganesh Bidkar, leader of the house in PMC. “Even if the global tenders are floated, it will not serve the purpose of having strong competition. The funds to be used for floating the tenders should be utilised for other Covid-related work,” said Aba Bagul, leader of Congress in PMC. Prithviraj Sutar, leader of Shiv Sena, said, “All parties are supporting efforts to vaccinate citizens, but the decision to float global tenders seems to be politically motivated.” Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch said, “The state has announced free-of-cost vaccination. Why is PMC spending public money on these global tenders? The vaccines will be costly and burden its coffers.” Around 8 lakh vaccine doses have so far been administered to the citizens in the PMC limits. The civic body will need around 55 lakh doses more to vaccinate all aged above 18 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bjps-demand-for-vax-global-tenders-faces-opposition/articleshow/82782124.cms||---

The 5.4km-long extension will cost around Rs4,020 crore. The proposal will be sent to the state government and then to the Union government for final approval. The civic body’s contribution for the Metro has increased to 15%. The state and Union governments will share 15% and 10% of the cost, respectively. The standing committee of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Tuesday approved the revised funding pattern. Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee, said, “A meeting was conveyed under the chairmanship of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar last month, where it was decided to increase PMC’s share to 15%. A proposal was tabled by the administration to revise the funding pattern, which was sanctioned by the standing committee.” The MahaMetro has prepared the detailed project report (DPR) of the route. The entire stretch will be underground with three stations — Market Yard, Saibabanagar and Katraj. The project has been considered as an extension of the existing route.Rasne said that as per the earlier funding proposal, the PMC was to contribute Rs 233.75 crore against cost of the land and rehabilitation measures. Howeve,r following a decision to increase the contribution, the PMC’s share has been increased to Rs733.85 crore. The revised proposal will be put before the general body for approval, he said. As per the revised proposal, the state government’s share is pegged at Rs585.23 crore and Union government’s share at Rs323.49 crore. Around 60% funding is proposed to be raised via loan. The proposal to extend the Metro up to Katraj was under consideration for long. The DPR got delayed because of various technical reasons and alignment issues. The MahaMetro is already constructing a Metro line from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) to Swargate, of which the Shivajinagar to Swargate stretch is underground. The work on the entire stretch has been started. The Swargate-Katraj section is among the busiest stretches in the city. A senior corporator had said in February, “If the extension is executed as a part of the first phase of the Metro project, it would benefit people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmcs-share-up-to-rs-733cr-for-swargate-katraj-metro-line/articleshow/82782128.cms||---

Identified as a vaccination centre by the government, a dry run of the process took place at the Eidgah on Wednesday. Beneficiaries from all age groups starting 18 years with due online registration will be given the vaccine from 12 pm onwards from Thursday. Walk in vaccination will not be entertained. Officials of Islamic Centre of India housed within the Eidgah complex, will help people with their online registrations. “The capacity at the centre for beneficiaries between 18 and 44 years of age is 150 per day and for those above 44 years of age is 250 a day. Vaccination will, however, depend on registrations made in advance and people can select the Eidgah as their choice of centre on the online CoWin portal,” said spokesperson Maulana Sufiyan Nizami. “Some people will be present to aid those who will not be able to register online themselves,” he added. It was after the Eidgah authorities headed by Imam of the Eidgah Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali expressed their willingness to support the administration in Covid management and care, that the Eidgah was chosen as a vaccination centre. Clerics said that the step will create awareness about vaccination further and lessen the general lack of trust in Muslim population especially the illiterate people in the vaccination process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aishbagh-eidgah-to-turn-into-vaccination-centre-from-today/articleshow/82783723.cms||---

He said the attendants were venturing out without the personal protection equipment kits and spreading the virus.Despite his order, most of the government hospitals, including the ESI Hospital and the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, continued to allow the attendants. TOI had carried pictures of attendants in government hospitals in the edition that was published on Wednesday.In a swift response, the ESI Hospital removed all the attendants under the supervision of hospital dean Dr Raveendran on Wednesday morning itself. However, within half an hour, trouble broke out. “Many elderly patients on oxygen support who wanted to get the nurses’ attention to report a symptom, use the toilet or to sit up were left helpless, as there wasn’t anyone to attend to them. And they began shouting from the ICU. While the hospital is taking care of patients extremely well, nurses can’t handle all this workload,” said Raviraj Kanth, an attendant of a Covid patient.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/attendants-of-patients-still-find-way-to-covid-wards/articleshow/82782089.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Asha workers demand scooters to beat transport hurdles||PUNE: Sangita Khule (48), an Accredited Social Health Activist (Asha) worker, walks at least 8km daily to deliver medicines to senior citizens and conduct her Covid duty in the remote hilly region of Velhe tehsil of Pune district. She has the responsibility of overlooking three remote villages, which don’t even have cellphone network. Khule, a resident of Pasli village, told TOI, “I have been doing my duty in this manner for the last decade. It becomes extremely difficult during the rainy season. But, if I don’t go there, senior citizens living in remote hamlets would be deprived of basic medicines.” Velhe tehsil usually receives highest rainfall in the district. “With the absence of public and private transportation due toCovid restrictions, a scooter would make my job easy. We can’t afford to buy it as we have financial challenges. But, if we get help from authorities or social organizations, it would be a big respite,” she said. There are around 47 Asha workers that perform their duties like Khule in the district. Rajshree Dharpale, supervisor of Asha workers of Velhe tehsil, said, “We demanded for scooters via a letter that was submitted to the Panchayat Samiti here last year. But, we didn’t get any response.” “Apart from our regular pay, we get only Rs1,000 Covid incentive from the Zilla Parishad (ZP). But, we perform almost all the duties such as conducting door-to-door survey, providing details of Covid positive patients, tracing their close contacts, maintaining records of people who go to the city for work, supplying regular medicines to senior citizens, Covid awareness drives, conducting meetings with gram panchayat, among others. The list is endless. But in return we get paltry pay,” she added. Sharad Butte Patil, opposition leader of the ZP, said the ZP Pune has done very little for the welfare of Asha workers over the years. “They should get transportation allowance in this situation. One needs to understand Covid cases were being reported from the smallest of hamlets.,” Patil asked. He said Asha workers working in Bhor, Velhe, Mulshi, Maval, West Khed, Ambegaon and Junnar tehsils should get special incentives from the ZP. Ayush Prasad, the ZP’s CEO, conceded these workers faced transportation issue and worked in adverse conditions. “We are giving them Covid duty incentive. But, on the transportation issue, we will take a decision after taking the views of elected members and officials,” he added. Ranjit Shivtare, the ZP’s vice-president, said, “The respective gram panchayat is supposed to incur the expense of their transportation or any work related to Covid. We have issued an order also in this regard.” However, a tehsil health officer, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “The ZP can easily get scooters for Asha workers from the CSR funds, as there are several leading auto companies in the district. It can also make budgetary provisions for the same. In the current budget, there was no provision for the Asha workers’ welfare.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/asha-workers-demand-scooters-to-beat-transport-hurdles/articleshow/82782094.cms||Sandip Dighe

The incident occurred in Bajot village near Meerut Bypass on Tuesday night. The killing may have been perpetrated due to an alleged illicit affair. According to police sources, Mohd Mustafa worked in a handloom factory where Sartaj also worked. Mustafa had allegedly developed illicit relations with a cousin of Sartaj because of which there arose a tiff between the two. Both were residents of Bajot village. After the tiff, Mustafa along with his family moved out of the village and started living in Lisari Gate. He gave his house in Bajot village on rent. On Tuesday night, he had come to collect the rent when he was overpowered by Sartaj and his friends. He was first brutally thrashed. Somehow he got out, momentarily, and managed to send the SOS to his wife. The wife then started from her home accompanied by other members of the family. But, by the time they reached the village, Mustafa was lying in a pool of blood. "I received a call on my phone from my husband. He was frightened and shivering. He had hid himself from his killers for a while, but they found him," the wife said. Soon, scores of people assembled in the area and tried to nab the killers. The accused managed to flee. Later, when police arrived, the villagers did not allow the body to be taken away for more than half an hour. It was only after some assurance the body was sent for postmortem. Saharanpur SSP Ajay Sahani said, "Several teams have been formed to nab the culprits. We have some leads as well."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-shot-dead-moments-after-sending-sos-to-wife/articleshow/82772251.cms||Sandeep Rai

His arrest comes just four days after he walked out of the Yerawada jail on regular bail in a theft case. “We have arrested Abhishekh Sharad Pawar (32) of Guruwar Peth after a hot chase through the areas of Camp, Kondhwa and Race Course. We will arrest his aide soon.” inspector Ashok Kadam of the Cantonment police told TOI. The stolen hatchback belonged to Jayant Solunke (48), an officer with a realty firm, who had taken the car to his office. He had asked two men to clean the vehicle around 11.45am. “At this moment, Pawar and his aide arrived at the spot and snatched the car keys from cleaners. Pawar got into the driver’s seat, and his aide sat next to him as they drove away within a matter of seconds. Solunke attempted in vain to chase them on foot. He then reached the Centre Street police chowkey to alert the police,” Kadam said. Constables Sangram Warpe and Vaibhav Hilal, who attended Solunke at the chowky, asked him to accompany them on their motorcycles in search of a stolen vehicle. Kadam said, “After they spotted the vehicle, they kept chasing it from Solapur Bazaar to Lullanagar and Kondhwa. Near Solapur Bazaar, the constables asked Solunke to get off and pursued their chase and attempted to overtake the car. At this point, Pawar sensed trouble and began driving in a rash manner.” “At Kondhwa, the car took a ‘U’ turn and came back to Lullanagar and turned left. Meanwhile, the two constables had alerted the Wanowrie police and traffic policemen ahead about the incident. The police intercepted the car at Bhairoba Nala chowk near Race Course by barricading the road,” Kadam added. Kadam said Pawar tried to knock down the barrier but was overpowered by the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/out-on-bail-criminal-robs-car-held-after-hr-long-chase/articleshow/82782145.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: 14 patients of black fungus admitted to King George’s Medical University in 24 hours||LUCKNOW: With the admission of 14 more patients at the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) in the past 24 hours, the number of patients with black fungus infection, or mucormycosis disease, touched 50 on Wednesday. “The common factor in all these patients is uncontrolled diabetes and high use of steroids during treatment of severe infection caused by Covid-19,” said head of KGMU’s medicine department Prof Virendra Atam. Of 50 mucormycosis patients, 27 caught black fungus infection after recovering from Covid-19. However, 23 are still battling with the Covid-19, which means they have two sets of infections, novel coronavirus and black fungus. According to experts, this has established the fact that mucormycosis can start appearing even during Covid-19. Previously, most mucormycosis cases were reported in patients who had recovered from Covid-19. The spike in mucormycosis cases has left doctors concerned. Though a rare disease, its fatality rate is 50%. It affects mainly those who have low immunity. So far, four patients have died in KGMU. Six patients have also undergone surgery. Overall, 60 black fungus patients are under treatment in various hospitals of the city. “As diabetes lowers immunity level, chances of a diabetic person acquiring severe lung infection after contracting Covid-19 are high. Serious lung infection caused by Covid-19 is often treated with steroid, which further lowers the immunity. If these steroids are used for a longer period or given in excessive quantities to a diabetic Covid-19 patient, possibilities of her/him acquiring black fungus infection increases,” said Prof Atam. KGMU vice-chancellor Lt Gen (retd) Dr Bipin Puri said, “The black fungus problem is getting bigger by the day, but prevention, identification of high risk population, early diagnosis and treatment are the key for optimal outcomes.” “With the graph of the pandemic on a downward slope, it is likely that the number of black fungus cases will also drop in another 2-3 weeks.Till then, we will need to fight this war and take multidisciplinary approach with ENT, eye and neurosurgery for best results as the disease rapidly spreads from the nose, paranasal sinuses, orbit and then to the brain,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/14-patients-of-black-fungus-admitted-to-kgmu-in-24-hrs/articleshow/82783730.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Nepalese workers in U’khand struggle to get vaccinated; HC takes cognisance, issues notices to Centre and state||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday took suo motu cognisance of the fact that Nepalese workers, who are employed in various areas of Uttarakhand, are facing difficulties in getting vaccinated as they do not have Indian identity proofs. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma also appointed an advocate as amicus curiae in the case and gave both the Centre and state three weeks’ time to respond. After Medha Pande, a Nainital-based law student highlighted the issue in a letter to the Chief Justice, the court decided to hear it as a Public Interest Litigation (PIL). In her letter, a copy of which is available with TOI, Pande wrote, “It is also not clear whether Covid-19 vaccine is available for them or not. To my knowledge, vaccination facility is not available for them because the vaccine is being given to only Indian citizens who register themselves via a valid identity card (Aadhaar card in most cases). Therefore, even if these people are not explicitly excluded from the vaccination drive, lack of any valid identity card effectively disables them to get vaccine.” Pande added in her letter that local residents in hill districts like Nainital, Pauri, Pithoragarh and Rudraprayag are heavily dependent on Nepalese workers to provide last-mile delivery of essential items like dairy, food grains and even carry luggage. These workers also work in agricultural fields and orchards. “Being associated with a gamut of activities, they come in direct contact with a very large section of our population. If not vaccinated, Nepali labourers can become super-spreaders of Covid-19 among the Indian population,” Pande said. The letter further said that the step is in line not only with the provisions of the Constitution but even several judgments of the Supreme Court, the Treaty of Peace and Friendship signed between India and Nepal in 1950 and The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nepalese-workers-in-ukhand-struggle-to-get-vaccinated-hc-takes-cognisance-issues-notices-to-centre-and-state/articleshow/82777901.cms||Prashant Jha

Mucormycosis treatment is hugely expensive and can last weeks or even months. The cost of injections (liposomal amphotericin B) alone can be as high as Rs 25,000 to Rs 60,000 per day. Doctors have reported instances of families mortgaging belongings to pay for patient care. The government has put together various treatment components — medical as well as surgical — under the state-sponsored health scheme, Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MPJAY). It has also created a corpus of Rs 30 crore if treatment costs for certain patients at an advanced stage of the disease run into lakhs, crossing the limits fixed under the health cover. Nearly 80 big multispecialty hospitals (private and government-run), including 56 medical colleges in the state, are set to be designated as mucormycosis care hubs under the scheme. The state currently has at least 2,000 patients with mucormycosis. Sudhakar Shinde, CEO of MPJAY, said, “The scheme will offer free treatment to each and every patient of mucormycosis in Maharashtra at empanelled public and private multispecialty hospitals and attached medical colleges. There are no riders; every patient who holds a ration card can avail of this benefit.” The state Covid task force has been roped in to pick medical facilities that can be designated as mucormycosis care hubs. “A list of 75 to 80 big private and public hospitals, mainly medical colleges, is in the process of being finalized,” Shinde said. The treatment includes medical management, repeated clearance (debridement) of affected sinus tissues, ICU stay and radical surgeries. The scheme, however, is meant only for patients in whom the diagnosis of mucormycosis has been confirmed. It does not include suspect cases. "Unlike treatment, diagnosis of mucormycosis is not an expensive affair," Shinde added. The scheme also covers expensive anti-fungal medications, including liposomal amphotericin B jabs. Procurement of this drug, however, has been a challenge because of short supply nationwide. "The state government has floated a global tender to procure liposomal amphotericin B injections from other countries as the two major Indian manufacturers of the injection have very limited production capacity. We intend to provide the injections to the designated hospitals for free, where patients are availing treatment under the scheme," Shinde said. T P Lahane, director of the Department of Medical Education and Research (DMER), the state's apex body overseeing hospitals attached to state-run medical colleges, said, "The state government has also created a social responsibility corpus of Rs 30 crore for mucormycosis patients who need prolonged hospital care, including advanced treatment and surgeries." There are 56 medical colleges attached to hospitals in Maharashtra, including 19 state-run facilities. "Since these are teaching institutions, they have multispecialty experts available. The treatment of mucormycosis involves a multidisciplinary approach," Lahane said. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA's Hospital Board of India, Pune branch, said, "The free treatment scheme will certainly help many. Currently, many patients' relatives are mortgaging belongings or borrowing money to cover treatment expenses, which can run into lakhs."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-offers-total-medical-cover-for-mucormycosis/articleshow/82782156.cms||Umesh Isalkar

A case under various sections, including that of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 was registered at Bhopa police station. And a joint probe was also launched by the forest department and police to unearth the entire racket. According to police, Arvind and Govind, residents of Yogender Nagar in Bhopa area, were arrested when they were going to Delhi to sell the creatures. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Abhishek Yadav said, “This is the first time that we have been able to nab these culprits red-handed. However, we were getting reports of such activities taking place in the region. We had constituted a patrolling team and also installed a police picket near the wetland.” Haiderpur Wetland situated on Bijnor-Muzaffarnagar border hosts thousands of migratory birds every winter and of late conservation efforts have also led to the introduction of turtles in the region by UP forest division and WWF India. According to police sources, during police investigation it has been revealed that the pythons and turtles are used to make illegal medicine. They are also used for ‘tantrik’ activities. Station house officer (SHO) of the Bhopa, Deepak Chaturvedi said, “During interrogation, the accused have revealed that they used to sell a python between Rs 25,000 to Rs 2lakh depending on its size. We are tracking their links.” Forest officer of Bhopa area, S Pundir said, “Investigation is being conducted. We are also trying to find that where these creatures are being supplied.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/2-animal-traffickers-arrested-with-3-pythons-37-turtles/articleshow/82772268.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Terming Israel as a “terrorist” state, the seminary questioned the “silence” of the international organizations, including the United Nations (UN). The officiating vice-chancellor (VC) of the seminary, Maulana Abdul Khaliq Madrasi, said, “The killing of innocent citizens and children in Palestine is barbaric. We condemn the attack in the strongest words. And we are pained to see the silence of international organizations like the UN on the issue at a time when several nations are condemning Israel for what it is doing. We appeal to all Muslim countries to take strong action against the country. Those who are silent are equally responsible. We urge the UN to declare Israel as a terrorist state.” Spokesperson of Darul Uloom, Ashraf Usmani, told TOI, “The seminary has also sent a letter to the UN and also to our government urging them to declare Israel as a terrorist country.” A press note issued by the seminary said, “The brutal violence that Israel has unleashed against innocent Palestinians worshipping in Al Aqsa mosque is terrorism. The silence of the United Nations against the Israeli brutalities upon the Palestinians, the killing of innocent children and the desecration of the mosque is sheer injustice and unacceptable. Darul Uloom, Deoband strongly condemns it. It is an established fact that Israel’s aggression is increasing. Its army is bombarding residential buildings and refugee camps and as a result, innocent Palestinians are being killed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/islamic-seminary-darul-uloom-condemns-israel-for-attacking-palestinians/articleshow/82772259.cms||Mohd Dilshad

---||India||75,000 deaths in May so far; 2nd wave shifts to east India||The first 19 days of this month have already recorded 75,000 reported Covid deaths which are by far the highest for any month. The previous record was held by April 2021 which saw about 49,000 deaths. Apart from these two months, the death toll was less than 6,000 for each of the first three months of this year. During the peak of the first wave, September was the deadliest month that saw over 33,000 reported covid deaths. The day also saw a marginal increase in cases which remained low in the first two days of the week. Because of lower testing over the weekend, the first two days typically report the lowest cases in every week. The days’s case count of 2,76,476 fresh infections was higher than the first two days of the week but Wednesday was the fourth consecutive day when cases didn’t breach the 3-lakh benchmark. With the day’s count of 3,882, deaths too remained below 4,000 for the third consecutive day. With 34,875 cases, TN’s tally was the highest for Wednesday and it was followed by Karnataka, Maharashtra and Kerala — each of them reporting over 30,000 cases in the past 24 hours. As many as 14 states reported over a hundred deaths in the past 24 hours. The list was topped by Maharashtra with 594 deaths followed by Karnataka with 468 Covid-related fatalities. The analysis of cases on May 19 as compared to May 1 shows that the wave has now shifted eastwards as most of the eastern states are witnessing an increase in cases while there is a decline in the country’s west. In the south, there is an increase in cases on the east coast as TN and Andhra saw a rise in cases while fresh infections dipped in Kerala, Karnataka and Telangana. Similarly, cases on May 19 increased in Assam, Bengal, Tripura and Odisha as compared to cases reported on May 1 from these states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/75000-deaths-in-may-so-far-2nd-wave-shifts-to-east-india/articleshow/82787326.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Hazaribag hosp inflated numbers of missing oxygen cylinders: Police||Hazaribag: Police on Wednesday accused the authorities of the Hazaribag Medical College and Hospital (HMCH) of exaggerating the figures of missing oxygen cylinders and regulators. The hospital in its complaint had said that 186 oxygen cylinders and 64 oxygen regulators were missing from its premises. Hazaribag SP Karthik S said that the deputy superintendent of the hospital, Dr A K Singh, who had filed an FIR in connection to the incident, was not able to provide them with proper data pertaining to the missing medical equipment. He said, “There is utter negligence on the part of the HMCH and the hospital administration is currently confused over the actual number of missing cylinders. The figures quoted by them in the FIR are incorrect as per our probe so far. The deputy superintendent has inflated the numbers.” Notably, Dr Singh filed an FIR on May 16, after which one ward boy was arrested. A few more personnel are also under detention. “It will take some time to crack the case of missing cylinders,” he said, adding that six oxygen cylinders seized by them in the past have been handed over to the hospital management to meet the oxygen crisis following a recent order of the Jharkhand high court. A senior official said requesting anonymity that the chaos in the hospital was due to the recent transfer of the previous superintendent of HMCH, Dr Sanjay Kumar Sinha, and some other members who were handling the Covid-19 situation for more than a year. He said, “It was thus a blunder on the part of the state government to arbitrarily transfer Dr Sanjay on the recommendation of the deputy commissioner Aditya Kumar Anand.” The district police have also formed an SIT under the aegis of SDPO Mahesh Prajapati to investigate the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hazaribag-hosp-inflated-numbers-of-missing-oxygen-cylinders-police/articleshow/82779401.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||With 1,000 doses left, Dhanbad shuts several vax centres||SINDRI: Dhanbad, the coal capital of the country, is facing acute shortage of vaccines for inoculating people of any age group. The gravity of the situation can be judged from the fact that the district ran just three vaccination centres for people above 18 on Wednesday and will reduce it to two on Thursday owing to lack of vaccine doses. On Tuesday, just 1,116 persons between 18 and 45 were vaccinated at 11 centres. The district so far has vaccinated 17,916 persons above the age of 18 in the last five days. District reproductive and child health officer (DRCHO) Dr Vikash Rana said there is acute shortage of vaccines in the district as there are just 560 doses of Covaxin and 670 doses of Covishield available in the district as on Wednesday. “We are likely to get 2,500 doses of Covishield by late Wednesday evening with which we have to run the centres on Thursday.” Dhanbad registered 4,423 vaccinations on the first day of inoculation for those between 18 and 45 but it declined to 4,006 on the second day. Although vaccination registration sites kept showing the slots full, the number of persons coming down to the centres kept dwindling by the day. The scenario is same for the age group above 45. On Tuesday, only 398 persons turned up for vaccines both for the first and second dose. On Monday, it was 503, but on Sunday last, it was just 298. As a result, the number of vaccination centres came down from 127on April 11 to 25 on May 11 and 21 on Wednesday. Rana admitted there was some confusion about vaccination in rural areas and they are trying their best to convince people to get vaccinated. He however claimed, “Dhanbad ranks third in vaccinating people above the age of 18 and below 45 in the state and the district has the potential to top the state chart if provided with adequate number of doses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/with-1k-doses-left-dhanbad-shuts-several-vax-centres/articleshow/82779634.cms||Anil Ashutosh

NCPCR raised concerns after complains about 10 private schools in Bokaro which hiked fees by 15-20 % this session. Sending a letter to secretary (education) department of school education & literacy, NCPCR asked the department to look into the matter and take proper action against such schools. Increasing school fees is against the advisory issued by NCPCR to private schools during the Covid-19 lockdown on April 04, 2020. NCPCR, under Section 13 (1) (0) of the CPCR Act, 2005, can inquire into complaints and take suo-moto cognizance in relation to deprivation and violation of child rights. The letter comes after a resident, Mahendra Ray, in his complaint mentioned the names of the prominent schools of the town. Although the district education department is yet to receive any instruction, district education officer Neelam Eleen Toppo said they were are looking into the matter. Meanwhile, Bokaro MLA Biranchi Narayan also sent a letter to deputy commissioner Rajesh Singh to complain about private schools increasing the tuition fees and changing course materials to force parents to purchase new text books. “I have requested the DC to constitute a district and school-level fee regulatory committee to stop arbitrary fee hikes by the schools,” Narayan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ncpcr-asks-govt-to-take-action-against-10-pvt-schools-for-fee-hike/articleshow/82779509.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Hemant Soren photo replaces Modi’s on vaccine certificates issued in Jharkhand||RANCHI: The state government on Wednesday rolled out a vaccination card, especially for those in the above 18 age group, which has a photograph of chief minister Hemant Soren. The move comes in the backdrop of a recent bickering between the Centre and some states like Maharashtra, for instance, over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s photograph being displayed on the Covid-19 vaccination certificate that is being issued by the CoWin app. The mahagathbandhan government of JMM-Congress-RJD is of the view that since it is providing free vaccines from the state’s coffers, it is befitting for the card to have the CM’s photo. “Since the state government is vaccinating people by using funds from the state budget, it is logical to put the CM’s photo on the vaccine card. Why should certificates for the 18-44 age group carry Modi’s photo? In that case, the Centre should take responsibility for the huge number of causalities across the country due to its mismanagement of the pandemic and put the PM’s photo on the death certificates of Covid-19 victims,” Rajesh Thakur, the co-working president of the state Congress unit, said. A senior official of Ranchi administration told TOI that during the state-wide launch of the third phase of vaccination at Ranchi’s ATI on May 14, the CM had asked the officials concerned to give out the vaccination cards to the beneficiaries so that they don’t face any hassle while taking the second dose. “Even though the CoWin app issues a certificate following inoculation, the beneficiaries first need to register themselves on the app in order to get the certificate and the CM feels that many people may not be tech-savvy. Hence, the vaccination cards,” he added. On Wednesday, the Ranchi administration began issuing the cards across 12 centres and other districts will follow suit. Besides Soren’s photograph on the right side, the vaccination card bears the state’s emblem on the centre and a pictorial depiction on the importance of taking both the doses on the right. Deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan said, “The card also bears full details of the beneficiary, place of vaccination and date of the second dose, among other things. This is just for the convenience of those taking the second dose.” According to the health department’s data issued, as of Tuesday night, around 1 lakh people, out of about 1.57 crore people in the age group of 18-44, have received their first dose. As many as 30,61,831 have taken their first dose and 6,75,553 have taken both the doses till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-photo-replaces-modis-on-vaccine-certificates-issued-in-state/articleshow/82780622.cms||ASRP Mukesh

With the pandemic now gripping the hinterland, the rural economy, yet to recover from last year's nationwide lockdown, does not have support from the state government, which has failed to facilitate proper markets for the farmers. Many are staring at stare at an uncertain future at a time when the unemployment rate in the country has doubled during in the last three months, according to the weekly figures released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) recently. As per CMIE’s latest figures, the unemployment rate in the week ending May 16 was 14.45% of the total workforce, double the 6.63% recorded on March 14. Among farmers, growers of watermelon are the worst hit as tonnes of their produce are lying unsold. Estimates suggest that 680 metric tonnes of watermelons are unsold in Khunti and Gumla districts alone. Rajesh Oraon, a farmer in Khunti’s Torpa block, said, “I sold my buffalos to plant watermelon on 20 acres of land. While the yield was encouraging, there is no market for it at all. I am not even finding buyers even though I am offering the produce at throwaway prices. I don’t know how to cope with the losses.” Like him, many farmers who cultivated tomatoes and other seasonal vegetables are battling poor returns. Ironically, e-NAM, a centralized open market platform launched by the Union government a few years back, is also failing to get buyers. Abhishek Anand, secretary of the agriculture produce market committee (APMC) under the state agriculture department, conceded the problems. “Last year, we managed to sell tonnes of fruit and vegetables of our local farmers through this portal. This time, the situation is different. There are hardly any buyers and traders are not keen to invest,” he said. Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha, a conglomeration of different rights body, has asked the state government for immediate intervention by urgently fixing MSPs of all crops. In a statement, it said, “The Jharkhand government should ensure no restrictions are placed during the lockdown for transport and sale of crops. Central and state governments should compensate farmers for their losses during the pandemic. Loans taken by farmers from local moneylenders, SHGs and banks should be waived off by the government and, most importantly, government must fix MSP for all crops.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/lockdown-hits-earnings-of-veggie-farmers-in-jkhand/articleshow/82780657.cms||ASRP Mukesh

A letter in this regard was issued by the additional chief secretary (health), Arun Kumar Singh, to all the 24 deputy commissioners, directing them to start preparations for the survey and the testing drive. As per the letter, two teams will be constituted for the drive – the survey team will identify the suspected cases of Covid-19 based on their symptoms and the other team will conduct tests on them. The letter stated that sahiyas, anganwadi sevikas and multi-purpose workers (MPWs) and community health officers (CHOs) will be roped in for the job. Following the health department directive, the state unit of the National Health Mission (NHM) started a training program for the CHOs, MPWs, sahiya and anganwadi sevikas on Wednesday. Senior NHM officials said that they are organizing a two-day online training program for the members of the survey and testing teams. NHM’s MD Ravishankar Shukla said, “We have already completed the first schedule of the training programme, as part of which 12 districts were covered. The second phase will begin on Thursday where the rest of the districts will be covered. Once the training period is over, all the block health officers will organise training sessions in their respective blocks between May 21 and 23 to familiarize the survey and testing teams with the process of sample collection and testing.” Meanwhile, Singh’s letter also stated once a person has been screened, if he/she shows any symptoms of severe acute respiratory infection and influenza-like illness, he/she will be tested through antigen kits. If a symptomatic person tests negative through antigen kit, the testing team will collect his/her samples and send it to the nearest lab for a TrueNat or RT-PCR test. During the survey, the teams have also been directed to create awareness regarding Covid-appropriate behaviour, home isolation protocols and vaccination. The community health officers and ANMs have been directed to do tele-monitoring of those under home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/survey-mass-testing-across-4k-panchayats-from-may-25/articleshow/82780778.cms||Gaurav Pandey

On Tuesday the first batch of six oxygen concentrators reached Ranchi headquarters of Indian Medical Association (IMA) from where they would be dispatched-two each to Giridih and Anjuman Islamia hospital in Ranchi while one each concentrator would be provided to Bagodar and IMA’s Covid-19 ward. The oxygen concentrators of seven liter each, have been purchased by his contacts placed internationally. Jharkhand Foundation, a non-profit organization coordinated with prof Roy to select needy people particularly in the rural Jharkhand. Director of the foundation Vishnu Rajgariah told TOI that professor Roy was born in Ranchi and completed his education from St Johns schools and St Xaviers college before moving to IIT Mumbai. “Though he is based in Mumbai but he has always remained connected to rural India, particularly Jharkhand where he voluntarily visits government schools in villages to train teachers on interactive methods of pedagogy,” he said. Explaining about the efforts to extend helping hand to the poor and needy people in state Rajgariah said that Reeza Garewal from Amsterdam, who is a friend of prof Roy and Mohd Abdul Qadir from Houston, US, his student have donated four and two Concentrators, respectively. According to Roy purchasing OCs was a big challenge as most of the manufacturers have escalated the cost owing to the rising demand. “We were being quoted somewhere between Rs.55,000 to 70,000 for five litre Concentrators but by some divine intervention we got the concentrators for Rs.43,500 so instead of planned four units we purchased six units and were able to dispatch them to Jharkhand within time,” he said. Roy and Jharkhand foundation is also coordinating with Garewal who has founded Sikhs United and collecting funds to extend maximum help to the people in India. Rajgariah said that to offer or seek help, people may approach http://SikhsUnited.nl directly. The group that has already received offers for help from US, Canada and European countries have plans to extend help to rural people in India struggling with Covid and its after-effects. With the intervention of Professor Roy, Jharkhand was chosen as the first state to extend help. Till date Roy and his acquaintances have collected Rs.4.5 lakh and provided oxygen cylinders and masks to people in Koderma, Giridih and Daltonganj apart from Ranchi. “Women tailors have been identified to stitch triple layer masks at Rs.6 each and there are plans to distribute 50,000 masks in total to the labourers and rickshaw pullers in Jharkhand,” Rajgariah said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ex-prof-dials-friends-overseas-to-arrange-for-oxygen-in-covid-hit-villages/articleshow/82779714.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Surat||Forgery of HC order: Man denied bail||Surat: A man living in Nanpura area had sent a forged high court order to the Surat Parsi Panchayat last month to allow the final rites of even the community members who succumb to Covid at the Tower of Silence. Mahiyar Patel, who works at a motor driving training school, was arrested and sent to judicial custody. He filed a bail application which was denied by a sessions court here on Monday. In his bail plea, Patel stated that was arrested on suspicion and he has not taken any advantage of the forged order. According to the case details, the Parsi panchayat had passed a resolution to cremate Covid victims according to Hindu rituals. This had hurt Patel’s religious sentiments as his father Ratansha Patel too had succumbed to Covid and his final rites were performed according to Hindu rituals. “Parsis consider fire to be holy, but the accused believed that if dead bodies are burnt, the fire becomes unholy and because of the community’s resolution his sentiments were hurt and he forged the high court order,” said additional public prosecutor Kishore Revaliya. Since Patel had forged signature and seal of justice A J Desai, the chief executive officer of the panchayar had filed an offence against him at Cyber Crime police station. “The accused also argued that it is a bailable offence, but the nature of the offence is quite serious as he forged the signature and seal of a high court judge,” Revaliya said. The court of additional sessions judge P S Kala upheld the argument while turning down the plea and stated that the alleged offence is serious in nature affecting the administration of justice at large.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/forgery-of-hc-order-man-denied-bail/articleshow/82777492.cms||---

He said there is a strong possibility that Covid is playing havoc with neuro-transmitter serotonin, by inducing some changes in it. “Apart from online research papers, we are also observing trends in patients, which strongly suggest there is some imbalance in serotonin, which comes with changes in sleep pattern, memory loss, appetite loss, restlessness and so on,” he said.“There is a distinct correlation between Covid and anxiety. The anxiety starts surfacing about eight to 10 days later in Covid recovered patients,” said Dr Rathi, adding he is treating patients with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, relaxation exercises, and counselling. “Mucormycosis and other fears regarding complications related to Covid could be the reasons,” said Dr Rathi, adding such symptoms need both pharmacological and non-pharmacological help.Dr Kamal Bhutada, president of Nagpur chapter of Indian Society for Critical Care Medicine, and director of ICU, Care Hospital, said PTSD after recovering from Covid could be a reason for increased cases of anxiety and depression. “The most common trigger of anxiety is the fear factor, whether they would be affected by Covid again. The trauma of the first infection seems to be so great that they associate recovery with a ‘new birth’,” said Dr Bhutada, adding he is advising counselling, mild anti-depressants and referring to good psychologists, psychiatrists and also physicians.Dr Mohan Nerkar, a director of Seven Star Hospital, said patients are reporting some phobia in the post-Covid stage. “Corona may have done the damage, but the main fear later is mucormycosis,” said Dr Nerkar, adding that Covid recovered patients are correlating any uncomfortable feeling with mucormycosis. “We assure them they are healthy after proper check-up, and they feel a bit relaxed. Also, we put them on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs, and later advise a nasal endoscopy by an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist,” he said.Renowned cardiologist Dr Prashant Jagtap of Viveka Multispecialty Hospital said it has become routine now to treat Covid recovered patients for anxiety-related complaints. “The Covid recovered patients often come to hospital with high pulse rate, over 100 per minute. They also share complaints of headache and sleeplessness and such issues. Their main concern is the health of their heart,” said Dr Jagtap.“The main reason of their anxiety is apprehension of developing clot in the heart. This is true for even young patients. We do ECG and Echo to assure them they are alright, and help them relax,” said Dr Jagtap. Dr Jay Deshmukh of Sunflower Hospital said mucormycosis is one of the reasons of anxiety though the incidence of the disease is low. “The fears include whether they have lung fibrosis or may get a heart attack,” said Dr Deshmukh. “Chronic illness brings many anxieties and depression,” he said, adding counselling at the time of discharge is crucial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/post-covid-anxiety-needs-medicines-as-well-as-counselling-experts/articleshow/82782545.cms||Soumitra Bose

Last financial year, the Nagpur branch of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) set a national record by getting Rs 750 crore of fresh premium. In normal years, it was not more than Rs 500 crore. Figures for the current fiscal’s first quarter will be only available after June, but sources said the trend has continued. Insurance consultants said the trend has only got stronger in the second wave due to its severity. The sum assured opted by some of the rich is running into tens of crores. Even as there is a primary demand for term insurance which gets plain death cover of a higher amount, for less premium, there is a demand for other plans too, sources said. There is a similar trend in the health insurance business where covers are running into crores. At the same time, there has been a massive rise in clients going for top-up on existing loans or getting loans against property (LAP), sources said. Leading insurance agent Bharat Parekh said the scenario has increased awareness among the general public.  “For example, there was a family in Itwari of which a 54-year-old member passed away due to Covid. Soon, his two brothers and son got insured. The amount was up to Rs 10 lakh, but despite their limited income, the family member took an insurance cover due to the experience,” he said. There are a number of such examples. Those who can afford are increasing their cover by multiple times. Parekh said as against term insurance which only provides death cover, his clients are going for regular endowment policies only. This will ensure a return or pension if nothing happens over the years. Sources said there has been an increasing trend in the general insurance policies too. “Lately, a number of persons have come for mediclaim. Earlier, the average amount of a medical insurance used to be up to Rs 10 lakh. Now, clients are extending it to Rs20-25 lakh,” said G V Iyer from Om Apex Consultants. Sources said the elite are also going for an international health cover. In pre-Covid times, a city businessman got an insurance claim of Rs3 crore after undergoing treatment of an illness in the US. Encouraged by this, a number of others who can afford are also buying international covers these days. Even the companies are highlighting this case to push international policies and the case is being projected in the internal meetings. Manoj Rai, who heads Bharat Parekh Home Loan Consultancy, said if insurance growth has gone up by 13% as against the regular average of 6%, the growth in home loan top-ups and loans against property (LAP) has grown by 100% at his end. “There can be various reasons. LAPs are available at 7.5% interest rate. The money can be used to retire earlier or may people want to have enough cash in hand. Covid treatment has led to major outgo for families. There are chances that LAP may be a means of meeting the expenses,” said Rai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-scare-leads-to-rush-for-insurance-cover/articleshow/82782551.cms||Shishir Arya

Kadoli, about 20km from Nagpur, hasn’t been reporting a Covid case for the last 15 days, said a proud woman sarpanch Pranjal Wagh. “We had been reading in newspapers about the Covid havoc in Nagpur. We also heard patients were not being treated properly by the society, beside refusal for beds,” said Wagh. The villagers didn’t wait for the situation to go out of hands. Soon, a committee of 20 villagers was formed which went door-to-door collecting funds in March for the proposed CCC. “We converted a primary school into CCC. Over Rs70,000 were collected and we purchased 20 cots, mattresses, some oxygen cylinders and other basic medical equipment by April,” she said. The facility helped us ensure infected people were not moving around freely and further spreading the disease, said the sarpanch. “Till date, around 50 villagers were admitted here and recovered. One person died of Covid at home during the second wave and the only other death was reported last year,” she said. Kamptee tehsildar Arvind Hinge said Kadoli may have hardly seen a case or two in the last couple of weeks. “Among the 77 villages in the tehsil, only Kadoli came up with the initiative. In other villages, the administration has been enforcing containment measures. In one case, we had to seal an entire village after 70 residents tested positive in two days,” he said. Hinge applauded Wagh for her efforts in ensuring the village remained Covid-free. As cases have declined, the CCC is being used for regular RT-PCR testing of those moving out of the village for work and vaccination. “We ask nearby companies to quarantine villagers working with them on their premises if they test positive,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kadoli-with-5k-popn-defeats-covid-with-self-funded-ccc/articleshow/82782611.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Roads in and around the subway also have patches of mud leaving motorists, especially those heading towards the hospital, in a frenzy to avoid the muck. “In the second wave of the pandemic, there are families bringing their loved ones to the hospital daily. Getting stuck inside the subway will only add to their woes,” a resident of Bambolim said. Sources said there used to be a pump and a generator with one of the shops housed inside the subway. However, this time, even three days after the cyclone left the underground subway waterlogged, there has been no action taken in this regard. While the stagnant water is starting to slowly recede on its own, it’s been three to four days since the cyclone, making the stagnant water a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Most of the ambulances, however, have been able to avoid a face-off with the inundated subway. “Turning the ambulance through the curves of the subway tunnel is a huge risk, especially when there is a patient inside. Also, it is slightly difficult to manoeuvrer the vehicle with the entire equipment. Even smaller ambulances like those inside a Maruti Omni have trouble passing through the subway. To proceed to the hospital, the ambulance drivers usually avoid the subway,” a source said. However, regular motorists that venture inside the tunnel can do little to avoid the impending hurdle. “There is no signboard put up in front of any of the entrances or exits of the tunnel to alert citizens to avoid taking the subway. If lucky, some motorists manage to reverse their vehicle and avoid getting into the water altogether. Others helplessly wade through, especially when there are other vehicles following closely behind them,” a citizen said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/inundated-subway-makes-access-to-gmc-tricky/articleshow/82782874.cms||---

The company, which has an annual installed capacity to produce 14,00,000 metric tonnes of urea and other organic fertilisers, said that it is assessing the damage caused by the cyclone. Zuari Agro manufactures NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) fertilisers and urea-based fertilisers. While the urea and ammonia plants have a manufacturing capacity of 1,140 tonnes per day, the two NPK plants can manufacture 1,200 tonnes per day each. Farmers depend on ZACL’s fertilisers to increase crop productivity and the kharif crop season is just around the corner. Company secretary Vijayamahantesh Khannur said that there “could be a potential delay in restart of ammonia and urea plants” but did not provide details about the extent of the damage and the time required to repair the damage. Khannur said that the ZACL is still in the process of assessing the damage caused by the cyclone and that once the assessment is complete, further details would be provided. “Damage, if any, is covered by insurance and the company is still assessing damages,” the company said in a statement to the bourses. The damage is yet another crisis to hit the company which has been troubled by several lengthy shutdowns over the course of the last year and a half. The company stopped operations of its urea and ammonia plant on July 4, 2019, after a leakage was reported in the ammonia plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tauktae-damages-zuari-agro-plant/articleshow/82782939.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

After a storm over Kejriwal’s remarks warning about a “Singapore variant” that could put kids at risk, Wong said Singapore reserved the right to invoke POFMA (protection from online falsehoods law) with regard to claims that have a negative impact on society. Singapore, India solid partners: CentreDelivering an online rebuke, Jaishankar criticised the “irresponsible comments” after Indian envoy P Kumaran was summoned by the Singapore foreign ministry on Wednesday. “Singapore and India have been solid partners in the fight against Covid-19. Appreciate Singapore's role as logistics hub and oxygen supplier,” Jaishankar said. The minister added that Singapore’s gesture of deploying military aircraft spoke of the exceptional relationship. “However, irresponsible comments from those who should know better can damage long-standing partnerships. So, let me clarify — Delhi CM does not speak for India,” Jaishankar said. His Singaporean counterpart, Vivian Balakrishnan, added, “Politicians should stick to facts.” According to the foreign ministry spokesperson, the Indian high commissioner told the Singapore foreign ministry that the CM “had no competence to pronounce on Covid variants or civil aviation policy”. Kejriwal had asked the government to restrict flights from Singapore, to which civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri said there were no flights between India and Singapore except a couple of Vande Bharat missions. The Singapore statement said, “The MFA is disappointed that a prominent political figure had failed to ascertain the facts before making such claims. MFA met the high commissioner of India P Kumaran this morning to express these concerns.” The Singapore government stressed that “there is no Singapore variant”. “The strain prevalent in many of the Covid-19 cases in recent weeks is the B.1.617.2 variant, which was first detected in India,” it added. Singapore’s Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act is a statute of the parliament of Singapore that enables authorities to tackle the spread of fake news or false information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwals-singapore-variant-remarks-set-off-a-storm/articleshow/82787485.cms||---

DYFI all-India president and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s son-in-law Mohammed Riyas is likely to succeed G Sudhakaran in the crucial public works department besides handling the tourism portfolio. Vijayan on Wednesday briefed the CPM state secretariat about his ministerial picks but neither he nor the ministerial candidates confirmed the details. "There is an issue of propriety in that. Once the list is given to the governor, it’s not proper to reveal the same before the swearing-in ceremony," Vijayan told reporters on Wednesday evening. Party sources said CPM state secretariat member P Rajeeve will be the new industries minister. The chief minister will continue to hold the home and vigilance portfolios while party central committee member M V Govindan will head the local self-government institutions and excise ministries, they said. First-time MLA and former Thrissur mayor R Bindu, wife of CPM acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan, is tipped to become the new higher education minister while V Sivankutty, who wrested the Nemom seat back from BJP is likely to head the general education and labour ministries. Radhakrishan may head devaswomVijayan is learnt to have chosen CPM central committee member and former speaker K Radhakrishan to head devaswom, SC/ST welfare and parliamentary affairs departments. Senior CPM leader V N Vasavan is likely to be the new co-operatives and registration minister while Chengannur MLA Saji Cheriyan will be the new fisheries and cultural affairs minister. Sources said Vijayan has shown a surprising patronage towards junior coalition partners this time, by giving the power portfolio -- which was held by the CPM -- to K Krishnankutty of Janata Dal (S) and water resources to Roshy Augustine of Kerala Congress (M). N Jayaraj of KC (M) will be the new chief whip. Ahammed Devarkovil, a first-time MLA of the INL, has been given ports, archaeology and museums while Antony Raju of Janadhipathya Kerala Congress is tipped to become the transport minister. A K Saseendran of NCP will be in charge of the forest department that was earlier held by the CPI. Businessman-politician V Abdul Rahman is the new minister for minority welfare and Norka, the portfolios held by K T Jaleel in the last government. Ollur MLA and CPI former chief whip K Rajan is tipped to be the new revenue minister and Cherthala MLA P Prasad the new agriculture minister. G R Anil will be the new food and civil supplies minister while Chadayamangalam MLA J Chinchu Rani is tipped to hold dairy and animal husbandry portfolios.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-veena-george-may-succeed-k-k-shailaja-k-n-balagopal-likely-to-get-finance/articleshow/82787474.cms||---

That is not all – the share of eight major cities of Gujarat was 49%, the lowest in 209 days. It means that one in every two positive cases recorded in Gujarat on Wednesday was from outside major cities, which public health experts roughly term as rural Gujarat. On October 22 last year, the eight cities had recorded 46% of daily cases when the daily cases were 1,112. The share of eight cities – Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, and Gandhinagar – is on constant decline in May. On May 1, the share of the cities was 65%, which reduced to 52% on May 10, and further to 49% on May 19. In absolute terms, total number of new positive cases in eight cities (2,588) was lowest in 42 days. “It’s not the time to rejoice just yet – while the overall cases are on a downward slope, the impact of cyclone may have led to comparatively less people stepping out in extreme weather to get tested. Compared to 1.39 lakh daily tests on May 13, the number was 1.14 lakh on May 18. The test positivity rate however has also fallen – from 7.7% on May 13 to 5.6% on May 18. We take May 13 as it was the last day of 10,000-plus daily cases for Gujarat,” said a public health expert. But the statistics also follow the pattern observed across the country during the current wave where the rural areas now command a significant share of the daily cases. For example, compared to Vadodara city's 436 daily positive cases on Wednesday, the district recorded 205 - fourth highest in Gujarat. Out of top 10 municipal corporations and districts with highest cases, five each were municipal corporations and districts. Experts said that given the issues of infrastructure and availability of healthcare professionals, the non-urban areas pose a challenge for the state administration in containing the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/one-in-every-two-covid-cases-now-outside-8-major-gujarat-cities/articleshow/82787518.cms||Parth Shastri

For example, compared to Vadodara city's 436 daily positive cases on Wednesday, the district recorded 205 - fourth highest in Gujarat. Out of top 10 municipal corporations and districts with highest cases, five each were municipal corporations and districts. Experts said that given the issues of infrastructure and availability of healthcare professionals, the non-urban areas pose a challenge for the state administration in containing the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/one-in-every-two-covid-cases-now-outside-8-major-gujarat-cities/articleshow/82787517.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Vadodara||One in every two Covid cases now outside eight major Gujarat cities||AHMEDABAD: Call it the impact of Cyclone Tauktae, or extension of overall fall of Covid-19 cases in Gujarat – but in 24 hours ending 5 pm on Wednesday, Gujarat recorded 5,246 new cases, lowest in 39 days. That is not all – the share of eight major cities of Gujarat was 49%, the lowest in 209 days. It means that one in every two positive cases recorded in Gujarat on Wednesday was from outside major cities, which public health experts roughly term as rural Gujarat. On October 22 last year, the eight cities had recorded 46% of daily cases when the daily cases were 1,112. The share of eight cities – Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, and Gandhinagar – is on constant decline in May. On May 1, the share of the cities was 65%, which reduced to 52% on May 10, and further to 49% on May 19. In absolute terms, total number of new positive cases in eight cities (2,588) was lowest in 42 days. “It’s not the time to rejoice just yet – while the overall cases are on a downward slope, the impact of cyclone may have led to comparatively less people stepping out in extreme weather to get tested. Compared to 1.39 lakh daily tests on May 13, the number was 1.14 lakh on May 18. The test positivity rate however has also fallen – from 7.7% on May 13 to 5.6% on May 18.

As per reports, Modi said, Varanasi did not go into extreme lockdown, but preferred to work on micro-containment zones and this helped contain positivity. Sources said, the PMO has been keeping a tab on Covid management and former bureaucrat and Modi aide, A K Sharma, has been camping in Kashi since April, when second wave struck.

---||India||J&K HC upholds validity of orders of proprietary rights over state land granted before Roshni Act||SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir high court upheld on Tuesday the validity of government orders and schemes on grant of proprietary, or freehold, rights over state land prior to the Roshni Act coming into effect. Disposing of a number of petitions, a division bench of Justices Ali Mohammad Magrey and Vinod Chatterji Koul made it clear that the government cannot deny the grant of proprietary or freehold rights on any "arbitrary, unreasonable and illegal basis". "We are unable to accept the argument advanced on behalf of the respondents (UT officials) that all pending cases of applicants under any pre-existing scheme/government order of the (government) stood automatically rejected upon coming into force of the Roshni Act/Rules," the division bench said. "In any event, since the Roshni Act/Rules having already been declared null and void by a coordinate division bench of this court by its decision dated 9th October, 2020 in PIL No. 19/2011, the respondents (officials) cannot take shelter under the Roshni Act/Rules to advance such an argument," the court said after examining the decision of the coordinate bench which, it said, applies to beneficiaries of rebates, discounts and concessions under specific schemes envisaged by the Roshni Act/Rules. "It does not apply to the 1973 government order or the 1976 government order. It also does not apply to those successful lessees/petitioners in whose favour earlier judgments had been delivered by this court enforcing their rights under any pre-existing scheme/GO that existed before the enactment of the Roshni Act/Rules, more so, if such judgements had attained finality and had even been implemented." "We find that argument completely unacceptable, more so when the subject matter of the controversy before the division bench in PIL No. 19/2011 had nothing to do with any such pre-existing scheme/GO," the court said, and held that such cases cannot be clubbed with the cases of beneficiaries under the Roshni Act and Rules. In conclusion, the court issued slew of directions and, among others, ordered that in cases where the application for grant of proprietary/freehold rights has been made during the subsistence of any scheme or GO prior to Roshni Act/Rules, and such application having duly been recommended by the recommending authorities, the government cannot deny the grant of proprietary/freehold rights to applicants under the scheme or GO on any arbitrary, unreasonable and illegal basis. "In such cases, the applicant cannot be made to suffer because of the delay, default or omission on the part of the respondents (officials)," the division bench said In such cases where the process has further culminated in a decision by the government to grant proprietary/freehold rights to the applicants, but the decision was not implemented by government functionaries on some inexplicable, illegal, arbitrary and legally unsustainable basis (sic), such applicants’ case would be on a much higher footing. "The Roshni Act/Rules or the decision of the division bench of this court, dated 9th October, 2020, in PIL No. 19/2011 do not extinguish or destroy the rights of any (such) applicant if such rights had accrued under any such pre-existing scheme/government order," the HC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-hc-upholds-validity-of-orders-of-proprietary-rights-over-state-land-granted-before-roshni-act/articleshow/82787547.cms||M Saleem Pandit

He also announced that treatment for the ailment, dubbed as the black fungus and found in a section of Covid-19 patients, would be provided free to ration card holders under its health insurance scheme, the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY). Tope said unless the Centre steps in, the state will face a shortage of the injection till May end. "The next 10 days are crucial. We have around 850 mucormycosis patients and had placed orders for 1.9 lakh shots of amphotericin B." ‘State may have 5k black fungus cases in few mths’Tope said, “But we will receive them only by the end of the month. Since the Centre regulates the supply, we have urgently asked these be allocated to the state.” He said he had raised the issue with Union fertiliser minister Mansukh Mandaviya. Currently, the state has allocated 16,000 of the injections to different districts. On free treatment for mucormycosis under MPJAY, Tope said, “There is already an insurance cover worth 1.5 lakh under the scheme, but treatment beyond that, including medicines, will also be met through the MPJAY trust. We will release a list of MPJAY hospitals and other hospitals with medical colleges providing tertiary care since the patients could require ENT, dental and ophthalmic care.” Meanwhile, the State Health Assurance Society (SHAS), which implements MJPJAY, has estimated Maharashtra will have to treat around 5,000 mucormycosis patients over the next few months. With each patient requiring around Rs 80,000 for treatment over and above MPJAY, the state will have to spend around Rs 30 crore to treat them, SHAS has said. Its CEO Sudhakar Shinde had recommended its treatment should take place in tertiary care hospitals since most small hospitals will not be adequately equipped. Tope also said the state had not yet received any response to its global tender for vaccines. “The tender is open till May 25. The companies need some approvals from the Indian government,” he said, adding the state had received 3 lakh doses of Covishield and 2 lakh of Covaxin. “Those getting the second dose will be prioritised,” he said. Tope said Maharashtra’s cases had reduced substantially and growth rate of active cases to 0.5%. “Maharashtra is now in the 34th place in the country when it comes to the growth rate of active cases,” he said, adding all districts in the state now had enough beds available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-facing-shortage-of-mucormycosis-injection/articleshow/82787552.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

On 28-week deployment spanning 26,000 nautical miles, from the Mediterranean to the Philippines Sea, the CSG, led by new aircraft carrier "HMS Queen Elizabeth", will conduct more than 70 engagements with 40 countries, making four big stops in India, Singapore, South Korea and Japan, as part of the UK’s post-Brexit tilt towards the Indo-Pacific region. The carrier will pass India twice and conduct joint exercises with the Indian Navy. On the flight deck she will host the largest group of fifth-generation fighters ever put to sea and the greatest quantity of helicopters assigned to a single UK task group in a decade. Deep below the surface, a Royal Navy submarine will be deployed in support, armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles and a company of Royal Marines commandos. A US Navy destroyer, a frigate from the Netherlands and a squadron of 10 US Marine Corps F-35B jets, will fly alongside. The carrier is more than a warship — it is a floating showcase of diplomacy and trade aspirations of post-Brexit Global Britain that will not only carry out military exercises also conduct a broad range of economic and political engagement with nations, address global security challenges, and strengthen partnerships with like-minded countries to shore up the rules-based order. Defence secretary Ben Wallace speaking on Wednesday at the IISS, a think tank, said: "We are going in a confident manner but not in a confrontational manner. Britain believes in respecting each other’s territorial waters. Prosperity is important for Britain and it is in our interests to have trade deals with many of these countries. No customer wants to only buy from one supplier. China is important to our economy but we want to say to China we want them to uphold rights in Hong Kong and respect human rights of minorities like the Uyghurs. The Indo-Pacific-tilt isn’t just a military tilt, it’s playing to our strengths across the whole horizon — economic, science, culture, security industrial. The UK’s fundamental strengths across the world is our friends and allies and that’s how we are going to force-multiply. The dawn of China on the USA is that USA is coming across a power it unilaterally cannot challenge and it realises it needs alliances." He confirmed the CSG would travel through the South China Sea and East China to visit the UK’s "friend and ally Japan" and will exercise with the US in the Philippines Sea. "The carrier’s departure marks a decisive shift in posture and signals in the future Britain won’t just be more engaged but permanently deployed in this region," Wallace said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-carrier-strike-group-to-set-sail-for-indo-pacific-region-this-weekend/articleshow/82787577.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The left eye of the patient hailing from Tirur in Malappuram had to be removed through surgery at a private hospital in Kozhikode to prevent the rare but serious infection from spreading to the brain. Family members said that he had been a diabetic patient for the last six years and tested positive for Covid on April 22 and had got admitted at the Manjeri Medical College Hospital three days later. He was discharged from the hospital on May 3 but continued to experience headache and later developed problems with his vision following which he went to a private hospital at Kottakkal on May 6. They referred him to the MIMS hospital at Kozhikode following confirmation of the black fungus infection and he was immediately operated. According to family members, his condition is stable and he needs to be kept on anti-fungal medications for the next two weeks. The patient, an expatriate who had returned from Gulf five years ago, is a plumber. Mucormycosis is caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes which live throughout the environment. Mucormycosis mainly affects people who have health problems or take medicines that lower the body’s ability to fight germs and sickness. Steroids used for Covid treatment is said to increases the chances of infection. It most commonly affects the sinuses or the lungs after inhaling fungal spores from the air. It can also occur on the skin after a cut, burn, or other type of skin injury. Mucormycosis can’t spread between people or between people and animals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/black-fungus-infection-in-kerala-tirur-man-loses-eye/articleshow/82787559.cms||---
---||Surat||Gujarat: Four strong-willed youths beat Covid despite severe infection in lungs||SURAT: Just when he was running from pillar to post for his father Mohammed Saddik who suffered a brain stroke last month, Mohammed Akib Kazi, 33, caught Covid-19 infection. Within a few days, Kazi with 90-100% infection in his lungs was fighting his own battle against the virus. But after a 25-day-long struggle, Kazi, an accountant at a trust-run hospital, got discharged earlier this week. Although his father passed away, Kazi slayed Covid-19 thanks to his strong will. “He started having breathing problems on the second day of hospitalisation after which we put him on BiPAP. He was on BiPAP for eight days and on external oxygen for another eight days,” said Dr Piyush Patoliya, who treated Kazi. “Despite severity he recovered. Although the pace was slow, he was mentally quite strong,” said Patoliya. “Doctors and staff kept telling me that if I am able to tolerate ventilator, then I will get cured. So, I kept myself mentally strong and did not give up hope,” said Kazi, who was informed about his father’s demise only after he got discharged. At a time when Covid-19 has created havoc, Kazi is not the only one who despite high severity has defeated the virus. Harshad Kumbhani, 28, who travelled to Surat as he could not find a bed in Rajkot, too defeated Covid-19 even as 70 % of his lungs were infected. “Even as we had put him on ventilator, his oxygen saturation level was 66. But because he was young and did not have any comorbidities, he recovered well,” Patoliya told TOI. Pravin Kavad, 41, was brought to Surat’s New Civil Hospital from Bhavnagar where he could not find a bed even as he had 55% infection in his lungs. He was on BiPAP for 15 days and was also given convalescent plasma therapy. “My oxygen level had dropped. But I was not scared. I reminded myself that I will get cured and return home,” said Kavad, who was discharged after 20 days. Vesu resident Gopal Bhagat underwent treatment at SMIMER Hospital for 24 days. When Bhagat, 47, was admitted his oxygen saturation level was 92. But since 75% of his lungs were infected, he was given external oxygen and with each passing day, his demand for oxygen increased and subsequently he was put on BiPAP. “I got scared when I was on BiPAP, but doctors and hospital staff kept assuring that if I keep my morale high, I will be completely fine,” said Bhagat, who during treatment also suffered from deep vein thrombosis (DVT). After conducting tests, doctors assured Bhagat that DVT will not affect him post discharge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/4-strong-willed-youth-beat-covid-despite-severe-infection-in-lungs/articleshow/82778864.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Kolkata||Mamata may attend PM meet on Covid today||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is likely to attend the virtual meeting on the pandemic situation that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold on Thursday. It is scheduled for 11am. On May 12, the PMO had issued a missive saying the PM would interact with nine district magistrates of West Bengal. The DMs of North and South 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly, East Midnapore, West Burdwan, Nadia, Birbhum and Kolkata were shortlisted for the meting. As Kolkata has no DM, Kolkata Municipal Corporation commissioner Binod Kumar is likely to join the meeting. Modi had wanted to interact with 54 DMs of various states/UTs, including Bengal, Chhattisgarh. Maharashtra, Kerala, Haryana, UP, Rajasthan, Odisha, Jharkhand and Puducherry But as soon as the missive came to Nabanna’s notice, the Bengal government expressed its note of dissent, saying this was against federal structure and bypassed state machinery, an official said. The state’s protest, the official added, made it clear that the PM should communicate with the CM and not directly with DMs. Chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay and health secretary N S Nigam too are likely to attend the meeting as the former heads the state task force on Covid-19. The vaccination issue too is likely to be discussed. A senior official said that though eight Bengal DMs were supposed to join the meeting, it was still not clear whether they would do so or not on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-may-attend-pm-meet-on-covid-today/articleshow/82782249.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Urban development minister Bhattacharya, who is also president of the Bengal Mahila Trinamool Congress, filed an FIR at the Gariahat police station, alleging that Covid norms were violated during the arrest of the senior state ministers. The CBI’s FIR, filed at the Shakespeare Sarani PS, blames “unknown persons” for rioting and unlawful assembly. The Hare Street PS filed a suo motu FIR for the protests in front of the Raj Bhavan. Sources said another complaint was also registered in north Kolkata about the protest by Trinamool supporters on Monday. The cops said they had lodged a complaint based on Bhattacharya’s FIR. The cops said they had lodged the complaint based on Bhattacharya’s complaint. “The complaint had several allegations. The FIR mainly is about too many officers and central forces barging inside the residences of senior leaders — one of whom has recovered from Covid, while his wife is still positive — without following Covid protocols,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. Bhattacharya, a Gariahat resident, in her letter on Monday to police commissioner Soumen Mitra, alleged that the arrests of ministers Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim and MLA Madan Mitra (along with former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee) amidst the Covid pandemic was “illegal”. The FIR has been registered under Sections 34, 166, 166A, and 188 of the IPC and 51(b) of the Disaster Management Act. The CBI’s complaint on Monday’s protests at its Nizam Palace offices coincided with its petition, filed in Calcutta HC on Wednesday, which cited this incident. Till late evening, the Shakespeare Sarani and Hare Street police sources claimed that cases under sections 147, 148 and 149 of the IPC — pertaining to rioting and unlawful assembly — had been registered at the police stations. CBI officials did not speak on the issue but conceded that a complaint had been filed against unknown persons. On Wednesday, the CBI submitted photographs relating to the incident at the HC. The Hare Street PS suo motu FIR against unlawful gatherings and protests around Raj Bhavan on Monday and Tuesday coincided with governor Jagdeep Dhankhar seeking a report from the police commissioner on the protests. Raj Bhavan has Section 144 CrPC imposed outside it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tit-for-tat-firs-by-agency-state-govt-over-arrest-ruckus/articleshow/82783746.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The drive, which kicked off on May 1, aims to inoculate 1.57 crore people under this category. However, the state has received only 5 lakh doses for the entire month of May. Senior officials in the state health department on Wednesday sought the Centre’s intervention in ensuring that Jharkhand gets more vaccine doses to keep the programme going. However, the Centre reportedly informed the state health officials in Ranchi that they will not be able to help the state immediately. “On an average, we are vaccinating close to 40,000 beneficiaries (aged between 18-44) daily. Against our requirements, we have got only 5 lakh doses for this month. Now, we have been told that we will not get more than 5 lakh doses in June as well,” a senior official in the department said. “If we go by the current pace, we will run out of stock within a week,” the official added. Since the drive started on May 1, nearly 1.9 lakh people in this category have taken their first dose. On Tuesday, nearly 37,000 people took their jabs. The state health department is being flooded with complaints about vaccine unavailability on its toll-free helpline numbers as many are being turned away from the session sites. The deputy commissioners of 24 districts are also requisitioning for more doses to meet the growing demand. “We are currently working out the requirements of the districts and allotting doses from the available stock. Our efforts are aimed at ensuring that the drive does not stop in any district,” A Dodde, state nodal officer for vaccines, said. However, sources in the department said there are plans to cut down the number of session sites unless the supply is seamless. There were 596 session sites statewide as on Tuesday. “The vaccine shortages will remain for another month or so,” an official said. The vaccination programme for people above 45 years is also slowing down due to the shortages. The state has 5 lakh doses in its stock to administer second doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/vax-drive-for-18-to-slow-down-in-jharkhand-to-stock-shortage/articleshow/82791433.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Kolkata||Arrested netas stay in custody, Calcutta HC to hear case again today||KOLKATA: Ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee and former ministers Madan Mitra and Sovan Chatterjee remained in custody for at least one more night as the Calcutta High Court, after a two-and-a-half-hour hearing on Wednesday, decided to take up their bail pleas and related issues for hearing again on Thursday. The CBI named Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and law minister Moloy Ghatak as parties in their plea for transferring the case out of Bengal and the counsel for the arre-sted politicians accused the agency of saying “half-truths” in court, which was without “precedence in post-Independence India”. The CBI interpreted the CM and the state law minister’s presence at the CBI’s eastern zone headquarters and the court complex on Monday as an attempt to “influence the probe”. Not so, said the defence, explaining that the act was to “extend support and sympathy” to her senior cabinet colleagues. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta started his arguments around 2 pm after the division bench of acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Arijit Banerjee convened virtually. Mehta’s arguments followed the formal CBI plea in court, seeking to transfer the Narada case outside Bengal. “A clear, cogent and forceful attempt” was made by CM Banerjee and other state functionaries “to overreach, impede and intimidate the judicial system and due process of law”, he said, submitting photographs and other documents to support the CBI claim. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for the arrested politicians, argued that staying their bail order without even giving them a hearing denied them “natural justice”. He also accused the CBI of saying half-truths in court, like “Aswathama Hata...” in the Mahabharata, as it wanted these leaders in custody at any cost. Justice Banerjee intervened at this point, saying Monday’s HC stay order followed a specific allegation of a judicial order being given under pressure. Singhvi countered this by saying the CBI special judge did not mention any such thing in his order. Justice Banerjee then asked Mehta a few specific questions: whether the four arrested politicians had ever refused to cooperate with the CBI, which necessitated their arrest during a pandemic; and whether arrests were needed when charge sheets had already been filed? Mehta said he had got a copy of the plea by the four arrested politicians only on Wednesday morning and needed time till Thursday to respond formally. That the arrested could not be produced in court physically was something “unheard of”, he added. Acting CJ Bindal then asked Singhvi why the CM and the state law minister had to go to the CBI office and the court, to which Singhvi replied that it was to support her party colleagues and democratically protest against the CBI’s action. “No one was stopped from functioning. It was the CBI that asked for a virtual hearing,” he said, adding that people were bound to gather when “senior public figures” with mass following were picked up in a five-year-old case. Singhvi also referred to mass protests and gatherings after film stars Sanjay Dutt and Salman Khan were arrested and mentioned that the CBI special court judge never complained of any pressure. Acting CJ Bindal then asked how he could explain the CM’s presence at the CBI office for six hours. “It is a Gandhian way of protest,” Singhvi responded, prompting the judge to ask: “Stone-pelting too? So these legal issues can be settled on the streets?” The CBI alleged that CM Banerjee entered the CBI office at 10.50 a.m. and “went straight to the room where the arrested were sitting”. “She started shouting that you also arrest me,” the agency alleged in its petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/arrested-netas-stay-in-custody-hc-to-hear-case-again-today/articleshow/82783734.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand Congress files FIR against BJP leaders over toolkit controversy||RANCHI: Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC), a part of the ruling alliance in the state, on Wednesday filed an FIR against central BJP leaders, including a Union minister, accusing the saffron party of forging All India Congress Committee (AICC)’s letter head to float a purported document on social media dubbing it as ‘Congress toolkit’ that has snowballed into an ugly political slugfest between the two parties. Hours after BJP leaders tweeted about the letter levelling various charges against the Congress on Tuesday, the Grand Old Party slapped FIRs against BJP national president J P Nadda, Union minister Smriti Irani, BJP’s national spokesperson Sambit Patra and others. Following suit, JPCC on Wednesday evening lodged a similar FIR at Kotwali police station in Ranchi upping the ante against BJP. JPCC spokesperson Alok Dubey said, “BJP is trying to divert the nation’s attention from the mishandling of Covid-19, which in the recent months has created a havoc. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has led from the front to fail the nation in times of the pandemic. On the contrary, Congress has been flagging wrongdoings by the Union government that is now making BJP and its government in the Centre nervous, prompting them to spread canards against our party.” Another spokesperson Lal Kishorenath Shahdeo said BJP functionaries have not only stopped at manufacturing fake documents to target Indian National Congress but have also attempted to lower the image of India and has the potential to escalate tensions in the country through its politics of hatred. “As a responsible party, we have urged the law enforcers for appropriate action under various sections of IPC and IT act,” he said. On the other hand, state BJP didn’t issue any statements to counter the charges levelled by JPCC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-cong-files-fir-against-bjp-leaders-over-toolkit-controversy/articleshow/82779548.cms||---

But now a mushroom species, touted to be one of the costliest in the world, has also turned out to be of medicinal value. Scientists at Kutch-based Gujarat Institute of Desert Ecology (GUIDE) have successfully cultivated – ‘cordyceps militaris’ – a mushroom species that traditionally found its use in Chinese and Tibetan herbal medicines. The scientists grew the mushrooms in 35 jars in a controlled environment in a laboratory within 90 days giving 350 grams yield. The mushroom is valued at Rs1.50 lakh a kg. The institute which has found it useful in treating even breast cancer has decided to provide training to entrepreneurs at a very nominal fee as a livelihood option to cultivate mushrooms at laboratory scale. “C. militaris is known as Himalayan gold. It has a multitude of health benefits and can potentially prevent a wide range of lifestyle illness. The fungus is club-shaped and the surface appears roughly punctured. The inner fungal tissue is whitish to pale orange. It is now possible to cultivate it in labs under controlled conditions,” said GUIDE’s director V Vijay Kumar. The institute has studied the antitumor element of this mushroom variety in detail. “We explored the in-vivo anticancer activity of the extracts against breast cancer in animal models. This was done in coordination with Nirma University, Ahmedabad. The preliminary investigation reveals extracts of this mushroom can provide significant results in terms of reduction in breast cancer tumour,” said K Karthikeyan, senior scientist and head of environment laboratory division at GUIDE. The institute has sought regulatory permission to carry out clinical trials on humans. “We are also studying its effect on prostate cancer but it has been delayed due to Covid-19 induced pandemic,” he said. Plans are to test anti-viral and anti-cancer properties of this species in Indian conditions. “With proper awareness, we can make this wonderful nutritional and medicinal supplement available to a broader population,” said V Vijay Kumar, adding that GUIDE scientist G Jayanti and professor Jigna Shah from Nirma University were also part of this study. Training of mushroom cultivation at laboratory scale costs as high as Rs one lakh a week. But GUIDE will provide this training at a normal charge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-scientists-grow-one-of-costliest-mushrooms/articleshow/82787616.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

This includes a one-time Rs 3,000 cash assistance for workers in the unorganised sector, mainly taxi and autorickshaw drivers, and crop loss compensation for flower growers and horticulture farmers. "We've done the best we could within the current financial constraints to alleviate the suffering of people affected by the lockdown," hesaid. Last year, Karnataka was the first state to announce a relief package of Rs 1,610 crore when a national lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Yediyurappa said Rs 3,000 would be given to autorickshaw/cab drivers and construction workers registered with the Karnataka State Construction Workers Welfare Board. Barbers, porters, tailors, ragpickers, potters, mechanics and roadside vendors registered under the Atma Nirbhar Fund would get Rs 2000 each. "The amount will be directly transferred to bank accounts," the CM said. Yediyurappa also announced plans to hire 2,150 doctors in the next three days to ramp up Covid treatment facilities across the state. Farmers get more time to repay loansHe added that floriculture farmers will get a compensation of Rs 10,000 per hectare while horticulture farmers will get a maximum relief of Rs 10,000 irrespective of losses they suffered due to lockdown. In all, 89,000 farmers will benefit from this. Over 16,000 artists and artists’ groups registered with the Kannada & Culture department will also receive Rs 3,000 each. The package also deferred repayment of loans availed by farmers and self-help groups from cooperative societies till July 31. “The government will bear the interest component for three months,” he said. The government will give free ration up to 5kgs of foodgrains and 10kgs of foodgrains at subsidised rate of Rs 15 per kg which will benefit 4.3 crore beneficiaries. This will cost the exchequer Rs 204 crore. The government will also distribute free food packets to over 6 lakh beneficiaries in Bengaluru through 174 Indira Canteens and 15 kitchens until the lockdown is lifted. The government will release Rs 50,000 each to all 6,000 gram panchayats under provisions of the State Disaster Response Fund as part of a contingency relief package. “We have set aside over Rs 30 crore for this,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-rolls-out-rs-1112-crore-aid-for-unorganised-workers/articleshow/82787746.cms||Anil Gejji
---||Business||Cyclone caused Rs 15,000 crore loss; Gujarat and Diu worst hit||MUMBAI: Cyclone Tauktae is estimated to have caused a loss of about Rs 15,000 crore, that’s slightly over $2 billion with the agriculture sector being the worst hit and Gujarat and Diu the most affected regions due to the strong wind and the resultant flooding. Infrastructure (mainly the ports along the western coast) and utilities (electricity and telecom) sectors have also been hit severely leading to such losses, a report by RMSI, a global consultancy firm working in the field of natural calamities, climate change etc., said in a report. Among the states, Kerala, Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra have been partially affected by the cyclone which made a landfall along the Gujarat and Diu coastlines on Monday late evening. There are expectations that the frequency of such devastating cyclones could increase in near future. According to Pushpendra Johari, Senior VP, sustainability, RMSI, Tauktae was a unique cyclone that impacted all the states and UTs along India’s western coast. Recent studies on climate change have highlighted the rising sea surface temperature in the Arabian Sea which would increase the frequency of cyclones in these regions, Johari said. RMSI estimates that out of the total Rs 15,000-crore loss, at least half is expected in Gujarat and Daman & Diu while the other four western coastal states incurring the balance half of the loss. On the sectoral front, about “25-40% losses are expected from the agriculture sector from all the above impacted states. Around 15%-20% of the total was from the transportation sector, primarily ports, and a similar loss share from the utility sector, primarily power and telecom,” the report noted. The heaviest brunt was witnessed in Junagadh and Amreli districts in Gujarat and Diu. According to RMSI, flooding of 0.5m to 1m is expected around Porbandar, from 1m to 3.5m around Una, Bhavnagar, Rajula, Tajala and Diu and some parts of Surat city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cyclone-caused-15000-cr-loss-gujarat-and-diu-worst-hit/articleshow/82787753.cms||Partha Sinha

The service with a fleet of five auto ambulances began late Tuesday evening and aims at ensuring patients reach hospitals without much wait. Three of the autorickshaws ply during day and two at night. They are stationed at the city municipal commissioner's office in Kalaburagi, about 570km from Bengaluru. Kalaburagi city corporation commissioner Snehal Lokhande told TOI the city has nearly 100 ambulances, but most areas are accessible only by autorickshaws. The service was used by seven people in the night when the service began, and 25 on Wednesday. "The district reports 700-800 new cases every day and the city accounts for 400-500 of them. Only 10% of those cases require hospitalisation. As the city has many narrow lanes, movement of ambulances is not easy. Hence, we need autorickshaws too," said Lokhande. The city administration has provided PPEs to the auto drivers. We’ve no other work, would like to help patients: Auto driversIf the patient's condition demands a fullfledged ambulance, then the auto driver will get back to the authorities to arrange for the same. Autorickshaws are sanitized after every trip and they can be used by the public to go to vaccination centres too. “Thanks to lockdown, we have no other work and would like to help patients,” said Shakeel Patel, an auto driver who has volunteered for the service. Ravichandra D, 32, another auto volunteer, said it’s the plight of patients that made him come forward to do his bit. “On Wednesday, I ferried five patients. I take precautions like using a mask and sanitiser,” he said. Ensuring the patient reaches the designated hospital at the earliest is his only concern, he added. According to Lokhande, the idea behind introducing auto ambulances is not only about shortage of ambulances. He said many patients have been requesting autorickshaw drivers to reach out to hospitals and many drivers refuse fearing the virus spread and stigma. “Many patients have tried using public transport, but that’s not advised keeping the virus-control measures in mind. Some auto drivers have volunteered to work with the city administration. We are aiding them with daily allowances and free fuel,” he explained.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Concern over quality of PPE kits at government rate||KOCHI: Leading manufacturers of PPE kits in the state have expressed helplessness in manufacturing good quality kits at the rate fixed by the state government. While some have informed private hospitals that at the present price, they would reduce the items in the PPE kit to just body suits and shoe covers, others have made it clear that quality will have to be compromised for the cost. Private hospitals have now sought the chief minister’s intervention in the matter. The main contention of the manufacturers is that they are dependent on raw material from other states and due to increase in Covid cases, their cost have increased. They are also demanding that there should be a graded price for all items, depending on quality. PPE kit consists of a body suit, head cover, shoe cover, goggles and N95 mask. The government, in an order on May 14, had declared these items as essential articles and fixed maximum retail price for them. “Due to recent price restrictions, good quality products from the state are now going to other states where there are no price restrictions. This may lead to a dangerous situation where HCWs will be unable to get quality safety products. We have appealed to the chief minister to consider restructuring the current pricing,” said Hari K S, secretary, Association of Indian Medical Product Manufacturers. “There should be some control in prices of raw materials. It should be noted that N95 masks, goggles and gloves are not manufactured in the state and are sourced from outside. Now, with the price fixed, no one is interested in selling the product to us and this is leading to acute shortage. A Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) approved PPE kit costs us Rs 350, while the government has fixed an MRP of Rs 273,” added Subhash AV, a leading PPE kit manufacturer in the state. However, Indian Technical Textiles Association (ITTA) chairman SK Sundararaman and managing director of Shiva Texyarn, one of the leading PPE kit manufacturers in the country said that it is possible to give the items at the rate fixed by the government and they are already in talks with private hospitals. “Good quality manufactures can supply the products (500 to1,000 kits) at the price fixed by the government. However, if the hospitals want to mark it up then it won’t be possible,” added Sundararaman. There are allegations that some private hospitals purchase PPE kits at around Rs 350 to 400 mark it up three to four times when billing patients. Meanwhile, Kerala Private Hospitals Association secretary Dr Joseph Benaven said that “compromising the quality of these products will surely put healthcare personnel at risk. This may lead to a situation where scarce human resources are further depleted leading to a crisis”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-concern-over-quality-of-ppe-kits-at-government-rate/articleshow/82787671.cms||Preetu Nair
