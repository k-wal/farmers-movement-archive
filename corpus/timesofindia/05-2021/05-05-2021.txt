A division bench led by justice Devan Ramachandran said in an interim order, “It does not require for us to expiate that if uncontrolled gathering is permitted in the vaccination centres, the very purpose of vaccination would boomerang, since what is intended to be prophylactic exercise would perhaps become a super-spreader event of the pandemic infection.” The court directed the state police chief to ensure that crowding is prevented at the centres, without using force. State attorney KV Sohan submitted that the government has stopped spot registration and is now focusing on citizens requiring second dose. The government has requested 25 lakh doses of Covaxin and 75 lakh doses of Covishield have been requisitioned from the Central government, the court was told. In the order, the court noted that the primary reason why people crowd at vaccination centres is because of the impression that vaccines are not available. “We must say that this impression appears to be gathering momentum by the day,” the court said. “We, therefore, deem it appropriate to initiate suo motu action with all necessary stakeholders on the fray, so that the apprehensions of the citizens of this State can be allayed as regards the availability of vaccines and their chances of being vaccinated, both the first dose and the second dose.” The court has asked the central and state governments to inform it about the steps taken by May 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/crowding-at-vaccine-centres-kerala-hc-registers-suo-motu-case-asks-govts-to-respond/articleshow/82393986.cms||Mahir Haneef
---||Kochi||Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan politicized, distorted my words: NSS chief||KOCHI: Attacking Pinarayi Vijayan for his statements against Nair Service Society (NSS), general secretary Sukumaran Nair alleged on Tuesday that Vijayan had politicized and distorted the answers he gave to the questions raised by the media on polling day. In a statement, Nair said that NSS would continue its stand of protecting the beliefs of devotees and the Nair community would look at the anti-NSS stand by the LDF with due importance. The statement was issued as a reply to the statements by Vijayan at a news conference on Monday when he attacked NSS for its stand against LDF and the “anti-LDF” statements Nair made on poll day. “CM’s statement that Nair tried to urge members of NSS not to vote for LDF on the poll day is not true and anyone who saw the live telecast that day can understand this. I said the people would vote for those who stand to protect secularism, democracy, social justice and beliefs. People wanted a change in rule as per my understanding and it should happen as per the will of people. I did not comment on that. All these statements were my answers to the media’s questions and I stand by what I said. He should not have politicized and distorted these statements to misguide people and create enmity with NSS and its leaders,” read the statement. Nair said that NSS hasn’t opposed anything except the LDF stand on Sabarimala. “Some LDF leaders, including CM, are trying to take an offensive stand against NSS and its leaders. There is no doubt that Nair community would see this with due importance. NSS will continue its stand in issues pertaining to protecting belief. NSS has the right to express its stand no matter which front rules. We have done that always and will continue doing so,” said the statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cm-politicized-distorted-my-words-nss-chief/articleshow/82393686.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||India||UK-India collaboration at heart of vaccine miracle: UK PM Boris Johnson||The Enhanced Trade Partnership will unlock new opportunities for Indian businesses in the United Kingdom and British businesses in India, UK PM Boris Johnson tells TOI in an exclusive email interview. Excerpts:Q: Given the Covid surge in India and the strong relationship between UK and India in healthcare, how do you think we can expand this relationship in terms of vaccine production? Coronavirus is the greatest global challenge of our lifetimes. If we’re going to defeat this pandemic, countries will have to work together with a spirit of openness. India and the UK have demonstrated this commitment to cooperation throughout the last year. You have kept your borders open so that vital medicine and PPE gets to those who need it in the UK and of course we cannot forget the immense contribution Indian people make to our National Health Service. I’m proud that the UK has been able to help India during the acute Covid emergency you are currently facing. On Sunday I announced 1,000 more ventilators will be sent from the UK’s surplus supply to Indian hospitals to help the most severe Covid cases. This is in addition to 200 ventilators, 495 oxygen concentrators and 3 oxygen generation units we announced last week. Businesses, civil society and the wider public have also responded to appeals for help and launched funding drives. I am deeply moved by the surge of support the British people have provided to the people of India and am pleased the UK government has been able to play our part in providing life-saving assistance. We’ll continue to look for ways to support in the coming weeks. The development of coronavirus vaccines is nothing short of a scientific miracle. UK-India collaboration is at the heart of that story – the UK funded the creation of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, doses of which are now being produced in their millions at the Serum Institute to be distributed – at cost – around the world. It is now the responsibility of all governments to get vaccines to those who need them, wherever they are in the world. That is why the UK has given £548m to the COVAX scheme to get vaccines to developing countries and pledged to share any excess vaccine doses we have with the scheme. I look forward to working closely with Prime Minister Modi and others to increase global vaccine production and distribution so we can defeat this pandemic, together.” Q: How do you expect the UK’s new interest in the Indo-Pacific to work on the ground/sea? The landmark review of foreign policy the UK published earlier this year was very clear about how important the Indo-Pacific region is to the UK’s security and prosperity. India is, of course, an indispensable partner in that region and we are aligned with India in our global goals. Later this year the UK’s Queen Elizabeth Aircraft Carrier – the largest and most technologically advanced vessel ever made in Britain’s shipyards – will sail to the region, including to India, to undertake joint exercises with the Indian navy. The carrier will visit west coast ports, expanding our interoperability and enhancing our ability to defend against shared threats- a tangible symbol of our commitment to the Indo-Pacific. Of course we will look for ways to deepen our defence relationship further in the coming years, ensuring both our countries are fully equipped to tackle the range of challenges we face. Q: India and UK are planning on declaring an Enhanced Trade Partnership. Is this a free trade agreement in disguise? The Enhanced Trade Partnership agreed with Prime Minister Modi this week is a really important step. The Partnership will unlock new opportunities for Indian businesses in the UK and British businesses exporting and investing in India. Our economic relationship is strong with trade already worth around £23 billion a year, supporting more than half a million jobs. The UK is already the largest European market for India’s goods exports. The Enhanced Trade Partnership sets the ambition to double the value of UK-India trade by 2030 and declares our shared intent to begin negotiations on a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement by the end of this year.” Q: What would be the highlight/focus of this trade partnership, given India is one of the largest investors in the UK already? The ETP is about setting a clear direction for the future of the economic relationship between the UK and India. A relationship that I hope will be bolstered down the line by a full Free Trade Agreement. This Enhanced Trade Partnership will resolve market access issues, boost exports and strengthen our trade relationship. It will lead to the removal of barriers to trade through a market access package and will result in new opportunities for everyone from Indian seafarers to nurses. The commitments we have made to increase trade will create jobs in both the UK and India and help more brilliant Indian products get on the UK’s shelves and vice versa.” Q: How will UK immigration reform impact India and Indians? “Prime Minister Modi has spoken often about the ‘living bridge’ that exists between the UK and India. The close relationship between our countries ultimately comes down to our people and their shared values and culture. One in fifty people in the UK have Indian ancestry and the contribution made by Indian diaspora in the UK speaks for itself. India is already benefitting from the new points-based immigration system, which came into force at the beginning of this year. This new system will lead to even more brilliant and skilled people from India being able to study, work and live in the UK in future. It levels the playing field so that where you come from matters less than what you can bring. Indian student visas increased by over 40% last year, and Indian nationals account for nearly half of all UK skills work visas. On the 1st of July, we will implement the new post-study Graduate Route, offering new opportunities to tens of thousands of Indian students to study in the UK’s fantastic universities and build a career in the UK afterwards. We have also made it easier for Indian professionals to work in the UK – and for Indian companies to hire the labour they need. When we met, PM Modi and I discussed how to encourage Indian people to come to the UK, especially students and young professionals, and how to combat immigration crime – and were pleased to agree on a new mobility partnership that will look to achieve just that.” Q: Are you pushing India to declare a “net zero” pledge on climate change? India is already a world-leader on climate action, with an impressive target of 450GW of renewable energy by 2030. I’m proud that we’re already working hand in hand to tackle the devastating effects of climate change, through initiatives like the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. Any progress we make in the face of this huge challenge, we will make together. That’s why as hosts of this year’s UN climate summit, COP26, we’re asking all countries to up their ambition on climate change. The science is clear. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees to avoid catastrophic global warming means that globally we need to reach net zero emissions by 2050. In the UK we have found that setting a net zero target has helped drive action here and now, giving a clear signal to business that the future is low carbon. Here in India, I think there is a unique opportunity to show the world that a new, clean development path is possible. An opportunity to be at the forefront of a new global green transition with all the benefits of jobs and cleaner air that brings.” Q: What would you say are the drivers of a post-Brexit India-UK relationship? The UK-India relationship is a modern partnership of equals, focused on the future. As the UK’s landmark foreign policy review this year made clear, for the UK, the relationship with India is crucial to help address all the issues we care most about: tackling Covid, protecting against climate change, building back our economies. We have shared interests and together we are tackling shared threats. India is a crucial voice on global issues – that is why I have invited Prime Minister Modi to attend the UK’s G7 summit this summer.” Q: What does the post-roadmap relationship look like? Over the next decade the UK and India will expand our relationship – a relationship that is much greater than the sum of its part. That means taking tangible action on the most important areas of our relationship: tackling Covid, protecting against climate change, expanding free trade. But we will also work increasingly together on a huge swathe of issues – from lifesaving scientific research to world-beating education to next-generation technology. I was pleased to lend my personal commitment to the UK-India relationship this week alongside Prime Minister Modi and I have every expectation that great things will continue to happen when the UK and India work together.” Q: How are you re-assessing your relationship with China, particularly in the areas of technology and defence? Our approach to China remains clear-eyed and rooted in our values and interests. We have a strong and constructive relationship with China in many areas. China has to be part of the solution to any major global problem we face; whether ensuring we do not face another devastating global health crisis, supporting vulnerable countries or addressing climate change. It’s always been the case that where we have concerns we raise them and take action – as we have done consistently over the human rights violations in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.” Q: Covid seems to have interfered in two trips that you have been planning to India. When you do finally make it here, what would be the top things you would like to do? I was very disappointed to have to postpone not one but two visits to India this year. But of course responding to the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic must come first and Prime Minister Modi and I agreed it was the right call to make. I am hopeful that the situation will improve quickly so that people can return to their normal lives and I can visit your wonderful country again. In the meantime, Prime Minister Modi and I continue to speak regularly – most recently earlier this week. I’m also very much looking forward to welcoming him to Cornwall for the UK’s G7 Summit this summer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uk-india-collaboration-at-heart-of-vaccine-miracle-uk-pm-boris-johnson/articleshow/82394264.cms||Indrani Bagchi
---||India||Oxygen supply to Delhi: HC issues show-cause to Centre on contempt||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday issued a show-cause notice to the Centre asking why contempt action should not be initiated against it for not complying with its order that Delhi be supplied with its allocated share of medical oxygen. Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli also rejected the submission of the Centre, represented by additional solicitor generals Chetan Sharma and Aishwarya Bhati, that Delhi's daily oxygen demand was not 700 metric tonnes (MT). "We reject this submission of Mr Sharma and Ms Bhati that GNCTD is not entitled to receive 700MT per day in the light of the existing medical infrastructure. It pains us that the aspect of supply of oxygen for treatment of Covid patients in Delhi should be viewed in the way it has been done by the central government. We are seeing the grim reality every day of people not being able to secure oxygen or ICU beds," the bench noted. The court observed that hospitals and nursing homes had reduced their bed capacity and were not able to service the existing capacity as well due to shortage of oxygen. "On the one hand, there is a need to augment capacities to meet the rising numbers of Covid-19 positive cases while on the other hand the existing infrastructure is crumbling and the bed capacity which is available can't be put to good use. We, therefore, direct the central government to show cause as to why contempt action should not be initiated for not only non-compliance of our order ...(but) also of the Supreme Court order passed on April 30, 2021," said the court. Two senior officials of the central government, Piyush Goyal and Sumita Dawra, were accordingly directed to be present on Wednesday. During the course of the hearing, the court was informed that Delhi still hadn't received 700 MT of liquid oxygen per day in spite of the fact that the Supreme Court had in a detailed order on April 30, 2021, asked for compliance by the Centre by the midnight of May 3, 2021. The court then took note of the relevant portions of the Supreme Court order in its own order. ASG Sharma had submitted that a compliance affidavit was being filed in the Supreme Court on Wednesday. “We fail to understand what good a compliance affidavit would do when as a matter of fact 700MT is not being delivered to Delhi on a daily basis. In fact, the earlier allocation of 490MT which has been revised to 590MT is not received for a single day,” the bench underlined in its order. “In our view, this itself is sufficient to show that according to the SC order, Delhi should be allocated and provided 700MT per day. If there was any doubt, the same is cleared from the further reading of the order.” The Supreme Court in its order had said, “This situation must be remedied forthwith. The situation on the ground in Delhi is heart-rending.” “This is something that, from the submissions of Mr Sharma and Ms Bhati it appears, is not present to the minds of the central government,” said the court. “In the same paragraph, the SC takes note of the assurance given by the SG on instructions to the effect that GNCTD’s demand of oxygen will be met and the national capital will not suffer for lack of oxygen.” It was, however, observed that the Centre’s assurance had not been fulfilled. “We are seeing day after day how small and large hospitals are running to us with SOS for supply of oxygen,” the bench said. Earlier in the hearing, the court had remarked that Centre’s officials had been informed about the aspect of oxygen allocation to Delhi and an order was passed. “We told your officer. Contempt is the last thing on our minds doesn’t mean you will take it lightly-…Certainly, it is there. Don’t drive us to issue notice…Now we mean business. We are not going to take no for an answer. There is no question why right away you can’t give 700MT. SC runhas said and we are saying it. We are making it clear.” When the bench was informed that an affidavit on oxygen supply would be filed, the court said, “We don’t want to hear the Centre on anything apart from compliance. What is the purpose of an affidavit? We want compliance. What is the use of an affidavit?” On being informed that the Delhi government had earlier made a demand of 300MT and then revised it, the court remarked, “Because they made the demand of 300MT, that’s why people of the city should suffer? Therefore, the Centre is quibbling about these little things to justify and let people die?” “Are you living in ivory towers? You may want to be the ostrich in the sand but we will not be,” the bench remarked. The court also pulled up the Centre for referring to the Delhi government’s statement that “with 420MT, citizens are dying” as “rhetoric”. The bench said: “Is this only rhetoric? Is it not a fact? Sorry, we don’t accept. We will not shut our eyes. It is very unfortunate. How can you be so insensitive! Be careful when you use this language,” the bench said. Earlier, Delhi government’s counsel, senior advocate Rahul Mehra, had referred to the Centre’s submission made in the Supreme Court regarding 1,224 oxygen tankers in the country with a capacity of 16,732 MT and efforts being made to enhance the number of tankers to 2,000 through conversion of nitrogen and argon tankers and import of 138 cryogenic tankers. Mehra, therefore, submitted that there was no dearth of tankers and the only issue was the turnaround time. The court later asked the Centre to improve the oxygen allocation issue with respect to mobilisation of tankers. ASG Bhati said, “We will get back with clear scientific data. Specialised groups are dealing with this mechanism.” The court subsequently asked, “How many experts are there from the suppliers in that group?” ASG Sharma informed that while 138 cryogenic tankers were being imported, another 50 were being manufactured. “The point is what you are planning and getting is in the future… We don’t even know whether it is going to be one week or two weeks or one month or six months…Whole nation is crying for oxygen. Our only concern is… Is it being (done) in the most efficient way? The way we look at it is we don’t even know… Maybe it is being done. We are only trying to persuade you. Assumption (is) you have not involved major suppliers, major players in the trade in the allocation business… You need to go back... involve some people technical some brilliant minds from IIMs... They will be able to tell the best model as to how to work efficiently with what you have today,” the court remarked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oxygen-supply-to-delhi-hc-issues-show-cause-to-centre-on-contempt/articleshow/82394976.cms||Aamir Khan

More than 12 people have been reportedly killed and many attacked while several families have fled their homes, according to BJP. "PM called and expressed his serious anguish and concern at the alarmingly worrisome law and order situation. I share grave concerns given that violence, vandalism, arson, loot and killings continue unabated. Concerned must act in overdrive to restore order," Dhankhar tweeted. PM called and expressed his serious anguish and concern at alarmingly worrisome law & order situation… https://t.co/qJkOGDdVkq— Governor West Bengal Jagdeep Dhankhar (@jdhankhar1) 1620116771000Accusing BJP of “growing desperate for President’s rule” and instigating the postpoll “communal clashes” that have also claimed five TMC workers and one from the ISF, Mamata Banerjee vowed to “tackle the situation” after taking oath on Wednesday. Modi's phone call and Nadda's visit followed appeals for help from BJP cadres and supporters, who took to social media platforms accusing Trinamool Congress of patronizing the attackers. BJP state in-charge Kailash Vijayavargiya tweeted videos alleging that women supporters were being attacked. West Bengal: Live updatesNadda said after visiting a slain BJP worker’s “wailing mother” he was shocked at some in TMC “discounting these incidents as stunts”. BJP asked its national secretaries to reach out to all families “battered in this unprecedented state-sponsored violence”. Wondering if the “gruesome violence” was part of “TMC’s victory celebrations”, CPM’s Sitaram Yechury said this would be “resisted and rebuffed”. Congress’s Jitin Prasada said Bengal “did not vote for this lawlessness”. "You (CM Mamata Banerjee) are a woman and daughter of Bengal. Aren't the women who are being killed and raped daughters of Bengal? Do they deserve this?" BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra asked. "BJP won't relent till Mamata Banerjee is held accountable for the murders of its workers and supporters for political vendetta. We are in Pratapnagar, Sonarpur with BJP president Naddaji to take stock of the situation and initiate action," party general secretary Bhupender Yadav tweeted. "The liberal cabal is silent over the carnage BJP is being subjected to in Bengal. Not shocking. Not surprising. But the same cabal blaming BJP for the violence is appalling. Your silence is complicity," he added. BJP leader Swapan Dasgupta, who contested unsuccessfully from Tarkeshwar, urged the Calcutta high court to take suo motu cognizance of the violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-calls-up-bengal-guv-on-violence-didi-smells-prez-rule/articleshow/82395263.cms||---
---||India||Nandigram returning officer provided security||NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Tuesday said all inputs and reports available with it regarding counting in Nandigram assembly constituency confirmed that the returning officer had followed all counting protocols and his rejection of the Trinamool agent's demand for a recount was in line with the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. Noting that election-related officers on the ground performed in a highly competitive political environment with diligence, full transparency and fairness, the EC said "attribution of any motive in such cases is not desirable". The commission's reaction came in the wake of TMC questioning the counting process in Nandigram and Mamata Banerjee, who lost to BJP's Suvendu Adhikari, alleging that the returning officer had not ordered a recount as "he feared for his life". The West Bengal government on Monday informed the EC that it has, on the latter's directions, provided security to the Nandigram returning officer both in person, with two personal security officers assigned for the job, and at his home. The EC on Tuesday also directed that he be provided medical support and counselling. The EC wrote to the West Bengal chief secretary directing that officers performing election duty be given due protection as "any pressure or harm or even perception or furtherance of any such narrative shall have serious implications on the entire machinery deployed during elections". As per Rule 63 of Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, a returning officer upon receiving a recount request can allow it in whole or in part or may reject if it appears to him frivolous or unreasonable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nandigram-returning-officer-provided-security/articleshow/82395790.cms||Bharti Jain
---||India||Daily jabs continue to decline as private hospitals remain short of vaccines||NEW DELHI: Daily vaccinations against Covid-19 have declined sharply as most private hospitals are yet to tie up with manufacturers for supplies. Even large hospital chains such as Max Healthcare, Fortis and Apollo, which have procured vaccines directly from the manufacturer, have limited stocks and are being able to organise only a few vaccination sessions at select sites. An average of only 2,000 sites in private hospitals conducted vaccinations on Monday and Tuesday, whereas only 1,000 sites delivered the shots during the weekend. This is compared to over 5,000 private sector sites that conducted vaccinations daily before May 1. On Tuesday, only 11.5 lakh doses of Covid vaccines were given till 8pm. This included 2.29 lakh beneficiaries in 18-44 years age group. Though most government sites are conducting vaccination, availability of vaccines is very limited. Of the total 55,739 vaccination sites on Tuesday, 53,721 were government facilities. Private sector operated only 2,018 sites. While 30-45 lakh doses were being administered daily till about mid-April, it dropped to the range of 4-14 lakh doses since May 1, when the Centre initiated Phase 3 of the vaccination drive extending the coverage to all those above 18 years of age. This meant that under the new policy, states and private sector were asked to procure jabs on their own. While the Centre continues to procure 50% of local production and distribute it through states for the 45+ population and health and front-line workers, the rest is for procurement by states and private sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/daily-jabs-continue-to-decline-as-private-hospitals-remain-short-of-vaccines/articleshow/82396038.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||Foreign aid sent to 38 outfits in 31 states and UTs so far||NEW DELHI: The Centre has distributed nearly 24 different categories of items totalling around 40 lakh pieces of Covid-19 relief material received from foreign countries to 38 institutions in different states and Union Territories. The distribution to states is based on a standard operating procedure set in place by the health ministry. The allocation is being done to states with a high caseload and where requirement of equipment such as BiPAP machines, oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders, PSA oxygen plants, pulse oximeters, Flaviparivir, Remdesivir, PPE and masks are high. The allocations are also done keeping in mind equitable distribution and load on tertiary health care facilities. In the first few days, the states were covered through AIIMS and other central institutions where critical care patient load is high and the need highest. Besides, the central government hospitals, including DRDO facilities in and around Delhi and in the NCR region were also supplemented through the aid, a government statement said while detailing the entire operation of distributing the relief material to states and UTs. The distribution strategy is intended to improve transparency. The ministry of external affairs is the nodal agency for channeling offers of help from foreign countries and coordinates with missions abroad. The MEA has issued its own standard operating procedures which are applicable across the board. The processing of aid has to be quick as some of it is perishable and needs storing and government said the process of tallying items, opening the packaging and repackaging sometimes needs to be done in a quarter of a day. Apart from this, a high-level committee under CEO, Niti Aayog and comprising secretary expenditure, MEA and officials of Niti Aayog and health ministry has also been formed to oversee the whole operation. State run logistics firm Concor is being used to move the relief material to states. Niti Aayog has also set up a control room and digital dashboard to monitor the distribution of relief material received from private sector, associations, industries and other entities. It monitors the process right down to the end beneficiary and is managed by officers from the government think tank. The medical items started coming in as donations from different countries after the sharp and sudden surge in Covid cases in the country and were channeled through the ministry of external affairs. A cell was set up in the ministry to coordinate the receipt and allocation of foreign Covid relief material.This unit started functioning on April 26, and comprises one joint secretary on deputation from ministry of education, two additional secretary level officers from MEA, chief commissioner customs, economic adviser from the ministry of civil aviation, technical, representatives from HLL, two joint secretaries from the health ministry and the secretary general along with representatives from the Indian Red Cross Society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/foreign-aid-sent-to-38-outfits-in-31-states-and-uts-so-far/articleshow/82396147.cms||---
---||India||Year after Pangong clash, China reinforces positions, rotates troops along LAC||NEW DELHI: A year after Indian and Chinese soldiers first clashed on the north bank of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh, China is now further reinforcing its military positions and rotating troops in the “depth areas” along the Line of Actual Control in a clear signal that it has no intent to de-escalate anytime soon. With the harsh winter having receded, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is fast converting the temporary structures, ammunition dumps, helipads and surface-to-air missile positions it had set up last year in the “depth areas”, ranging from 25 to 120-km from the LAC, into permanent positions now. “There is no fresh accretion of PLA troops on the frontlines in eastern Ladakh. But China continues to maintain sizable forces in the areas to the rear of the friction points, while it reinforces military positions all along the frontier in the region,” said a senior officer on Tuesday. “The Rutog Country area, which can act as a staging area for Pangong Tso since it is only around 100-km away, for instance, has witnessed a lot of activity in recent days. The PLA, of course, can move forces much faster to the LAC due to better road and other connectivity,” he added. It was on May 5-6 last year that dozens of Indian and Chinese soldiers were injured in the major brawl that had erupted on the north bank of Pangong Tso, which was followed by another one at Naku La in north Sikkim on May 9. India had then been caught off-guard by the way China had suddenly diverted its troops from their annual spring\summer exercises to undertake multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in a well-planned manner. Scrambling in response, India had moved over three additional divisions (each has 10,000-12,000 troops), howitzers and armoured vehicles into Ladakh, along with deploying fighters as well as attack and heavy-lift helicopters in forward bases, to match the PLA deployments. The tense face-off had led to the violent skirmishes in the Galwan Valley on June 15, with casualties on both sides being witnessed for the first time in 45 years, and even “warning shots” being exchanged by the rival troops in the Kailash Range-Chushul sector between August 29 and September 8. After multiple diplomatic and military talks, the two armies finally disengaged on both sides of the Pangong Tso in February. But since then, the PLA has flatly refused to pull-back from Gogra, Hot Springs, Demchok and Depsang Plains, as was reported earlier by TOI. With the onset of summer, both India and China are rotating their troops in the forward areas as well as readying for their annual exercises and stepped-up deployments now. The PLA, for instance, has replaced its two motorized infantry divisions across the LAC with fresh ones over the last month. Apart from systematically building roads, military camps, missile positions and other infrastructure all along the 3,488-km LAC from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, Chinese airbases like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa (Ngari Gunsa), Lhasa-Gonggar and Shigatse have also augmented their capacities for additional fighters and bombers. “These airbases continue to have additional deployments. There is not much change,” said another officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/year-after-pangong-clash-china-reinforces-positions-rotates-troops-along-lac/articleshow/82396364.cms||Rajat Pandit

While the government is yet to issue an advisory on identification, management and treatment of serious and severe adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs), experts have expressed concerns over the significant drop in AEFIs. "There is a drastic decline in reporting of AEFIs. This can be a cause of concern because it hinders further investigation into Covid vaccine effectiveness and side-effects," a senior official said. Official sources said the advisory has been finalised and is expected by end of this week. The parameters for AEFIs remain unchanged, and a majority are classified minor. With the early apprehensions over vaccines having declined, some of the anxiety related reactions have also reduced. However, the absence of the guidelines that were due at least three weeks ago has hindered monitoring and response to AEFI. A draft advisory was submitted to the health ministry in mid-April by the national committee on AEFI along with a detailed report based on assessment of around 498 samples of 'serious and severe' AEFIs like rare blood clots were reported after beneficiaries received Covid jabs. Some of these events were reported in countries, mainly in the West, after administration of AstraZeneca-Oxford University's Covid vaccine. "Though the assessment indicates (points to) racial differences and that incidence of thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) post-vaccination are rare in India, reporting and further investigation of AEFIs in India remains crucial because of the sheer volume of vaccinations. It is important to assess the AEFIs to rule out the risk and reiterate the preliminary findings from the assessment of the initial 498 AEFIs," a member of the AEFI committee said. Officials say lack of AEFI reporting also poses a potential risk. As 90% of AEFI are minor, it is possible that much of it is not being reported by recipients as people are gaining confidence in vaccine safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vaccination-no-advisory-yet-on-spotting-adverse-events-reporting-dips-sharply/articleshow/82396858.cms||Sushmi Dey

The dairies in the cooperative sector, which were closed in the past, would now be given to Amul for reopening. Amul would extend its services, including milk collection, in 705 villages across the state. The cabinet also decided to ask 35 per cent of admissions in all private universities to be given to the convener quota. The cabinet felt that the state government is paying the fees of the students through the fee reimbursement scheme and hence it should have control and greater share in admissions. The cabinet also discussed the issue of aided schools and colleges in the state, where the government is paying the salaries and meeting other expenses. The government had earlier found that the aided schools and colleges were making money from different sources with huge extent of lands in their possession, while the government had to pay the wages for the teaching and non-teaching staff. The cabinet expressed its displeasure over the performance of these aided institutions and felt the need to take them over. The cabinet had expressed satisfaction over the renovation of schools and colleges under the Nadu-Nedu scheme. The government had taken a loan of Rs 1,860 crore for renovation of schools and colleges under the scheme and was paying 2.5 per cent interest. As the renovation the schools had resulted in the increase of admissions this year, the cabinet felt the need to introduce CBSE syllabus in all schools across the state. The cabinet had also instructed the education department to come up with proposals to train the teachers in the new syllabus and introduce the same to increase the education standards in the state. The new CBSE syllabus would be introduced in schools from Class 7, brining under it all 44,639 schools in the state. It has also been decided to go ahead with English as the medium of instruction in all schools, particularly where the CBSE syllabus is introduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cabinet-clears-move-to-lease-out-district-level-dairies-to-amul/articleshow/82393448.cms||Gopi Dara

This comes a day after the AP high court gave permission to ACB officers to interrogate Narendra at Rajahmundry central jail instead of taking him into custody. The ACB is investigating alleged irregularities at Sangam Dairy. However, Covid-19 tests conducted on Narendra and Gurunatham, a former official of the cooperative department, turned out to be negative. On May 3, Sangam Dairy managing director P Gopala Krishnan tested positive and was admitted to a private hospital after taking the ACB court’s permission. Narendra’s advocate Gottipati Ramakrishna too has sought permission to admit him in a private hospital, stating his heath is deteriorating and he needs medical support. Rajahmundry prison authorities said rapid test results was negative for both Narendra and Gurunatham. However, their swab samples have been sent to the virology lab in Kakinada for RT-PCR tests.

---||Patna||No end to O2 crisis in city’s private hospitals||PATNA: Though the status of oxygen availability at government hospitals in the city has improved considerably in the last few days, the crisis still persists at most private hospitals. Many private hospitals have either reduced the number of beds for Covid patients or stopped admitting new patients citing short supply of oxygen. The Covid-dedicated Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) pressed panic button on Tuesday after the pressure of the oxygen supply began decreasing at a time when about 300 patients were on oxygen support at the hospital. The hospital officials began calling the government officers and the agencies concerned and it worked well. “The consignment of new cylinders reached in few minutes,” NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said. He added about 850 cylinders had reached the hospital on Monday against the daily consumption of 900 to 1,000 cylinders. “Though the government is doing its best to meet oxygen demand, the fact is that nobody, not even the doctors, had ever imagined such a situation of oxygen dependency of patients infected by the virus,” Dr Binod added. There was no crisis of oxygen at IGIMS, another Covid-dedicated hospital in the city, on Thursday. IGIMS superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said, “We remain watchful all the time as far as maintaining oxygen supply chain is concerned. It is the prime need of serious Covid patients.” Ford Hospital had reduced the number of Covid beds from 75 to 60 a few days ago. Hospital’s quality manager Pradeep Sharma said the step was taken due to short cupply of oxygen cylinders. The High-Tech Emergency Hospital near Saguna Mor has also stopped new admission even as 16 beds in its 40-bed Covid ward was lying vacant. Hospital manager Dr Abhay Pandey said about 80 cylinders were being delivered against the daily requirement of 140. “We don’t want to play with one’s life. Hence, we have stopped fresh admissions,” he added. Same was the scene at Nestiva Hospital where 28 patients were under treatment in the 30-bed Covid ward. “We have been bringing oxygen from Samastipur and Muzaffarpur since the last three days. The number of cylinders we are getting is leass than the requirement,” said hospital’s operation manager Vipin Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-end-to-o2-crisis-in-citys-private-hosps/articleshow/82392983.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||Lockdown will break virus transmission chain: Doctors||PATNA: The medical fraternity believes that the lockdown imposed by the state government till May 15 was very much needed to break the transmission chain of the deadly Coronavirus, which has infected a large number of people in the last few weeks. The acting president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Bihar branch, Dr Ajay Kumar said it was a globally proven fact that lockdown helped in putting a brake on the transmission of the Covid virus. Moreover, the lockdown would help the hospitals and other health infrastructures to review their preparations and strengthen other resources for providing better treatment, he said, adding that the IMA state unit had already demanded this measure. AIIMS-Patna director Dr PK Singh described the lockdown as the only effective measure to break the chain of the Covid-19 caused by a respiratory virus which supposedly became stronger and more dangerous after undergoing mutation. He said the first wave mostly affected people of advance ages, but the second is infecting younger ones with more severity. “All viruses mutate for their survival with improved ability and this natural process made the Covid second wave more deadly. Now, there was no way to disrupt its transmission, mostly through droplets, than imposing lockdown even for a few days,” he said. “Lockdown is the first medicine to save a society from viral infection,” said Dr NR Biswas, director of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), Patna. Reciting the example of lesser number of countrywide cases in the first wave of the Covid last year, he said it was only the lockdown which had helped the country compared to many other developed nations. Crowded markets and neglect of the Covid protocols worsened the situation resulting in the large number of casualties everywhere, including Bihar, Biswas added. PMCH’s former superintendent Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said the lockdown would rejuvenate the health infrastructure which had come under huge pressure due to the sudden rush of patients. Many people with minor symptoms reached the hospitals instead of following the general guidelines like home isolation and consultation through telemedicine. However, the lockdown would lessen the rate of infection in both urban and rural areas, he said. Dr Nitish Kumar Ranjan of Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC) said unnecessary and avoidable gatherings and flouting of the Covid protocol worsened the situation, necessitating lockdown. “Mutant virus becomes more deadly and it is true with the Covid-19. Now a check on public movement would effectively help in curbing further transmission,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lockdown-will-break-virus-transmission-chain-doctors/articleshow/82393076.cms||VK Tripathi

The EOU has set up a dedicated control room in Patna to receive round-the-clock complaints on black marketing or hoarding of oxygen cylinders and necessary medicines across the state. With the help of complaints received at the control room with baseline number 0612-2215142, the EOU’s raiding teams have nabbed altogether four persons in the last 24 hours and recovered 17 large oxygen cylinders from their possession. The EOU team raided a closed shop in Madhav Market near Maurya Hospital on 90ft Road under Patrakar Nagar police station area on Tuesday and recoveredof 12 oxygen cylinders, each of 50 litres capacity. The raiding team arrested Dheeraj Kumar of Mahendru in Patna City and Kameshwar Rai of Karbigahiya under Jakkanpur police station area from the spot. EOU sources said they were selling one oxygen cylinder for around Rs65,000 and charging huge amounts separately for their regulators. On Monday, the EOU raiding team had arrested Priyanshu Raj and Amrit Raj from Agamkuan and seized five 50-litre oxygen cylinders from their possession. Sources said both the brothers were charging around Rs85,000 per cylinder from the attendants of Covid-19 patients, who were asked to transfer money in their e-wallets. Sources said the duo was exploiting those whose kin were in serious condition. EOU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan personally reviewed the situation on Monday after it came to light that common people as well as NGOs are approaching police and giving information about the black marketing and hoarding of oxygen cylinders and important medicines used for Covid-19 treatment. The dedicated EOU control room has several police personnel working in three shifts of eight hours to receive complaints, maintain logbook and pass on the information to the raiding teams for taking necessary action. A DSP-rank officer, Bhaskar Ranjan, has been made in-charge of both the raiding teams which are presently taking action in Patna. On Tuesday, ADG Khan issued a letter to all the IGs and DIGs posted in the ranges along with SSPs and SPs to review the situation and take action on the complaint being received by police from the common people regarding hoarding of oxygen cylinders and medicines and being sold on black market. Khan said EOU is putting efforts to ensure that all such oxygen cylinders and medicines must not be seized and kept at maal-khana. Instead, these items should be handed over to medical institutions for immediate use after seeking interim orders from the courts concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oxygen-cylinders-being-sold-at-rs-65000-seized/articleshow/82392851.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||All parties welcome lockdown, opposition says should’ve imposed earlier||PATNA: The ruling and opposition parties were on the same page as the state government imposed an 11-day complete lockdown in Bihar effective Wednesday to break the chain of the coronavirus transmission. The opposition also maintained that it had been demanding a lockdown for the past fortnight to prevent the loss of lives. An hour after the state government announced the lockdown on Tuesday, the leader of the opposition, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, tweeted his reaction. "For the past 15 days, the opposition had been demanding the imposition of lockdown, but the ‘chhote saheb' (read CM Nitish Kumar)’ was obeying the orders from ‘bade saheb' (read PM Narendra Modi) that no lockdown be imposed before May 2 (the counting day for assembly polls)," he posted. Tejashwi also described the state government’s delayed response to breaking the coronavirus chain as a "low grade ‘nautanki’ show and a sham," since the pandemic had already reached villages. BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said he was flabbergasted that Tejashwi dragged in PM Modi and described his statement as an example of "petty politics". "The statement of the leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, made after the lockdown was imposed, shows his negativity and cynicism. Tejashwi is not making any logical suggestions but spitting venom against the government to provoke people," Anand said. Like Tejashwi, the state Congress acting president Kaukab Quadri too welcomed the lockdown and added that it had been imposed in the light of the Patna High Court’s stand on the matter, its imposition had become "necessary". Quadri demanded that the government release a daily bulletin on the situation wrought by Covid-19, which will help all concerned, including social workers, to make a proper assessment of the situation to carry out their activities to help the needy. Similarly, CPI(ML) state secretary Kunal and other senior functionaries, welcomed the lockdown and made a 10-point demand, including the issuance of passes to its workers, who are engaged in helping the needy and providing assistance at the hospitals. The ruling NDA camp, deputy CM Tar Kishore Prasad and other ministers welcomed the complete 11-day lockdown. Prasad sought the cooperation of the people and requested that they obey the lockdown rules to help the government in its fight against Corona. There was also a difference of opinion on the issue of the lockdown in the NDA camp, as the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) spokesman Danish Rizwan maintained that the government imposed the lockdown only after seeing the pressing stance of the Patna High Court on the matter. "If the lockdown has now been imposed, the government should also ensure that daily wage workers and poorer sections of society can earn their livelihood, and still others don’t face difficulties," Rizwan said. The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), which stands on the fringe of the NDA and continues to be critical of Nitish, echoed the opposition. "If it was imposed some days ago a lot of lives could have been saved. Honourable Nitish Ji delayed in imposing the lockdown," the Chirag Paswan-led party said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/all-parties-welcome-lockdown-oppn-says-shouldve-imposed-earlier/articleshow/82393061.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Bihar reels from Covid fury, govt apathy||PATNA: Months after holding the assembly election in Bihar, the state is reeling from the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is wreaking havoc on people's lives here at a scale not seen in living memory. And there is no help at hand. The scared and suffering Aam Aadmi, it seems, is not even left with the lung power to raise their voice against the "system" that they expected to come to their rescue amid helplessness and despair. The level of fright is such that people are even scared to perform the last rites of their loved ones, who had sacrificed everything in life for them. Unsurprisingly, desperation drives some people to react, sometimes violently, to vent their anger, but only to aggravate the situation for others in hospitals as there is no one to listen to and redress their grievances. There's a kind of vacuum, at every sphere. When the opposition raises its voice, the government dismisses it saying they don't know the ground reality, emphasizing that they are reviewing the situation daily. People on social media take a swipe and say it's the government that should see the ground reality instead of taking feedback from the same set of officers who are 'managing' things. But why blame the government alone. There are people who have turned the 'aapda' (disaster) into 'awsar' (opportunity) to mint money selling oxygen and life-saving drugs at exorbitant prices on the black market. Even basic drugs and vitamin tablets are out of stock in several localities of the state capital. The healthcare system is in such a sorry state that people fear taking their patients to a government hospital. The private ones are no better. The common man is being fleeced by either an 'ambulance wala', who charges Rs3,000 for general and at least Rs7,000 for an oxygen-equipped vehicle to take a patient to one hospital, or the illegal oxygen vendors and others. If there is no bed available in one hospital, the ambulance driver will charge the same amount again for taking you to the next hospital. The system is so helpless that it is beyond its scope to control and regulate things. But, again, some good samaritans are taking all kinds of risk to help the people in need. Former Bihar DGP (retired) Abhayanand, in his recent Facebook post, blamed corruption as the root cause of such helplessness. "Agar koi ek wakya hai jo is vibhishika ke mul mein hai to wah hai samast sarkari tantra mein macha nirbadh bhrastachar. Aam Aadmi ne bhrastachar se samjhauta karna sikh liya hai. Falafel ka vibhats roop dikh raha hai (If there is one thing to blame, it is pervasive corruption in the entire government machinery. People have compromised with corruption and the result is showing up in disaster)," he posted. But people will forget this havoc once things normalise. They won't ask if it was a failure of the government or the democratic system in which most of us vote for anything but health and education infrastructure, which has been badly exposed in Bihar. After the first wave of Covid-19 subsided, the government trumpeted it as their success story. Without naming any government, the US epidemiologist Anthony Fauci, in an interview with an Indian newspaper, said, "Victory was declared maybe too prematurely."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-reels-from-covid-fury-govt-apathy/articleshow/82376139.cms||Jai Narain Pandey

---||Business||Mentoring culture helps cos create effective flow of info||By James AgarwalMany successful people in business and life have acknowledged the presence of a mentor — a person who was there at the right time to guide them on their journey. Having a mentor can make all the difference in one’s professional life. These relationships are often informal and long-lasting. Should companies be stepping into this mentoring process or leave it to develop organically between individual employees? A mentoring programme will have a positive impact on various aspects in your organisation. Such programmes show results in the long term and help HR in propagating the culture they want to build in the organisation. A focused programme with clear objectives can go a long way. Setting down objectives Mentoring programmes run the risk of getting too informal once they are part of your company’s fabric. This is a favourable outcome for the company since a culture of mentoring has set in, but such an informal process is difficult to control and measure. Setting a clear objective will help in achieving measurable outcomes. The goal could be to promote more women to management roles, or to help new employees fit in. These goals should be communicated to the entire team with roles defined for both mentee and mentor. The mentoring programme could also prescribe hours that mentors and mentees will have to put in at work together. Cross-functional team interactions will also help to improve company-wide communication. Flexible process Setting down the objectives of the programme will give clarity. But being rigid about how the mentoring process should pan out will be counterproductive. Mentoring in reality is a personal relationship that both mentor and mentee need to work at. So, while company mentoring programmes can facilitate the relationship, being too specific with the process might not work. For example, a company specifies that mentor and mentee have to meet during office hours every week. This could be possible for many of the employees. But there might be sales teams that are on the move and require meetings outside office hours, at their convenience. Mentoring programmes should be flexible enough to allow for these small changes, without hassles. Assigning the mentor and mentee roles will be a critical part of the overall programme. Most companies choose hierarchical programmes where bosses turn out to be mentors to their team members. This may work in many cases, but there might be a need for a more balanced equation sometimes. So, while pairing mentees and mentors should follow a given format, the format should be open to modifications too. There is no fixed formula to get a programme going, it needs to evolve over time and adapt to individual differences, where possible. It is important to remember that mentoring relationships may get nurtured within the framework of the company programme, but no two of them are going to look alike. Once this flexibility is allowed, the company can look at a culture of mentoring within the organisation. Embedding the mentoring culture When firms look at mentoring as a daily outcome in the organisation, there is potential for paradigm shifts in the company culture. This could be a top-down approach where every leader in the organisation is available for small chats with people. Employees can then feel free to ask for help when they need it. They need not wait for a formal mentor to be assigned or search for one to work better. This kind of openness needs to be built over time by training the leadership to accept such interactions. The mentoring programme can also be application-based where junior employees seek out mentors who they feel can help them succeed at the workplace. Mentors also can identify mentees who they would like to work with. At a very large level, mentoring is essentially an information-sharing platform — especially with new hires. Having a mentoring culture creates information flows within firms that are open and effective. Startups can integrate this into their work culture from the word go. Having mentors around not only helps startups navigate the first few years that are usually very tough, it also encourages new employees to participate in the growth process of the company. As the Dominican-American writer rightly said, “Colleagues are a wonderful thing. But mentors, that’s where the real work gets done.” (The writer is MD, BTI Executive search)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mentoring-culture-helps-cos-create-effective-flow-of-info/articleshow/82394423.cms||---

Shruti Singh of RPS Mor area said the lockdown will help in breaking the Coronavirus chain. “The decision should be followed strictly,” she said. Nitish Sharma, a resident of Bypass Road, said: “Staying at home for long can be annoying at times, but lockdown was needed to control the prevailing situation in the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. The situation is out of control as of now,” he said. Sushmita Kumari (30) said the lockdown changes the daily schedule of a housewife. “Family members staying at home all day puts extra pressure on us. We need to take care of everything and early closing of shops will create more problems. But staying safe and alive is more important than anything else. So, lockdown is a good step.” But small businessmen are concerned about monetary losses. Shradha Roy, who owns a gym at Kankarbagh, said: “Short-term losses can be covered, but payment of long-term overhead expenses will be difficult. We have already been paying our staff, trainers and other bills despite the gym being closed from last month. We hope the situation gets better after lockdown and life returns to normal again.” Dinesh Kumar Singh, a general store owner on Station Road, said the rush for buying household items after the lockdown announcement was not like last year. “Though people were buying essentials a little more than required, but no heavy rush was witnessed at the shops on Tuesday. People were accumulating essentials for 10 days of the lockdown period,” he said. Kumar Alok, who owns a cafe, said curfew and lockdown have long-term effects on businesses. “Take away and home delivery would be less during the lockdown. Dining is already prohibited, which has drastically affected our revenue. But safety comes first,” he said. Nitish Chandra, who owns a jewellery shop on Ashiana-Digha Road, said: “We support the government’s decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/residents-hail-govts-decision/articleshow/82393040.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Enrolment in Punjab government schools up by 1.5 lakh||CHANDIGARH: The outbreak of Covid-19 since last year has helped the Punjab government achieve an unusual trend of people’s rushing to its schools for the admission of their children. Enrolment in the government-run schools has increased by 1.51 lakh in the ongoing academic session 2021-22 compared with the previous year. Of these 1.51 lakh students, 87% shifted from the private schools. Inability to pay hefty fees of private schools due to financial crunch and shutting down of a large number of small schools are understood to be the key reasons behind this reserve migration. Besides financial constraints faced by parents, an improvement in the quality of education in government-run schools has also been put forward as one of the reasons for a big jump in admissions in all the classes. The highest enrolment has been in the higher secondary classes. The number of new admissions went up from 3,75,457 on March 31, 2021, to 4,02,411 on April 30. Similarly, the number of students who took admission increased from 6,15,042 to 6,55,937 in the upper primary classes. At the primary level, 10,04,400 enrolments were recorded against 9,48,785 in the previous academic session. The government schools in Ludhiana recorded the highest increase in enrolment in classes from LKG to XII of 3,00,990, 8.83% more than the previous session, while in Mohali, the number of students went up from 1,06,465 in 2020-21 to 1,15,100, recording a jump of 8.11%.

Punjab education secretary Krishan Kumar attributed the rise in enrolment number to consistent efforts put in by the government for improving the quality of education and teachers who ensured the implementation of all the government policies. “People have not shifted their wards to government schools for only financial reasons. They are impressed with the improvement of quality of education in government schools in recent years,” said Kumar. To support his contention, he cited an example of Ferozepur (Rural) MLA who got her son enrolled in a government school. To attract students, the education department has launched an aggressive campaigns of motivating parents to enroll their children inthe government schools. That includes door-to-door drive and awareness programmes on social media and other platforms. Teachers have made skits of three to five minutes, highlighting the improved standards of government schools including, smart classrooms and beautified school buildings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/enrolment-in-pb-govt-schools-up-by-1-5-lakh/articleshow/82394429.cms||Vinod Kumar

The criminals abducted the two employees of the firm and roamed for over three hours before committing the loot. The firm’s local manager, Sunjan Kumar Yadav, has lodged an FIR with Ekma police station. Yadav said he along with co- worker Suraj Choudhary, closed the office around 8pm on Sunday and proceeded to their rented rooms. As soon as they reached near Alakh Narayan High School, about eight armed criminals on four bikes forced the two to accompany them on their bike. Later they tied a band over their eyes and took them to Harpur and Madhavpur. They returned to the office located at Hansrajpur under Ekma nagar panchayat in Saran district around 11:30pm and forced them to open the almirah in which the day’s collections were kept. Police sources citing the FIR said the criminals looted Rs17.56 lakh along with 20-25 parcel bags, CCTV camera, computer monitors and other electronic devices. After the loot, the two were freed.

The cabinet, which met here on Tuesday, has authorised the chief minister to take up the issue of shortage of vaccine doses in the state. Though the central government had decided to administer vaccine to all people above 18 years of age from May 1, the states have run out of stocks of the two variants of vaccine. The Andhra Pradesh government, after its initial decision to give vaccine to all, had to struggle with the shortage of stock, and had decided to give vaccine to all people above the age of 45 years. The government would then go for people in the age group of 18 to 45 years in the later stage depending on the availability of the doses, the cabinet felt. The cabinet had authorised the chief minister to seek supply of nearly four crore doses of vaccine for the state. The government plans to start vaccination at the village and ward secretariats to cover everyone in the state and in order to avoid a rush at the government and private hospitals and the primary health centres in both rural and urban areas. Meanwhile, the cabinet has approved the day and night curfew in the state from Wednesday. The curfew would be implemented from 12 pm to 5 am, covering a duration of 17 hours. The government has decided not to allow shops and other establishments to be open after 12 pm. The cabinet has also decided to withdraw RTC buses and other public and private transportation after 12 pm. Interstate transportation would also be closed after 12 pm, the cabinet said. The government has also decided to close all Intermediate classes by 11.30 am during the curfew period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jagan-to-write-to-modi-seek-more-vaccine-doses-for-ap/articleshow/82393472.cms||Gopi Dara

The government is aiming at converting the state into a global electronics manufacturing hub by 2024. The new electronics policy 2021-24 also aims at getting a whopping market size of $400 billion from the present $104 billion. It envisages tapping a majority of new investments in the sector flowing to India and South East Asian countries, into Andhra Pradesh and developing the state into a mature electronics manufacturing ecosystem. The government also plans promotion of a world-class greenfield electronics manufacturing cluster being developed at Kopparthy in Kadapa district. Introduction of a production linked incentive sscheme in the green field clusters extends incentives for the electronics manufacturers in the state. The government is also aiming at creating over 39,000 direct jobs in the electronics manufacturing sector with major employment share going in favour of women. The policy framework is a major milestone for the state to become a preferred investment destination for electronics manufacturing industry and is a testament to the investor friendliness of the government led by chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, said principal secretary to the government G Jayalakshmi. “The department is confident that the release of the Andhra Pradesh Electronics Policy 2021-24 will expedite the grounding of investments and provide employment opportunities to citizens of the state,” the senior IAS officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/green-signal-to-aps-new-electronic-policy/articleshow/82393454.cms||---

No Admission’ posters on Tuesday. “We are overstressed and overstretched,” hospital superintendent Pramod K Tiwary said, stressing that the hospital administration had no option but to announce the real situation in light of patients already occupying the dedicated Covid hospital beds to capacity. “The two floors of the Covid ward has 210 oxygenated beds, including ventilator beds. All are occupied,” he said. Tiwary said 18 patients whose SPO2 levels had stabilised at 94 or above have been discharged. “Even then, we have no beds (with oxygen). Yet, seeing anguished people coming with critical patients, we are nonetheless admitting them in other wards and further stretching our already thin resources to provide oxygen,” he said, adding that four such patients were somehow accommodated in the surgery ward and another 15 were taken into the orthopaedic ward. “We received our sanctioned quota of 500 oxygen cylinders yesterday. The next consignment is expected to reach us tonight,” he said. Civil surgeon Arun K Sinha, too, appeared forlorn when he echoed social media’s angst: “Hawaaon me maut hai, cylinder me zindagi (There is death in the air, life is in an oxygen cylinder).” “It pains to see even young patients desperately seeking oxygen. We are trying to find everyone with oxygen beds in other Covid facilities,” Sinha said. He was further distressed by the rising number of frontline health workers themselves getting infected in the district. “Even our testing outreach efforts have been hit,” he said. After two nurses were assaulted at the GMCH last week, health workers faced another attack from the attendants of a critical Covid patient from Motihari, who went berserk on finding this hospital ‘House Full’ late Monday night. “Health workers are fatigued, yet they are at the frontlines. We are seeing misery and treating beyond capacity. We too are risking our lives in seemingly impossible mission,” the civil surgeon bemoaned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/houseful-of-patients-at-gmch-in-bettiah/articleshow/82392721.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

The appeal was made after the IMA received information about some nursing homes, radiologists, pathologists, ambulance service providers and medical shops charging exorbitantly and taking advantage of the traumatic situations of patients and their families. Dr Sandeep Lal, president of Bhagalpur chapter of IMA and head of forensic medicine and toxicology department at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JLNMCH), told this newspaper on Tuesday: “We have appealed to the medical fraternity and related healthcare service providers to make sacrifices and take more humanitarian approach by lowering their charges to bare minimum for Covid patients and others in view of overall grim situation.” He added: “Perhaps, Bhagalpur region is the first in the country where doctors, radiologists, pathologist and others have offered to reduce their charges. Four radiologists and their diagnostic centres have reduced the charges by 40% following our appeal.” Similarly, others have also come forward to serve the needy in the wake of IMA’s appeal. “We had to come forward after receiving information and reports about some unscrupulous healthcare service providers, including a handful of clinics, nursing homes, diagnostic centres, ambulance service providers, medicine and surgical shops charging exorbitantly while taking advantage of the situation,” Dr Lal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dont-charge-exorbitantly/articleshow/82392905.cms||Kumar Rajesh

The latest deaths came after the deceased suffered from a fever for a couple of days, just like the earlier deaths. Those who died on Tuesday include two men, aged 22 and 30, according to Suresh Kumar, who is the representative of the village sarpanch, Parmila. Rohtak chief medical officer Dr Anil Birla confirmed that in the earlier 22 deaths, four had contracted Covid-19 and the remaining deaths were because of diseases like cancer and old age. Dr Birla said a team of the Haryana health department has been collecting samples to test for Covid-19. Of the total 122 samples taken by the health department in Titoli village till now, 30 have tested positive. However, Suresh Kumar, who is the younger brother-in-law of the sarpanch, contested the health department’s claim and said that those who died on Tuesday and in the last had good health before running a fever that took their lives. “The deaths that occurred on Tuesday had no ailment like that of cancer. They were young, healthy, and were doing well in their lives but died all of a sudden,” he added. A doctor on Covid duty at PGIMS Rohtak, who did not want to be identified, said Titoli village is not the lone case where a virus was the cause of a large number of deaths. At PGIMS, a huge number of patients are coming from Sampla, Rohad, and Ladhot. “A schoolteacher, who had contracted the virus, was found dead at his home after getting discharged from hospital. The sudden death after recovery of the patient is worrisome,” the doctor maintained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/6-more-mysterious-fatalities-in-rohtak-village-after-22-in-7-days/articleshow/82394485.cms||Sat Singh

---||Patna||Patna HC: Hand over state health infra to armed forces||PATNA: The Patna high court on Tuesday again came down heavily on the state government and asked the Centre’s additional solicitor general (ASG) to speak to the defence secretary regarding handing over the entire health infrastructure of the state to the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS). The division bench of Justices Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Mohit Kumar Shah orally observed that the state government has miserably failed in controlling the Covid-19 pandemic and the situation is beyond its control in Bihar. The bench directed ASG K N Singh to speak to the defence secretary on the matter that the high court may pass a stern order on Thursday for handing over the state’s health infrastructure to the AFMS. Advocate general Lalit Kishore urged the court to give the state government a chance to submit an affidavit that it did its best before passing any order. To this, the high court gave time to the state till 10.30am on Thursday for filing its affidavit. The bench would take up the hearing of the three PILs filed by Shivani Kaushik, Rohit Kumar and Gaurav Kumar Singh on the pandemic situation from 11am. Kishore said it’s a sorry situation that even after putting so much efforts, the high court is not reposing faith in the works of the state government. This further irked the bench which observed that the state government should feel sorry for it. “We feel ashamed of ourselves that since April 15, we are reposing trust in the action and assurances of the government. We continuously passed orders while people were dying,” the bench observed orally. “We feel ashamed that we only passed orders. Rather, we should have taken a proactive approach instead of believing in the state government’s assurances. We could not intervene properly to protect the fundamental right to life of the people under Article 21,” the bench observed. The high court had started hearing the three PILs on April 15. The bench also observed that an assurance was given on behalf of the state on April 23 that 50 beds at ESIC hospital in Bihta would become operational by April 27. But the order was not complied primarily because of non-supply of medicines. Kishore submitted that Rs50 lakh was sanctioned to the state health society director Monday night for supply of drugs to the Bihta hospital. The court fumed at Kishore’s submission that the IGIMS director and a squadron leader-rank doctor deputed at ESIC hospital in Bihta have been summoned for their separate submissions in the high court on Monday that mere making announcements in the air won’t transform IGIMS into a Covid-19 dedicated hospital as there was lack of oxygen supply and medicines. Kishore submitted that their submissions were not true. “Why have you called them? You are going to nag them that why they gave such statements in the high court. If we receive a complaint from their side that they have been nagged, then we will take you to task,” the bench observed while addressing the advocate general. The bench remarked that if the state government sanctioned funds for medicines at ESIC hospital on Monday, then how the doctor deputed there was lying. Meanwhile, appearing for the AIIMS-Patna, counsel Binay Kumar Pandey filed a report that the capacity of beds at the institution has been increased to 920, of which 527 would be for Covid-19 patients. Pandey submitted that of the 527 beds, 442 are oxygen-equipped and 85 are ICU beds with ventilators. The report was taken on record by the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hc-hand-over-state-health-infra-to-armed-forces/articleshow/82393676.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Freezer box rents numb kin as private players make a killing||HYDERABAD: It’s not just hefty hospital bills that an average Hyderabadi is finding it difficult to bear, even renting a freezer box to keep mortal remains of a coronavirus patient is turning out to be quite expensive. Private operators are demanding Rs 16,000 to Rs 50,000 for preserving bodies overnight in an ambulance, and with many small hospitals not having a mortuary facility, relatives are giving in to the pressure tactics. With rising coronavirus deaths, bodies are first stored in a freezer box inside an ambulance overnight in many cases and later brought to the crematoriums or graveyards for the last rites. “My friend’s father died a few days back and we intended to preserve the body for five days as his son had to return from Canada. However, when they demanded Rs 50,000 per day, we had no option except to cremate the body,” said Vishal M, adding that the hospital was not even willing to keep the body overnight as they did not have a mortuary. While it generally costs around Rs 2, 500 to Rs 3,000 to keep a body overnight, currently these freezers boxes are rented out by dozens of operators for Rs 10,000 for Covid-19 victims at homes. But if the patient dies in a hospital, the charges rise significantly as an ambulance also comes into the picture, and depending on the area and duration required to keep the box, prices are fixed. Ten days back, a 57-year-old Secunderabad resident died and his family was asked to pay Rs 32,000 to keep the body in an ambulance overnight. “We had no other option but to agree as the hospital asked us to take the body away,” said a family member, adding that the cost included storing, transportation, and cremation. When TOI contacted some of the private players renting out freezer boxes in an ambulance, they quoted Rs 18, 000 for keeping the body overnight and transporting it to a crematorium the next day. In two more cases—one at Kothapet and the other at Chaitanyapuri, families had to shell out Rs 16, 000 each to store mortal remains of Covid-19 patients overnight. Not just those who lost their loved ones at hospitals, but families of patients, who are under home isolation, and succumbed to Covid-19 at home also are forced to shell out about three times the normal cost to get a freezer box. “We had to pay Rs 10, 000 for a freezer box for one night,” said a family member of a 40-year-old, who died of Covid-19 at his home in Kompally. NGOs helping families with finding hospital beds, last rites, ambulances, said that instead of coming to the rescue of family members who lost their loved ones, private players have increased the costs exponentially and are making fortune. Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar assured action against people trying to derive profit from the Covid-19 crisis. “Such times call for compassion and concern for others. Hyderabad city police are there to protect citizens in all possible ways,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/freezer-box-rents-numb-kin-as-private-players-make-a-killing/articleshow/82395594.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Nagpur||Vax may resume today with fresh supply of doses||Nagpur: After being affected for six days, Covid-19 vaccination for 45-plus age group is likely to resume from second half in the city on Wednesday. The state government gave 1,67,700 doses for six districts of Nagpur division on Tuesday which will arrive in city on Wednesday morning. In last six days, of total 142 Covid Vaccination Centres (CVC) of Covishield, only in two centres were serving 18-44 year age group while remaining were closed. The city’s average daily coverage was over 8,000. In Chandrapur district, not a single person from 45-plus age group could get vaccinated for want of doses on Tuesday. The situation was more or less same in five districts of Amravati division. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “Covishield inoculation will resume on Wednesday only if the civic body gets the doses.” Vaccination continued at three CVCs of Covaxin- two at GMCH Nagpur and NMC’s Mahal Diagnostic Centre— on Tuesday. The same will continue on Wednesday. NMC had received 3,000 doses of Covaxin from Bhandara district three days ago. The central government is supposed to supply doses of Covishield and Covaxin for healthcare workers (HCW), frontline workers (FLW) and people above 45 years of age. No supply came in over ten days hitting vaccination programme badly. The state government on Tuesday received doses from the Centre. Accordingly, the state allocated 99,700 doses of Covishield and 68,000 doses of Covaxin for six districts of Nagpur division. An official from the office of deputy director of health services told TOI, “Vehicle reached Aurangabad on Tuesday and collected the doses. It will arrive around 10am on Wednesday in the city and doses will be distributed to six districts including to NMC.” NMC is likely to resume vaccination at a majority of CVCs being operated in its own and government-run hospitals in second half on Wednesday. NMC also continued inoculation for 18-44 years age group at three CVCs—Indira Gandhi Rugnayala (IGR), Isolation and Pachpaoli Hospitals. 700 people took the jab at these places on Tuesday. The inoculation of this age group is limited only to three CVCs due to shortage of doses. But it has continued as the state had supplied 6,000 doses specially for this age group. The centre had given responsibility of procuring doses for this age group to the state. Over 10 lakh people from the city are estimated to be eligible in this age group. Due to limited CVCs, many people are unable to get appointment online and are eagerly awaiting the jab. The state on Tuesday announced it had placed order for 18 lakh doses for youngsters. If fresh stock arrives, NMC will be able to increase CVCs and cover more people. Advocate Pruthu Abhayankar told TOI, “People, especially those due for second dose, are in dilemma due to lack of doses at CVCs. Centre should not have started inoculation of 18-44 years age group if production was less. 45-plus people who are more vulnerable could have received their second dose from the stock being given for 18-44 years. Vaccination of 18-44 years should have been started after ensuring sufficient stock.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-may-resume-today-with-fresh-supply-of-doses/articleshow/82394530.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Winning as an independent candidate with a margin of 5000 votes, Rajni has been elected from ward no. 6 of Baghera village, falling under Chirgaon block of the district. Talking to mediapersons on Tuesday after receiving her certificate, she said that her priorities include education for girls in her village. “I want to work more for women in my area, especially for their education and check atrocities against them.

---||Kochi||Kerala: New cabinet members to take oath only after May 18||KOCHI: The swearing in ceremony of the new members of Kerala legislative assembly will be held only after May 18. The CPM state secretariat which met on Tuesday decided to complete all discussions and procedures for the formation of the government by that time. According to party leaders, no discussions regarding party representatives in the cabinet were held at the secretariat meeting. “It will be after discussions in LDF that the constituent parties will be deciding on their ministers. The LDF meeting will be held on May 17. All the constituent parties will hold their meetings by then. The CPM state secretariat will meet on May 18. The swearing in ceremony will be held only after that,” CPM state secretary A Vijayaraghavan said. However, it is learnt that there will be a blend of experienced hands as well as new faces in the new cabinet. Informal discussions have already been held in the CPM for handpicking new ministers. The party state secretariat member P Rajeev is being considered for finance portfolio while central committee member M V Govindan may get industries or local self-government. K K Shailaja, who emerged winner with more than 60,000 votes, may retain health portfolio. In the absence of Mercykkutty Amma, P P Chitharanjan may be the minister for fisheries. Veena George or M B Rajesh may be given education portfolio. As the strength of the legislative assembly is 140, the maximum number of ministers shouldn’t exceed 21. “Representatives of two new constituents such as Kerala Congress (M) and Loktantrik Janata Dal will have to be included. Similarly, there are demands for including K B Ganesh Kumar and Antony Raju in the cabinet. So, seat sharing will be a difficult task. CPM will be holding discussions with leaders of other constituents. The LDF meeting will finalize the number of cabinet berths and portfolios to each constituent,” a CPM leader said. CPM leadership has to walk a tightrope to accommodate former ministers like M M Mani, A C Moideen, Kadakampally Surendran and K T Jaleel. V Sivankutty won the prestigious fight from Nemom, CITU leader Nandakumar from Ponnani and Kanathil Jameela from Koyilandy are also on the list of probable ministers. Former revenue minister E Chandrasekharan, J Chinchu Rani, P S Supal and Prasad may represent CPI in the cabinet. Mathew T Thomas or K Krishnankutty from Janata Dal, Roshy Augustine or N Jayaraj of KC(M) may also get cabinet berth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/new-cabinet-members-to-take-oath-only-after-may-18/articleshow/82393677.cms||---

While there was a 12 paise rise in petrol price, from Rs 96.83 a litre to Rs 96.95, diesel went up by 17 paise, which is from Rs 87.81 to Rs 87.98 per litre across all city pumps. Transporters fear that if the price of diesel continues to increase, it could escalate the freight charges and eventually the prices of essential and non-essential goods may increase. They said that during the election period in other states, the prices were “well under control” for nearly two months. The last hike was on February 27, after which there was a lull for 24 days. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-2-months-petrol-diesel-prices-rise-again/articleshow/82395608.cms||Somit Sen
---||Coimbatore||Reconstruct damaged bridge, Lingapuram residents tell officials||Coimbatore: Pressure is mounting on the district administration to take immediate steps to reconstruct the bridge connecting Lingapuram with five other villages in Mettupalayam taluk on the outskirts of the city. The bridge, which submerges every monsoon when the water level in Gandhaiyaaru river increases, was damaged on both ends recently. Whenever the river is in full spate, local residents are forced to either use coracle or alternative route through forest. Gandhavayal, Mokkamedu, Alur, Melur and Ulliyur villages, which together house more than 300 families, also get cut off from the remaining areas. M Ammasaikutti, a farmer from Lingapuram, said officials hadn’t paid heed to their demands to increase the height of the bridge, which the former had fixed at 30ft, when it was constructed in 2005. “The bridge had submerged on the inauguration day eve itself. It was again submerged almost 12 years later in August 2018. Since then, the situation has been the same every southwest monsoon. The bridge will remain submerged for five to six months, depending on the intensity of rainfall.” The residents had increased the height of approach roads to the bridge in 2016 by sharing the cost among themselves. “When the water receded a few months ago, we found that the bridge has been damaged in the area where it ends and the road begins. It will be helpful if the officials take necessary steps to reconstruct the bridge at the earliest,” Ammasaikutti said. When contacted, an official with the north revenue division said they had already submitted a proposal to the state government to increase the height of the bridge and initiate work when the water level drops. “Presently, the water level is just a few feet below the bridge.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/reconstruct-damaged-bridge-lingapuram-residents-tell-officials/articleshow/82394592.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Milkman becomes ‘pad man’, provides free sanitary napkins||JAIPUR: A milkman in Hanumangarh has taken it upon himself to single-handedly ensure that girls do not miss school due to menstrual cycle. He has been distributing free sanitary napkins not only in the district but also in adjoining states like Haryana and Punjab for over a year. Since January last year, Rajesh Suthar has distributed around 12,000 sanitary napkins, an initiative which started before the pandemic and is continuing even now. Travelling almost 100 kilometres on a daily basis, Suthar goes to slums and small rural colonies where he gives the sanitary napkins to all women under 40 years of age. Girls who have benefitted from this said that they stopped missing out on school. Now, the milkman is lending a helping hand in arranging oxygen as well as medicines for Covid patients. Talking about the start of the initiative, 33-year-old Suthar who hails from Nathwana village in Hanumangarh, told TOI, "once when I was returning home two girls who were known to me asked me to drop them home while school was still going on. Initially, I could not understand but then one of the girls hinted that her friend was menstruating and her clothes were stained. After this episode, I realised that even in today's day and age, girls and women are not getting access to hygiene so I took it up upon myself to make sanitary napkins available to them." For the first few months, Suthar sponsored all the sanitary napkins and gradually when his work started getting noticed on social media, people from abroad started sending him consignments of the same. "At times people send packages of sanitary napkins ordered online or money to buy them. We ensure that these persons get to know how their donation is helping. In the beginning, there was hesitation on the part of the women but gradually they understood the importance of basic hygiene. Even my mother and wife are supportive of this. Now along with the milk, I also take packages of sanitary pads," he added. Hundreds of girls and women have benefitted from this initiative and 19-year-old Jyoti Gurjar who stays in Hanumangarh’ Sangaria said, "I and my two sisters would use cloth during menstruation and skip going to school. Although, sanitary napkins were available in shops we could not go to buy them alone so when Suthar started giving the free napkins to my aunt, she would get them for us. We have been receiving them for many months now. Not only does it feel more comfortable but now there is no reason to miss school or college."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/milkman-becomes-pad-man-provides-free-sanitary-napkins/articleshow/82394572.cms||---

A predictive modelling study prepared by Goa Medical College’s department for preventive and social medicine shows that Covid-19 cases continue to remain on the rise with the number of high risk areas increasing. The study, which has been submitted to the government, indicates that more and more residents from Querim, Dhargalim, Pernem, Siridao, Aldona, Khandepar, Dodamarg, Cudnem, Priol, Agonda, and Xeldem have started displaying symptoms of Covid-19. “These are very high-risk and high risk areas that need immediate scrutiny,” the report prepared by GMC said. The study is based on composite data obtained from confirmed Covid-19 cases, probable cases who have come for testing and suspect cases based on those who updated their symptoms on the Arogya Setu app. Head of department for preventive and social medicine Dr Jagadish A Cacodcar along with Dr Nitin Y Dhupdale and Dr Dhanya Jose prepared the Arogya Setu analysis surveillance report and analysed the data which is then submitted to the state government. The report shows that high risk hotspots jumped from 169 on May 1 to 192 on May 3 and subsequently to 206. Calangute continues to show the highest risk in North Goa with Bicholim, Bambolim, St Inez and Porvorim taking up the remaining top five positions. Down South, Fatorda is the top hotspot for Covid followed by Curchorem, Cortalim, Gogol and Nagoa. Bicholim industrial estate has emerged as a hotspot, with sources suggesting that several industrial workers have contracted the virus. Interestingly, with the number of domestic tourists falling drastically, the North Goa coastal belt has dropped from the list of very high risk areas. In the last week of April, a similar report had identified Baga, Calangute and Anjuna as among the top hotspots in Goa. Sharing the findings of the report, health minister Vishwajit Rane said that adequate measures are being taken up to control the spread of the novel coronavirus and to also aid the decision-making process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gmcs-study-finds-high-risk-areas-in-goas-hinterland/articleshow/82395609.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||After SC order, unaided schools in Goa rule out fee cut||PANAJI: The All Goa Government Recognised Unaided Schools’ Association (AGGRUSA) on Tuesday hailed the Supreme Court verdict stating that the judgment upholds the autonomy of private schools and that parents are bound to pay the full fees during the pandemic as well. The association said that Monday’s Supreme Court order also amounts to squashing of the preceding judgments by different high courts across the country, which had allowed up to 30% cut in private school fees as relief for parents during the pandemic. “It is a good judgment and in favour of private schools as it clearly states that state government cannot interfere with the autonomy of private schools and that full fees should be charged and paid, though it does ask schools to take a soft view on parents during the pandemic,” said Deepak Khaitan, founder president of AGGRUSA. Many parents of students studying in private unaided schools in Goa had held demonstrations last year demanding a concession in the fees as classes are now being held online during the pandemic. The parents had also said that their income is affected due to the pandemic and therefore schools should offer concessions. The court verdict states that no provision in the Disaster Management Act allows states to order private schools to curtail the fees during a pandemic. Khaitan said private unaided schools in Goa have already offered parents the option to pay the fees in installments as a concession, while some have done away with charges like activity fees. He said the Supreme Court judgment states that state government cannot transcend the line of regulation and impinge upon the autonomy of the school under the guise of exercising powers to fix ‘just’ school fees. The judgment was passed in a matter pertaining to private unaided schools in Rajasthan. Khaitan said that as state governments have understood the adverse effects a total lockdown can have on the economy, the same economic impact is not expected on individual or parent incomes during the second wave of the pandemic as seen during the total lockdown last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-sc-order-unaided-schools-rule-out-fee-cut/articleshow/82401264.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

While the government of India has been funding the vaccination drive of citizens above the age of 45, the state government will have to pay vaccine manufacturers for doses to inoculate persons between the ages of 18 and 45. According to government sources, there are about 3.25 crore citizens between the ages of 18 and 45 in Gujarat. With each citizens requiring to be administered two vaccine doses, there is requirement of 6.50 crore doses of the vaccine for this age group. The state government has placed orders of 2.50 crore doses with two Indian vaccine manufacturers. While an order of two crore doses has been placed with Pune-based Serum Institute of India, an order of 50 lakh doses of the vaccine manufactured by Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad, has also been placed. “Serum Institute is charging Rs 300 per dose, while one dose of Bharat Biotech vaccine is priced at Rs 400. The state government has placed orders for vaccine doses worth Rs 800 crore — Rs 600 crore for SII vaccine doses and Rs 200 crore for Bharat Biotech vaccine doses,” sources said. Sources added, “The government is paying advance to both the companies in proportion to the decided delivery schedule. For a total of 6.50 crore estimated doses, the state government will have to spend anywhere between Rs 2,000 crore to Rs 2,200 crore.” Having already placed orders for 2.50 crore doses, the state government has begun talks with GOI-approved foreign and Indian vaccine suppliers. “We will place orders with those companies who will offer vaccine doses at cheapest rates. Our priority will be to procure reliable vaccines from companies who can supply them at the earliest,” sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-to-spend-rs-2k-cr-on-jabs-for-18-44-age-group/articleshow/82395920.cms||Kapil Dave

But municipal officials are keeping their fingers crossed. The reason is that they anticipate a small delay in the distribution of the vials to various vaccination centres. “The vials were to arrive by flight on Tuesday evening but now they will come in the morning on Wednesday,” said a senior AMC official. “We will try our best to cut any delay. The shots will reach the centres.” Ahmedabad has been getting doses for 16K to 18K individuals every day over the past few days. The logistics of delivering the vaccines to various cities is handled by the state government. “One batch did not arrive and we had to pull back the vaccination drive for those who are 45 or above. That’s the major reason why our vaccination count dipped,” said the official. On Tuesday, 14.6K people were vaccinated against more than 22K on Monday. There are 380 vaccination centres and in them there are about 505 vaccination tables; on 427 tables, no vaccination was done. “The abrupt decision to halt the vaccination on Tuesday for those who are 45 or older had made many return home,” said Prakash Talodiya, 55, a musician from Naranpura. He said that he tried to get a slot when there was an update on the Cowin dashboard and managed to get one. “We have to try various vaccination centres. I got my vaccine shot at Vadaj though I belong to Paldi area,” said Naina Shah, a teacher at a private school. “It takes a while before you get lucky,” she added.

Social functions like wedding ceremonies, especially in rural areas or in outskirts of city, have been constantly witnessing such violations. On Tuesday, in such a violation of Covid guidelines, a marriage function was found to have over 100 guests dining and that too with no masks on. Acting as per new guidelines, police slapped a cash penalty of Rs 1 lakh on the host. Police, when raided the spot of celebration on Monday night, was in for surprise with neither the host nor the guests exhibiting an iota of compliance with the guidelines announced by the government. “We charged a fine of Rs 1 lakh as per new directions and dispersed the guests from the spot,” said a police officer from Dangiawas police station. According to him, information was received about a wedding function in the family of one Ramchandra Paliwal in Kakelao village under Dangiawas police station. “We visited the spot for inspection to ensure that the host was holding the function in adherence to the new guidelines for Covid. But we were shocked to see that there were over 100 persons having dinner and hardly anyone was wearing a mask”, said the officer. Police immediately slapped a fine of Rs 1 lakh on the host and dispersed the gathering from the spot. It may be noted that this was the first fine of Rs 1 lakh levied by police in Jodhpur for violation of Covid guidelinesat any marriage function. As per new guideline, the fresh cap for guests in any marriage function is 31 and violation of this condition is subject to a cash penalty of Rs 1 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/police-slap-rs-1-lakh-penalty-for-inviting-100-guests-to-wedding/articleshow/82394588.cms||---

They will have to only inform the tehsildar. Earlier, companies in the hydrocarbon sector had to acquire the land from the owners hampering the speed of exploration. Addressing a review meeting of the petroleum department on Tuesday, additional chief secretary Subodh Agarwal said the norms were changed by the revenue department to fast-track exploration of hydrocarbon resources in the state. Rajasthan contributes 22% of the crude oil produced in the country while Bombay High accounts for 40%. About 1.22 lakh barrels of oil and 4-5 million cubic metre gas are produced in the state. Agarwal said that 14 petroleum exploration leases and 13 mining leases have been awarded in the state which will add further depth to the sector in the state. I n the financial year 2020-21, the royalty revenue from the petroleum production reached to Rs 1904.79 crore against Rs 3320.10 crore in 2019-20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/boost-for-hydrocarbon-exploration-as-companies-can-take-land-on-lease/articleshow/82394594.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||In Mohali, Covid-19 waste mixed with trash, protocol goes for a toss||Mohali: Garbage segregation in Mohali is not being done as per the Covid-19 protocol as the waste collected from households is found mixed with the Covid-19 waste at the garbage collection centres in Mohali. MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg, however, maintained that a list of Covid-19 infected houses is provided to the collection teams and the biomedical waste is being collected separately and sent to biomedical waste incinerator. But it seems that the efforts of the MC garbage collectors go waste after used masks, gloves and other Covid-19 waste from the households of infected patients are dumped at the garbage collection centres. Garg said, “We do get a list of infected houses from the administration which is passed on to the garbage collection teams. The waste from houses of infected patients is ollected separately and sent to biomedical waste incinerator and garbage from other households is dumped at the collection and segregation centre. People do put masks and gloves in normal waste, which is beyond our control due to lack of awareness.” During a check, it was observed that garbage collection teams were collecting waste normally from the households without caring weather the house has a Covid-19 patient or not as there are no markings outside the houses. The same garbage is being dumped at dumping points where sanitation workers segregate the same for composting pits. On the other hand, recouping from the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, the Mohali municipal corporation is now going to re-organise the garbage segregation at source project. “The MC will go strict against residents who do not segregate the garbage at source,” the said MC commissioner. Sources in MC said directions were issued to the officials of the sanitation department for passing notice to residents and warning them to adopt the garbage segregation at source till March 31, following which they would be penalized and garbage would not be lifted if it is not segregated. The MC commissioner said, “It is high time that residents must adopt the garbage segregation at source project. Four teams constituted will first aware residents found violating the norms, but during if they are found violating the norms again, they will have to face a fine of Rs 250. We will add the fine to water bills. We have already given 45 specially-designed carts to garbage collectors.” Also, the Mohali municipal corporation has announced that the garbage dumps will be cleared this year as the MC has allotted tenders worth Rs 4.5 crore for processing of garbage at dumping ground. The announcement was made by mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu alias Jeeti Sidhu after visiting the dumping ground at Phase VIII-B here recently. He said two to three lakh tonne of garbage will be processed within a year. Mayor Jeeti Sidhu said the contractor Eco Stan will process the garbage within a year and convert the area into a plain ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-mohali-covid-19-waste-mixed-with-trash-protocol-goes-for-a-toss/articleshow/82394590.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Chandigarh||SAD asks government to let all shops open, extend business hours||CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Tuesday asked the Congress government to extend timings for opening shops and allow all shops to open keeping in view economic concerns. Former minister Daljit Singh Cheema said the government should take all necessary steps to ensure there was no overcrowding in markets, but it should ensure all shops were allowed to do business in a regulated manner. He asked the government to go by logic, saying: “Directions should not be issued from the farmhouse without taking into consideration the economic wellbeing of the people.” Cheema also made out a strong case for waiving all taxes levied from the transport sector till the Covid situation normalised and the economy limped back to normal. He said the sector was not offered any relief package by the state government. “However, the least the government can do is waive all taxes,” he said. Cheema said schoolbuses had been lying idle for more than a year. He said the same was the case with autos and taxi operators. He said trucks were functioning partly and were already burdened by increase in diesel rates. The SAD leader described the government’s decision on closing procurement in market sub yards as ill-advised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-asks-govt-to-let-all-shops-open-extend-biz-hours/articleshow/82394616.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Massive transfer of employees at Secretariat||Thiruvananthapuram: A day after the LDF government retained power with a huge mandate, a massive shuffle of employees, from the rank of undersecretary to additional secretary, was effected at the Secretariat. As many as 65 employees were transferred by the general administration department on Monday. The order has made five mutual transfers, in addition to transferring several employees to posts within the secretariat as well as those in several organizations outside. Those who have been shunted out of the secretariat have been transferred to organizations like state higher education council, RTI commission, Norka Roots, IMG, minority commission, council for food research and development, commission for backward classes, DHS, directorate of scheduled tribes, Kerala warehousing corporation, MDB, Kerafed, Kerala House in New Delhi, Matsyafed, Kollam fashion technology institute, Natpac, centre for continuing education, higher secondary directorate, youth welfare board, printing directorate and Munnar engineering college. A majority of those who have been transferred are members of pro-UDF associations. “Most of those who have been transferred to offices outside the Secretariat are from pro-UDF employee unions. It is a usual practise followed in such transfer matters to send employees of unions that are not in power to comparatively less-relevant posts or other offices outside the secretariat,” said additional secretary J Bency who is also the president of pro-Congress employee organization Kerala Secretariat Association. Sources at secretariat said that these transfers also ensure promotion for employees at secretariat. “Once an employee is promoted, he is transferred on deputation to an organization outside, so that the person below him is elevated. In most cases, employees of the pro-ruling front are retained in the Secretariat,” said a senior official with the general administration department. Sources added that the order was kept ready during the election period and was issued on May 3, immediately after ensuring that the LDF government has retained power. However, pro-CPM employee unions dismissed mal-intentions in the promotion-transfer order. “There is no politics in the said order for the transfer and promotion of employees. It was issued on May 3 so that it is not delayed till the new cabinet comes, which would mean a wait till May 18. There are four employees who would retire on May 31 who are awaiting promotions, which would mean that if the order is delayed till then, they would get only 10 days in the post. There are employees from both unions in the transfer list,” said additional secretary P Honey, who is also the president of pro-CPM Kerala Secretariat employees’ association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/massive-transfer-of-employees-at-secretariat/articleshow/82393680.cms||KP Saikiran

Officer in charge of Covid-19, Lucknow, Roshan Jacob made this announcement after inspecting the Integrated Covid Command Centre (ICCC) on Tuesday. During inspection, Jacob was surprised to find out that hospitals are not accepting requests of patients whose temporary referral IDs have been created for immediate allocation of beds in hospitals. TOI has been persistently raising the issue that patients are being denied admission to hospitals in the absence of RT-PCR report. “Temporary IDs for immediate hospital allocation should be generated for patients who have CT scan reports or have visible Covid-19 symptoms,” she said. She instructed the CMO to ensure that those patients whose temporary referral IDs have been sent from ICCC to hospitals for immediate admission, the health department makes payment against the service so that hospitals do not create unnecessary hurdle in admission of patients. Other private hospitals can forward bills to CMO office against the treatment of patients referred by ICCC, she said. Currently, 14 Covid hospitals, including public and private facilities, are being paid by health department for treatment of Covid-19 patients. “Under no circumstances hospitals should charge patients referred by ICCC. Legal action will be taken against such hospitals under the Epidemic Act, if even a single penny is charged from patients,” Jacob said. She said all hospitals should share clear data of available isolation, oxygen-supported, HDU and ICU beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rt-pcr-report-no-longer-a-hurdle-for-hosp-admission/articleshow/82395600.cms||---

The PIL filed by Dilip Sawant, assistant section officer at the HC, said the state took a decision on January 28, 2021, to bring court staff under the GR’s purview. Thereafter, he did not find any order or circular extending the GR’s operation beyond December 31, 2020.The petition claimed that the Centre’s original insurance cover scheme is still in force and “it is not known how the state government could effectively close the said scheme”. Also, the state kept the HC “in the dark on the correct status of GR” in the earlier proceedings.The government’s advocate informed that a meeting was held on May 3, and the state is considering extending the GR. Asked by the judges how much time it would take to reach a decision, he replied that it would take some time. “One or two days? One or two months? Say that properly,” said Justice Tated.The petitioner’s advocate Ramesh Ramamurthy argued that the Centre has extended its insurance scheme till March 31, 2022. “This is the fifth month since the [state] government resolution was discontinued. A decision should have been taken by now,’’ he added. The judges posted the matter on Thursday for the state government’s reply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-how-long-to-decide-on-extension-of-rs-50-lakh-cover-for-frontliners/articleshow/82394609.cms||Rosy Sequeira

According to police, Kamlesh Labadiya along with his 22-year-old daughter Krupali are still unconcious and battling for their lives. Cops said Labadiya, a resident of Shivam Park in Nana Mava area of Rajkot, was suffering from depression after being reportedly cheated by two persons whom he had sold his house for Rs 1.2 crore. He purportedly fed his children poison-laced water claiming it to be a medicine that will protect them from Covid-19 infection. Labadiya had also prepared the same drink for his wife Jayshree, but as she was busy in some household work, he consumed it before her. Jayshree lodged a complaint of murder, attempt to murder against her husband with Rajkot taluka police station. Labadiya had also left behind a suicide note blaming Dileep Korat and RD Vora for forcing him take the extreme step. “Dileep Korat and RD Vora are responsible for my death. I am helpless. There is no work due to pandemic conditions. I don’t even have Rs 5,000 at present and there are instalments of car and home loans to be paid,” Labadiya wrote in his suicide note. “Ever since the incident, Korat and Vora have gone incommunicado and their phones have been switched. We are awaiting Labadiya’s statement for further probe as he has not regained consciousness and we want to know the chain of events that led him to take this extreme step,'' police said. Primary probe suggests that Labadiya entered into an agreement with Korat and Vora to sell his house for Rs 1.2 crore as he needed money for marriages of his son and daughter. “It seems that Labadiya was cheated by the accused. The duo reportedly purchased his house but did not give full payment thus forcing Labadiya to take the extreme step,” a police official said. It is reported that the accused claimed that they had paid the full amount to a lawyer who had brokered the deal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rajkot-priest-battling-for-life-booked-for-sons-murder/articleshow/82392912.cms||---

The HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale issued notice on appeals filed by Fr Swamy, and said his plea for regular bail would be heard post the court’s summer vacation. Senior counsel Mihir Desai, appearing for the accused, said the prosecuting agency had raided Fr Swamy’s house in 2018, but chose to do nothing for the next two years and now despite his advanced Parkinson’s disease and precarious health, has arrested him and placed him in the prison’s medical facility since. “He is unable to stand properly or do daily chores without help, and every day his health is deteriorating,” said Desai, seeking interim medical bail for Fr Swamy. In an FIR originally filed by Pune’s Vishrambaug police station in January 2018, following the Elgar Parishad, Swamy was booked under the UAPA, and several sections of the IPC, including waging war against government of India. Sandesh Patil, counsel for NIA, sought time to file a reply saying a supplementary chargesheet has been filed against Fr Swamy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-to-hear-swamys-bail-plea-seeks-med-report/articleshow/82395660.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Citizens complain of scarce vax centres||Ahmedabad: On Tuesday, Gujarat crossed 1 crore mark for the first dose of vaccination, whereas cumulative doses reached 1.27 crore. In total vaccination numbers, Gujarat is third in India behind Maharashtra (1.6 crore doses) and Rajasthan (1.3 crore doses). The queue for first dose of vaccine at Nava Vadaj on TuesdayThe landmark is achieved when the fourth phase of immunization has started off in the state from May 1 covering population in 18 to 44 years age bracket. For the past few days, the citizens – both below and above 45 years of age – complain about finding it increasingly difficult to get themselves vaccinated. Dr Nayan Jani, state immunization officer, said that the number of vaccination centres is the same, but the sessions are divided. “Those centres vaccinating 18-44 years would only vaccinate that group, and vice versa. It’s a technical issue as currently both the groups follow different norms – the fourth phase allows only those registered online to get vaccinated, whereas the beneficiaries of third phase can opt for both walk-ins and online registration,” said Dr Jani, adding that the inventory for both the phases is also maintained differently. He said that there’s no dearth of vaccine, and it’s not the reason of the plateau in daily vaccination numbers. Sources close to the development said that the state has over six lakh shots, which can last for about five days, given the current pace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/citizens-complain-of-scarce-vax-centres/articleshow/82395637.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Param Bir Singh, Waze made serious, unpardonable mistakes: Ex-HM Deshmukh||Nagpur: Former home minister Anil Deshmukh on Tuesday levelled fresh allegations against ex-Mumbai CP Param Bir Singh and suspended assistant police inspector (API) Sachin Waze, saying the two had committed grave, unpardonable mistakes in the case relating to gelatin sticks found in a car outside Ambani residence ‘Antilia’ and murder of Mansukh Hiren. The senior NCP politician was in Nagpur for a two-day tour. Deshmukh said he had to remove Singh as Mumbai CP after Waze and his dubious roles started coming to fore in the Antilia and Hiren murder case. “If Singh wanted to make allegations against me, then why did he not say so when he was Mumbai CP? Singh started levelling allegations against me after I removed him as Mumbai CP,” said Deshmukh. “Singh was also angry as I had taken away the two probes from under his supervision and given them to ATS (State Anti-terrorist squad),” said the former home minister, who is scheduled to visit Katol and Narkhed on Wednesday. “The two cases are now being professionally probed by the NIA (National Investigation Agency), and the suspicious roles of Singh and Waze would come to fore,” he said. Singh had alleged Deshmukh was trying to extort Rs100 crore through policemen, and also interfered in the suicide of a Gujarat-based politician in Mumbai. Deshmukh, while talking to scribes at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar international airport in Nagpur, said everyday fresh allegations of corruption and malpractice are surfacing against ex-Mumbai CP Singh. “Some police personnel like Ghadge (Bhimrao) and Dange (Anup) had filed complaints against Singh. Some businessmen like Ketan Tanna and Sonu Jalan too have come forward to lodge complaints against Singh for having extorted money from them,” said the former HM. Deshmukh said he had approached the Bombay high court seeking justice in view of the allegations made against him in the FIR filed by CBI last month. “There had not been a single allegation against me in my entire career of 30 years in politics. Hence, I have now approached the judiciary for justice,” said Deshmukh. In the past, Singh’s petition, along with a PIL before the Bombay high court, had paved way for a FIR by CBI against Deshmukh, whose residence-cum-office in Nagpur was also searched. In the meantime, police inspector Ghadge’s complaint led to a FIR against Singh for implicating him in a fake case. Dange too had lodged a complaint against Singh for having links to the underworld.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/param-bir-singh-waze-made-serious-unpardonable-mistakes-ex-hm-deshmukh/articleshow/82394621.cms||Soumitra Bose

A 100-year-old sadhvi of the Jain community, Piyush Varsha Shreeji Maharajsaheb, passed away on Monday due to old age at Rameshwaram apartment near G D Goenka School in Vesu. When the mortal remains were being taken in a procession, a stray dog started walking alongside the palanquin, with dogged determination. For, when people started noticing it and even tried to physically remove the dog from the path, it did not protest, but came back again to its original position. It walked all the way to the Umra crematorium — a distance of around 5 km. Story doesn’t end there. It waited patiently till the cremation was over and didn’t protest when it was brought back in a car to Vesu. Not once did it bark or even disturb anyone, onlookers said. “We were shocked and surprised to see the dog join the procession. It started walking under the palanquin. We lifted it twice and put it away from the procession, but found it to be back in the same position as soon as we started walking,” said Pritesh Shah, a volunteer in Palkhi Group that assists in taking out the cremation procession of Jain monks in the city. Devotees claimed that the dog did not react as protest when it was picked up and cast aside twice. Nor did it disturb the rituals in the crematorium and even silently accompanied them back home in a car. A devotee of the Sadhviji, Sanjay Mehta, told TOI, “I have participated in several cremation processions of sadhvis and monks but never seen such a love of some animal." Sadhviji, who had renounced the materialistic world around 39 years ago, was staying at the apartment for the past two months and daily went out to the nearby derasar for prayers. She had been residing in the city for over one-and-a-half years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/dog-accompanies-cremation-procession-of-sadhvi/articleshow/82393743.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

It also reported over 2,814 fresh cases, taking the state’s total Covid-19 cases past the 1 lakh mark. In just four days of May, the state has seen 176 deaths. Ten of Tuesday’s mortalities had no comorbidities. Four — all below 65 — were brought dead, the youngest all of 38. Eleven died within 24 hours. A senior doctor advised people to immediately self-isolate and get tested even if they have Covid-19 symptoms for just one day. “Even if one has low-grade fever or a slight cough or any upper respiratory infection, it is Covid unless proved otherwise. Don’t neglect cough, body ache, headache, fever. Go get tested immediately. If symptomatic, test on antigen,” the doctor said, advising those who test negative on antigen with symptoms and strong suspicion that it could be Covid, to go for an RT-PCR test and isolate. “This is a very strong wave, and it’s better that positives are picked up immediately. The contacts must test as soon as they turn symptomatic, or wait for four to five days before they do the test,” the doctor said, also advising those who get a second bout of fever while on home isolation or find their oxygen saturation falling to seek medical help as soon as possible. The doctor also appealed to people to get vaccinated as soon as possible, stating that the adverse effects of immunisation (AEFIs) are very low, and that thousands of people around the world have taken the vaccine. Twenty-eight of the deaths over the past 24 hours took place at GMC, 14 at South Goa district hospital, two at north Goa district hospital, two at Balli primary health centre and a private hospital in Margao, and one each at sub-district hospital Chicalim, community health centre, Curchorem, primary health centre Loutolim, and ESI hospital. Citizens continued to search for hospital beds in desperation, with the government’s online link to bed availability ceasing to function two days after it was launched. While on Monday, citizens trying the link found a ‘Work in Progress’ message, on Tuesday they were left with ‘Some error occurred while processing your request’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-sees-52-more-deaths-2-8k-new-cases/articleshow/82395727.cms||---

With this, the cumulative count of the cases has gone up toThe latest data, posted by Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Flu Data (GISAID) on the variants of novel coronavirus in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka, shows that B.1.617 represented in about 50% cases registered during March, while B.1.1.7 showed up in about 10% cases. The percentage of N440K came down to less than 10% from the peak of about 70% in February. At the same time, the presence of B.1 lineage went up to around 10 or 12% during March. Major variants like B.1.1.7, B.1 and N440K were also noticed in significant numbers. Other variants in circulation since March 2020 made up 10%. Coronavirus: Live updatesCommenting on the decline of N440K variant in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, former CCMB director Dr Rakesh Kumar Mishra said: “The N440K variant is diminishing and likely to disappear soon”. Divya Tej Sowpati, CCMB senior scientist, who specialises in genome sequencing, told TOI that the variant B.1.617 was found in around 50% cases in southern states as per the recent data from AP, Telangana and Karnataka, while B.1.1.7 was mostly predominant in Kerala, logging around 30% cases there. “Lineages with N440K are not the dominant ones in the second wave of Covid-19 in India. While N440K was indeed mutation of concern in south India during and after the first wave, current data shows it is essentially replaced by B.1.617 and B.1.1.7 variants,” Divya Tej said. He said when comparing the data from Maharashtra, one can see that the increase in B.1.617 was observed in February itself, and again a reduction in N440K. “This coincides well with the second wave seen in the respective states. In Maharashtra, the second wave started almost a month and a half earlier compared to the four southern states, along with the explosion of B.1.617 at the expense of N440K,” Divya Tej said Referring to the study that N440K was 10 times more infectious than its parent strain, he said it is important to remember that just because a variant behaves a certain way in cell cultures (with no competition, and in controlled settings), it does not mean it would behave the same way in humans, or in a complicated pandemic scenario.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-50-cases-t-ap-reeling-under-maha-covid-19-variant/articleshow/82395717.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Students from IIM, RMLNLU turn saviors for patients fighting Covid||LUCKNOW: As people struggle to find authentic information about Covid hospitals and medication, students of Dr Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University (RMLNLU) and Indian Institute of Management-Lucknow (IIM-L) have come forward to help people. Around 80 students of the law university have started a 'Covid' relief campaign in which they provide information to people about where in the city they can get oxygen cylinders and where it can be refilled. They also help people in getting ambulances and beds in Covid hospitals as well as the medication prescribed by the chief medical officer and also about plasma donors available in the city. "Members of our legal aid clinic as well as members of the alumni association are providing required information to the distressed people from 9 am to 11 pm. We verify information about the availability of medical facilities through our sources, ask for help on behalf of people on Twitter and various social media platforms and are also in contact with hospitals to help people," said BA LLB student Ravi Shankar Pandey, who is also a volunteer in the team. He said that “our toll-free helpline number is 08047092314 on which people can call and take help.” Similarly, Amrita Singh, a student of a postgraduate programme in management for working executives at the IIM-L has developed a website to assimilate all Covid related information at a place. Singh came up with an idea of a centralized platform that provides easy access to people. “One needs to click at compiledcovidresources.carrd.co. and can get authentic information." "There is so much information flowing on the internet and on various social media platforms that at times people struggle to find the authentic helpline numbers. Hence to end this chaos I have collected all helpful Covid webpages links, people and contacts and have placed them on a single website" said Amrita. She said all her social media accounts were flooded with the information on Covid. “As people cannot find which number is working or which is not I decided to put relevant and helpful information at one place. The website is divided into two parts. The first part, titled 'Government initiative', has information and links about Covid related help provided by the government as the list of NGOs providing relief, information on vaccination, links of UP government website to track bed availability in city Covid hospitals,” she added. The second part of the website is 'Citizen-led initiative' that provides information about plasma donors, meal providers for Covid infected people and a lot more, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/students-from-iim-rmlnlu-turn-saviours-for-patients-fighting-covid/articleshow/82395689.cms||Mohita Tewari

Tanavade added that the health portfolio would remain with Vishwajit RaneTanavade told TOI, “In this pandemic, MLAs should not discuss this issue in public, instead they should focus on the Covid crisis.” He has also ruled out any cabinet reshuffle at this point of time. With less than a year to go for the assembly polls in Goa, Monserrate had called on chief minister on Monday demanding a cabinet reshuffle. He told Sawant that many from the cabinet have not been taking decisions in the interest of the state, and that “BJP cannot face the next assembly elections” with some of them. Monserrate had suggested that Sawant give transport minister Mauvin Godinho bigger responsibilities going by the latter’s decision-making abilities and handling of issues like the taxi agitation. The Panaji MLA had also said that while all the ministers worked together during the first Covid-19 wave, the second wave has exposed a grave lack of coordination.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Mullappally not to quit, puts onus on AICC||Thiruvananthapuram: KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran has decided not to resign and has urged the AICC to take a decision in this matter. Ramachandran is upset that he is being blamed for the poll debacle and that all group managers are targeting him. He had a discussion with senior leaders Ramesh Chennithala and Oommen Chandy and told them that he will not resign unless the party high command asks him to do so. Irrespective of group affiliations, party leaders are now pointing a finger at the KPCC president for the party’s biggest defeat. Ramachandran has convened the political affairs committee of the KPCC on May 7 to discuss this poll debacle. He is waiting to see whether there will be a demand for his ouster at this meeting. He has already told leaders close to him that he alone cannot be held responsible for UDF’s defeat in assembly elections. Moreover, he was not given credit when the party had won 19 seats in Lok Sabha elections under his leadership. Then why only he should shoulder the responsibility for the party’s defeat, he asked the leaders close to him. Though there was a demand for the removal of Chennithala also from the opposition leader’s post, the ‘I’ group is not supporting this move. Group leaders are of the view that Ramesh was an ‘excellent’ opposition leader and he did not get enough support from the party for all allegations he had raised during his tenure. Both ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups are still adamant that their leaders should be accommodated in plum posts and are not ready to make changes in the party, which could upset their leaders. K Muraleedharan, who lost the elections in Nemom, also met Ramachandran, Chennithala and Chandy on Tuesday. He is learnt to have told the party leaders that a change in the party leadership is not the apt solution for the crisis faced by the party. It is also interesting to note that KPCC general secretaries, who received their posts through group sharing, have now started blaming the groups for the party’s defeat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/mullappally-not-to-quit-puts-onus-on-aicc/articleshow/82393772.cms||---

Deceased was identified as Jaysukh Vadodariya, a resident of Udaynagar near Mavdi chokdi of Rajkot city who worked as a carpenter. Deceased has left behind a suicide note addressing the city police commissioner and blaming his wife and two sons for his extreme step. He requested the police commissioner to book his elder son Sumit and be sentenced life imprisonment for all the harassment he had meted out to his father. Police sources said that Vadodariya allegedly took his life reportedly due to the domestic torture by his two sons, Sumit and Viral, along with his wife Jayshree owing to the her extramarital affair with a person identified as Meru. “Sumit had been beating me up for the past three days and I was not given meals,” deceased’s note reads. Addressing his wife, the deceased wrote that she should now stay with Meru and enjoy life with him. “Two days ago, deceased had assaulted his wife over some domestic issue and the wife had lodged a complaint with police where she had alleged that her husband assaulted her with scissors in drunken stupor.

Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who was scheduled to arrive in the state on Tuesday as a parliamentary board observer tasked to get feedback on the contenders, postponed his trip at the last moment. Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who is seen as a potential CM-in-waiting, said the "whole process of government formation" had been delayed by the "unexpected situation" in Bengal. "Our national president JP Nadda is currently in Bengal to take stock of the situation. After he returns to New Delhi, the parliamentary board will sit." Sarma clarified that any such delay didn't mean that government formation had been left "hanging" since the election results were declared completely only on Monday. State BJP chief Ranjeet Kumar Dass said the parliamentary board could meet late Tuesday while the observer would arrive on Wednesday to take the process forward. Dass denied there was any conflict within the party on its choice of CM. "It is a settled matter that one among the two leaders (incumbent Sarbananda Sonowal and Sarma) will become the chief minister," he said. If Sonowal is retained, he will become the first non-Congress CM for two consecutive terms. In the event of Sarma making the cut, he will become the third ex-Aasu leader to get the CM post and the second one after Sonowal to be chosen for the post after crossing over from another party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengal-violence-delays-bjp-meet-on-new-assam-cm/articleshow/82396862.cms||Prabin Kalita

Senior crisis management team members at the city oxygen helpline for Ahmedabad claim that most hospitals are carrying large number of cylinders for refilling which is only increasing the replacement time. The crisis management team (CMT) involving Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), state FDCA and Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) found that in the absence of a proper stock of cylinders in circulation, the daily oxygen requirement is hard to be met. Every day there is a oxygen requirement of anywhere between 270 to 280 metric tonnes and against that the supply has been only 250 metric tonne. “Despite repeated appeals to hospitals with more than 50 beds to take at least one-third of their empty cylinders to refillers, many hospitals engage in knee jerk reaction when two-third cylinders are empty. It is then they give us a distress call,” says a senior CMT member. The second reason they found was that if a hospital has a cylinder stock for 20 patients, there are sometimes 35 oxygen beds at the hospital. “Frantic calls like ‘patient about to die’ are made and the CMT is caught completely off-guard,” adds the member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/quick-refilling-by-hospitals-can-ease-o2-crisis/articleshow/82395892.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Take the jabs, get full tax waiver in this Kutch village||RAJKOT: While big cities are choking under Covid’s deadly grip, hamlets are showing better resilience while staving off the killer virus or even by fighting it off. Mota Angiya, a village of Kutch district, is proving to be a clear example in how to handle the pandemic. While it has four active cases, the village has armed itself in advance to defeat advances of the contagion. The village, located just 5km off Nakhatrana taluka, has announced 100% panchayat tax waiver for the financial year 2021-22 for those families in which all the adult members have taken two shots of the Covid vaccine. It has also completed its target of 60% vaccination of the first dose for people above 45 years of age. Panchayat tax includes charges for water, property, sanitation, and also for street lights which comes to a total of around Rs 700 annually per family. Sarpanch Iqbal Ghanchi told TOI, “We have made advanced planning for the next three months to give a good fight to Covid in case more people get infected. Already a half-day voluntary lockdown is in place to curb spread of the virus.” The village made a team of youths in every ward who will help senior citizens above 55 years of age in getting sufficient stock of medicines. Patients will be given a mobile number on which they have to send the prescription for the medicines to be procured from Nakhatrana or Bhuj town. They have also made a plan to provide tiffin service to the infected people and for that a kitchen has already been made operational in a primary school of the village. The panchayat is bearing the entire cost without asking for donations. The village will also start a Covid care centre (CCC). “Looking at the shortage of beds in city hospitals, we will create a 15-bed CCC in the next two days which will be operated by primary health centre staff. The villagers will then not have to travel to talukas for treating illnesses.” Ghanchi added. The panchayat also sanitizes the village at regular intervals and if anybody calls to sanitize their home, the panchayat readily provides the facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/take-the-jabs-get-full-tax-waiver-in-this-kutch-village/articleshow/82393785.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Jaipur||Jaipur Municipal Corporation fails to dispose of biomedical waste safely||JAIPUR: The Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) has failed to dispose of biomedical waste in safe manner produced by the Covid-19 positive patients who are under home quarantine. With the number of Covid-19 infections rising over the past several weeks, the city is facing a massive surge in biomedical waste and many residents are staying at home. However, in absence of strategy, threat of spreading infection in the city colonies looms large. With no JMC facility available to collect biomedical waste generated by patients in home isolation, many are disposing of the waste in door-to-door garbage collection van. This improper and irresponsible disposal of Covid waste is not only endangering other citizens, but also garbage collectors. A senior official at Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) said, “A firm is only hired to collect biomedical waste from the primary health care centres and hospitals. People who want to dispose of their biomedical waste safely can collect and dump it in nearby PHC.” The JMC claims that directions have been issued to the citizens to collect the patients biomedical waste including protective gear, masks, gloves and syringes in separate paper bags and keep it bag before throwing it in garbage collecting vehicles. Environmentalist Dau Lal Bohra said, “People need to be told how to dispose of waste if they are Covid positive. I feel the government should ideally run advertisements using smart city funds and others about segregating biomedical waste. By not doing this, we are putting all sanitation workers and neighbours at risk.” The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) guidelines last year directed state governments to handle Covid-19 samples with care and dispose the biomedical wastes diligently in order to not let the pathogens spread and transmit diseases. It was stated for management of Covid-19 biomedical waste says garbage from patients’ houses must be collected daily, in colour-coded and sealed bags, to prevent any spread of infection. Household biomedical waste must be put in yellow bags. Moreover, for biowaste collection, the contractor must deploy separate red colour boxes as it would easily segregate waste after collection. The residents, however, alleged that the JMC has failed to provide regular garbage collection facility during Covid times. Rama Jain, a resident of Tilak Nagar, said, “The vehicle comes once in two days. Due to this, many plot owners throw their waste on roads and heaps of garbage can be witnessed in many lanes of the colonies. Installing colour coded bins appears to be a far-fetched thing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-fails-to-dispose-of-biomedical-waste-safely/articleshow/82394666.cms||---

It is our appeal to the aided schools to ask for transfer or leaving certificates before admitting a new student. We want that the parents should pay at least some part of the fees and take the leaving certificate,” said Khaitan. Many smaller unaided schools have claimed that they are on the verge of shutting down as many parents have been unable to pay the fees post the pandemic. Schools state that many are withdrawing their students, even though concession to pay fees in installments on a monthly basis has already been provided to parents. “Many parents have not paid the fees, but the child has attended all classes and answered all the exams and completed the year. Now the parents are asking for transfer certificates to be sent through email so that they do not have to face the school,” said Khaitan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aided-schools-asked-to-seek-leaving-certificate-before-admitting-students/articleshow/82394663.cms||---

On Tuesday, Krishnadas said the failure of NDA candidates in Nemom, Manjeswaram and Palakkad was only because of the understanding between Congress and CPM. “Pinarayi Vijayan had struck a deal directly with Congress leaders to ensure the defeat of NDA candidate Kummanam Rajasekharan in Nemom. Similar CPM-Congress alliance worked against E Sreedharan in Palakkad and K Surendran in Manjeswaram. Pinarayi Vijayan should clarify his stand on these deals and vote trades,” he alleged. Krishnadas claimed that CPM leader AK Balan played the dealer’s role in Palakkad. “CPM central committee member Balan had said that he would love to see Shafi Parambil win Palakkad. KPCC chief Mullappally Ramachandran had openly solicited CPM’s support for UDF candidate in Manjeswaram. K Muraleedharan contested in Nemom to fulfil Vijayan’s agenda to close BJP’s account in Kerala,” he alleged. In Palakkad and Manjeswaram, LDF did not get the votes it received in 2016. Compared to 2016, LDF votes fell by 2,196 in Manjeswaram. Its votes came down by 2,242 in Palakkad. “LDF votes came down only in Manjeswaram. Similarly, it got lesser number of votes only in Palakkad. LDF improved its votes in all other 11 assembly seats in Palakkad,” he said. Krishnadas accused CPM of having struck alliance with ultra-Muslim organizations and said ‘CPM-Jihadi’ alliance helped LDF to retain power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/krishnadas-alleges-cpm-cong-deals-in-three-seats/articleshow/82393781.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Govt steps up usage audit||Ahmedabad: The state government has recently started an external oxygen audit of many large private hospitals and government-run hospitals in the state to ensure that there is no wastage. It wants any leakage to be plugged. The move has been spurred by the demand-and-supply gap for oxygen in the wake of the massive spike in Covid-19 cases from April. “Oxygen use has gone up steeply of late. To double-check and ensure judicious use of oxygen and to rationalize its usage, we have begun audits at large hospitals in the state,” said a senior government official. He said that this practice will be extended to clinics and other centres that are treating Covid-19 patients. The use of oxygen was found to be higher in government hospitals as compared to the private ones, said sources aware of the matter. “It was found that in some cases, the usage of oxygen per patient was about 25% more in government hospitals,” said a source. “This was revealed after an evaluation on a case-to-case basis in which the oxygen consumption of two Covid-19 patients with the same vitals were compared.” The consumption often went high at night in some cases when the supply was increased by about 20% to save the trouble of checking every few hours, according to sources. In comparison, private hospitals maintained a two-hour chart for regularly monitoring oxygen levels in patients. The state government stepped up its efforts for oxygen audit in hospitals recently after facing a shortage of supply across the state with the second wave of Covid-19 hitting hard. With more people in need of hospitalization, the state’s demand has touched the 1,200-1,400 metric tonnes per day range against the allocation of 975 metric tonnes per day by the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-steps-up-usage-audit/articleshow/82395893.cms||Maulik Pathak
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Now, private hospitals can only admit severe cases||HYDERABAD: In a move to ensure that serious coronavirus patients get a bed on time, Telangana health authorities on Tuesday asked private hospitals to only admit moderate to severe cases, without insisting on a Covid-19 test report. “Taking into cognizance the rise in the positivity of the Covid-19 cases in the state, all private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients are hereby directed to admit patients with moderate and severe symptoms only,” the government order said. Authorities said mild and asymptomatic cases, in which oxygen saturation at room temperature of more than 94%, should be recommended for home/institutional isolation in Covid care centres. “For admitting patients with moderate/ severe symptoms the hospitals should not await or ask for Covid-19 test results,” read the order. Private hospitals were also directed to keep a display board at the entrance of the hospitals giving updated details of availability of regular beds, oxygen beds, ICU beds (ventilator/CPAP) on real time basis. The move is meant to cut down loss of waiting time at hospitals for admission. Getting hospital beds in Hyderabad has been the most difficult part for relatives of Covid-19 patients, and social media is abuzz with complaints of people on the difficulty to get beds on time. “We scanned the entire city but failed to get a bed anywhere. I hope with the new rules in place, patients who desperately need a bed can get one,” said Siddhart Patel, a resident of Madhapur area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-pvt-hosps-can-only-admit-severe-cases/articleshow/82394659.cms||Amrita Didyala

The hospital will start functioning almost a fortnight after DRDO stepped in to set up the facility at the instance of Lucknow MP and defence minister Rajnath Singh. With the addition of 500 beds, the city will now have 7,000 beds for Covid patients, though most of them are occupied. Talking to TOI, DRDO director Narendra Kumar Arya said, “The makeshift hospital at Awadh Shilpgram in Lucknow will be operational from Wednesday noon. The hospital has the capacity of 500 beds, including 150 ICU and 350 general beds which are also equipped with oxygen.” “Patients will be admitted through the Integrated Covid Command Centre (ICCC). We have given the DRDO hospital a login and a password for the ICCC portal where they will upload the status of bed availability. People will be able to view bed occupancy but admission requests will be centrally controlled,” said city’s Covid in charge Roshan Jacob. “Two patients were admitted to the hospital on Tuesday itself, but the facility will formally start functioning on Wednesday,” she added. District magistrate Abhishek Prakash also visited the facility on Tuesday and said the hospital would have unlimited 24-hour oxygen supply. He said there would be a separate electricity feeder for the hospital and special sanitization and cleanliness facilities would be provided to the hospital. DRDO has already set up similar hospitals in Delhi and Ahmedabad in April this year. While DRDO will not formally inaugurate the facility given the crisis situation, sources said chief minister Yogi Aditynath could visit the facility on Wednesday. Diwakar Tripathi, representative Rajnath Singh, said the local MP has asked the CM to inaugurate the facility on Wednesday. “Patients will not be charged for treatment at the hospital. Arrangements for the stay of patients’ relatives will also be made on the premises. Medicines and food will be free,” added the DRDO director. While the hospital has been set up with the expertise and supervision of DRDO, the medical aspect of the facility will be taken care of by the doctors, nurses and support staff of the Armed Forces Medical Services. It has an oxygen plant on base and central air-conditioning as per WHO protocols of air circulation for Covid-19 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/wait-over-drdos-500-bed-covid-hospital-to-start-operations-today/articleshow/82395724.cms||Yusra Husain

These showers are pre-monsoon showers. “These will not be like monsoon showers where it rains back-to-back every day, from morning to evening. There will be thundershowers and we can expect this to go on for the first two weeks of May,” IMD scientist Rahul M said. The rain activity is being attributed to the formation of a trough that is passing through interior Karnataka. IMD officials, however, said that it is a seasonal phenomenon. Based on weather parameters, the trough sometimes gets stronger and sometimes weaker. There will be oscillations in the trough position as well. “All this contributes to the intensity or distribution of rainfall/thundershowers in the pre-monsoon season over Goa. The trough like feature is going to persist and we can also expect some lower level circulations to form because of the heating effect. All this will keep on adding to the possibility of rainfall/thundershower activity over Goa,” Rahul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/imd-pre-monsoon-rain-in-first-two-weeks-of-may/articleshow/82394668.cms||---

In a meeting of stakeholders, including the deputy collector and health officials, Almeida sought to know whether the number of people dying in Vasco was due to Covid-19 or coal pollution. Speaking to TOI on Tuesday, he said that he strongly suspects that it is the coal pollution that is killing more people in Vasco rather than the virus. “Since last year, more deaths are being reported in Vasco. It shows that coal pollution has caused respiratory disorders among people,” he said.

The modus operandi is similar to the liquor delivery and fake e-tailer scams operating through social media platforms where fraudsters float their phone numbers in the name of known shops. When people call, they’re asked to make an advance payment, online. And that is where the trap lies. Once the payment is made, the scamsters switch off their phones and promptly disappear. Only this time it’s not a fake wine-and-dine bluff but a rip off that could cost a human life. Kanika Saxena from Mumbai, who was fleeced of Rs 18,000 by a certain ‘Ajay Agarwal’ posing as a distributor of a leading pharmaceutical company, calls these scamsters the lowest scum of the earth. “I was desperately trying to source six Remdesivir injections for a critically ill friend in Gurgaon so I didn’t think twice when asked to pay in advance only to find out after 12 hours of trying to reach him that I’d been cheated. The patient passed away in the next three days and I haven’t been able to shake off the feeling that I could have been responsible for delaying treatment,” says Saxena. Kunal Chopra from Gurgaon, who lost Rs 15,000, says medical emergencies leave you especially vulnerable. “When I stumbled upon a forward about injections for my father-in-law, I didn’t think about paying up in advance to that so-called pharmacy,” he says. Although both Saxena and Chopra flagged the numbers on social media, neither filed a police complaint. “Saving the patient and pursuing other leads for medication was more important than lodging an FIR or going after the conman,” reasoned Chopra. Harish Baijal, DIG, Cyber Security Maharashtra Police, says uncertainty and distress have forced people to let down their guards. “While we’re trying to spread awareness, it’s difficult to keep a tab on the dissemination of information on social media,” said Baijal. “These scams are an outcome of the shortage of infrastructure and official resources. If we had more organised ways of collating and verifying information and aid being processed, we could reduce instances of blackmarketing or fraud,” said Dr Anant Bhan, an expert on bioethics suggesting that the “groups promoting or facilitating such calls, invest some time in screening them for more accountability”. Sugandh Rakha, a product manager who has built an online portal for Covid-19 resources in Hyderabad, was one of the first to sound an alarm when he stumbled upon complaints that many had been cheated by the numbers listed. “I took off from work to dial around 200 numbers in one day and outsourced a few to two students volunteering to investigate how the scam works,” he said. Rakha’s findings elucidate how scamsters use social media to lay traps disguised as helpful posts, further legitimised when resource portals and celebrities unknowingly repost them. “These numbers are often marked as ‘verified’ although one may have only checked if the number rings or if the person receiving the call claimed that he had the medicine. When desperate relatives of patients find these numbers and contact them, the scammers charge any random amount,” explains Rakha who has seen 22 frauds till now. “For instance, Remdesivir which is priced between Rs 2,000-3,500 is being sold for Rs 10,000-50,000 a vial. If a family is lucky, they get what they paid for. Otherwise, the scammers will say it’s out of stock and then switch off their cell phones for good.” To weed out the dubious ones, Rachit Mathur in Gurgaon, who runs a gig workforce platform, has re-assigned 35 members of his on-demand staff to provide real-time verified information on ‘We Will Win’, a platform to match requests for beds, oxygen, concentrators and medicines with availability. “We conduct a two-step authentication process. First, we call the number to verify stock, price and availability. If they claim to be a company representative, we ask for an official email address, bank account details and for pictures of the stock with date stamps. If we see that it’s a personal bank account or the city from which the call has originated does not match the city where the bank account exists, or that the company has no social media or offline presence, we flag them as fake,” says Mathur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fraudsters-lurking-on-social-media-beware-of-the-great-covid-rip-off/articleshow/82394674.cms||Mohua Das

In a letter to the Director General Medical and Health Services (DGMHS), UPPMSA president Dr Sachin Vaishya and general secretary Dr Amit Singh have stated: "Many patients with respiratory distress syndrome - breathing difficulty or shortness of breath - are coming to the emergency wards of non-Covid district hospitals and primary/community health centres across the state. It has been seen in these cases that they don’t have any Covid test report or had been tested negative in the rapid antigen tests. However, their X-Ray and CT-Scan reports show signs of Covid-19.” The UPPMSA office-bearers said that there are reports that doctors in these non-Covid government hospitals and centres are facing pressure from higher-ups and politicians to admit patients with Covid-19 symptoms. Admission of such patients in these hospitals is leading to infections among doctors and healthcare staff on emergency duty. Such a situation also poses a risk of infection to under treatment non-Covid patients in these healthcare centres Further, the letter states, all the district hospitals in the state, particularly in small districts, which have been converted into dedicated Covid facilities, are already working to their capacity. The two UPPMHS office-bearers asked DGMHS to intervene and take appropriate measures to protect doctors and healthcare workers from falling victim to infection. Already many doctors and paramedics have been infected or died due to infection, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ensure-safety-of-doctors-at-non-covid-hospitals-pmsa/articleshow/82395743.cms||---

Addressing mediapersons here on Tuesday, he said that chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan was able to create a consolidation of Muslim votes in the state. “The public support provided by SDPI and also the support received from other Muslim extremist organizations helped CPM in many seats. In constituencies where IUML was not in the fray, the Muslim votes had gone to LDF,” he said. Surendran said that both LDF and UDF had prevented the victory chances of the party in many seats by joining forces with Muslim communal forces. He refuted the allegations by Vijayan that BJP engaged in vote trade in many seats and countered it by asking whether the massive drop in CPM’s vote share in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections was due to trading of votes to UDF. “LDF had lost around 8% votes in 2019 Lok Sabha election when compared to 2016 assembly elections. The chief minister should explain if that was a result of vote trade,” he said. Surendran also asked whether the decrease of around 2,000 votes in Manjeswaram despite polling of over 10,000 votes was due to sale of CPM votes to IUML. “Also, did CPM see a decrease of over 2,000 votes in Palakkad due to vote trade with UDF?” he asked. Surendran said that many in the party think that he could have won from Manjeswaram had he not contested from two seats. He added that he contested from two seats as per the party’s directive. Surendran said that the party would examine the poll defeat in detail and two party leaders will visit each constituency to discuss with local-level cadres to understand the political and organizational lapses, and will take corrective measures. Padmanabhan criticizes party brass, hails Pinarayi Meanwhile, BJP former state president C K Padmanabhan who had contested against Pinarayi Vijayan in Dharmadam constituency criticized the party state leadership and praised Vijayan for the LDF’s return to power saying that it was a well-deserving win for the chief minister. “Pinarayi Vijayan government has done several good deeds and it is not proper to find faults in everything. The Vijayan government had handled several crises, including the Covid pandemic, more effectively than many other states. Let him continue. There is nothing wrong in that,” he said. He said that there has been no serious discussions in the party over Surendran contesting in two constituencies and that the delay and confusion over candidate selection in constituencies like Kazhakkoottam could have affected the party’s chances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/communal-consolidation-of-muslim-votes-scripted-ldf-win-surendran/articleshow/82393791.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Some 700 doctors at eight GMERS colleges on Tuesday said that many demands of theirs are pending with the state government for over a decade now. “Even after being in service for 10 years, some basic employment benefits such as Employees’ Provident Fund accounts and promotions are pending. The benefits of the Seventh Pay Commission are also yet to be given to us,” the GMERS Faculty Association said in a statement. For the last year, these doctors have been working without break to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a representation made to the state government. “We have risked our lives and the lives of our families by joining as frontline warriors for various Covid-related duties that have been assigned to us. Despite our dedication and hard work, the government has ignored our basic demands,” the statement said.

Doctors said though regular monitoring of big cats was being conducted at Nahargarh Biological Park, correspondence was done to have reference points. Senior veterinarian Dr Arvind Mathur said, “To learn about the symptoms, I spoke with Hyderabad zoo vet on Tuesday. It was informed many animals were coughing and sneezing. There was also nasal discharges and respiratory distress. Some of the animals were also not eating. Luckily, there are no such symptoms in wild cats at Nahargarh here. In January, samples were sent to Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly, and RT-PCR tests were also conducted.” Mathur said several measures for prophylactic purpose are been taken at the biological park. There are 14 wild cats at the biological park including Asiatic loins, a white tiger, Bengal tigers and leopards. The forest department is carrying out daily health screening of all the animals and administering anti-stress and immuno modulator medicines to all big cats. “We have carried out deworming of all animals. To boost immunity, vitamins and minerals supplements are being provided. Close and intense monitoring is being carried out to observe the biological parameters.” Caretakers at the zoo said to prevent infection, floors of cages are daily being cleaned with Kohrsolin disinfectant. For the same, hot water is used weekly. Moreover, caretakers are allowed to enter inside the enclosure after wearing PPE kits, masks and gloves. Source said the shortage of red meat due to closure of shops in the city owing to lockdown has forced the authorities to procure buffaloes to meet the food requirements. According to officials, chickens can’t fulfill the food needs of lions, tigers and leopards. Therefore, buffaloes are procured from nearby districts. One buffalo every day is enough to meet the food demand of big cats of park. The slaughter takes place within the park or at the government slaughter house at Chainpura in the city, said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hyd-doctors-guide-city-zoo-to-check-infections-in-lions/articleshow/82394671.cms||---

---||Jaipur||12 containment zones come up in Jaipur to put brakes on Covid surge||JAIPUR: The local administration on Tuesday created 12 zero mobility containment zones (CZ) for an indefinite period in the city following a surge in Covid cases. Movement of people in these zones will be completely restricted other than those involved in medical services — doctors and nurses — along with a limited few involved in essential services such as vegetable vendors, milkman and newspaper hawkers. Those in need of medical emergency will be allowed to move from these zones only to visit hospitals or at the medical stores. The decision was jointly taken by DM Antar Singh Nehra and ACP Ajay Pal Lamba after surveying the Covid hotspots in the city. “These containment areas intended to break the chain. These zones come under 11 police stations where a large number of cases have been recorded. The decision was taken on Monday after carefully studying the trends and making an assessment of the situation,” said Nehra. The areas marked under the CZs have been barricaded from all sides keeping one entry/exit point for the movement of those allowed. ACP Ajay Pal Lamba has requested residents living in these areas not to panic and follow the order. “Police will cooperate with those facing any justifiable emergency. Those who flout the norms will be institutionally quarantined and will not be released until their RT-PCR report comes negative,” said Lamba. Sources said the containment zones will remain for a minimum of three days. It will be removed only after cases start dipping. The biggest among the 12 CZs are Tilak Nagar, which is recording an average of 10 cases from the last many days, making the entire area at a high risk of infections while the smallest areas include two apartments—Merwara and Vyas in Pratapnagar. The local authorities said people facing any confusion can call up the control room number for assistance and contact the nearest police station over the phone. The sudden barricading followed by the announcement has caused panic in these areas. KB Kothari, a former policy planner with UNICEF who lives at Tilak Marg, said an announcement made by police doesn’t give us an idea of who is allowed and who’s not. “I support the decision of the local administration and believe that police will give a patient hearing to those who will step out rather than arresting or charge them with batons,” said an octogenarian Kothari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/12-containment-zones-come-up-in-jaipur-to-put-brakes-on-covid-surge/articleshow/82394677.cms||---

After the video went viral and drew flak for the police’s approach, senior officers inquired into the matter and found there was no fault in the force’s actions. The video shows an ambulance of a private organization being stopped at a crossroads near Panjrapol Circle while a convoy of three purple buses of an IPL team and two police vehicles was passing. The video was shared widely on social media and people criticized the police’s action of stopping an ambulance at a time when hundreds of people are dying everyday of Covid-19 and from lack of healthcare facilities. Deputy commissioner of police, traffic (admin), Tejas Patel confirmed that the incident had occurred but did not see any fault in the police officers’ actions. “After the video went viral, I enquired with traffic police personnel deployed there at the time of the incident. They told me that two buses of the convoy had already passed and only after that did the ambulance arrive there,” he said. He added that if the cops had tried to stop the third bus, there would have been an accident between the third bus and the two police vehicles or the cops trying to stop it would have been hit by the speeding bus. Patel claimed the ambulance was allowed to pass from there after just 16 seconds. On the patient inside the ambulance, Patel said he was not aware if there was a patient inside or the ambulance was rushing to a patient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ambulance-stopped-for-ipl-team-convoy/articleshow/82395908.cms||---

The CM said the state government had no idea about the dire situation in the Covid ward. “This issue was not discussed with the team that looks after oxygen supply to hospitals,” he said. “We told them that if the issue was brought to our notice, it would have been solved. It has been decided to provide the required oxygen to GMC, including empty cylinders. We will provide oxygen as and when it gets over.” Asked whether has taken control of the issue, Sawant said, “The team will look after the requirement, one person cannot do it. One person can’t take responsibility and we as a team take a decision.” “The dean should have coordinated with me,” he said. “It was the need of the hour. Bandekar should have held a meeting with the Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD).” The CM said that principal secretary Puneet Kumar Goel has been assigned to look into the grievances, and coordinate with Bandekar. On Sunday, GARD highlighted the issue of poor oxygen supply, and, in a letter to the government said that it is “not even close to sufficient”. Sawant said that the issue would be sorted out. “I discussed the issue with the health minister (on Monday),” he said. “I had personal knowledge that oxygen cylinders are available at GMC. I have spoken to him. When I read about the issue in the newspaper, I conducted an inquiry, but we will manage.” Sawant, however, insisted that oxygen level doesn’t drop while changing trolleys.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-blames-dean-for-oxygen-shortage/articleshow/82395783.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Resident doctors on Covid duty demand scrapping of their PG final exams||Mumbai: Third year resident doctors across the country, posted on Covid duty, have demanded that their final exams be scrapped and they be promoted as senior residents as they continue to provide their services in India’s battle against the pandemic. Across the country, federations and associations of resident doctors have stated that Covid wards across hospitals are being serviced by these final year post-graduate doctors for over a year. With an extension of their services and a possible delay in their final exams, over 8,000 resident doctors want the governments to recognize their efforts and award them the post-graduate degree, promote them as senior residents and up their pay scales correspondingly. Furore erupted on Tuesday after the National Board of Examinations stated that the services of all DNB/DrNB/FNB trainees of the 2018 and 2019 entry batches as residents would be continued over and above their mandatory three-months’ extension, till fresh batches for 2021 admission session join or counselling for NEET-PG 2021 is concluded. “Our exams were to take place in May, they were then pushed to June and now there is an indefinite postponement. We don’t want to strike work, we are on the forefront of the fight against Covid and we feel that we deserve to get our degrees and our work ought to be recognised,” said a PG (dermatology) from the Vijaynagar Institute of Medical Science. “The postponement of the PG-NEET by four months and then counselling and admission will all add up to six to seven months. Till then, our services will be extended and we have lost several months of our career,” added another PG (orthopaedic) resident. Moreover, in a letter to the Prime Minister’s office, residents have stated that several diploma post-graduate students, who are expected to put in a tenure of two years, have been serving for three years due to the pandemic and also faced postponement of their exams. “Hence, it is requested that they be rightfully be considered at par with MD/MS students whose tenure is three years,” read the letter (a copy of which is with TOI). The Karnataka Association of Residents Doctors termed this a “black day” for residents. Federation for Resident Doctors’ Association India said that the residents have been through the toughest test while serving on the Covid frontlines. “Final exams are supposed to evaluate the theoretical and practical knowledge of students. However resident doctors have already shown their competency by serving the nation in this pandemic. Final exams require months of rigorous and uninterrupted preparation, but this time their preparation has been derailed following posting in Covid duty,” said FORDA president, Dr Partha Bora.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/resident-doctors-on-covid-duty-demand-scrapping-of-their-pg-final-exams/articleshow/82395845.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Cong tried a communal tie-up: Vijayaraghavan||Kochi: CPM state secretary A Vijayaraghavan said that the assembly election results have made it difficult for Congress, which is falling apart, to make a comeback. Congress tried to unite all the communal forces, including BJP, Muslim League and Jamaat-e-Islami against LDF to avoid a continuity of government. The victory of LDF, which implemented a slew of development and welfare measures in the state, is a landmark one, Vijayaraghavan said. The first Communist government which assumed power under the leadership of EMS Namboodiripad introduced historic policies like land reforms. “Then, Congress rallied all communal forces against the Communist government and tried to sabotage the democratic government through liberation struggle in 1959. That anti-Communist politics had been there for the past 64 years. By overpowering that unity, the LDF government retained power this time,” he said. The Nehru government made an undemocratic intervention and disbanded the democratically-elected EMS government. This time, the BJP government at the Centre intervened for sabotaging the Pinarayi-led LDF government using enforcement agencies in an illegal manner, Vijayaraghavan said. The LDF government implemented a lot of development and welfare projects and won the people’s hearts when crises hit the state one after another. So, the people rejected all the moves by the opposition and BJP to avoid continuity for the LDF government and voted in favour of the front, he said. Given the current political scenario in India, the victory of LDF assumes much significance. This victory will help create an alternative for the BJP-led Union government. Congress failed to adopt policies and strategies against BJP. The election results will empower the Left and regional parties in the country to take on BJP, Vijayraghavan said. The success of LDF will also fuel the movements against neoliberalism and communalism in the country, he added. Vijayaraghavan said that the NSS leadership tried to avoid LDF continuity, a call which was rejected by all, including the members of Nair community. He also said that Congress bought the votes of BJP in many constituencies in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cong-tried-a-communal-tie-up-vijayaraghavan/articleshow/82393797.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Elections have exposed double engine government in Uttar Pradesh: Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Expressing gratitude towards the people of the state who opted for Samajwadi Party candidates as their first preference in panchayat polls, SP president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said the abysmal performance of the BJP in Varanasi and Gorakhpur has exposed the “double engine” government. “BJP has the habit of making promises which they never intend to fulfil. But now people have realised this. The ‘double engine ki sarkar’ (government at the Centre and in UP) has been exposed. BJP candidates have faced defeat in Varanasi and Gorakhpur, the home turf of the prime minister and the chief minister,” he said, adding that by voting in favour of SP and against BJP, people had only voted to save democracy. He said the verdict in West Bengal assembly polls was clearly against the BJP’s politics of “hate and divide”. “In UP panchayat elections, people have sent across a message for the 2022 assembly elections in the state,” Yadav said. Appealing to SP’s winning candidates not to take out any victory procession keeping in mind the pandemic protocols, he said: “Instead, help the people in need. Celebrations can wait for now.” “The ruling BJP tried its tricks everywhere from Azamgarh to Etawah but the voter did not allow any irregularities and SP emerged as the winner. In Lucknow as well, Samajwadi Party managed to register victory in a big way. Wherever the ruling party tried to use unfair means to win elections, it did not help,” the former UP CM said. He added that while voting, the people had in mind the chunk of migrants and rural populace that was left jobless last year and those hit by Covid-19 infection were left without any medical assistance from the government. “All that the ruling BJP has done in the past four years is to obstruct development projects started during the Samajwadi Party government. Education of children has been hit hard and the government has no clear plan in place to restore the livelihood of the people or the education of the children,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/elections-have-exposed-double-engine-govt-sp/articleshow/82395780.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

They were sent to an empty housing board colony at Bagrana till their RT-PCR test report comes negative. Every police station in Jaipur has made special teams to detain such persons and send them to quarantine centres. The complex has a capacity of 500 persons and for food, the local administration has approached NGOs to provide them two times meals and breakfast. The rule of IQ is in force since May 3 to crack down on people who are not taking the Covid protocol seriously. On day 1, Jaipur police warned the citizens but found that people were taking advantage by falsely stating medical urgency. Since morning, police teams started rigorous checking at all important intersections in the city. Most of them sent to IQ were aged below 40 years and unable to explain the reason for stepping outside. “My station has sent two persons to IQ after they failed to provide reason or urgency to be out from their house. They were given time to explain but keep changing reasons,” said Anil Jaiman, SHO Vaishali Nagar Police Station. Those detained were taken to the police commissionerate before being taken to the IQ centre in a bus.  1,900 persons quarantined across state : The state police department has institutionally quarantined 1,900 persons across the state including 123 in Jaipur in the last two days.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Wanted KTR to succeed KCR as CM, says Eatala Rajender||HYDERABAD: Former health minister Eatala Rajender said he had never aspired to become chief minister and wanted TRS working president KT Rama Rao to succeed K Chandrasekhar Rao as next CM. “KCR, the man who is considered as ‘Telangana Gandhi’ and believed in dharma and people till 2014, is now resorting to witchhunt on me. Some leaders are misguiding him and instigating him against me. Cases have been booked against me and my firm without serving notices,” Eatala said at a press conference in Huzurabad on Tuesday. “If the chief minister did not want to continue me as a minister, he could have told me and I would have resigned from my ministership. But, he chose the other path to malign my image by levelling false allegations and harass me,” the former minister said. Eatala alleged that the CM never respects his cabinet colleagues. “When KCR was unwell, I along with ministerial collegue Gangula Kamalakar had gone to Pragathi Bhavan to see him. But, the security personnel stopped us at the gate saying that only those having appointment would be allowed inside. There were news reports that home minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali and former minister Nayani Narasimha Reddy were sent back when they went to meet the CM without seeking a prior appointment,” he said. He said the TRS leadership brands ‘match-fixing’ if any Congress leader or a BJP leader meets a minister. “When Congress was in power, TRS leaders often used to meet ministers on developmental works or allotment of funds. Is it wrong if a TRS leader meets another party leader,” he sought to know. Eatala said he would start interacting with leaders of other parties. On some of his cabinet colleagues criticising him, the former minister said he would leave it to their wisdom since their words were scripted by the party leadership. Eatala, who reached his Huzurabad assembly constituency headquarters on Monday evening, interacted with his followers and local TRS leaders. He sought suggestions from his close followers on his future course of action. He has not taken a decision on resigning from his MLA post and party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-i-wanted-ktr-to-succeed-kcr-as-cm/articleshow/82394693.cms||Koride Mahesh

These patients were sent to their homes for isolation and nearby hospitals were informed to treat them if the case arises. Rajasthan Revenue Training Institute situated in Ghooghra has been converted into a quarantine centre with 25 rooms and 50 beds. An official source said they needed more space as more people are being brought by police for being quarantined. The official also demanded that the speed of Covid tests should be increased as out of the 133 people who were quarantined, 33 tests were conducted and eight tested positive. If reports of Covid test come faster, then people with negative report should be sent to their homes early and those who are testing positive should be treated and directed to be quarantined at home. Police remained alert on Tuesday and checked people who were roaming, “We made barricades at every point in the city and stopped people who were roaming aimlessly and sent them to quarantine centre,” said police. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/eight-in-ajmer-centre-test-positive/articleshow/82394689.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||WR runs two more oxygen trains to Delhi from Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: The Western Railway has run two more Oxygen Express trains from Gujarat carrying liquid medical oxygen. One train left from Hapa for Delhi and another from Mundra for Tughlakabad. According to a press release, the Western Railway operated the two Oxygen Express trains towards the Delhi region. The train from Hapa left at 4.40am on Tuesday for Delhi Cantonment. It had five tankers which contain 104 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen. These tankers have been provided by Reliance Industries, Jamnagar. It will reach Delhi Cantonment on Wednesday morning after covering a distance of 1,230km. The other train departed for Tughlakabad from Mundra Port at 06.20am on Tuesday. It will reach its destination early on Wednesday. This train consists of seven tankers containing 140 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen. These tankers were shipped from the UAE and arrived at Mundra Port. So far, the Western Railway has run four Oxygen Express trains and transported approximately 373 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen. An Oxygen Express which left Hapa on Monday reached Gurugram for the Delhi region at 03.10am on Tuesday. It was given top priority and it followed all safety measures because it was carrying cryogenic cargo. The train ran at an average speed of 53 kmph on a special corridor so that it could reach the destination in the shortest possible time. Railways officials said that the organization is united in its fight against Covid-19 and in bringing relief to patients and their families. So far till Monday, Indian Railways has delivered approximately 1,125MT of liquid medical oxygen in 76 tankers to various states. The states include Maharashtra (174MT), Uttar Pradesh (430.51MT), Madhya Pradesh (156.96MT), Delhi (190MT), Haryana (109.71MT), and Telangana (63.6MT).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wr-runs-2-more-o2-trains-to-delhi-from-guj/articleshow/82395924.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Poultry hub Ajmer hit hard as eateries, shops remain shut||JAIPUR: With Covid curfew shuttering restaurants, the demand for broiler chicken has crashed up to 70%. The forced closure of retail shops selling raw chicken by police despite the home department’s guidelines remaining silent on it is also not helping the poultry farmers. In Ajmer that has over 10,000 poultry farms and supplies about 40% of the 50 lakh broiler chickens per day to the state and neighboring states, the impact has been unsettling. The district also accounts for 75% layer poultry farming for egg production in the state. Rajasthan Poultry Farmers Society president Rajkumar Jaipal said, “Besides meeting the needs of the state, we used to cater to markets like Delhi, eastern Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. Because of corona restrictions, we have lost businesses everywhere resulting in 70% decline in offtake.” Jaipal said that during summers the egg consumption in Rajasthan falls sharply requiring the farmers to tap other markets outside the state. “About 75% of the 40 lakh eggs produced in the state are from Ajmer. Because of the hot weather, the consumption in Rajasthan declines substantially. During this time, we start supplying to other markets in neighboring states. Given the current restrictions, much of the production is getting wasted because egg is a perishable product,” added Jaipal. He said the ex-farm egg prices have come down to Rs 3.50 per piece. It used to be Rs 5.50. The government’s current guidelines are not clear about retail shops selling raw meat or chicken. While shops selling essential productions are allowed to open for five hours, the meat and chicken retailers are forced to close the shops by the police. “The police don’t allow us to open the shop. We don’t know about the home department guidelines,” said Rajesh, a shop owner in Malviya Nagar. Rajesh said that the government needs to look at the guidelines and correct the anomaly because non-veg is also an essential product for many. He said the industry in Ajmer engages about 50,000 people and over a lakh in the state. Their source of livelihood would be at stake if the industry continues to suffer like this. Farmers have invested lakhs of rupees in these farms. Adding to the woes is the increase in bird feed prices as soya cake and maize prices have increased by 25%, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/poultry-hub-ajmer-hit-hard-as-eateries-shops-remain-shut/articleshow/82394703.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Chennithala alleges CPM, BJP nexus||Thiruvananthapuram: Countering the allegations by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala said that there has been a massive vote trade between CPM and BJP to subvert the electoral prospects of UDF in the elections. He added that Vijayan’s allegations that BJP traded its votes in favour of UDF was to cover up the nexus between CPM and BJP. He said that it was UDF that closed the account of BJP in the state by sabotaging the deal between BJP and CPM. He said that the chief minister’s statement was an anticipatory bail, in the fear that the BJP-CPM deal would get exposed. Chennithala said that in as many as 69 seats, BJP traded its votes in favour of CPM. It is clear from the number of votes that the UDF candidates had sabotaged the chances of BJP in Manjeswaram, Palakkad and Nemom, where the saffron party had expected victory. In Nemom, UDF had fielded K Muraleedharan, a strong candidate who had significantly improved the number of votes that the UDF candidate got in the 2016 elections, to stop the BJP from winning. At the same time, LDF candidate V Sivankutty could not even retain the total number of votes that the LDF candidate got last time, which means that LDF traded 3,305 votes to BJP. Similar is the case with Manjeswaram and Palakkad, Chennithala said. BJP got 4,35,606 votes less when compared to 2016 elections, which is 3.71% less votes. Majority of these votes went to the LDF candidates. In several constituencies like Kalamassery, Kuttanad, Vaikom, Udumbanchola, Ettumanoor, Aruvikkara, Trithala, Wadakkanchery, Idukki, Peermade, Changanassery, Vamanapuram, Kovalam, Kaipamangalam, it is seen that the votes of the BJP candidates have significantly reduced and had gone to the LDF candidates, Chennithala added. RSS leader R Balasankar’s statements that there is a secret deal between LDF and BJP has come out to be true, and BJP had even frozen all probes against the state government in corruption cases. BJP’s target is Congress-free country, which is the reason for the deal between BJP and LDF, he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/chennithala-alleges-cpm-bjp-nexus/articleshow/82393808.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Deliveries of Covid-positive women at Nair hospital cross 1k||MUMBAI: BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central achieved a remarkable feat by performing 1,001 deliveries of Covid-19-positive women—possibly the first by any public-run institution in the country amid the pandemic. The hospital, which has remained the city’s nodal centre for Covid-19-infected mothers-to-be, facilitated the births of 1,022 babies, including 19 twins and a set of triplets since last April. The gynaecology department had swung into action in mid-April last year, five days before it was decided to convert Nair into a complete Covid centre. Hurriedly, an alternate labour room in the adjoining building was set up for Covid-positive months. Soon, though, the hospital realised they would require not one but two labour rooms, the second one for suspect mothers. In the months that followed, the hospital delivered women who travelled all the way from Vasai, Virar, Palghar, Raigad and some even from affluent families with private hospitals shutting the door on many. Dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal said the first delivery of a Covid-infected mother was safely carried out on April 14, 2020, and since then the gynaecology, paediatrics, medicine and anaesthesia departments have worked in tandem to facilitate over 1,000 births. Dr Sushma Malik, head of paediatrics, said they have seen less than 50 babies testing positive for the virus. “Our experience shows that the infection doesn’t travel in-utero. It can be transmitted through contact with the mother after birth,” she said. The 1,000th delivery, a C-section, was carried out at 5.38pm by senior resident Dr Aastha Raheja on Monday. Sneha Pawar, a 34-year-old, delivered a healthy baby boy. Second-year resident doctor Shayla Srivastava who carried out the first delivery in the makeshift labour room last year said the biggest challenge was to deliver babies wearing PPEs and goggles, while profusely sweating. “We are used to it now and the fear is much less,” she said. Gynaecology head Dr Ganesh Shinde said that even positive mothers were encouraged to breastfeed with proper precautions such as masking. The second wave of the pandemic, though, has been more damaging, with increased infectivity of the virus and a surge in severe cases. A total of 17 deaths in April alone came as a shock for the department that had not seen so many in nine months of the pandemic in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-deliveries-of-ve-women-at-nair-hosp-cross-1k/articleshow/82393806.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||IIIT-Hyderabad model to predict Covid-19 outcome using ML||HYDERABAD: Researchers at the International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad (IIIT H) have come up with a Mortality Prediction Model to help in prioritising healthcare based on risk and mortality prediction. As part of a joint project funded by Intel Corp, under its Pandemic Response Technology Initiative along with CSIR-IGIB (Council ofScientific and Industrial Research – Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology), researchers from IIITH have used machine learning models to categorize risk and predict mortality in Indian patients. “Using the same dataset of Covid positive patients from Wuhan, we have identified 5 biomarkers that can be used to predict mortality with 96% accuracy,” said Akshaya Karthikeyan, IIITH researcher from the Centre for Computational Natural Sciences and Bioinformatics (CCNSB). She said that an early prediction can help accelerate the decision-making process of healthcare professionals for appropriate treatments. Akshaya, who is the lead author of the paper titled ‘Machine Learning Based Clinical Decision Support System for Early Covid-19 Mortality Prediction,’ said that they have attempted to provide a mortality prediction as early as 16 days before the outcome. Even as several algorithms provide much-needed insights into the risk and mortality rate, the researchers said that the biggest drawback is that all these algorithms have been trained on patient data obtained either from China or the USA. In a bid to fix this flaw, they conducted an India-specific study – this time on 544 Covid positive patients from the MAX group of hospitals in New Delhi. “First, we tested out the neural network created by Akshaya on the Indian dataset. Unlike the high (96%) accuracy of mortality prediction demonstrated in the early stages of Covid-19 diagnosis, we found that Indian mortality could be predicted with an accuracy of only 58%,” said Shanmukh Alle, lead researcher adding that one of the biggest puzzles was that Indian patients who were at high-risk and expected to die based on the Wuhan dataset actually survived. Shanmukh said that evidence was found linking mortality with the usage of steroids. “This is in line with the early treatment protocols by the Indian government mandating the use of steroids and immunosuppressant drugs,” he said adding that predicting patients’ risk, that is, if they are at high-risk or low-risk based on respiratory support needed (if at all) is important in order to effectively allocate scarce resources. “For this, biomarkers such as blood parameters, oxygen saturation levels and diabetes comorbid conditions were identified. For mortality prediction, however, only blood parameters were considered. Two different machine learning methods were used for risk stratification and for mortality prediction, respectively, both of which have yielded very good results,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiit-h-model-to-predict-covid-19-outcome-using-ml/articleshow/82394696.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Journalists to be given jab on priority in Uttar Pradesh: Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Media personnel will be given priority in vaccination, the state government announced on Tuesday. The order follows a string of Covid-19 related deaths among journalists in the past few weeks. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has issued instructions to allocate separate vaccination centres for journalists and their family members who are above 18 years. “The CM took this decision in recognition of the efforts of journalists who have put their lives and health at risk on a daily basis to cover the Covid-19 pandemic. All journalists should get vaccinated, and if required, free vaccines can be administered to them at their work place itself,” said a government spokesperson. Additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal added that state journalists will also now get the benefit of the central government’s welfare schemes. This includes financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh at the death of a journalist for his or her dependents. “Even non-accredited journalists and freelancers will be benefitted under the scheme. For this, one must be recognized by the government of India or the government of any state or Union territory. Even if they are not recognized, they must have been associated with any print, electronic or web-based services for at least five years,” said Sehgal. He added that in case of permanent disability, Rs 5 lakh will be given to the journalist, Rs 3 lakh in case of a serious illness such as cancer, renal failure, bypass, open-heart surgery, angioplasty, brain haemorrhage and paralysis and Rs 2 lakh to a journalist hospitalised for treatment due to a serious accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/journalists-to-be-given-jab-on-priority-yogi/articleshow/82395810.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Supreme Court annuls West Bengal’s real estate act||KOLKATA: The Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down the West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act, 2017 (WBHIRA) as unconstitutional for being in conflict with the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), a Central legislation enacted earlier. The apex court held that the state government encroached upon the domain of Parliament in enacting WBHIRA since both WBHIRA and RERA deal with the same entry in the Concurrent List and a significantly large number of provisions of WBHIRA overlap with RERA. The judgment was delivered by a Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah in a plea by NGO Forum for People’s Collective Efforts (FPCE), which contended that WBHIRA should be struck down since it conflicts with RERA. “From our analysis of RERA and WBHIRA, two fundamental features that emerge are that WBHIRA overlaps with RERA and is copied word to word and it does not complement RERA. Both the statutes refer to same entry in the Concurrent List,” the court said, adding that once Parliament has enacted a law on a subject, it is not open to the state legislature to enact a similar law and lift it word to word. “The overlap is so significant that test of repugnance based on identity of subject matter is established. West Bengal has attempted to establish a parallel regime which is not Constitutionally permissible,” the court ruled. While striking down WBHIRA, the court clarified that sanctions and permissions granted under WBHIRA prior to the delivery of the judgment will be valid. Over 1,000 projects have been approved by the authority. “This power has been exercised to safeguard past decisions and prevent chaos,” the court said. FPCE president Abhay Upadhyay, who resides in Kolkata from where he had raised the demand for a countrywide law on real estate in 2009 after encountering multiple hurdles when a prominent developed failed to deliver a project in Howrah, said the judgment had vindicated the stand that legislations by individual states would defeat the purpose of a central law. While the case was argued on basis of which law would take primacy, Upadhyay pointed to anomalies in WBHIRA that would now cease to exit. These include allowing any future event to be declared ‘force majeure’ or unforeseeable circumstances by a competent authority and alterations in the definition of parking and garage that were loaded in favour of developers and against buyers’ interest,” he said Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India president (West Bengal chapter) Sushil Mohta though contended that the minor tweaking was done and a few words changed to suit local geographic and urban conditions and that both laws were meant to protect customers of real estate. “Our members are committed to comply with the law which was in force or which shall come in future,” he said. Real estate consultancy firm Pioneer Property MD Jitendra Khaitan felt scrapping WBHIRA would have a positive impact in the long-term and allow stressed projects in Bengal to also avail of the Central government supported fund SWAMIH. However, developers including Jain group MD Rishi Jain, Ideal group MD Nakul Himatsingka and Eden Reality MD Arya Sumant felt while it' was a significant decision in terms of real estate practices, it wouldn’t make a huge difference to consumers as both acts were virtually same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sc-annuls-states-real-estate-act/articleshow/82393801.cms||Subhro Niyogi

It will be in force for 11 days. By that time, people will realise what we all have to do to comply with the Covid-19 protocol,” said former Bihar Industries Association (BIA) president K P S Keshri, adding, “It is true that earning your livelihood is important, but the situation we are facing is dreadful. Therefore, saving a life is more important, and the lockdown period is not long.” Keshari further said, “How big is the population of the state -- it is around 13 crores. No government can do much to streamline the lifestyle of people at large in the prevailing situation. Logon ko khud hi thoda bahut vyavasthit karne ka kaam karna hoga (We will have to organize our lifestyle ourselves) amid the coronavirus pandemic.” The current BIA vice-president, Sanjay Bhartiya, said the government has exempted sectors such as industries, construction and shops related to the construction activities. “The industry and trade will be somewhat hit, but what is needed is breaking the chain of the coronavirus transmission. The lockdown will help in it. We are hopeful that the situation will improve,” he added. In fact, like the Indian Medical Association (IMA), even BIA led by its president Ram Lal Khetan had asked for the imposition of lockdown last week, Keshri said, adding, “The industry and trade circles have welcomed the lockdown to save the lives of people.” Even traders and ‘kirana’ shop owners are in favour of the lockdown. “Upaay kya ha? What is the way out of the situation?” Sanjay Kumar, a seller of tea leaves on Shri Krishna Road in the Kidwaipuri locality, said. Similarly, Gopal, who belongs to Hilsa in Nalanda district and runs a ‘kirana’ shop in the Shri Krishna Nagar locality that has mainly middle-class sections, said people are afraid of the next day, and, the next moment, as to what will happen. “Every day they say they do not know where they could get infected by the coronavirus, and in which part of Patna. The situation is most alarming here, compared to all other big or middle-level towns in the state. The lockdown is a good thing that the government has done. It will save lives, break the transmission chain, and also bring peace to the tormented mind of people,” Gopal also said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/industry-body-small-traders-back-lockdown-to-save-lives/articleshow/82393026.cms||Abhay Singh

The CM inspected the hospital and directed officials to ensure that facilities are in place. The Cancer Institute is a Level-3 arrangement with oxygen and ventilator facility. Admission of patients also started from Tuesday. Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said, the 500-bed DRDO hospital would also be made operational shortly. “There were some issues regarding shortage of staff at the hospital and this has been resolved,” he said. Another 250-bed hospital set up by HAL will also be operational shortly and the health department has been asked to arrange for human resource. KGMU is in the process of adding 140 beds.“We have to double the current capacity of beds in all districts. The medical education minister should ensure this at the ministerial level,” the CM said. He added that each Covid hospital should appoint two nodal officers. While once will take regular rounds and ensure no patient is left outside the facility, the second official will be in charge of letting a patients’ families know about their status at least once a day. The health minister has been asked to ensure this arrangement. Asking officials to ensure that monitoring committees were active in rural areas, the CM said, the sooner the treatment for Covid-19 starts, the quicker is the recovery. Monitoring committees should try and identify those affected by Covid by regularly visiting houses in their areas, in both rural and urban centres, he said, adding enforcement of mandatory use of masks should be continued. District administration officers said, two critical patients requiring ICU facilities were admitted in the cancer hospital on Tuesday itself. The centre will be operational with full capacity soon. Admissions will be done through Integrated Covid Command Control Centre, they added. Officers also said, a 255-bed dedicated Covid hospital will also be started in Haj house soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-inaugurates-covid-19-facility-at-cancer-institute/articleshow/82395840.cms||Neha Lalchandani

They alleged that Eatala has not only tried to harm the party but also crossed the ‘lakshman rekha’ (party discipline) by making statements which were unwarranted and irresponsible. “The pro-Telangana movement was at its peak much before Eatala had joined the TRS. The party leadership gave him respect by giving him a party ticket to contest as an MLA and later made him a minister. He owes an explanation how he has lost respect and self-respect within the party,” ministers Koppula Eshwar and Gangula Kamalakar and Telangana State Planning Board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar said at a press conference here. They said Eatala had violated the party discipline by making comments against the government, TRS president and CM K Chandrasekhar Rao and working president KT Rama Rao on several occasions. “Eatala always thought he was above the party, but the party was strong in Huzurabad even before he joined the party,” they said. Raising the issue of encroachment of assigned land by his firm Jamuna Hatcheries, the ministers asked: “Being a senior MLA and a minister, is he not aware that purchasing an assigned land is an offence under the law and that too for his own business purposes. How did he purchase endowments land in Devaryamjal. He wants to protect his business interests and not the interests of Dalits and the poor. The assigned lands are given to landless poor. Kamalakar said Eatala who claims himself to have come from a poor family and stayed in a social welfare hostel should clarify how he has made thousands of crores in two decades of political career.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ministers-up-the-ante-against-eatala/articleshow/82394707.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Urban development and housing to set up 60 oxygen plants||JAIPUR: With Covid-19 surge continuing unabated and demand for oxygen on the rise, the urban development and housing (UDH) department minister Shanti Dhariwal announced to establish 60 oxygen plants in the state. For the same a high-level meeting with country’s 11 prominent oxygen manufactures was organised via-video conferencing on Tuesday. It was discussed, in the state there are hospitals having a capacity of 50 beds, 100 beds, 150 beds, and 300 beds. The oxygen requirement in these hospitals is two to three cylinders per day on one bed. Considering this requirement, oxygen plants having a capacity to produce 100 cylinders, 150 cylinders and 300 cylinders per day will be established in district hospital. Similarly, bigger plants having a capacity of 800 to 1,000 cylinders will be set up state’s big cities. A senior UDH official said, “Manufacturers were instructed to send their proposals. After studying the technical proposals, the manufactures will be asked to set the plants.” The urban bodies have been given a free hand by the state government to appoint manufactures for setting up an oxygen plant and purchase its required materials. The exemption to the UDH department has been provided under the Rajasthan Transparency in Public Procurement Act, 2012. The health department and the National Health Mission have also ordered to install oxygen plants at various places in the state. To benefit manufactures, the department may soon issue a separate notification regarding 100% exemption in premium payable under Rule 10 of the Rajasthan Urban Area (Permission and Allotment of Agricultural Land for Non-Agricultural Purpose) Rules, 2012 and relaxation in lease amount. The department has decided not to levy building plan approval fee on establishment of oxygen plants. The order reads, “Complete 100% exemption in building map fee will be provided under the Building Regulations 2020 for setting up of oxygen gas plants for medical supplies.” To encourage investors to set up oxygen plants instantly, the department has reduced the time duration in the land conversion process.

It would be good if CPM could analyse the working style of their Tripunithura candidate and the way he hurt the sentiments of Hindus. No matter how much CM tries to undermine the victory achieved by UDF and Congress, the voters will reject it with contempt,” he said. Babu said that the people know who gained from BJP votes as RSS ideologue R Balasankar had already revealed the alliance between CPM and BJP. Vijayan conveniently forgot all those, Babu added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chief-minister-insulted-voters-says-k-babu/articleshow/82393811.cms||---

However, the district administration on Tuesday supplied 50 cylinders to the hospital. The charitable Mayani hospital situated at Ashaganj had demanded three oxygen cylinders for neonatal care ward on April 29. The administration didn't provide oxygen and asked them to shut the facility. So, the hospital on Monday night sent messages to the relatives of Coronavirus patients that they should shift their patients to other hospitals as the oxygen supply would last till 10am on Tuesday. There was panic in patients and relatives and some of them shifted their patients. One of the relatives said that all hospitals were full and it was not possible for them to take their patient anywhere else. The message said that the hospital had not got oxygen supply from Air Liquid North India Private Limited as the quota was fixed by the central government and, therefore, there was scarcity of oxygen. The hospital tried its best to arrange oxygen at government level but failed. The supply would last till 10am on Tuesday and, therefore, attendants were requested to shift patients to other hospitals. Later, the district administration interfered and provided 50 oxygen cylinders to the private hospital. The administration also directed the hospital not to shift patients elsewhere. The administration of charitable hospital Miyani said that they provide neonatal care for the newborn babies and the hospital did not have oxygen. Dr Rakesh Bhargava said from April 29 they were begging the district administration to provide three oxygen cylinders to the hospital but they instead asked them to close the hospital. On a positive note, Panchsheel Covid care hospital started on Tuesday with 27 beds with oxygen and 8 patients were admitted. The administration is trying to increase the beds. Officials said that the new hospital will reduce the pressure on JLN Hospital. Those complaining of low flow of oxygen are admitted in this hospital.

---||Kolkata||Citizens use crowdfunding to help Cov patients||Kolkata: To meet the rising crisis of medical oxygen in the city, a bunch of good Samaritans in the city have resorted to crowdfunding to buy empty oxygen cylinders, getting them refilled and delivered free of cost to those in need. The initiatives — taken by individuals as well as community-help groups — have already resulted in offering lifeline to a number of Covid patients, who had failed to procure an oxygen cylinder either due to unavailability or skyrocketing price in the black market, after the youths stepped in and delivered it at their doorstep free of cost. “We were moved seeing friends, companions and hundreds of known and unknown people on social media gasping for oxygen. We had to do something, so we started a crowdfunding venture over Facebook and within two days, we accumulated around Rs 10 lakh. With that, we bought 20 oxygen cylinders and are getting them refilled to help people in need. We are keeping the cylinders in four clubs at four corners of the city and people can either collect it and get it delivered for free showing the doctor’s prescription and the current saturation level of the patient,” said Swarnabha Dey, a young stand-up comedian from Garia who also runs a free primary school in Purulia. “We are in the process of procuring more cylinders in the next week,” he added. Film and web series script writer Arkadeep Nath did not even wait for the crowdfunding money to reach bank accounts as he invested over one lakh rupees from his own pocket to buy 10 oxygen cylinders that he has been refilling and delivering to people all by himself over the last seven days. “The city needs more people to come forward and contribute in whatever manner they can. My office has also allotted me an office car for all the running around,” said Nath, who has been storing cylinders at a colleague’s office in Gariahat. Some groups of volunteers are even planning to set up transit camps with oxygen support, before a patient can manage a hospital bed. One such group is Quarantine Student Youth Network — a network of students who have been working for Covid patients and migrant workers since last year. “We are in the process of setting up a temporary transit camp somewhere in or near Md Ali Park in north Kolkata where we would offer temporary oxygen support to patients in need before they can arrange a hospital bed,” said Manmatha Roy, a PhD student at ISI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/citizens-use-crowdfunding-to-help-cov-patients/articleshow/82393812.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Party leaders felt it was a loss of face for the party as it is the home district of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and his constituency Gajwel also falls under this district. In that election held in November 2020, minister Harish Rao was incharge. Six months down the line, in municipal elections, the TRS proved that the party’s dominance is intact in Siddipet. The party won 36 wards of 43 wards in Siddipet municipality in the elections held on April 30. The pink party’s main opponent, BJP which contested in 40 seats, won in one seat. Interestingly, BJP, in the previous 2016 municipal elections, had won two seats in the municipality. Siddipet district BJP president Dudi Srikanth Reddy, who contested in this election,lost. Minister Harish Rao, who also represents Siddipet assembly constituency, camped in the town for the past two months and did underground work. He ensured all important leaders from other parties come to the pink party’s fold. TDP district president Gundu Bhupesh and other leaders joined the TRS just before the election. Harish Rao said the TRS government had developed the town by allocating several hundreds of crores in the past six years. “We have sought the votes based on developmental works taken up in the municipality,” the minister said. The party released a development report of Siddipet few weeks ago. While three independents won in the election, all three of them joined the TRS a few hours after declaration of the results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-makes-comeback-after-dubbak-setback/articleshow/82394733.cms||Koride Mahesh

They demanded immediate supply of medical oxygen and started raising slogans. A purported video of the incident in Dalpatpur area has gone viral. “I have been waiting here since last night. We are being repeatedly told that oxygen will be provided soon, but nobody is bothered. My father-in-law passed away and now my mother-in-law requires oxygen, urgently. We don't know what these people are doing,” said Sunita, outside the plant. Another local accused the plant management of black marketing. “I have been struggling to get oxygen cylinders for 12 days now. My mother is critical and needs medical oxygen daily. They only give oxygen cylinders at high price,” said Abid Ali. Manisha, another resident who was profusely crying, said, “My family member is a heart and diabetic patient, and needs oxygen immediately. I have been requesting oxygen for three days. They only make excuses. Vehicles loaded with oxygen can be seen leaving the plant daily.” Anil Yadav, the driver of the truck that was stopped, said that there were 80 oxygen cylinders on the vehicle for several Covid hospitals in Moradabad. He said the service to hospitals was delayed due to the protest by locals. Satya Bahadur, oxygen plant in-charge, present at the site, refuted all the allegations and said that the plant was providing oxygen to the public. He also dismissed the charges of black marketing. A heavy police force was later deployed outside the plant to bring the situation under control. When contacted, Chajlet police station SI Parvinder Singh said, “There are clear instructions by the Moradabad district magistrate Rakesh Kumar that authorised vehicles carrying oxygen to hospital cannot be stopped. Moreover, teams have been formed by the district administration to ensure that those in need are provided oxygen. However, locals have accused a gas manufacturing unit. The unit has been directed to do the needful. People are being provided oxygen based on Covid report and doctors' prescriptions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/after-waiting-for-hours-at-oxygen-plant-covid-patients-kin-block-o2-truck-in-up/articleshow/82393085.cms||Maria Khan

These are then picked up by food delivery aggregators and are left at the doorsteps of the patients,” explained Hanishka Agarwal, one of the core members of the team. “Once we start sending food to patients in home treatment, we keep tracking their progress, so that when they are out of the quarantine, we can de-link them and do similar handholding for others,” said Mahek Gupta, another student.

Around Rs 3,000 crore is estimated to be the cost of the vaccination drive. The chief minister at a recent meeting with people’s representatives sought their cooperation and said that in the current circumstances, the MLAs had to part with Rs 3 cr this year from the fund to vaccinate people against Covid. This would give the state about Rs 600 crore this year. The MLA LAD which was Rs 2.25 crore per annum was increased in the last assembly session to Rs 5 crore. The MLA fund has also been used by the government to augment community health centres and primary health centres last year during the first wave of Covid. Some MLAs have already started donating the amount to the CM relief fund. Another fund the state government set its eyes on is the district mineral development fund. This fund was created in 2015 with the objective to work for the benefit of the persons and areas affected by mining related operations. Under this fund, every holder of a mining lease or a prospecting licence-cum-mining, in addition to the royalty, pays to District Mineral Foundation, a trust formed at the district where the mining operations are carried out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mla-funds-to-be-used-to-vaccinate-18-age-category/articleshow/82394732.cms||Joychen Joseph

With regard to oxygen, the court directed the state government to explore the possibility of operation of oxygen generation plants in the state, which are not in operation, but the same are capable of producing the gas. Observing the shortage of medical staff in this crisis, the court also advised the state government to consider taking the services of final year students as well as PG students and deployment of the nursing staff on an emergent basis, if they were suitable in all respects to serve the general public at large. The division bench has sought an affidavit with regard to compliance of these orders before the next date of hearing, May 6, including the details about sourcing of oxygen and other medicines for the treatment of Covid.

There aren’t any significant changes in these parameters.” Data showed there were roughly 50,666 Covid mortalities from March 2020 till January 2021 in Maharashtra and 2,243 more from February 1, 2021, till March 15, 2021. Apart from the presence of a higher number of comorbidities and greater propensity to step out for work or social life in the case of men, disease specialists said biological factors appear to be at play here as well. Piyush Chaudhari, infectious diseases specialist at Jehangir Hospital, Pune, told TOI: “A relatively milder disease in females compared to males can be explained by higher interferons and Interleukin 10 production in females, among such other biological factors. A virus-infected cell releases interferons causing nearby cells to heighten their anti-viral defenses while Interleukin-10 is an essential immunosuppressive cytokine, with the ability to resolve inflammation and promote wound repair.” He said estrogen, a female hormone, could also be at play as it can lower the activity of harmful pathways (as well as increase that of useful pathways) associated with inflammation, vascular permeability and lung oedema. International studies over the past year have pointed to this trend. A meta-analysis of 31,11,714 reported global cases by the Centre for Rheumatology Research, UCL, London, had said last December that while there was no difference in the proportion of males and females with confirmed Covid-19, male patients had almost three times the odds of requiring intensive treatment unit and higher odds of death as compared to females. Another US study from Houston, based on data from electronic medical records, published earlier this year said among hospitalised patients, males were more likely to have complications, require ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, and had higher mortality than females, independent of age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-virus-claimed-over-twice-as-many-men-as-women-in-state-in-both-waves/articleshow/82393099.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Kolkata||Vax booster: 4 lakh Covishield, 1 lakh Covaxin doses to arrive in Kolkata today||KOLKATA: The state’s Covid-19 vaccine stock is set to get replenished on Wednesday with the scheduled arrival of new Covishield and Covaxin consignments. Sources in the health department said 4 lakh doses of Covishield and 1 lakh doses of Covaxin will be flown in from Pune and Hyderabad on Wednesday. While these doses will be sent from the central government’s vaccine quota, the state government has also started the procurement process on its own directly from the manufacturers — Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech. “The procurement process by the state government from its own coffers has commenced. If all goes well, we should have doses of both the vaccines very soon to launch the third phase drive and start vaccinating people from the 18-44 age group soon,” said a source in the health department. According to sources, the state has placed an initial order of 10.6 lakh Covishield doses and 3.6 lakh Covaxin doses. Both the manufacturers have responded and logistics are being worked out. The Union health ministry had earlier told state governments that beginning May 1, vials routed through the GOI channel would have to be used for vaccinating only people in the age group of 45 and above and healthcare and frontline workers, for both first and second doses. States were asked to buy the doses for the 18-44 inoculation drive on their own. “The vials sent through government of India currently are being used only in government CVCs to vaccinate the 45-plus category. But there is already an increasing rush on government facilities. Therefore, if we get the two consignments, it will be a huge relief,” said the source. As private CVCs have shut their vaccination programme since May 1, leading to a tremendous rush at government facilities, the government CVCs said they were unable to meet demand. In anticipation of the pressure, the government has already deployed cops at some of its CVCs to manage the crowd. Some hospitals like MR Bangur on Tuesday had men in uniform controlling the crowd. “Even as we have been told to prioritize people whose second doses are due, we are getting lots of people for the first dose. Many are queuing up since early morning. But the supply is already rationed and hence some are returning without getting the jab,” said the coordinator of government CVC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-booster-4-lakh-covishield-1-lakh-covaxin-doses-to-arrive-in-city-today/articleshow/82393823.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Standing instructions have been issued to all officials by the department’s chairman and managing director (CMD). The move comes after a tanker from Bhiwadi to RUHS broke down a few days ago. Rajasthan roadways CMD Rajeshwar Singh said, “A few days ago when a tanker broke down, a team from Jaipur workshop went to deal with the problem. In case such an incident occurs again, all assistance will be given by roadways. At times, the staff waits for permission from seniors but keeping in mind the pandemic, supply of oxygen is a priority which should not be hindered and our workshop will ensure repair of the vehicles if required.” During Covid, the roadways is also providing free travel to students who are appearing for competitive exams within the state limits as was announced in the budget two months ago. Previously too, the department had helped the migrant workers by dropping them to other state borders as well as railway stations. "At present, we are trying to get our drivers as well as conductors vaccinated as they come in contact with hundreds of people on a daily basis. They are also frontline workers and I have spoken to district administration officials of all the depots in the state to set up vaccination camps for our staff," said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/roadways-to-provide-repair-assistance-to-o2-tankers/articleshow/82394745.cms||---

Police are yet to establish if the suspect was really an employee of a private finance company. The businessman, who deals in infrastructure projects, lodged a complaint with the Vishrantwadi police on Monday. The victim wanted to install a chemical plant for his business and needed funds to set it up. He approached the finance company in February and sought a loan. He met a man at the company’s office, who promised to give him a loan of Rs16 crore against mortgage of a property. The FIR stated the employee told the victim to pay Rs32.38 lakh as registration fee and loan charges. He then called the victim to the firm’s Thane branch for registration, but switched off his cellphone. Police said the victim approached the finance company and realized no such transaction was executed at the firm.

UP-Rera has taken cognizance of the situation and says it may offer deadline extensions to builders.Pankaj Bajaj, president of Credai-NCR, said: “Sourcing material has once again become a problem with weekend markets being shut, also over 25% migrant workers have left for their home towns. As a result, running day-to-day work has become a problem. We are not being able to stick to timelines. The completion deadlines of ongoing projects may be affected.” UP-Rera has taken cognizance of the situation. “We understand the current situation and may consider some relaxation for builders in the coming days, though nothing has been decided so far,” UP-Rera member Balvinder Kumar said.Noida and Greater Noida together have around two lakh apartments due for delivery. UP-Rera has already given an extension to the builders for their apartments under-construction as on March 25, 2020. While work resumed after Unlock, the cities could not get back the entire workforce engaged earlier. As opposed to the pre-pandemic strength of around four lakh, the cities together barely have around 1 lakh workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/25-workers-left-projects-may-get-delayed-realtors/articleshow/82395909.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Eatala Rajender, aides likely to get notices on temple land encroachment||HYDERABAD: After the high court found fault with Medak district collector’s report on assigned land encroachment allegedly by former minister Eatala Rajender’s firm Jamuna Hatcheries, the state government is going slow on the alleged encroachment of endowments land by Eatala and his associates in Devaryamjal village in Shamirpet on the outskirts of the city. Though the IAS officers’ committee got into the action immediately to probe 1,521 acres of land falling into encroachers’ hands, the government is reportedly considering serving notices on Eatala and his associates who are allegedly in possession of the controversial land before initiating any action, sources said. The land belongs to Sri Seetha Rama Swamy temple, endowments officials said. The committee headed by panchayat raj department secretary M Raghunandan Rao with Nalgonda district collector Prashant Jeevan Patil, Mancherial district collector Bharati Hollikari and Medchal-Malkajgiri district collector Swetha Mohanty as its members visited the site on Monday and also on Tuesday and called for records. The committee members even went to the revenue divisional officer offices at Keesara and Malkajgiri on Tuesday and went through the records. Official sources said many of the land claimants, including Eatala, had constructed godowns on the controversial land and leased them out to private persons. There are as many as 50 godowns in the area. “The state government has asked the committee to submit the report at the earliest. But, it may take a couple of days to complete the procedures. The committee has also sought records from the endowment department,” sources in the government said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-aides-likely-to-get-notices-on-temple-land-encroachment/articleshow/82394746.cms||Koride Mahesh

The department officers had been instructed to initiate appropriate process for the same, he added. During the the state-level covid monitoring committee meeting, presided over by Vij, the minister said the officers should ensure 24-hour availability of oxygen in the state to ensure that no patient faced any problem in this regard. He said that every possible effort should be made to pick up Haryana’s oxygen quota from Orissa. The health minister said the process of providing Tocilizumab and Remdesivir medicines should be started online in various government and private hospitals of the state. These will be made available free of cost in government hospitals and at purchase price at private hospitals as per the requirement. Vij, who also heads the state home department, said it would be mandatory to carry departmental I-cards or government-issued passes for any movement during the ongoing lockdown in the state. Strict action should be taken against those commuting without due permission. The minister said this in a meeting of senior police officers here.

The hospital has procured its stock from Bharat Biotech and 250 recipients were administered their first dose of Covaxin on Day 1. So far, the Covid vaccination centre (CVC) at Woodlands is the only centre in Bengal to flag off the third phase inoculation drive. “We have got our first consignment from Bharat Biotech and we began the third phase with 250 recipients. From Wednesday, our target will be to administer 1,000 doses. We are planning to extend the drive to our three off-site CVCs — CESC House, International Management Institute Kolkata and Goodrich Centre,” said Rupali Basu, MD and CEO of Woodlands Hospital. The hospital had opened its booking around 9.50pm on Monday through Co-Win app and within minutes, 250 applicants booked their slots. “We chose Covaxin due to its higher efficacy, its potentials of neutralising the new strains and the shorter gap between the two doses. Bharat Biotech has assured us supply so that we could carry on the drive uninterrupted,” said Basu. The hospital is charging Rs 1,500 per person – Rs 1,200 being the price of the vaccine and the rest hospital charges. Other private CVCs have stopped their vaccination from May 1 due to unavailability of vaccines. Most have approached the vaccine manufacturers and are waiting for response. “We are trying to source vaccines. Though we are yet to get clear confirmation, the efforts are on for procuring them,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (East) of Narayana Health. Meanwhile private hospitals have also submitted their requirement for second doses to the state government. “We have around 3000 people whose second dose is due. We have submitted our requirement accordingly,” said Simmardeep Gill, COO of CK Birla Hospitals CMRI. “We want to resume the inoculation drive as soon as possible. While keeping the communication on with the manufacturers, we have also specified our requirement of 45,000 vials to the state government,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO of Peerless Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/1-pvt-hosp-starts-phase-iii-drive-others-wait-for-vials/articleshow/82393831.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

According to doctors there was 90% blockage in the blood vessels of the patient’s heart. The patient had suffered heart attack four days after he was admitted to the CPR hospital for treatment of Covid-19. The patient had tested positive for the contagion after being arrested by Ichalkaranji police. Akshay Bafna, cardiologist at the hospital, said, “After performing preliminary tests we found there were blockages. Our observations revealed that the blockages are due to severe Covid inflammation and weakening of the immune system. In such cases, most of the time the patient dies. But after lot of thinking we decided to perform the surgery for which we ensured the blood continously moves inside his body for which we gave him medicines for thinning the blood.” Bafna said that for the first time a critical surgery was performed on a Covid patient in the region. “Despite the threat of being infected, my team decided to save the life of the patient. Many people who have postponed their critical surgeries due to Covid infection will be inspired to undergo surgery. Also, those developing multi-organ complications and need surgical procedures to cope up their lives too will be saved,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/covid-patient-undergoes-heart-surgery-at-cpr-hosp/articleshow/82393115.cms||---

The total number of beneficaries who got inoculated in this category since its launch on May 1 stood at 1,32,476. Though people in large numbers have got themselves registered for vaccination, very few are getting time slots and site bookings. Authorities said such is the enthusiasm among this category that slots are booked within minutes after they are opened. However, many youngsters who have not been lucky alleged that there are problems in the CoWIN and Aarogya Setu browsers. “I got myself registered on May 2 but still haven’t been able to find vaccination sites. When I open to see the options, the sites already get booked,” said Deependra Agarwal, a 21-year-old pursuing BSc from a private college in the city. Apart from the government-run centres, some private institutions are providing Covaxin at a cost of Rs 1,250 per vaccine. Out of the 54,183 shots administered on Tuesday, 8,509 got their first jab in Alwar followed by Jaipur (7,454), Pali(6,065), Bikaner(5,189), Sikar(4,957), Bharatpur (4,575), Kota (4,543), Jodhpur (4,312), Udaipur (4,161), Ajmer(2,492), Dholpur (1,113) and Bhilwara (813).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/54k-youths-in-18-age-group-vaccinated-in-state-city-tops-list/articleshow/82394753.cms||---
---||Pune||Curbs hit production, employment in district||Pune: Lockdown-like restrictions imposed over the course of April have severely affected production and employment in Pune region, as according to the latest monthly survey by the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture (MCCIA). Compared to March, several companies have revised their timelines — for a return to pre-Covid levels of production and employment — to three to six months or more. The micro, small, and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs), which form the bulk of the industrial belt in the region, bore the brunt of the dip in industrial activity. As per the report, production across manufacturing and services was 69% in April, down from 83% in March. Around 70% of the employees were at work at these units in April, compared to 86% in April. However, the data also shows that the impact was much softer compared to the total lockdown imposed in 2020— employment had stood at only 21% this time last year. “Given the heightened levels of restrictions, the drop was expected. I’m glad it was not as bad as in April 2020. Any further restrictions need to allow for an increased level of economic activity as the impact of those in a hand-to-mouth existence would be unbearable,” MCCIA director-general Prashant Girbane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/curbs-hit-production-employment-in-district/articleshow/82393836.cms||---

The police team that reached the accident spot, was initially not aware of the victim’s identity. Using the two-wheeler’s registration number, the police contacted the deceased man’s family, only to find that he was the same Covid patient who had disappeared from the hospital.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Jab centre plan for cinema hall||KOLKATA: Priya cinema is all set to become the first single screen theatre in Bengal, and possibly in the country, to be turned into a Covid-19 vaccination centre. What’s unique is that the cinema will also offer free cine-viewing experience as well during the waiting period on its premises before and after vaccination. The owner of Priya, Arijit Dutta, told TOI that the plight of people waiting in long queues at vaccination centres prompted him to take this initiative. “My single screen theatre is shut now. So, I have a property that can be used to help people. This will reduce the stress and discomfort of the elderly who have to wait in the heat or in congested places for vaccination. The letters have been issued already,” Dutta said. The president of the Medica Hospitals group, Saumitra Bharadwaj, said, “We are trying to find space closer to the city dwelling and vaccinate as many people as possible. The idea, which Arijit also supports, is that we can offer a bit of entertainment when people come to get vaccinated.” The vaccination fee will be the same at Priya like hospitals. “Our paperwork, which also involves permission from Swastha Bhawan to recognize this as a Covid-19 vaccination centre, should come through by Sunday. Currently, I have zero vaccine and am waiting for the supply from the government,” Bharadwaj added. The drive will start as soon as the vaccine supplies are available. Currently, the aim is to vaccinate 1,000 people daily. “I hope other cinemas follow Arijit’s example,” Bharadwaj added. Tollywood is thrilled with this initiative. Director Arindam Sil first came to know about it from Dutta. “This is an exemplary service on Arijit’s part. For months, Priya is not giving him any business while he is having to bear the overhead cost. Yet, he has chosen to carry out his social responsibility this way. This is an incredibly exemplary and I think the module should be adopted by others,” Sil said. Once online registration is done, people will be asked to arrive at the theatre at a given date and time. At the designated time of arrival, the formalities will be cleared on the ground floor. “People can then wait in the air conditioned comfort of our theatre. All lights will not be turned off in the auditorium, even though the film will run. The section meant for rare stall will be used for this purpose. Once a person’s turn is announced, he or she will walk out of the auditorium and get vaccinated on either the first floor or second floor lobby,” he added. Dutta will soon begin talking to distributors about the screenings, 90% of which will be in Bengali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jab-centre-plan-for-cinema-hall/articleshow/82393840.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

A section of senior citizens has also questioned the rationale behind making them wait for the vaccination even as the the drive for those in the age group of 18-44 is on using available stock. “The civic administration and the government at large should complete the vaccination of senior citizens on a priority basis. The other age groups, being less vulnerable, can wait till the vaccine shortage eases out,” said Babasaheb Jadhav, a 65- year old who is yet to get the first dose. Nandini Kolhe , another senior citizen, said that she was facing issues in getting the second dose. “I took my first dose around 45 days ago. Despite repeated visits to the vaccine centres, I am no table to get the second dose since the last three days,” she said. When contacted, immunization officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) Dr Smita Nalgirkar said that the civic administration was expected to get fresh stock of vaccine shortly. “Vehicles are being already sent for procurement of vaccine doses from Pune and the stock is expected to arrive by Wednesday. Based upon supply of vaccine doses, we will vaccinate all target beneficiaries, including senior citizens,” she said. As per official data, municipal limits of Aurangabad has reported over 2.37 lakh vaccinations by Monday, including 975 beneficiaries in the age group of 18-45 and another 71,855 above 60 years of age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/elderly-demand-priority-amid-vaccine-shortage/articleshow/82393826.cms||---
---||Kolkata||May’s 1st nor’wester pulls temp down by 6 degrees||Kolkata: A nor’wester on Monday night — the first in May — followed by a series of thunderstorm spells through the night till Tuesday early morning — dragged the mercury down by six degrees below the normal. Met office expects the weather to remain pleasant for now as the thunderstorm activities will continue. The maximum temperature on Tuesday plunged to 29.5°C which was 6° below the normal mark. On Monday, it had remained as high as 31.5°C. The minimum temperature too shot down five notches below the normal to 21.2°C against 23.6°C the previous day, hitting the fourth lowest for May in a decade. The three occasions in May when the minimum temperature had skidded below that of Monday was in 2020, 2013 and 2012 (21.1°C, 20.9°C and 20.1°C respectively). The squall on Monday night had the wind speed gusting up to 62 kmph from the Norwesterly direction. Several part of the city witnessed spells of rain cooling down the night temperature. This was the first nor’wester for this month though there have been three squalls in April. “We had already predicted an enhanced thunderstorm activity between May 2 and 6 and issued an alert in advance. Currently there is high pressure area over the Bay of Bengal and a cyclonic circulation over the neighbouring Bihar and Jharkhand. These two conditions have fuelled the enhanced thunderstorm activities. We will continue to encounter such thunderstorm activities for now,” said GK Das, director (weather) at Regional Meteorological Centre, Kolkata. According to Das, the high pressure zone is injecting moisture into the land while cloud formation from Bihar and Jharkhand areas are also reaching the region. These two combined are causing the current thunder storm activities. Met office says that though Wednesday is also likely to see such thunderstorm activities, chances of the same are less on Thursday. But Friday might may again see rounds of thundershowers in Kolkata as well as other parts of south Bengal. “The mix of rain and cloud cover will keep the mercury below the normal mark for now, swaying between 32°C and 34°C,” added Das. The minimum temperature is also expected to remain below the normal mark at around 24°C. The mercury had inched close to 40°C mark in the last week of April. Met officials said Nor’westers which is typical to Bengal happen before the pre-moon showers. The more frequent these thundershowers are the more respite for people from heat and humidity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mays-1st-norwester-pulls-temp-down-by-6-degrees/articleshow/82393829.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Lucknow||Samajwadi Party ahead in Uttar Pradesh panchayat polls, BJP opens back-channel talks with Independents||LUCKNOW/AGRA: The Samajwadi Party (SP) is surging ahead in the Uttar Pradesh panchayat polls, considered the bellwether of the high-stakes assembly polls next year, with counting trends indicating that SP-supported candidates were frontrunners in 747 zila panchayat wards, while BJP-backed nominees were leading or have won 666 seats. This has led to BJP scrambling to open back-channel negotiations with Independents who have won or are leading in 3,050 zila panchayat wards to seize control over the top tier of rural local bodies. Top sources in BJP said, the party is trying to reach out to 1,238 Independent candidates to wrest maximum posts of zila panchayat chairpersons, which would be held through indirect election. Trends show BSP and Congress supported candidates were leading on more than 322 and 77 zila panchayat wards, respectively. Though panchayat polls are not contested on party symbols, parties field their candidates and election campaigns are conducted in a centralised manner. A senior BJP functionary confirmed to TOI that the party was in touch with Independents, who also comprise party rebels. "Panchayat elections are more about local influential candidates who contest without support of any political party. That is the reason most winners or frontrunners are Independents. We fielded our party functionaries to cultivate grassroots leadership, which holds the key for any political party," said UP BJP vice-president and party in-charge for panchayat elections, Vijay Bahadur Pathak. While Pathak refused to comment on back-channel talks with Independents, experts said that BJP enjoys the advantage of being the ruling party and would garner the support of Independents to win zila panchayat chairperson posts. BJP fared poorly even in places where it provided strategic support. In Mainpuri, the party failed to take advantage of roping in Sandhya Yadav, niece of Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. Sandhya was defeated by SP-backed candidate Pramod Yadav. While SP won 12 seats, BJP got eight seats. Congress won one seat and nine went to Independent candidates. In Aligarh, Independents stole the show by winning 21 of the 47 seats. BJP and SP won nine and seven seats, respectively. SP chief spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said the party’s impressive performance was despite BJP deploying its entire political machinery, including MPs, MLAs and ministers, in the villages. "The voting pattern in panchayat elections is a pointer to what lies in store in the 2022 assembly elections. People have understood the real face and governance of BJP," he said. Chaudhary claimed the party had also decided to leave seats where Independent candidates were in a better position. "Independents won’t get trampled upon by BJP," he said. State BJP secretary Vijay Shivhare, however, claimed that most of the Independent candidates who won were from BJP, so the party had "gained significantly".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-ahead-in-up-panchayat-polls-bjp-opens-back-channel-talks-with-inds/articleshow/82395925.cms||Pankaj Shah

Trends show BSP and Congress supported candidates were leading on more than 322 and 77 zila panchayat wards, respectively. Though panchayat polls are not contested on party symbols, parties field their candidates and election campaigns are conducted in a centralised manner. A senior BJP functionary confirmed to TOI that the party was in touch with Independents, who also comprise party rebels. "Panchayat elections are more about local influential candidates who contest without support of any political party. That is the reason most winners or frontrunners are Independents. We fielded our party functionaries to cultivate grassroots leadership, which holds the key for any political party," said UP BJP vice-president and party in-charge for panchayat elections, Vijay Bahadur Pathak. While Pathak refused to comment on back-channel talks with Independents, experts said that BJP enjoys the advantage of being the ruling party and would garner the support of Independents to win zila panchayat chairperson posts. BJP fared poorly even in places where it provided strategic support. In Mainpuri, the party failed to take advantage of roping in Sandhya Yadav, niece of Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. Sandhya was defeated by SP-backed candidate Pramod Yadav. While SP won 12 seats, BJP got eight seats. Congress won one seat and nine went to Independent candidates. In Aligarh, Independents stole the show by winning 21 of the 47 seats. BJP and SP won nine and seven seats, respectively. SP chief spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said the party’s impressive performance was despite BJP deploying its entire political machinery, including MPs, MLAs and ministers, in the villages. "The voting pattern in panchayat elections is a pointer to what lies in store in the 2022 assembly elections. People have understood the real face and governance of BJP," he said. Chaudhary claimed the party had also decided to leave seats where Independent candidates were in a better position. "Independents won’t get trampled upon by BJP," he said. State BJP secretary Vijay Shivhare, however, claimed that most of the Independent candidates who won were from BJP, so the party had "gained significantly".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/sp-ahead-in-up-panchayat-polls-bjp-opens-back-channel-talks-with-inds/articleshow/82397168.cms||Pankaj Shah

They also allegedly slapped the man's sister for coming to his rescue. Police, however, refuted the family's allegations and booked the man for "flouting Covid norms and misbehaving". They have also launched a probe against the accused cop. The cops were on duty to enforce night curfew in the area under Katghar police limits. The incident was purportedly caught on a CCTV camera, a clip of which has been making the rounds on social media. In the clip, a few cops can be seen "manhandling a youth following an altercation". The family accused sub-inspector Mayank Goyal, deputed at Dar Sarai police outpost, of entering their house and pushing the girl and slapping her. “My brother was thrashed for not wearing a face mask and the policemen followed him. One of the cops pushed me when I went downstairs to check out what's going on. The same personnel followed me upstairs and slapped me twice,” the man's sister alleged. “They should have issued a challan, according to the law. We demand legal action against the cops who thrashed my children,” the duo's father said. However, the police dismissed all the allegations and blamed the young man for not following the Covid protocol and "misbehaving" with them. Katghar SHO Gajendra Singh said, “A case has been registered against the man, who is still at large, under provisions of Epidemic Disease Act, 1897, and under various IPC sections.” Moradabad SP (city) Amit Kumar Anand said, “A man was intercepted by police for flouting Covid-19 guidelines, including not wearing a face mask and wandering despite night curfew, in Katghar area on Monday. A CCTV footage has also been accessed and a probe is on against the accused police on duty. Legal action will be taken based on the probe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/cops-beat-up-youth-for-not-wearing-mask-chase-him-si-pushes-sister-slaps-her-too/articleshow/82393116.cms||Maria Khan

In April 2021, three ventilators were sent to Alibaug civil hospital; the other two are unused due to unavailability of physicians, intensivists and anesthetists,” alleged activist Nanda Mhatre. “The ventilators could not be used at the SDHs due to lack of intensivists and anesthetists so were shifted to Alibaug hospital. In some places, ventilators have been loaned to private hospitals, where intensivists are available,” Raigad collector Nidhi Chaudhary said. “Nearly 50% of ventilator beds are vacant as of now...

Under this initiative, the firm has provided as many as 10 pick up vans to help over 130 private Covid hospitals in the city for picking empty oxygen cylinders from hospitals and take them to oxygen manufacturers/retailers and after refill handing them back to the hospitals. The service will be provided for free. Nashik IMA president Hemant Sonasis said the initiative has come as a boon for private hospitals since they do not need to spend time in arranging logistics for transportation of empty cylinders. “With Mahindra Logistics taking care of this crucial exercise, the hospitals can now focus on other important aspects of Covid treatment,” he added. The availability of medical oxygen in Nashik is still erratic and private hospitals have to slog hard to arrange cylinders and bring them to the hospitals. According to the project coordinator Kiran Shinde, on the first day of the initiative (on Monday) over 200 jumbo cylinders were provided to private hospitals. “The doctors fraternity is extremely happy with the initiative,” Shinde said. The IMA has appointed 10 doctors for coordinating with hospitals in localities like Gangapur Road, Nashik Road, Satpur, Cidco, Mumbai Naka etc. “We have shared the mobile numbers of these coordinating doctors in the WhatsApp group that private Covid hospitals are a part of. Once a hospital makes a request for pickup and delivery of cylinders, the authorities of Mahindra Logistics get the information and the vehicle is sent to that hospital immediately,” Shinde added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/oxygen-on-wheels-initiative-kicks-off-in-nashik-city/articleshow/82393129.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Messages of orphaned children up for adoption have been doing the rounds of social media of late. Activists and officials from the Dnyana Devi Childline have appealed to people not to circulate such messages as they can put children in danger of trafficking. Such children need to be handed over to the local child welfare committee or the police, they said. The process of adoption is centralised. Not following proper procedure can attract criminal proceedings, added the activists. Manisha Biraris, assistant commissioner, women and child development department and programme manager, Integrated Child Protection Scheme, said, “We are coming up with a helpline number for children who have been orphaned due to the death of their parents. Either the children themselves or their relatives or anyone who knows about such children can call on this helpline. The department is looking at options regarding arrangement of temporary home facilities for children whose parents are hospitalised or quarantined. As for the messages circulating on social media, this is completely illegal. We have written to cyber police officials to look into the issue.” Anuradha Sahasrabudhe, director, Dnyana Devi Childline Pune, said, “Orphaned children have to be handed over to the local child welfare committee or the police who would then place the child in a suitable shelter, verify the case and then declare them free for adoption.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hand-over-orphaned-kids-to-cwc-cops-say-activists/articleshow/82393845.cms||Ardhra Nair

Speaking to reporters here, NCP national spokesman and state minister Nawab Malik referred to the statement of TMC chief Mamata Banerjee who reportedly said Opposition unity was necessary. “Sharad Pawar was also trying to unite all Opposition parties before the Bengal elections. In the next few days, Pawar will work for the unity of Opposition parties, especially of regional parties,” Malik said. When asked about the post-poll violence in Bengal, he said such incidents must be condemned. “West Bengal was under the charge of the election commission for the last 100 days. Reports of violence came during the poll campaigning as well...Responsibility needs to be fixed. Violence during the campaign and after the poll result needs to be condemned,” he said. Targeting the BJP, Malik said the saffron party should stop its politics of hate and allow the Mamata Banerjee government to function.

---||Nagpur||Stamp duty mop up exceeds target in city||Nagpur: Stamp duty collection for the financial year 2020-21 has finally crossed the target set for the city. This is being attributed to the cut in duty rates announced by the state in September, as a part of Covid relief measures. There is a mixed view among builders on the development, though. A section of builders TOI talked to said these were mainly old deals that were registered by March-end to take advantage of the reduced rates. Others said the reduction in duty and offers by banks and realtors spurred genuine fresh demand for real estate, especially homes. Builders, however, say the coming times are tough with slower demand and higher input costs due to rising rates of steel and cement. There is also view that with rates moderating, it may be best time to buy a property. The state government had reduced stamp duty rates to 3% from September last year as against 6% earlier. The 3% rates were applicable till December 31. From January 20 to March 21, it was 4%. The rates are back to 6% from April onwards. Stamp duty is paid on purchase of property. The collections as on March stand at Rs732 crore, which is 16% higher than the target set for the fiscal. This was generated on sale of over 82,000 properties registered in the city during last fiscal. In March, 1,753 documents were registered generating a total stamp duty of Rs167 crore. Gaurav Agrawala, secretary of Confederation of Real Estate and Developers Association of India’s (CREDAI) Nagpur unit, said duty cut had indeed led to an increase in demand. Nearly 80% of the registrations were from fresh buying and rest out of pending deals, he said. “The industry is now dogged by rising construction costs due to an abrupt increase in cement and steel prices. Steel rates have touched Rs52,000 a tonne and cement is over Rs300 a bag from Rs200 earlier. This will take the construction cost to Rs2,200 a square feet, at least,” said Agrawala. Lockdown has also affected the work, he added. Steel rates have crossed Rs50,000 from Rs45000 a tonne a month ago, said a manufacturer. Tejinder Singh Renu from Vidarbha Taxpayers’ Association (VTA) and also a builder said most of the duty is expected to have been generated due do old agreements being finally registered to take advantage of the reduced duty rates. “Majority of the registrations were for purchase of open plots as against built-up flats. The demand is slow,” said another builder requesting anonymity. Former president of CREDAI Nagpur Sunil Duddalwar said it’s not only steel but even rates of copper used for electric wiring, paints and a whole gamut of other inputs have gone up. Builders want to put a demand for another round of reduction in stamp duty to support the realty sector. “There is a demand for prime property, but the market is witnessing a slowdown for real estate of average pricing category. There are buyers for higher end properties, but not for the middle level units that form a large part of the market,” said Pankaj Roshan, a broker. The sentiment of the general home buyer is down, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stamp-duty-mop-up-exceeds-target-in-city/articleshow/82394763.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Kolkata||Online sales, home delivery help mall retailers keep business afloat after govt closure notice||Kolkata: Retailers at malls have turned to online sales and home delivery of goods to keep the business afloat following the sudden closure order. Even before the government announced the shutdown of malls on Friday, footfalls had nosedived and retailers were beginning to channelize resources to drive online sales. But now, they are going the whole hog, messaging their client list about products and deals on offer to entice them to make a purchase from their homes. While apparel sales, particularly comfortable home wear and summer clothes, have picked up, luxury stores selling expensive products are also enticing customers with sweetened offers. Quest mall vice-president Sanjeev Mehra said stores had even delivered home bags priced over Rs 1 lakh. “For retailers at the mall, online sales usually constitute 8-10% of business. But in April when footfalls dropped, it had increased to 20-25%. Now, the only sale that can happen for the stores other than hypermarkets is online,” he said. As Ramesh Pandey, the wholetime director of Ambuja Realty that owns and operates the twin City Centre malls, pointed out that apparel retailers may find it difficult to sell online as they would have to compete with exclusive platforms like Myntra, Flipkart and Ajio that have a wider range as they are not constrained by the space to store their products and operate out of warehouses. At South City, the mall management has not yet allowed retailers to use their stores to ship goods purchased online. “Since the store attendants will have to use public transport, we are careful. We have made arrangements for lodging and food of the housekeeping and maintenance staff to ensure that the mall upkeep is not hit by infections,” said South City Mall vice-president, Manmohan Bagree. That is a learning that nearly all the malls acquired from the sudden lockdown last year when some had allowed the staff to return home and had then struggled with the upkeep of the facility. “Most of the staff live in suburbs. Though there is no lockdown yet, public commute is becoming hazardous. So, we have arranged for the critical staff to stay here,” said Pandey, adding that each mall was incurring an additional expense of Rs 40,000-50,000 for the arrangement in addition to the extra sanitization costs without any incremental revenue. Between Durga Puja and Poila Baisakh, footfall and sales at malls had steadily improved. But since mid-April, both had dropped sharply with only serious shoppers stepping in to pick up essentials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/online-sales-home-delivery-help-mall-retailers-keep-business-afloat-after-govt-closure-notice/articleshow/82393880.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The retired Army officer, who turns 100 on Wednesday, is also among the few in his exclusive age group to have recovered from Covid-19 in recent times. Gulati tested positive for the disease on March 15 and was admitted to city-based Medicover Hospital. He was discharged within a week upon recovering. “I tested positive after developing some breathing problems and weakness. My family members admitted me to hospital and I needed oxygen support for a couple of days,” he said, adding that he was administered remdesivir. Gulati says the post-Covid recovery period is important to regain total fitness. “Proper diet and rest helped me after my discharge from hospital. I kept telling myself that I would overcome the illness. Having that mindset played a key role in my quick recovery,” he said. Stating that no one should take the Covid infection lightly, Gulati said he was planning to get vaccinated soon. “The discipline I have observed in my daily routine throughout my life has helped me live longer. Amazingly, even at 100, I am fairly independent and manage to do all personal work myself,” he said. “My religion teaches me to face adversities with an inner strength and faith. I feel I am blessed to turn 100 and celebrate the day with my lovely family.” Born on May 5, 1921, in undivided India in Roopwal village near Rawalpindi, Gulati picked up a job with the ASC Records Office of the Indian Army and was posted in Lucknow during Partition. The entire unit of ASC Records was moved to Aurangabad in 1955. Gulati too had to move to Aurangabad with his wife and made the city his home for three generations.

It has pitched in with two separate fundraisers to help India, which is in the midst of a massive oxygen crisis in the wake of the second wave of Covid-19. While it has collaborated with the British Asian Trust (BAT) to raise funds for oxygen concentrators, which will be supplied to small towns and villages in the country, it has also taken part in the ‘BAPS Cycle to Save Lives’ fundraiser in the UK. In a laudable gesture, as of Monday morning, the Bharat Army, which boasts of over one lakh members globally, has raised £23,000. The funds were raised in just over a week since its campaign, ‘Oxygen For India emergency appeal’ kicked off, with BAT. With BAPS, it has contributed over £1000 in the UK. The initiative started on April 21. Overall, along with Bharat Army’s contributions — both BAT and BAPs in the UK — have raised over £2 million. “This money will help over 50,000 people in remote villages of India with the use of low flow Oxygen concentrators. Our next target is to reach £25,000. The Covid pandemic has hit India for a six. It is destroying Indian families and communities and we must do everything to help and support them as quickly as possible. There has been a huge amount of desire by our members to support those in India in real need. I do hope we can pull together and make a significant contribution to help,” Bharat Army founder Rakesh Patel told TOI from London on Monday.

---||Bareilly||With no safety kits, Asha workers on Covid duty refuse to work in rural Uttar Pradesh||BAREILLY: Scores of Asha (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers have refused to go to villages in Uttar Pradesh's Budaun district for Covid duty. They claimed that they were not provided with any safety kits, including sanitisers and face shields, and feared for their own health. Thousands of locals have recently returned to their native villages from Covid-affected cities and other states for the rural polls. Some of the Asha workers protested outside the Saidpur community health centre on Tuesday. They also went to the chief medical officer's (CMO) office in Budaun demanding proper safety kits for their task of door-to-door reporting of those who are sick and have Covid symptoms in the villages. Some of them alleged that seniors misbehaved with them. Asha worker Shakeela Begum said, “We should be given proper face shields and sanitisers at least for our Covid duty in rural areas. The officers even misbehaved with us when we requested for the kit." Asha workers in other places didn’t turn up due to lack of safety gears. An official said that these workers have received the vaccine jabs as they are "frontline warriors". "They should fearlessly lead the medical department in the rural areas as they have been working there since the beginning,” the official added. When contacted, Budaun’s CMO Yashpal Singh said, “Instead of starting their work, they started a protest. It is a pandemic and they should have behaved more responsibly. They didn’t contact their medical officer in-charge for the safety kit that includes gloves, sanitisers, face masks, etc." The CMO added, "Their work is to collect information about symptomatic patients and share it with the medical team. The team will collect samples of such people and ensure their treatment. Also, Asha workers have the funds for buying safety kits, but they are indulging in petty politics in such a difficult time.” Sources said that several people in the rural areas are dying of Covid symptoms, and most of them were not tested for Covid and hence the cases are being underreported. Recently, the state government decided to reach out to the people in rural areas to ensure proper testing and treatment are carried out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/with-no-safety-kits-asha-workers-on-covid-duty-refuse-to-work-in-rural-up/articleshow/82393141.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Agra||Panchayat polls: BJP suffers setback in west Uttar Pradesh||AGRA/MEERUT: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) faced a setback in the Uttar Pradesh panchayat polls as it failed to garner majority seats in Mathura, Mainpuri and Aligarh. The local body polls were held less than a year before the assembly elections scheduled in the state. The ongoing farmers’ protests and a shoddy handling of the Covid crisis for the past month could have contributed to the BJP’s debacles, say political experts. In Mathura, the temple town, the BJP managed to win only 8 of the 33 zila panchayat seats, while the BSP emerged the biggest gainer with 13 seats. The remaining seats were shared by RLD, SP and independent candidates who won 8, 1, and 3 respectively. Talking to TOI, BJP’s Mathura district president Madhu Sharma said, “We accept the public mandate. We will find out the reasons for not getting a majority and work on it.” She further said that due to the pandemic, many of their workers and leaders could not campaign in the elections effectively. In Mainpuri too, BJP failed to take advantage of roping in Sandhya Yadav, niece of Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. Sandhya was defeated by SP-backed candidate Pramod Yadav. While SP won 12 seats, the BJP got 8 seats. The Congress won 1 seat and 9 went to independent candidates. Samajwadi Party district president Devendra Singh Yadav told TOI that BJP-backed candidates won 8 seats because of their own party workers, who fought independently after not getting nomination seats. “BJP has otherwise no existence in Mainpuri,” he claimed. Though the panchayat polls are not contested on party symbols, parties field their candidates and election campaigns are conducted in a centralised manner. In Aligarh, independents stole the show by winning 21 of the 47 seats. The BJP and the SP won 9 and 7 seats respectively. The RLD won 4 and five seats were secured by the BSP and one by Bhim Army. Out of 30 district council seats in Etah district, SP won 15, independents 10, BJP 3, BSP 1 and Shivpal Yadav’s Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (PSP) won 1 seat. In Firozabad district, out of the total 33 wards, SP-backed candidates won 17 seats, independents 7, BJP 5, BSP 2 and PSP 2. Out of 23 seats of district council members in Kasganj, SP won 11, BJP 6, BSP 4 and independents 2. Out of 56 wards in Bijnor, BJP could grab just 7 seats. In Muzaffarnagar, out of 43 ward seats, independents are winning in 17. In Meerut too, BJP fared badly, leading in just 6 out of 33 seats, though the final results were yet to be announced. State BJP secretary Vijay Shivhare, however, claimed that most of the independent candidates who won were from BJP, so the party had “gained significantly” in the semi-finals to the assembly elections. Political observers say that the BJP has the power to leverage support of independent candidates and will manage to get their people elected. However, they cannot ignore the results, particularly since the assembly elections are less than a year away. BJP’s state spokesperson Chandra Mohan said, “I think we have done a remarkable job. Results could have been better, if we were not confined by the Covid-19 pandemic. I don’t see any impact of the farmers’ protest. Otherwise, why would Muzaffarnagar – the power centre of the farmers’ protest – would give us 13 winning candidates?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/panchayat-polls-bjp-suffers-setback-in-west-up/articleshow/82393156.cms||---

The incident happened at Bhosari on Monday afternoon. The manager Tukaram Lawte (21) has been arrested under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code after the customer Nagnath Solanke (33) lodged an FIR. “Around 2.30pm on Monday, Solanke had gone to the eatery to take Biryani parcel. However, one of the waiters told him that Biryani was not available. Solanke requested him to arrange it and told him that he knew the manager (of the eatery),” an officer from the Bhosari police told TOI. The officer said, “When the waiter asked Solanke to leave, Solanke told him that he has no option but to wait there as someone had parked their vehicle in such a way that Solanke could not move his vehicle. Following this, an argument broke and Lawte and two waiters thrashed Solanke with sticks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/eatery-manager-held-for-thrashing-customer/articleshow/82393920.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cash-strapped BMC to shell out Rs 1.6 crore to rent e-cars for 8 years||MUMBAI: At a time when the BMC is facing an acute shortage of funds and has had to dip into its reserves, it plans to spend Rs 1.6 crore on renting brand new electric cars for its civic leaders. Instead of buying new e-cars, the BMC has decided to rent these for a period of eight years.  By renting the vehicles for eight years, the BMC will end up paying around Rs 32 lakh per car—more than double the market price of around Rs 14 lakh for each. TimesViewCivic netas must get new cars if their vehicles are very old. The BMC, though, must not spend double the amount on renting cars, when the vehicles’ market price for outright purchase is 50% lower. Given the BMC’s current financial situation, when it has been forced to take an internal loan, the civic body must avoid such fancy spending and maintain austerity.The proposal to buy five e-cars for civic netas such as the leader of the house, Shiv Sena corporator Vishakha Raut, and leader of the Opposition, Congress corporator Ravi Raja, will be placed before the civic standing committee for approval on Wednesday. In its budget this year, the BMC decided to dip into its fixed deposits and withdraw Rs 10,564 crore as loan to meet its increasing expenditure. The estimated 2020-21 expenditure was Rs 33,441 crore, which was increased to Rs, 39,039 (17%) for the current financial year. Instead of raising money from the market through bonds, the administration took an internal interest-free loan. Civic officials said the BMC will end up paying Rs 27,000 to Rs 37,000 per month per car. The BMC is renting the cars from Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL). Officials said since many of the cars assigned to civic netas were old, there was demand for replacement. Raja said he wouldn’t want to get a new electric vehicle at a time when the BMC is in a bad financial state. “Our cars are almost 10 years old and often break down but this proposal should be deferred. The BMC is not in a financial position to go for fancy cars. The BMC has already spent a lot of money on Covid and such fancy electric cars must not be bought,” Raja said. RTI activist Anil Galgali too said the BMC must not spend money on electric cars when it is facing a crunch. “The BMC must not buy fancy cars right now at double the market price on rent. Paying double the market price and taking cars on rent doesn’t make sense. There should be an austerity drive by BMC leaders,” Galgali said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cash-strapped-bmc-to-shell-out-rs-1-6cr-to-rent-e-cars-for-8-years/articleshow/82392960.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata schools keep close watch on Supreme Court fee order||KOLKATA: A Supreme Court order on Monday over why schools should desist from charging 100% fees during the pandemic months got city schools consulting lawyers about how the order would impact them. Monday’s order by the division bench of justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari was keenly studied by city schools though it was given in the context of a hearing about fees in private unaided schools in Rajasthan. More than 145 city schools have approached the SC against a Calcutta High Court order in October 2020 that asked schools to offer a 20% waiver in tuition fees for the pandemic months since classes are all happening online, without the use of physical premises. The hearing of this appeal is pending but school heads felt Monday’s order could be a reference point when the next hearing takes place. The difference between Bengal and many other states is that no fee regulation act is in place here. Hence, the state government does not have much say in the fee structures of unaided schools. The Supreme Court in its order on Monday reminded schools that they should give a 15% reduction in fees during the pandemic months since many facilities were not used by the children and the schools have saved substantially on heads such as electricity, maintenance costs, water charges etc. The SC reminded schools that not passing on these benefits to parents might be called profiteering. La Martiniere schools, Birla High School, South Point, MP Birla, Shikshayatan and many other schools said on Monday that they were studying the order but since they had already allowed a reduction of 20% to parents, they had nothing to worry. “The order clearly says that 15% reduction is to be given. Such am arrangement will not affect the fee collection for the 2021-22 session,” said lawyer Sourav Bhagat of Fox and Mandal, who is representing a large number of city schools. Many city schools have revised fees for the 2021-22 session and a percentage of hike has been woven in from April 2021 fees itself. Schools said that they were asked not to revise fees in 2020 and give a 20% reduction and the courts had not mentioned anything about a fee revision in 2021-22. “The order is a closure of sorts and para 117 of the order clearly says that it is relevant to fee of 2020-21 and not for 2021-22 and therefore restricts the concessions/relaxations to the last academic year. So there is finality in this order,” said Krishna Damani, spokesperson of South Point School. Parents bodies felt that this order is a shot in the arm for them. “Schools are misinterpreting orders. No order is restricted to 20-21, they are relevant to the current months as well,” said Vineet Ruia, who has been leading parents on several forums.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-schools-keep-close-watch-on-sc-fee-order/articleshow/82393938.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolhapur||10-day janata curfew imposed in Kolhapur district from today||Kolhapur: A 10-day janata curfew will come into effect across Kolhapur district from 11 am on Wednesday owing to rising number of Covid cases. The vegetable markets will also remain shut and essential shops will remain open, but only home-delivery of goods will be allowed. No one will be allowed to move out except for emergency medical reasons. Hotels and restaurants can provide home delivery services while bars will be shut and no home delivery will be allowed. The appeal for janata curfew has been signed by guardian minister Satej Patil along with ministers Hasan Mushrif and Rajendra Patil-Yadravkar. The trio discussed Covid preparations with district collector Daulat Desai and his team through video conference. “District is facing shortage of oxygen for Covid patients as the cases go up. To bring down the demand of oxygen we need to undertake immediate and strict measures to break the chain. Therefore, I appeal to the citizens to strictly follow the janata curfew guidelines” the guardian minister said. Meanwhile, Mushrif said the Supreme Court too has suggested lockdown to bring the situation under control. “The enforcement of the curfew must be strict,” he added. Desai, while stating the need of lockdown, said currently there are 2,400 Covid patients on oxygen support. “We have oxygen manufacturers, but they also need to supply oxygen to other neighbouring districts. Therefore, we are facing shortages,” he said. Officials claimed that there will be no separate order from district collector and the appeal by ministers is sufficient for enforcement of stricter curbs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/10-day-janata-curfew-imposed-in-kolhapur-district-from-today/articleshow/82393148.cms||---

This was decided in a meeting chaired by the PGI director. Some of these patients are called to the institute for physical evaluation. To reduce that number as well, the registration timings have been reduced. On an average, the PGI sees 2,000 patients every day using tele-consultation.Also, from May 5, GMCH is starting separate counselling services for its Covid patients. The service will be run by consultants and clinical psychologists. This will be in addition to 24-hour helpline services being provided on numbers 0172-2660078, 0172-2660178, and post-Covid counselling services, which are being provided in liaison with the department of general medicine.A dedicated landline number (with calling facility) is installed in the department of psychiatry which will operate on all working days from 9am to 5pm, and 9am to 1pm on Saturdays. A clinical psychologist will be the in-charge of the landline number. Calls will be received on this number for mental health issues for any Covid patient admitted to GMCH. Psychological intervention in the form of ventilatory session, supportive session, addressing the concerns and queries will be done telephonically. The patients will also be counselled through video-calling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/change-in-tele-consultation-registration-timings/articleshow/82393913.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Biz body urges for timing tweak||Kolkata: The Confederation of West Bengal Trade Associations has appealed to the government to allow wholesale business to operate from 11am to 5pm. It has instead offered to keep the markets shut on two weekdays and over the weekend so that the spread of the virus is curtailed. Last week, the state had imposed business-hour curbs in the wake of the second wave. As per the order, shops selling non-essential items can open between 7am and 11am and then again between 3pm and 5pm. “Most of the shops might not be selling essential items but they are the supply source of manufacturing these items. While we welcome government’s decision to reduce the timing, we have requested the government to tweak the timings of wholesale markets so that we can carry on with the business uninterrupted. Instead we can shut markets on the weekends and two weekdays,” said Sushil Poddar, president of CWBTA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/biz-body-urges-for-timing-tweak/articleshow/82393940.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Pune||Schools cite costs, balk at fees cut for online classes||PUNE: Schools in the city have said that despite the Supreme Court saying that fees for online-only classes must be reduced, it was impossible to give any concession as they were dealing with defaulters, have invested in technology and continue to pay the salaries of their staff. Parents, on the other hand, said the concession should be given as they are suffering several losses on personal fronts and schools were saving on operational costs. Many said it has been a difficult year and they were unable to pay the fees for their wards. In retaliaiton some schools have barred the children from the online classes. Arvind Agarwal, management member of a school, said, “The interest rates have not been reduced by banks over money loaned to educational institutions. The building and infrastructure is built with borrowed money from financial institutions. The buildings are still there and the costs remain the same.” Spokesperson of Aam Aadmi Party Mukund Kirdat said the Supreme Court’s decision of May 3 regarding the Government of Rajasthan and its schools is an important guideline. The decision endorses the government’s right to regulate school fees. The court said the savings in expenses during the lockdown would have saved at least 15% of their running costs and schools can further offer concessions depending upon actual expenses, he added. “Individual child cases can be dealt with by schools. It endorsed the principles of the right to education such as children cannot be expelled from school for non-payment of fees, their offline, online education cannot be stopped and they cannot be barred from appearing for Std X and XII examinations. Due to this court order, the government of Maharashtra should take immediate steps to bring a new ordinance,” he added. A school principal said, “We have been investing in technology, paying the salaries of teachers and the housekeeping staff has been coming to school every day except for the lockdown days. These expenses need to be taken into account.” President of Indiawide Parents’ Association, Anubha Sahai said the state government should intervene and stop looting of parents by the private schools and colleges in the city. The government should act on what the Supreme Court has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/schools-cite-costs-balk-at-fees-cut-for-online-classes/articleshow/82393943.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Members of the civic body said the fresh proposals were discussed by the standing committee on Tuesday. If approved, the injections will be provided free of cost to patients till May 31. “A decision on the matter will be taken soon," said Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee. The PMC is set to spend nearly Rs 2 crore for the purchase of the injections. Members said use of CSR funds will also be explored. The civic body had recently procured 600 remdesivir vials with help from a jewellery store at the cost of Rs 17 lakh. In another proposal, the standing committee decided to procure 20 ventilators at the cost of Rs 1.6 crore for civic-run Covid hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-plans-to-give-out-tocilizumab-for-free/articleshow/82393941.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||CCMB: Vital to ensure animals don’t get Covid||HYDERABAD: The SARS CoV-2 A2A strain that dominated during the first wave has infected the Asiatic Lions at Nehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad. Authorities of Nehru zoo informed Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) that eight Asiatic lions in the zoo had shown mild respiratory distress. Following the Central Zoo Authority guidelines, the veterinarians collected nasal and oral discharge samples and sent them to the Laboratory LaCONES-CCMB. The samples were tested using RT-PCR, and found positive for coronavirus. Karthikeyan Vasudevan, senior principal scientist at CCMB’s Laboratory for Conservation of Endangered Species told TOI: “We are currently working to finding scientific evidence on how the lions contracted the virus. They, most likely, got it from the keepers.” LaCONES experts did an RT-CPR test to confirm the SARS CoV-2 infection in the lions. “The variant is old and it is not matching with the infection causing variant now,” Vasudevan said, and added: “We have reports across the world that not only lions, but tigers, primates and other animals have also been infected with the virus.” Dr Rakesh Mishra, CCMB advisor, said , “The old strain is identified as A2a. There is not other source for it to have spread from except infected humans or feed. All the lions showed mild symptoms and recovered. All mammals can be infected. It is unlikely it will infect poultry,” CCMB analysed the genomes of coronavirus samples from the infected lions, and did not find those to be a variant of concern currently. Dr Vasudevan also said, “Since pandemic began, many zoos and farms have reported that their animals have gotten infected from humans. It is essential to strictly follow the safety regulations in Indian zoos, especially in current times, to avoid transmitting the infection to the animals. We have to carefully document the different symptoms that the infection causes in animals and also develop non-invasive ways to procure samples from animals. Getting swab samples from animals is very difficult.” Dr Mishra said: “We are looking forward to now testing animals for coronavirus by testing their fecal samples. This can be a useful method of testing for both captive and free-ranging animals.” There are four designated Covid-19 testing centres for captive animals in the country, including LaCONES-CCMB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ccmb-vital-to-ensure-animals-dont-get-covid/articleshow/82394836.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 9 lakh doses in hand, BMC’s focus remains 45-plus group||On Tuesday, immunisation centres had serpentine queues in which 60- and 70-year-olds waited for hours. Vaccination on Wednesday will only start post noon, BMC said. The statement said there will be separate queues for first and second dose seekers. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said there was enormous demand for the second dose. “We will be replenishing doses earmarked for 18-44 group from the stocks we are scheduled to receive on Tuesday night,” he said. Those coming for the second dose can walk in. The city could vaccinate 26,944 people from the 45-plus group with the borrowed doses. The token drive for 18-44 will continue at the five vaccination centres, strictly through appointments, Kakani said. The city had received around 20,000 doses for the younger age bracket. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the state’s stocks dropped to as low as 25,000 doses on Monday, but got replenished on Tuesday morning with 9 lakh doses. “This too will last just two days,” said Tope. The minister said the state which has a potential of vaccinating over 5 lakh in a day should be given vaccines as per its performance. Civic officials also said one lakh doses were too little for the drive to gain momentum. Tope added that the state has issued a purchase order to buy 13.8 lakh Covishield doses and 4.7 lakh Covaxin doses for the 18-44 group.  “We had purchased 3 lakh vaccines to begin the drive for this age group from May 1 and we have administered nearly 1 lakh doses. We are looking at opportunities to buy more vaccines,” said Tope. He said the state will have a one-on-one meeting with SII CEO Adar Poonawalla once he returns from the UK. The current shortage has forced the elderly to launch a frantic search. Shubha Patel (67) went to three vaccination centres in Mumbai for her second dose of Covishield, but returned home without the shot. Patel said the BMC’s message on which centres will be operational came very late on Monday night and by the time she reached one in her ward, there was a serpentine line in front of her. "I stood in the queue in the blistering heat. There was no communication, no enquiry desk,” said Patel. Shyam Iyer (70) said his son was trying to book a slot online for him and his wife, but it was not working. "When we went for our first dose in mid-March, we had taken an online appointment in a private hospital and it went smoothly. But now, private hospitals don't have stocks for the second dose. Such crowded vaccine centres increase the risk for senior citizens,” said Iyer, who managed to get his second dose after a wait of nearly 2.5 hours at a Chembur centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-9-lakh-doses-in-hand-bmcs-focus-remains-45-plus-group/articleshow/82394859.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Save paddy from rain: Mareddy Srinivas Reddy||HYDERABAD: The state government has issued instructions to the officials not to store paddy purchased from farmers in large quantities in the 5,884 procurement centres sets up in villages. These orders have been issued to save paddy from getting damaged due to unseasonal rains lashing various parts of the state in the past few days and a forecast for further rains in the next three days. Telangana State Civil Supplies Corporation chairman Mareddy Srinivas Reddy said the procurement centre officials should immediately transport paddy to rice mills which, in turn, should unload it and take proper care for its storage. Under no circumstances, the paddy stocks should be allowed to pile up at the procurement centres, he said. As much as 15.49 lakh metric tonnes of paddy worth Rs 2,920 crore has been purchased from the farmers so far this season. Officials were also directed to ensure that tarpaulins were provided to farmers and also at the procurement centres to protect paddy from unseasonal rains. Srinivas Reddy directed the officials to make all arrangements to ensure that there is no delay in procurement of paddy brought by the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/save-paddy-from-rain-mareddy/articleshow/82394845.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: From guard rails to tokens, traders find new ways to keep coronavirus at bay||KOLKATA: Owners of business establishments have started resorting to different means to protect themselves and their employees from the virus. While some have barred entry of customers into their shops, others have introduced token systems. Some have even put up barriers made of wooden poles or guard rails so that nobody enters their establishments. Traders have been forced to take these measures after several businessmen tested positive and developed complications. The state government has curbed the timings of shops selling non-essential items from 7am to 10am and 3pm to 5pm. Those dispensing essential services, like medical stores, groceries and shops selling medical equipment, can operate beyond the stipulated timings. “We have told our members to prioritize their lives and that of their employees over business,” said Chandresh Meghani, president of the Calcutta Electric Dealers’ Association, who was admitted in hospital with Covid-related complications for two weeks. “I have requested traders not to take the virus lightly because it can create havoc inside. They must take all precautions even if it means that they have to forgo some business.” Pawan Ostwal, who owns an electrical goods shop in Pollock Street, has put up barriers at the entrance. “Including me and my employees, we are already seven people inside the shop. At any point of time, there are at least 10 customers. Seventeen people inside this small shop is nothing less than a disaster,” said Ostwal. Several sweets shops in central Kolkata, too, have stopped serving sweets and savouries to customers to eat inside the shop. At Bhim Chandra Nag on BB Ganguly Street, customers queue up outside the shop. “All orders are for parcels only. Earlier, people would order sweets and singaras and eat on the side tables kept inside. But we have stopped that practice because in the evening, there are over 15 to 20 people inside,” said an employee of the popular sweet shop. The second wave of the pandemic has taken everybody by surprise. Many businessmen were thinking of sales picking up this year. They said time curbs had adversely impacted their businesses because many of them had started stocking up goods. “But we are only getting five to six hours for business and the timings are very odd,” said Rajesh Bhuvalka, a textile trader in Cotton Street. Many traders have taken the digital route. “I have told my customers in districts to let me know their requirements and I will transport it to them. They can transfer the money to my account. This saves them the travel,” said Mahendra Poddar, a wholesaler of dry fruits at Sadasukh Katra market on MG Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/from-guard-rails-to-tokens-traders-find-new-ways-to-keep-virus-at-bay/articleshow/82393944.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Delhi||O2 crisis in Delhi: 24x7 helpline for hospitals||NEW DELHI: To deal with the capital’s oxygen crisis, Delhi government has set up a 24X7 emergency helpline for hospitals and other healthcare institutions. More than 20 executives have been deployed to operate the helpline, which will be supervised by three IAS officers to ensure efficient supply and distribution of oxygen. In a statement on Tuesday, Delhi government said that the city received 450 metric tonnes of medical oxygen and hoped the supply would touch 500 MT by Wednesday or Thursday. “The Kejriwal government has been making all efforts to assist the citizens in this tough time and is working on strengthening the supply chain management of oxygen,” the statement said. The government said the severity of the oxygen situation is being monitored on a daily basis with the help of SOS messages. While the big hospitals in the city are being supplied liquid oxygen, the smaller healthcare institutions are using a mix of liquid oxygen and gas cylinders. According to the government, the demand for oxygen in Delhi will reach 976 MT by May 11 while the central government has allocated only 590 MT. To ensure that there is no shortage of oxygen, Delhi government is working to make the supply chain robust and efficient, smoothen the movement of oxygen and supply of the gas to the city is according to the prescribed roster. The gas will be supplied by nearby districts such as Roorkee, Panipat and Ghaziabad. At present, east Indian states are supplying most of the oxygen, resulting in a higher turnaround time. Delhi government said it was closely coordinating with officials of the central government, including senior officials of the railway ministry, IOCL and Concorde to ensure undisturbed supply of oxygen to Delhi. The state government has also deputed a team of officers to each of the oxygen plant locations to ensure there are no glitches or administrative obstacles in the oxygen supply to Delhi. The government statement pointed out that within Delhi, there were 14 refiller companies, which got liquid oxygen from different suppliers, filled the gas cylinders and provided them to institutional customers. “One-fourth of Delhi’s oxygen supply is dependent on cylinders. To overcome this, Delhi government has decentralised the system and given the powers to the respective district magistrates to ensure smooth functioning,” the statement said. The DMs would ensure that refillers linked with various hospitals were able to supply their quota of oxygen either directly or through their dealers. The government said that teams had been formed under the divisional commissioners to closely monitor and track the movements of the gas tankers. “Delhi has prepared a fair distribution and allocation strategy for optimal utilisation of the given oxygen. Many NGOs and religious organisations are extending a great helping hand in fighting this pandemic,” the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/o2-crisis-24x7-helpline-for-hospitals/articleshow/82394948.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Goa||Oxygen level drops at GMC, doctors hook up 2-3 patients per cylinder||Panaji: The central flow of oxygen for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) at Goa Medical College (GMC) dipped at 7pm on Tuesday, forcing doctors and attendants to scramble for oxygen cylinders as patients’ oxygen saturation began dropping below safe levels. Patients began sounding an alarm as soon the flow dropped, and healthcare workers, making the best of the available resources, shifted critical patients to neighbouring wards and hooked two or even three patients to a single cylinder till the central flow was restored. Patients whose parameters were slightly better were put in the prone position so that their oxygen levels remained steady. Doctors, nurses, and patients confirmed to TOI that the central oxygen supply tends to dip erratically, but the cause has not yet been determined. “There is a deficiency in the oxygen supply, and this has been informed to the higher-ups on several occasions. If the supply drops, we have no other option but to ask patients to share oxygen cylinders,” said a resident doctor. On Tuesday, GMC authorities ensured that oxygen supply stabilised in a couple of hours. Admitting that there was a shortage of oxygen in ward No. 142, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that as soon as he learnt of it he intervened and ensured the supply was restored. “There is no oxygen shortage now. We managed to get 60 cylinders and supply has been normalised,” Sawant said late night. Doctors said that if two or three patients are put on NIV support on a single oxygen cylinder, the amount of oxygen delivered to each patient is not optimal. “But something is better than nothing,” said the doctor. “Every night around 3-4am, oxygen supply dips. Patients are lying on stretchers, wheelchairs, on the ground and being given treatment, including oxygen,” said a Covid-19 patient, speaking to TOI. Patients at the North Goa district hospital have also complained that the oxygen supply tends to dip. “Most of the deaths are preventable. If these patients continue to get steady oxygen for another six to seven days, they will make it through,” said another doctor. The state government has admitted the problem, and has announced that the state’s oxygen supply will be ramped up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oxygen-level-drops-at-gmc-doctors-hook-up-2-3-patients-per-cylinder/articleshow/82394872.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Only a preliminary probe, says govt||Hyderabad: Advocate general BS Prasad said the government has only done a preliminary investigation into the alleged encroachment of 66 aces of assigned land by Jamuna Hatcheries in Masaipet mandal. He said the government will soon initiate action against the poultry firm management under the provisions of the Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfer) Act. When Justice T Vinod Kumar of the high court asked as to which provision of law had empowered the district collector to trespass into a private property without notifying the owner, the AG replied that section 156 of the Telangana Land Revenue Act, 1317 Fasli, accords such power to the collector to inquire into any matter of public importance. The judge reminded him that there were provisions in the Act which also ask the inquiry authority to notify the affected parties. The AG then sought a direction to the petitioners to cooperate with the government in conducting the survey to which the judge said that if they would very much cooperate and that there were procedures which could be followed to get their cooperation. The AG earlier said that following complaints from original assignees that their land was grabbed by the poultry firm, chief secretary directed the district collector to inquire into the matter. “He conducted a preliminary probe and concluded that Jamuna Hatcheries is in illegal possession of 66 acres of assigned land,” the AG said. Petitioners’ counsel D Prakash Reddy argued firm owners bought patta land from land owners and they are in possession of 59 acres in various survey numbers of Achampet and Hakimpet in Masaipet mandal. He said government was referring to areas and survey numbers that are not connected to Jamuna Hatcheries’ land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/only-a-preliminary-probe-says-govt/articleshow/82394857.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kol zoo back on guard; Cov not fatal to animals: Experts||Kolkata: Alipore zoo officials are keeping a close watch on all animals for Covid-19 symptoms after eight lions at Hyderabad zoo tested positive and the zoos across Bengal were shut down on Monday. While a similar order from National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) on April 30, shutting down tourism activities in all sanctuaries and national parks, expressed concerns over lions contracting the virus, the state’s chief wildlife warden, VK Yadav, said that the decision to close down zoos across Bengal was taken after the chief secretary’s order on the same day, banning any kind of mass congregation. But, vets have sounded caution and advised to minimise interaction with animals as much as possible since the second wave is turning out to be more dangerous than the first one. NVK Ashraf, vice president and chief veterinarian with Wildlife Trust of India said that there are many zoonotic diseases that a human can get, but many of them do not spread from human to human. And, there’s a chance of reverse zoonosis too in some rare cases, when humans transmit it back to the animals, he added. But Covid-19 is different as it is not only transmissible from human to human but also highly contagious. According to him, among animals, mustelids like otters and minks are known to be more prone to Covid-19. “Next comes the big cats in the zoos. But, these are not fatal. It’s possible that lions in many zoos would have contracted the disease but might have remained asymptomatic. After all, it is only when they show some symptoms that we subject them to a detailed sampling for Covid-19,” Ashraf added. According to him, the zoos are no longer open to the public but one cannot keep curators, animal keepers and doctors from attending to animals. We cannot afford to have in zoos the kind of “bio-bubble” they had for events like the IPL, which by the way, is also not fool-proof with some players testing positive for Covid-19. No need to panic at all as far as the zoo animals are concerned because it is not fatal to them. Still, the zoo personnel can minimize their close interaction with animals to minimize transmission possibilities. Alipore zoo director AK Samanta said that a host of measures to check spread of the disease are already in place. “90% of our staff stay in the quarters located opposite the zoo. We regularly check temperature of zookeepers and handlers and made them pass through sanitisation channels when they report to work. We also regularly use anti-viral spray inside the cages. Apart from birds, food to animals like tiger and lion are thrown into the cages from outside. For zebra and giraffe, we keep the food at a specific location inside their cages. We are thinking of ways to make sure that there’s minimum interaction between animals and keepers,” Samanta added. On being asked about ways to conduct RT-PCR tests on zoo animals, former vet of Alipore zoo, DN Banerjee said that it’s possible to collect nasal swab samples from animals like lion by putting it in a squeeze cage. “But that will not be the best way to collect swab samples from its mouth. From pets like dogs and cats, we use mouth gags to collect swab samples, but for wild animals like lions or tigers, one needs to tranquillise it to collect the sample from their mouth,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-zoo-back-on-guard-cov-not-fatal-to-animals-experts/articleshow/82393985.cms||Krishnendu Mukherjee

An Army engineering team set up an oxygen plant comprising sub-plants of 300 litre/minute capacity each of the 500-bed state-run Shaikh-Ul-Hind Maulana Mahmood Hasan Medical College (SMMH) in Saharanpur. The hospital’s plant was lying in a state of disuse for four years primarily due the Rs 2.64 crore cost of repairs. Now, besieged with patients in need of oxygen due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the authorities at SMMH along with district administration approached the Army’s West UP area command centre which deputed 510 Army Base Workshop located in Meerut for technical assistance in getting the plant into serviceable condition. Another team from the Army base workshop repaired the oxygen generator laying in a state of disuse since last year in Bulandshahr's Khurja-based hospital, thus helping the civil administration to somewhat mitigate the oxygen deficit crisis.  According to a source in the Army, “A team of three technicians led by assistant executive engineer Manas Behera was formed. The initial inputs were telephonically collected to build basic understanding of the machinery and the technology therein. Kitted with anticipated tools and spares, the two teams reached Saharanpur and Bulandshahr hospitals, respectively.” In Saharanpur, due to the state of disuse for long, the air filters and complete pneumatic lines were clogged with dust and dirt. The compressor was unserviceable, and the electric panel was non-functional. Extensive maintenance besides sanitization had to be carried out before the actual repairs. Over 40 hours of relentless work out the 93% purity oxygen generator plant into action. Currently, one sub-plant of 300 litres per minute has started producing oxygen.`` Dr Manu Kapil, in charge, oxygen, at SMMH, Saharanpur told TOI, “At a time of pandemic, this is certainly a good development. We hope that our second generator also starts working soon as its parts are being procured from Ahmedabad. We are really thankful to the Army establishment.” While the district magistrate of Saharanpur was not available for comment, his counterpart in Bulandshahr, Ravindra Kumar, said, “Our oxygen generator that catered to 50 beds in Khurja Government L2 Hospital was dysfunctional and we were on a lookout for a technician who could make it functional. In the meantime we approached the Army establishment at Meerut also to help us and they sent their team and repaired it free of cost.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/army-engrs-revive-defunct-o2-plants-in-2-west-up-hosps/articleshow/82393176.cms||Sandeep Rai

The divison comprises Pune, Sangli, Satara, Solapur and Kolhapur districts. In the present scenario, the demand for oxygen in the division is close to 608 tonnes as against the supply of 516 tonnes, a Pune divisional office report has revealed. The demand for oxygen in Pune division was 90 tonnes in January and has shot up to 608 tonnes by April-end. The maximum demand for oxygen is in Pune district, 420 tonnes. Sangli, Satara, Solapur and Kolhapur districts have demand less than 55 tonne for oxygen supply. As per the latest Maharashtra government report, Pune district alone has 12,764 beds with oxygen support in both private and government, facilities. Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said several measures were being undertaken by the administration to improve the oxygen supply. He said, “Orders have been issued to set up 12 oxygen generation plants in sub-district and rural hospitals through the corporate social responsibility initiative.” The district planning committee has proposed 10 oxygen manufacturing plants. The Pune Municipal Corporation has proposed six such units. As part of the corporate social responsibility programme, 170 oxygen concentrators have been ordered and the administration has so far received 50.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/from-90-tonnes-in-jan-o2-demand-up-to-600-tonnes-in-divn/articleshow/82393979.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Meerut||Mothers of slain or jailed gangsters call shots in panchayat elections in west UP||MEERUT: Despite police coming down heavily on the families of slain or jailed gangsters to negate their influence in the Uttar Pradesh rural polls, the results tell a different story. A bunch of mothers whose sons ran a sway of terror in the region and were either killed by police bullets or gang wars or thrown behind bars have now made it to village panchayats as elected head woman. They say they never wanted the lives they lead now, but then being a mother has never been easy. One of them is Kshama Devi, 68, mother of Rahul Khatta who had 32 cases of murder against him and was killed by cops in August 2015. She is now the second-time pradhan of Prahladpur Khatta village in Baghpat district. Interestingly, district administration had invoked the UP Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act,1986 against family members of Rahul Khatta, but Kshama Devi is unperturbed. “My son was a victim of police brutality. A shy boy who barely interacted with villagers, Rahul resisted a former pradhan’s attempt to grab a piece of land belonging to a poor widow. He was taken away by cops and tortured for days. When he came back, he was a different man. The entire village knows the story. No one sees him as a criminal here, but a victim of an oppressing system," Kshama Devi said. A similar action was taken by the administration against the family of Pramod Gangnauli of village Gangnauli. He carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head and was killed in a police encounter in January 2015. His mother Subhashna Rathi, 60, has also been elected as village pradhan for the second time now. In August last year, Pramod's elder brother Praveen Rathi was injured in a police encounter and was sent to jail, but that did not prevent Subhashna from becoming the head woman of Gangnauli. Villagers have an interesting story to tell about Pramod. He was a crime reporter from whom police sought help to meet a few criminals. The meeting was fixed, but police killed two of them in an encounter and the entire blame fell on Pramod who had to take up arms to defend himself as cops refused to bail him out. Another mother who has been elected for the post of head woman is Geeta Devi. She is the mother of dreaded gangster Ankit Baba who is currently lodged in Tihar Jail. Notably, Geeta Devi who got elected from village Khela is, at present, absconding in an extortion case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/mothers-of-slain-or-jailed-gangsters-call-shots-in-panchayat-elections-in-west-up/articleshow/82393216.cms||Sandeep Rai

This number is 20,520 for just March and April this year, in the second wave. Though numbers swelled, the high number of cases in second wave means the ratio of infections in this age group to total cases has remained almost the same as the first wave. The second wave, that began in third week of February, is proving much more virulent compared to first one. Everyone has also noticed a lot more youngsters contracting the disease in second wave. Now, NMC has revealed the exact figures. In 14 months from March 2020 to April this year, the city had registered 2,96,402 positive cases, of which 33,348 (11.2%) were of people below 20 years of age. Though number of cases in this age group are higher in March and April, as percentage of total cases it comes to 11.1% in March and 11.6% in April. The district had witnessed peak of first wave in last two weeks of August and entire September last year. In August, 11.8% of total cases were from this age group and in September 9.9%. In first wave, highest number of cases were in 21-40 age group. The numbers have further increased in second wave, with 39% of total cases in this age group in March and 42.5% in April. Share of this age group in overall cases is 40.54%. It was 41.5% in August and 40.9% in September last year. The city has seen decline in cases in 41-60 years age group in March and April. Ratio was 25.7% in March and 32.3% in April. Overall percentage was 33.64%. Of total 2,96,402 cases registered, 1,78,180 (60.1%) were in March and April whereas the rest 1,18,222 (39.9%) were in 12 months from March 2020 to February this year, indicating the severity of second wave. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI, “Second wave is highly contagious. But NMC has kept on increasing number of beds, testing centres and other infrastructure that provided relief. There were 3,454 beds in September last year. They increased to 7,632 in April this year. There were 44 swab collection centres run by NMC in first wave, which increased to 52 in second. Testing laboratories increased from 22 to 47. Daily average of tests was 4,689 in first wave and 11,501 in second.” TOI had on April 26 reported the disease is virulent and unpredictable in second wave, quoting doctors. They had said children, teenagers and young people did not have many complications in first wave but were facing acute symptoms in second.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/far-more-youths-infected-in-2nd-wave-but-ratio-to-total-cases-remains-same/articleshow/82393975.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: More pvt vax centres open but cost up to Rs 1,250/dose||Mumbai: A day after HN Reliance and Apollo in Navi Mumbai, Vile Parle’s Balabhai Nanavati hospital became the third private facility to start Covid vaccination for all above 18 years on Tuesday. Hospitals are charging Rs 700-Rs 900 for a dose of Covishield and Rs 1,250 for Covaxin, giving rise to demands for price uniformity. It may be a while before more private hospitals get into the drive given lack of assurances from the state or the BMC about supply. By April 30, private hospitals had administered over 6.24lakh doses. Fortis Hospital, Mulund is the only likely candidate to start vaccination in a few days. A few mid-level hospitals are also trying to source doses but volumes may not be high. The Centre had said private facilities must make their own arrangements from May 1 by procuring from manufacturers directly or importing doses. But the head of one of the city’s premier hospitals said the Centre ought to have made its stand clear earlier. “The letter about decentralisation came only on April 23 saying we have to buy our own stocks from May 1. Where does one get to make deals overnight?,” he said, adding that nearly all hospitals have invested on pandals and arrangements for additional staff to conduct vaccinations. The Association of Hospitals (AOH) which has city’s big trust hospitals as its members has approached the Serum Institute of India recently, but hasn’t got any assurances. “The earliest Serum can give us doses is by mid-June which may be too late,” said Gautam Khanna, CEO of PD Hinduja and president of AOH. He said public health minister Rajesh Tope had assured AOH that the state would provide doses, but given the shortage faced by public centres, there is little clarity on how much that promise would be fulfilled. Dr V Ravishankar, COO of Lilavati Hospital, said they get dozens of calls every day from people who have taken the first dose. “We have to tell them to go to a public centre. The state or the BMC must help us with doses,” he said. Dr Gautam Bhansali of Bombay Hospital said the BMC had assured them supplies but that stand appears to have changed. “We are hoping the state steps in,” he said. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said there are no plans to share stocks BMC receives from the Centre with private hospitals. “There are clear guidelines that the doses have to be used in public centres. Private hospitals have to make their own purchases,” he said. Meanwhile, an official pointed out that private hospitals’ rates were steep. While Nanavati is charging the highest for a dose of Covishield (Rs 900), Apollo is charging Rs 850 and Reliance is charging Rs 700. Santosh Marathe, COO of Apollo, Navi Mumbai said the cost involves maintenance of cold chain and other logistical arrangements.. HN Reliance administered 769 doses while Nanavati gave 290 on Tuesday. For a dose of Covaxin, Reliance and Fortis will be charging Rs 1,250||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-more-pvt-vax-centres-open-but-cost-up-to-rs-1250/dose/articleshow/82394879.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Chandigarh||Viral transport medium may run out, city doctors to rely on dry swab test||Chandigarh: Chandigarh’s main hospitals, including PGI and GMCH which do RT-PCR test, are expected to soon face shortage of viral transport medium (VTM). This is a sterile medium to preserve virus specimens so that they can be collected and transported to another location. With an enhancement in the number of tests, VTM will exhaust soon, if the scientists at the tertiary care hospitals are to be believed. The doctors are now prepared for the dry swab instead. This technology was approved recently by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The dry swab test was developed last year by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad.These hospitals are in the process to use dry swab, which can cut down the time of test result from 24-48 hours to almost four hours. “Last year also, there was a shortage of VTM. This test is validated by the ICMR and needs to be standardised by any laboratory that plans to use it,” said prof Mini P Singh, virologist at PGI. She said, “We have used this dry swab in trial mode and had good results. It needs different reagents from what are presently being used for the RT-PCR.”There have been reports that in the double mutant virus case, the RT-PCR is unable to pick up the infection. On this, prof Singh said, “Timing of the test and the gene targets are significant to determine the accuracy of the results in RT-PCR. In case a patient gets tested the next day of the onset of symptoms, the results will be negative. Due to a lot of panic, people are hurriedly getting the test done. Also, we are not using a single gene target in the RT-PCR. The problem arises when a single gene target is used and the diagnostic cannot produce accurate results.”The dry swab is done the same way as the RT-CPR as the swabs have to be collected from the throat and nasal area. But the timing of processing is reduced as this method does not require RNA extraction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/viral-transport-medium-may-run-out-city-doctors-to-rely-on-dry-swab-test/articleshow/82393954.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Gold imports down 51% in April||AHMEDABAD: High price and stricter restrictions imposed territorially to contain the spread of Covid infections have hurt gold demand. The import of gold in April fell by 50.7%, settling at 3.54 metric tonnes (MT) against 7.19MT in March, according to the data issued by the Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex. With demand taking a hit on retail counters, jewellers have reduced purchases. Moreover, the last fortnight of April saw a partial lockdown or self-imposed shutdowns which also affected retail demand. “The market had recovered well in March with good demand and weddings were lined up,” said Jigar Soni, president, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA). “However, as the cases of Covid-19 surged, the demand crashed in April.” Soni said that in the second half of the month, most jewellers observed self-shutdowns. “As a consequence, gold jewellery purchases once again took a hit,” Soni said. “As on date, the demand has reduced to 10%.” The gold price stood at Rs 49,500 per 10 gram on April 23 in the Ahmedabad market. Gold trading came to a standstill from April 24 as jewellers across the city observed a self-shutdown from April 24 to 30. The state government imposed curbs on commercial complexes and shops from April 28. Rising prices of gold was one of the reasons for the decline in gold demand. “Jewellers and stockists have consistently reduced the purchases of gold in April due to weak retail demand,” said an Ahmedabad-based bullion trader. “The demand could remain soft over the next few weeks amid the rising Covid cases.” The trader said a weakened US dollar, falling yields of the US treasury, and a correction in equity markets around the world pushed the demand for gold as a haven. It was spurred by the concerns about the impact of the second Covid wave on the economy. Jewellers and bullion traders say that the demand is expected to take a further hit in May as many weddings planned around the Akshaya Tritiya Muhurat have been called off due to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dull-show-gold-imports-down-50-7-in-april/articleshow/82394875.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Apologise for wrong info on vaccine wastage, Congress tells Prakash Javadekar||MUMBAI: Tender an apology to the people of Maharashtra for providing wrong information on the wastage of Covid vaccine, state Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant told BJP leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Tuesday. “Instead of requesting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to grant more vaccines to Maharashtra, Javadekar was providing wrong information on vaccine wastage. The NDA government is making all out efforts to tarnish the image of Maharashtra,” Sawant said, adding that Maharashtra’s vaccine wastage was 0.22% as per the data, and not 6% as claimed by Javadekar. Sawant said none other than the Modi government has released crucial information on vaccine wastage, which is contrary to the claims made by Javadekar, as a result, now it has been established that information released by the BJP leader is incorrect. “As Javadekar’s information, vaccine wastage in Maharashtra stood at 6%, however, from the records, it appears that the wastage was only 0.22%. It was unfortunate that despite that fact that he belongs to Maharashtra, he was providing wrong information,” Sawant said. He further said that despite several odds and “complete injustice” by the central government, Maharashtra is making all possible efforts to tackle the pandemic and has set an example before the nation on effective handling of the situation. “Despite our efforts, many centres across the state are closed owing to non-availability of vaccines. Till Monday, only 23,547 vaccines were left in Maharashtra,” Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-apologise-for-wrong-info-on-vax-wastage-cong-tells-javadekar/articleshow/82396031.cms||---

Cutting across party lines, MLAs made a unanimous demand for a task force comprising of experts from civil society and the Indian Army to be constituted to handle and manage the Covid pandemic in Goa. The opposition MLAs, aside from NCP MLA Churchill Alemao, met at the assembly complex to discuss the prevailing situation. They have also demanded that the state government release a white paper with details of the availability of oxygen, ventilators, vaccines and beds in the state. The MLAs have also shown unison in the call for a 15-day lockdown with all entry points being sealed except for essential commodities, medical aid and vital equipment. Other than pharmacies and stores selling essential items, all other shops and establishments must remain closed, opposition leader Digambar Kamat said. Pratapsingh Rane, Luizinho Faleiro, Ramkrishna Dhavlikar, Vijai Sardessai, Rohan Khaunte, Jayesh Salgaonkar, Vinod Palyekar and Prasad Gaonkar attended the meeting. The opposition MLAs have also demanded that entry of tourists needs to be restricted with Covid-negative certificates being made mandatory. The MLAs also expressed concern over the lack of hospital beds, critical medicines, oxygen cylinders, home quarantine kits, regulators, ventilators and other essential items. “There is complete apathy on the part of the government with regards to vaccination drive,” said Goa Forward Party (GFP) president Vijai Sardesai. “The government needs to procure Covid vaccines on war-footing and start the vaccination drive across the state. We strongly recommend that the government provide free vaccination to all citizens. We also recommend that vaccination centres be opened at every panchayat level, which will reduce the rush at the public health centres,” he said. The opposition MLAs urged the state government to consult academicians and educationists and prepare an academic action plan for students at various levels. Given the expenditure for the healthcare sector and the social sector, the opposition has also recommended that expenditure on non-priority works be stopped. The MLAs said that patients and their relatives have to run from pillar to post searching for treatment, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and even crematoriums. They said that the government must create an online dashboard and war room in every constituency giving details of availability of beds at various hospitals and availability in crematoria||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oppn-unites-to-fight-covid-calls-for-15-day-lockdown/articleshow/82394943.cms||---

Like Kumar, scores of labourers who have been out of work due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, now stand in queues to refill cylinders for others. Ironically, the pandemic has created a temporary source of livelihood to the likes of Kumar. And it works both ways – for the wage labourer and those in need of oxygen. As these refilling stations are few in number, a huge crowd of relatives of Covid patients desperate to get life-giving oxygen cylinders filled up gather there every day. One person can get one cylinder filled at a time. “Due to the huge rush, it takes almost an entire day to get one cylinder filled with oxygen. My mother is down with Covid and her SPO2 saturation is 75%. These cylinders are the only hope left for us but, at the same time, I cannot stand here the entire day as I have to tend to her. I am dependent on these daily wagers for filling up the cylinder,” says a resident of Meerut’s Begum Bagh colony. Ritesh Gautam, another daily wager who otherwise works as a mason, has no qualms about standing in a queue that moves at a snail’s pace. “Whether I work at a construction site or stand in a queue, what difference does it make? At the end of the day, I am getting work and money though the hours stretch beyond the standard eight hours at times.” Speaking to these men in these queues, TOI learnt that a couple of these daily wagers got work even at the time of demonetization when people stood for hours in long queues outside banks for exchanging currency notes. “I made quick money during those days but the hassle was less in those days. Now, it is more strenuous with summer season on. Besides, these refilling stations also cater to hospitals which send cylinders in bulk. The refilling consumes a lot of time. Then there are those who use influence to jump the queue. They too get priority. We require a huge amount of patience,” says Rajeshwar Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/how-oxygen-is-lifeline-for-out-of-work-daily-wagers/articleshow/82393234.cms||Sandeep Rai

And there is no help at hand. The scared and suffering Aam Aadmi, it seems, is not even left with the lung power to raise their voice against the "system" that they expected to come to their rescue amid helplessness and despair. The level of fright is such that people are even scared to perform the last rites of their loved ones, who had sacrificed everything in life for them. Unsurprisingly, desperation drives some people to react, sometimes violently, to vent their anger, but only to aggravate the situation for others in hospitals as there is no one to listen to and redress their grievances. There's a kind of vacuum, at every sphere. When the opposition raises its voice, the government dismisses it saying they don't know the ground reality, emphasizing that they are reviewing the situation daily. People on social media take a swipe and say it's the government that should see the ground reality instead of taking feedback from the same set of officers who are 'managing' things. But why blame the government alone. There are people who have turned the 'aapda' (disaster) into 'awsar' (opportunity) to mint money selling oxygen and life-saving drugs at exorbitant prices on the black market. Even basic drugs and vitamin tablets are out of stock in several localities of the state capital. The healthcare system is in such a sorry state that people fear taking their patients to a government hospital. The private ones are no better. The common man is being fleeced by either an 'ambulance wala', who charges Rs3,000 for general and at least Rs7,000 for an oxygen-equipped vehicle to take a patient to one hospital, or the illegal oxygen vendors and others. If there is no bed available in one hospital, the ambulance driver will charge the same amount again for taking you to the next hospital. The system is so helpless that it is beyond its scope to control and regulate things. But, again, some good samaritans are taking all kinds of risk to help the people in need. Former Bihar DGP (retired) Abhayanand, in his recent Facebook post, blamed corruption as the root cause of such helplessness. "Agar koi ek wakya hai jo is vibhishika ke mul mein hai to wah hai samast sarkari tantra mein macha nirbadh bhrastachar. Aam Aadmi ne bhrastachar se samjhauta karna sikh liya hai. Falafel ka vibhats roop dikh raha hai (If there is one thing to blame, it is pervasive corruption in the entire government machinery. People have compromised with corruption and the result is showing up in disaster)," he posted. But people will forget this havoc once things normalise. They won't ask if it was a failure of the government or the democratic system in which most of us vote for anything but health and education infrastructure, which has been badly exposed in Bihar. After the first wave of Covid-19 subsided, the government trumpeted it as their success story. Without naming any government, the US epidemiologist Anthony Fauci, in an interview with an Indian newspaper, said, "Victory was declared maybe too prematurely."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-reels-from-covid-fury-govt-apathy/articleshow/82387581.cms||Jai Narain Pandey

The UT administration on Tuesday said they would have dedicated zone-wise phone lines, and SDMs would ensure that patients on oxygen support get the supply at home. During the resumed hearing on Covid management in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, an apprehension was expressed by senior advocate Rupinder Khosla, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae in the matter, that availability of beds in various government and private hospitals was limited. As a result, some patients have to stay at home and if they need oxygen support, they have to purchase it from the open market, which was also not easy. On this, UT senior standing counsel Pankaj Jain assured the court that in case of such a problem, the SDMs of each zone could be asked to step in to help patients on oxygen support. He submitted that dedicated zone-wise phone lines would be arranged and widely publicised. The high court directed that the required steps be taken by Tuesday evening and in case, it was found that there was hoarding of any sort, SDMs must seek police help, which should come in immediately. “In case any report of disobedience of these orders is received by this court, it shall consider initiating punitive action,” the orders said. “Needless to observe that in case proper oxygen supply is available to those patients who are on its support at home, it will reduce the pressure on the administration as well as on the government and private hospitals. We also believe that advisories have also been issued by various health departments to the patients to stay at home if the condition is mild to moderate. In such circumstances even home delivery of oxygen cylinders can be considered by the state, preferably by municipal authorities as health personnel are already overburdened. Apart from providing succour to the public, it will prevent hoarding of oxygen cylinders,” said the court. The court has fixed May 7 as the next date of hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/high-court-suggests-home-delivery-of-oxygen-cylinders/articleshow/82393981.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, at an online programme, said the state was planning to generate 1,500MT oxygen, whereas minister for public health Rajesh Tope said the state had decided to make every district self-reliant in generating medical oxygen. Kunte pointed out that the state has 6,63,758 active cases, of which 78,884 are on medical oxygen, including 24,787 in ICU. The allocation of the state must be enhanced by at least 200MT, stated Kunte. He mentioned that Maharashtra continues to face the onslaught of the second wave. Moreover, 16 districts such as Palghar, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Solapur, Nandurbar, Beed, Parbhani, Hingoli, Amravati, Buldhana, Wardha, Gadchiroli and Chandrapur are showing continuous growth in cases and need adequate oxygen.

---||India||SC junks Bengal's version of Rera as unconstitutional||NEW DELHI: The Trinamool Congress government's attempt to run a parallel regime on regulating the real estate sector came unstuck on Tuesday as the Supreme Court quashed the West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act (WB-HIRA), 2017, as unconstitutional for copying from a central legislation, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, and also because many provisions were in conflict with the central law. Slamming the Bengal government's attempt, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said, "The state law fits, virtually on all fours, with the footprints of the law enacted by Parliament. This is constitutionally impermissible. What the West Bengal legislature has attempted to achieve is to set up its parallel legislation involving a parallel regime." After carrying out a clause-by-clause comparison between the two laws, the bench said not only was the state legislature barred from copying a central legislation to attempt a parallel regime but an additional reason why there was "repugnancy" between WB-HIRA and RERA was that many provisions of the state law were directly in conflict with the central enactment. Writing the judgment, Justice Chandrachud said, "WB-HIRA has failed to incorporate valuable institutional safeguards and provisions intended to protect the interest of homebuyers. The silence of the state legislature in critical areas indicates that important safeguards which have been enacted by Parliament in the public interest have been omitted in the state enactment."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-junks-bengals-version-of-rera-as-unconstitutional/articleshow/82397142.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Corporation chairman V Pratap Reddy said the firewood will be supplied free of cost to crematoriums through local municipal bodies. “There are reports that due to an increase in the number of deaths, the cremation grounds are facing an acute shortage of firewood. Further, as the cost of firewood has increased, people, especially those from economically backward families, are struggling to procure wood to cremate their loved ones. To help them, we have taken this decision on humanitarian grounds,” said Reddy. The cost of 1,000 tonnes of firewood will be around Rs 20 lakh. TSFDC said it takes up plantations on a huge scale every year. After selling wood to paper mills, the corporation is left with 1,000 tonnes of wood which will be provided to the cremation grounds. “Those, who want the wood to perform the last rites of their relatives can contact the local municipal officials,” said TSFDC vice-chairman G Chandrasekhar Reddy. The truck owners’ association has come forward to transport the wood across the state. He said the wood will be sent to Amberpet, Bansilalpet, Asif Nagar and ESI crematoriums in Hyderabad limits in a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/1000-tonnes-of-free-wood-for-covid-19-crematoria/articleshow/82394837.cms||---

The Parmar family filed an application against Dhiraj Hospital at Waghodia police station on Sunday. The hospital authorities, however, said that they handed over the correct body to the family. According to the police, Hirabhai Parmar, who was in his sixties, was admitted to Dhiraj Hospital on April 29. Parmar’s family members said that the hospital authorities didn’t allow them to meet him. On April 30, the family got a call from the hospital stating that Parmar was facing breathing problems. The application submitted by Pragnesh Parmar said that the victim’s condition worsened and he was declared dead on April 30. The family cremated Parmar’s body that was completely covered according to the Covid protocol. Confusion was created when the hospital staff sent a photograph of Parmar, when he was hospitalized, to the family. The family alleged that the photograph wasn’t of Parmar and they suspected that a wrong body was handed over to them. Dhiraj Hospital officials refuted the claims made by the family. “There is absolutely no confusion. Correct dead body has been handed over to the relatives. There are all medical records which I have personally examined and I take full responsibility for that,” said Dr Lavlesh Kumar, medical superintendent of Dhiraj Hospital. He said that as per Covid-19 protocol the body is packaged. Waghodia police inspector, A G Parmar too said, “The family had doubts but we took them to the hospital. They met the hospital staff following which they were convinced that the body handed over to them was that of Parmar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/row-erupts-over-body-swapping-allegation/articleshow/82392493.cms||---

This, despite Telangana receiving a shipment of four lakh doses of the Covid-19 vaccine late on Monday night and another 75,000 doses yet to arrive. So far, the state has received around 52.9 lakh doses. The health department stated that it had administered 29,079 doses till 2 pm in the afternoon to those had booked their slots. Health director Dr Srinivas Rao said that 41,040 slots had been administered till May through pre-booking. “Those who are coming without booking their slots will not be given the doses,” he said. “We came after booking our slot at this centre but there were no doses available so we had to return. It is good that the state administration has resumed the vaccine drive but the process should be made simpler for the elderly,” said K Utpala, a retired teacher and a resident of Amberpet. Many who were unaware of the compulsory CoWin registration rule went to the vaccine centres at their neighbourhood hospitals. Some persons at King Koti allegedly tried to forcefully enter the vaccination centre despite not having registered on the CoWin platform.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/many-turned-away-from-vax-centres-for-non-registration/articleshow/82394766.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Home care for patients yielding positive results||HYDERABAD: A survey by a city-based NGO, which is treating 2500 Covid-19 patients in home isolation free of cost, reveals that only two percent of patients from districts in Telangana and eight percent from Hyderabad required hospitalisation. The survey also revealed that the higher percentage of hospitalization in city patients is linked to their lifestyle, including sedentary life and co-morbidities. According to Mujtaba Hasan Askari, managing trustee of Helping Hand Foundation (HHF), with the shortage of oxygen beds in hospitals, home isolation care services being rendered by voluntary organisations free of cost is proving to be highly efficient in treatment of Covid-19 patients with mild and moderate symptoms. The survey showed that 43% of patients in home isolation care in the city experienced shortness of breath, 41% lost taste and smell, and 40% reported fever that subsided within a week. “On a positive note, 95% patients in home isolation care are responding well and are on path of recovery. Only two per cent are critical and were hospitalised and 12 deaths were reported in the sample of 1750 home isolation consultation done in the city,” said Mujtaba Hasan Askari. The HHF, which also runs online free home isolation tele-medical helplines along with door delivery of critical health services like oxygen supplies and nursing care, received over 2500 calls, for home isolation care between April 1 and 30. About 30% of these calls were from districts of Telangana and rest 70% from Hyderabad. About two per cent of patients required hospitalization, while undergoing home isolation during treatment in districts, when compared to 8% needing hospitalization during course of home isolation care in the city. “It is beyond doubt that the virus has behaved differently in the core city, when compared to districts. Some of the reasons that we can attribute is to do with the lifestyle of people,” he said. In the calls received from the city, over 45% of calls were for oxygen cylinders, 5% calls were for Remdesivir injections and rest for online consultation for home isolation. While from districts the number of calls for oxygen and Remdesivir were negligible in the early part of April it steadily increased towards the end of the month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/home-care-for-patients-yielding-positive-results/articleshow/82394960.cms||Syed Akbar

They will works as interns under the supervision of faculty. This is in addition to extension of services of post-graduate (PG) final year students by another three months. With postponement of National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-PG) by four months, the Union government had said states and Union territories must make all efforts to reach out to prospective NEET candidates and request them to join Covid -19 workforce in this hour of need. In view of this directive, Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences (KNRUHS) is all set to deploy 4,000 MBBS final year students as interns in government and private teaching hospitals. “All students will have to work under supervision of their faculty on Covid-19 duties. Their internships shall commence in the next two to three weeks,” KNRUHS vice-chancellor Karunaker Reddy said. While the government is roping in health professionals to fight the pandemic, services of close to 1,000 PG students have been extended. “Utilise the services of post-graduates as residents for a period of three months or until a new batch of PG students joins after NEET-PG 2021, whichever is earlier, for smooth functioning of medical institutions in the state during the Covid-19 pandemic second wave,” secretary, health, medical and family welfare department, SAM Rizvi said in a circular issued on May 3. Following extension of their services, the PG students have demanded exam relaxation from National Medical Commission (NMC). “Final year exams require months of rigorous and uninterrupted preparations. But this time, their preparation was derailed following posting in Covid-19 duties and many have even tested positive. The NMC should at least reduce pass percentage from 50% to 35%,” Healthcare Reforms Doctors Association president Mahesh Kumar said. The Telangana Junior Doctors’ Association also wrote a letter to NMC on May 1 seeking exam relaxations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nearly-4000-final-year-mbbs-students-to-be-roped-in-to-bolster-covid-duties/articleshow/82394740.cms||Preeti Biswas

In several cases, patients were also asked to get a ventilator and when they were unable to get their own equipment, attendants were asked to take away the patient. “My aunt was admitted in a mid-sized hospital and after four days of treatment her condition worsened. While she was kept in an oxygen bed, she required an intensive care unit (ICU) facility and the hospital asked us to arrange for a ventilator. When we could not arrange one, we were asked to shift her to some other place,” said Mujeeb, a patient’s relative. “But we were unable to get an ICU bed anywhere for one full day and she passed away,” he said. Many voluntary organisations said they are getting calls from patients for oxygen cylinders, not only under home isolation but also from smaller private hospitals, where they are admitted, wherein hospitals are asking patients to go and fetch their own oxygen supplies. “We have received over 15 to 20 calls last week for oxygen cylinders. Smaller hospitals are asking patients to get Remdesivir injection, which is not available anywhere. Some hospitals have also asked patients to arrange their own non-invasive ventilators too and if they are unable to do so, they are asked to leave,” said Mujtaba Hasan Askari, a trustee with the Helping Hand Foundation. Another group of youngsters who are trying to help patients with these issues, said that they are getting 20 to 25 calls in a week just for arranging oxygen. “Some of the small and mid-sized hospitals are ready to give hospital beds to patients, if they get their own oxygen cylinders. We are getting distress calls from many such patients’ relatives who are curtly asked to move the patient if they cannot arrange for the supply of oxygen,” said Pavan Yedama, a student leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-patients-asked-to-get-their-own-cylinders-arrange-ventilator/articleshow/82394728.cms||Amrita Didyala

According to sources, though the process of transfer of technology by J&J to Indian vaccine maker Biological E has been initiated, it could take another 4-5 months for all the required processes to be completed and full-fledged manufacturing of the vaccines to begin in India. The `Made in India’ J&J vaccine is expected to be available for use only after September, sources said, adding that the export restrictions imposed by the US government on critical vaccine raw materials was one of the key reasons that set back the entire process by nearly a couple of months. While officials of both, J&J and Biological E, declined to comment on the issue, a top department of biotechnology (DBT) official is reported to have recently said that imports of the J&J vaccine for `fill-finish’ in India could happen as early as June-July this year. Last month the Indian government waived the requirement to conduct bridging trial studies before granting emergency use authorisation to foreign-made vaccines that have been approved by regulatory bodies of United States, Europe, Japan or United Kingdom, considered among the most stringent globally. As per the new norms, these vaccines can be imported into the country in ready-to-use vials or `fill and use’ form. However, such vaccines would have to be subjected to post-approval parallel studies in the Indian population, with the first 100 beneficiaries being assessed for seven days for safety before being allowed a full-fledged rollout under the immunisation programme. J&J had, in August 2020, inked a pact with the Hyderabad-based vaccine maker to manufacture around 500 to 600 million doses per annum of its single-dose Covid-19 vaccine called Ad26.COV2.S, which will be manufactured at the Genome Valley facility of Biological E. The vaccine has also been identified as a key weapon in the Quad’s (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) arsenal to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific region, as part of which the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) will be extending financial support to Bio E to help it ramp up capacities to manufacture at least 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/made-in-india-jj-vax-may-roll-out-only-in-q4/articleshow/82394860.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Each team, comprising an ANM (auxiliary nurse midwife), an ASHA worker, and a GHMC entomology worker, checked the temperature of people using a thermal scanner. “Of the 40,000 households surveyed, 1, 487 were suffering with fever. We have immediately given Covid-19 kits to 1,400 out of 1,487 people,” GHMC said in a release, adding that GHMC would be monitoring the health condition of all those suffering from fever. The corporation further added that they sprayed anti-larva chemicals in those areas where more number of fever cases were reported. The corporation stated that they could conduct the fever survey in 40,000 households on a single day as the number of teams were significantly increased. While 393 teams were part of this survey on Monday, the number was increased to 641 on Tuesday. Apart from these household surveys, as many as 18,600Covid-19 tests were conducted at basthi dawakhanas, urban healthcare centres and other hospitals in the city.

---||Hyderabad||Wearing masks reduces chances of death by 87%: Study||HYDERABAD: A study by a group of researchers associated with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the national public health agency of the United States, has found that chances of deaths have reduced by 87 per cent if people wear medical masks. It also said wearing double masks is a better option to counter the UK variant of Covid-19. The study, which was conducted for about six months in the US, said that by wearing a cloth mask, the death rate had reduced by 82 per cent. The medical masks also helped in reducing the cumulative infection by 78 per cent and by 69 per cent if people wore cloth masks. The study also enlightens the fact that those who are still reluctant to wear masks should do so immediately for their own good. The study made important observations on usage of double maks for protection against the UK and Wuhan variants. With strains still having a high reproduction number of 1.6 (one infected person can infect 1.6 persons), the study also stressed on usage of double masks instead of a single mask. Internal medicine specialist Dr Srinivas Yadavalli said though everyone cannot afford surgical masks, they can rely upon cloth masks which are handy to combat the spread of the virus. “Mask is a key component to beat the pandemic. With proper social distancing, we can keep the virus away,” he told TOI. According to Indian Council of Medical Research-certified researcher Dr Kiran Madala, wearing a mask becomes all the more important as the study highlights the fact of wearing of masks by infected people doubles the chances of curbing the infection spread. “In the second wave, most cases have been asymptomatic. Whether some one tests positive or not, he or she should wear masks to bring the down chain of infection. Most asymptomatic people do not know that they are infected,” he said. The study by the researchers also said that a significant factor is how infected people wear the mask and use it properly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wearing-masks-reduces-chances-of-death-by-87-study/articleshow/82394885.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

But the problem starts when roadside vendors and small traders buy vegetables from the wholesalers and sit on the footpath in the morning hours, attracting huge crowds,” senior inspector Anagha Deshpande of the Market Yard police said. The officer said people gathered in large numbers thinking that the stock of the vegetables and fruits would not last long as more people would throng the market after the weekend lockdown. “This is the primary reason for crowding in the area on Mondays and Sundays,” Deshpande said. On Monday and Tuesday mornings, only a single lane of the road was available for the movement of the vehicles, the Market Yard police said. “The footpath and a major portion of the Shivneri Road’s width was occupied by the vendors,” the officer said. After spotting the vegetable vendors and people gathering in large number on the road, the Market Yard police swung into action and asked the vendors to vacate the footpath and road immediately. The police also took action against many vendors. “Within 10-15 minutes, the entire road was vacated,” Deshpande said. She said the police would continue to take action against the vendors if there was crowing again. “We will also seek the help of Pune Municipal Corporation to clear the footpaths of the vendors,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/illegal-vendors-buying-rush-lead-to-crowding-near-market-yard/articleshow/82394043.cms||---

Officials said they received multiple responses for most items, but there has been only one interested in supplying 25,000MT liquid medical oxygen. The cost of the purchase is estimated at Rs 600 crore. The state had issued an expression of interest on April 27, seeking 10 lakh remdesivir vials, 40,000 oxygen concentrators, 134 PSA oxygen generator plants, 25,000MT of liquid oxygen and 27 oxygen storage tanks. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state had received responses from bidders who could supply 3.5 lakh remdesivir injections and 20,000 concentrators. “We are receiving responses from many countries. Most products are not in use in India, and we are seeking advice from the medical fraternity to ensure products we purchase are usable,” said an official. He said negotiations are on to ensure good quality, usable products are bought. Another official said priority was being given to those who can make things available quickly.

---||Nagpur||Allow blood donation early after Covid-19 jab: Experts||Nagpur: With vaccination having started for the 18-44 age group, blood banks are now worried about the blood supply. As per the set Indian standards, a vaccinated person cannot donate blood for at least 28 days after the final vaccination. This means, those who get Covaxin (two doses taken 28 days apart) cannot donate blood for 56 days. In case of Covishield (two doses taken 45-90 days apart), it is up to three months. As majority of blood donors are in the 18-44 age group, the blood banks might face crisis of blood in the next two months. Blood banks have already appealed to enthusiasts to donate blood before they go for the jab, but now they want the central government to revise the rules of blood donation deferral criteria for Covid-19 vaccine on the lines of USA and European guidelines. “In USA, this deferral criteria has been revised to 14 days, while European guidelines have revised it to 7 days. There is no deferral for inactivated virus based vaccine like Covaxin,” said Dr Harish Warbhe, medical director of lifeline Blood Bank. “Our Indian guidelines are based on old, traditional norms without considering the current scientific global norms and pandemic situation. If not revised early, it will lead to severe shortage of blood in India in near future,” he warned. Director of Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Centre, Dr Vinky Rughwani, has stated that blood donation is must for blood disorder patients who require regular transfusion. “Some patients require blood transfusion in a month, some in 20 days while others require blood in 15 days. Due to paucity of blood, the blood banks are now asking the patients to bring blood donors,” said Dr Rughwani. Blood donation camps cannot be held during the ongoing second wave of Covid-19. This has already negatively impacted the thalassemia and sickle cell patients. Vidarbha has a huge number of thalassemia and sickle cell patients. Dr Rughwani has appealed to the donors to donate blood before vaccination. “This could be a great relief for thalassemia and sickle cell patients,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/allow-blood-donation-early-after-covid-19-jab-experts/articleshow/82393997.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Ahmedabad||HC moved for rights of kids||Ahmedabad: An NGO Child Rights Collective, Gujarat, filed a petition in the Gujarat high court on Tuesday and sought directions to the state authorities and the Centre to ensure health and education rights of children of various categories during Covid-19 pandemic. The petitioner through advocate, Anand Yagnik, has urged the HC to direct the education authorities to continue to provide quality education material offline to those underprivileged children, particularly those who do not have access to internet and smart phones until schools reopen in this time pandemic. The petitioner NGO also demanded that the mid-day meal scheme and food supplement schemes under ICDS for Anganwadi children and for kids attending government and aided schools should continue. They are entitled to the benefits under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan Yojana. The petitioner has sought directions for testing and treatment for those children who are in juvenile homes. It insisted that the children from juvenile homes are required to be sent to foster care. For this, there is a pre-condition of at least six-month stay of the child in juvenile home and this needs to be modified in order to send children to foster care quickly to protect them from the disease. Besides, for those kids who have come into conflict with law, the facility of testing and treatment should be arranged in the special homes. The NGO has urged for special directions for spastic children, kids with mongoloid syndrome and other challenged children. As they are unable to stay without their parents, special arrangements are required to be made for their hospitalization, once they get infected with Covid-19. Their parents should be allowed to stay in hospital along with them. A strategy can be evolved where, such special children can be treated not only in hospitals, but at their homes also. The petition has also sought relief for food for migrant labourers and preferential treatment in medical facilities for pregnant women. The HC has sought response of the state on these issues and it is likely to hear it further next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-moved-for-rights-of-kids/articleshow/82394927.cms||---

One of the five deceased was in ICU and others were in the oxygen ward.” The hospital administration claimed that they had been continuously updating the status regarding oxygen availability to the local nodal officer and even a deputy commissioner-rank official deployed in the institution.  “We got a short supply in the hospital last week and had even then raised concerns about the oxygen supply and asked for an increase in supply,” said an official from the hospital’s administrative department. He added that the deputy commissioner-rank officer had been especially deputed in the institution to ensure availability of medicines and oxygen. This is the second incident of oxygen supply disruption in this hospital in the past one week.

We can monitor their movement at the flick of a key from a computer dashboard,” the transport commissioner told TOI. He said that the software would help communicate with tanker operators and re-route a fleet to areas where there is an emergency requirement of medical oxygen. “We can check the position of tankers 24x7 through the control room and hold the operators accountable for delays,” he said, adding that the system was operational from Tuesday, and access was given to municipal chiefs, collectors and divisional commissioners in charge of Covid war rooms. “We have fitted around 125 tankers with GPS, while the rest will be done in a day or two,” he said. The Federation of Automobile Dealer’s Association (FADA), Maharashtra, has funded installation of these devices on vehicles. “We raised nearly Rs 10 lakh and are providing GPS for the tankers. This will help save lives of patients, providing them with oxygen on time,” FADA state chairman Amar Yatin Sheth added. Sources said few tanker operators fitted the device in their vehicles. “But they will be deactivated and a common device will be installed,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-officials-to-check-oxygen-tankers-on-road-24x7-now/articleshow/82394953.cms||Somit Sen
---||Pune||Fake e-pass probe: 50 requests filed from same IP address||Pune: Four days after the Pune police crime branch arrested a travel agent on the charge of tampering with and selling e-passes for travel, investigations have revealed that he used the same internet protocol (IP) address to file 50 e-pass applications for his clients.The agent, Dhanaji Gaganmale (29), a resident of Phursungi, forged and sold e-passes — he would retain the Maharashtra police name and logo and change other details for his customers. He was arrested on April 29.Assistant inspector Prasad Lonare from crime branch (unit V), who is probing the case, said, “The special cell created on April 23 to issue e-passes had approved 18 applications in various names filed by Gaganmale. The cell had later rejected 32 applications filed by Gaganmale, after it came to the notice of the authorities that he was using the same IP address,”Lonare said Gaganmale had tampered with five of the 32 rejected applications by inserting the names and other details of his customers.Earlier, Gaganmale was produced before the Pune cantonment court after the initial term of his custodial remand ended on Tuesday.Assistant public prosecutor Santosh Patale told the court that the police had seized two mobile phones, a laptop and a hard drive used in the crime. The seized devices were sent to the forensic science laboratory for analysis.Patale argued that the police were in the process of collecting details of Gaganmale’s bank transactions and call record details from the mobile phone companies. He submitted that Gaganmale was not cooperating with the police and not revealing the names of any accomplices.The prosecution sought time to record his customers’ statements and requested that his custodial remand be extended by five days. The defence lawyer opposed the prosecution’s plea, stating the court had given enough time to the police to question Gaganmale and that nothing incriminating was required to be recovered from him. The lawyer asked for his client to be remanded in magisterial custody.Judicial magistrate first class A S Deshpande later sent the suspect to magisterial custody for 14 days. He was later sent to the temporary jail in Yerawada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fake-e-pass-probe-50-requests-filed-from-same-ip-address/articleshow/82394016.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Experts attribute TRS poll success to course correction||HYDERABAD: After Dubbak bypoll and GHMC election reverses, the TRS has reconsolidated its position in Telangana by winning the graduates MLC elections, Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll and civic elections.Experts attributed this to poll management, course correction of government and political strategies of TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. While the BJP created an impact in Dubbak and GHMC polls but failed to make further inroads, Congress continued to be on a weak wicket by tasting successive defeats in electoral battles. BJP former MLC N Ramchander Rao, who himself lost the MLC elections in Hyderabad, said: “The debacle of our party in the MLC polls was shocking. KCR knew that he cannot afford to lose another election for his party’s survival.” He said had the TRS lost Nagarjuna Sagar seat, ousted minister Eatala Rajender would have got support from within party. “To avoid a split in the party, KCR himself is drawing political strategies to win the elections and to put his party’s house in order,” he said. Former MLC professor K Nageshwar said KCR did course correction after learning lessons from Dubbak defeat. “He announced 27% fitment for employees and 50,000 jobs for unemployed. The CM is giving indications to the people that he is ready to solve the problems,” he said. “Due to the course correction after Dubbak and GHMC polls, the ruling TRS is again winning elections,” said Nageshwar. He added: “Also, there is no universal discontent for change of the government in Telangana. People want to strike at KCR but not wound him. People have not yet decided to dislodge KCR. They gave him a shock therapy in Dubbak and GHMC elections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/experts-attribute-trs-poll-success-to-course-correction/articleshow/82394966.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Incident commander Dadasaheb Kamble issued three separate orders for the town, industries and rural areas. “Deputy chief minister and district guardian minister Ajit Pawar had told the tehsil administration to take the decision in the Covid review meeting held on Saturday,” Kamble said. He said Covid-19 cases were increasing at an alarming rate in the tehsil and a strict lockdown was the only option to control the situation. “Almost the entire Baramati town is marked as a containment zones as most of its areas fall in the 19 wards that have active Covid-19 cases. Unless we impose strict lockdown, the cases will not reduce,” Kamble said. No two-wheeler commute would be allowed for industrial employees in the tehsil during the lockdown. “We have told the companies to arrange buses for the transportation of their employees. We have also directed the companies to provide accommodation to their employees on their campuses. But a very few firms have made this arrangement, while some are in the process,” he said. The tehsil has recorded 19,901 Covid-19 cases since the outbreak of the pandemic. Of these, as many as 15,558 have been discharged after recovery, while 387 succumbed to the virus and 3,956 are active cases till date. Tehsil health officer Dr Manoj Khomne said the positivity rate of the tehsil increased to 41% two weeks ago. “Now, it has come down to 28% due to restrictions imposed in the town and rural areas in the last two weeks. We believe that this rate will come down further after the implementation of strict lockdown for a week,” he said. The tehsil administration has been testing aggressively across its limit. Over 1,500 tests are being conducted in the tehsil every day, said Khomne. As many as 94 out of 118 gram panchayats in the tehsil have reported Covid-19 cases till date. “Twenty two villages near Baramati town or in the periphery where industrial units are located have been declared as hotspots,” Khomne added.

UT adviser Manoj Parida on Tuesday announced that the vaccine will be administered free of cost. District immunisation officer Dr Manjit Singh said they have already paid the Serum Institute of India (SII) for 30,000 doses of Covishield vaccine. “It is expected by May 15. As we cannot divert vaccines from the existing quota of priority groups of 45 years and above, we will not start the drive till the doses are received.” On the other hand, both Panchkula and Mohali have started vaccination for 18 years and above. A public health expert said, “Many come to UT from Mohali and Panchkula for work and other essential services. We need to treat the Tricity as a single unit. If the satellite towns have started coverage for this group, Chandigarh should also begin soon to make the drive beneficial.” Sources in the health department said initially the department had asked for one lakh doses, but due to the high demand for vaccines throughout the country, it was reduced to 30,000. “We know out of around three lakh beneficiaries, not more than one lakh will come for vaccination. We can meet the demand of 15,000 beneficiaries and by the time we immunise them, we will get the next consignment as well,” said an official in the UT health department. To date, over two lakh beneficiaries have received the jabs in the city. “In Panchkula, there had been times when not a single site was operational. But we are consistently running our 49 sites throughout the week without any day off,” said the DIO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/vaccine-free-in-ut-30k-doses-may-come-by-may-15/articleshow/82394084.cms||Shimona Kanwar

As per the SOP, only the chief priests (rawals) of the four shrines will be allowed to enter in the temples’ main sanctum and no pilgrims will have access to the temples because of the current Covid situation. All VIP movement has also been prohibited inside the temples. The SOP outlines that the shrines will be open for ritual worship from 7am to 7pm, starting from May 14. The use of bells, vermilion and any kind of religious study material is prohibited in the temple along with mats or rugs to reduce the risk of infection. Alcohol-based sanitisers will be used to sanitise the hands. The shrines will open after the winter break as per their stipulated dates. Gangotri temple will open on May 14 followed by Yamunotri on May 15, Kedarnath on May 17 and Badrinath on May 18. The temple administration has also been asked to sanitise the temple gates and arrange for thermal screening for local priests (hak haokkok dhari). “The current SOP has been prepared keeping in mind the state of the pandemic, and the safety of our people which is our topmost priority. We are also working on finding solutions for people whose livelihoods have been affected due to suspension of the yatra. Our government is continuously in touch with the officials and the local businessmen regarding possibilities of opening up the yatra once the situation improves,” said tourism minister Satpal Maharaj. The yatra has been suspended for pilgrims until further orders. Even last year, the yatra was opened for the general public late, on July 1, instead of early May due to Covid. As per estimates of the Devasthanam Board, over 3.2 lakh pilgrims visited Char Dham temples between July and November last year. In comparison, more than 35 lakh people thronged to the four shrines in 2019, before the Covid outbreak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/devasthanam-board-issues-sops-for-opening-char-dham-temples/articleshow/82393315.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat high court raps govt for discrepancy in RT-PCR machine count||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday pointed to a discrepancy in the details furnished by the state government with regard to the number of RT-PCR machines. The court rebuked the government for placing unverified data before it on oath. The HC clarified that the proceeding was not a fact-finding exercise. But the court said that it wants correct data and an honest version from the state government. During a hearing of the suo motu PIL on Covid-19 cases, Justice B D Karia of the division bench said that according to the state government’s April 19 affidavit, there should be 100 functioning RT-PCR machines. But the new report on Monday evening stated that after an increase, the total number of functioning machines is 72. The judge said, “There seems to be some problem with information placed before us. What is the correct thing?” The judge went on to say: “If today’s statement is correct then what you had stated on April 19 was not correct.” Chief Justice Vikram Nath immediately commented, “This is not to please us. If you have information, just tell us. There is no point in hiding information.” The high court also questioned the government on the reduction in testing numbers, to which the government law officer tried to explain that the number of tests keeps changing every day. Advocate Percy Kavina representing the Gujarat High Court Advocates Association (GHAA) said there were complaints from rural areas that people were being turned away because of a testing kit paucity. Justice Karia said that all districts have such complaints. The advocate general defended the discrepancy in the data by arguing that since information is gathered from all corners of the state in a very short time, mistakes occur. The crisis is unprecedented, the advocate general said. “We are not trying to fudge figures or hide them,” he explained. To this, the CJ said, “We are not into fact-finding, but we want correct data, an honest version before the court, what is the present status.” The CJ also asked the government to remain careful in this regard in the future and give the exact numbers in its next affidavit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-raps-govt-for-discrepancy-in-rt-pcr-machine-count/articleshow/82394085.cms||---
---||Delhi||Recovery rate improves in Delhi, no info on fresh Covid-19 cases||NEW DELHI: For the first time this year, the Delhi government did not release its health bulletin on Covid-19 cases and deaths reported in the last 24 hours on Tuesday. The officials responsible for collating the information did not offer any explanation for the delay either. The data to be shared involves new cases and deaths reported in up till a day before, in this case Monday. Earlier, on Monday, Delhi had reported record 448 deaths in 24 hours – the highest since the pandemic began. From May 1 to May 3, Delhi had reported more than 400 deaths in a day. The total number of deaths due to Covid-19 in the national capital is 17,414 as on May 3. The number of new reported cases on Monday was 18,043, which was lower than Sunday’s 20,394 cases. This could be due to decrease in testing. In April second week, the city conducted over one lakh tests of which nearly 70,000 tests were done using RT-PCR that is considered the gold standard for testing Covid-19. The positivity rate of Covid-19 is around 30%. On the brighter side, Delhi’s recovery rate has increased. In the last 24 hours, officials said, 20,293 people recovered from Covid-19. The total number of active cases that had touched nearly one lakh last week had reduced to 89,592. The availability of oxygen and ICU beds, however, remains scarce. Data shared by the state health department shows 56% of the active cases are recuperating under home isolation. Public health specialists say strict lockdown is needed in areas with a high positivity rate to reduce the cases and therefore the pressure on hospitals. “Our health infrastructure is overstretched. Doctors are facing burnout and mental trauma handling so many cases. But they are still continuing to work to be able to save as many lives as possible,” said a doctor at Lok Nayak Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/recovery-rate-improves-in-city-no-info-on-fresh-cases/articleshow/82394964.cms||---

A resident of Haridwar, the deceased was 23-weeks pregnant and had finally conceived through IVF after trying to get pregnant for the past 10 years of her marriage. “She used to get up and then again sit. She was not speaking a word but the pain she was undergoing was visible on her face,” said a staff nurse from the Covid ICU ward where the woman was admitted. Talking to TOI, Sophia Hussain, the deceased’s sister said that she was initially admitted in Haridwar but was later moved to Doon Hospital about a week ago. She needed plasma but it could not be administered to her as she had high fever in the past 24 hours. “We tried all possible ways to save her but nothing worked", added Hussain. Dr Atul Kumar, ICU in-charge at the Doon hospital informed that she was initially admitted in the women’s wing of the hospital and was later moved to the Covid ICU on Friday. “We tried our best but couldn’t save her. She was very sick,” added Dr Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/a-23-wk-pregnant-woman-and-her-twins-lose-battle-to-covid/articleshow/82393306.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Goa||Overworked doctors want Covid casualty to be streamlined||PANAJI: Doctors working in Covid casualties are swamped with patients and are asking for better administration in managing both patients and their relatives to allow them to perform their jobs better. “Administration needs to step up. There is no filtering point to the casualty and no triage is being done. There needs to be proper management of people coming in. Referrals, new admissions and critical patients need to be seen separately,” a GMC doctor told TOI. He told TOI he sees between 100-200 patients in the casualty during a 12-hour shift with 240 CT scans being done each day on Covid patients. “We need better triage for the casualty. The chaos is straining us as the number of doctors are fixed with one doctor having to manage around 60 patients. Imagine the lapse of judgement that is occurring,” he said. Health centres and private hospitals continue to direct patients to GMC, he says. “Instead of treating patients at their level, they’re just sending them here. We are getting more patients than we can handle. GMC has become like a dumping ground and its turning into a morgue,” the doctor said. At the South Goa district hospital, symptomatic patients along with asymptomatic ones wait along with those who have come to collect isolation kits. There are also those who have come for follow ups as well as references from a government or private hospital. “They all barge in at once and we are swamped although we do our best to save those who are gasping,” a healthcare worker said. People who queue up for their kits end up waiting hours with doctors attending to serious patients in the casualty. “Some people demand one kit per family member. They should all be redirected to their health centres instead of adding to the confusion in casualty,” a healthcare worker said. In addition, healthcare workers say they have to deal with patients and relatives who insist that they require hospital admission even when they clinically don’t require it. “I’m here to get admitted, they tell us. They want to block a bed and it’s like a race for a bed. If they don’t need a bed, they should be happy,” a doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/overworked-docs-want-covid-casualty-to-be-streamlined/articleshow/82394979.cms||Lisa Monteiro

The UT has added two conditions in the permission letter. The first is the association will have to ensure that out of the total bed capacity of the centre, 80% are oxygenated. The second condition is the arrangements for refilling of oxygen cylinders from the approved private vendor will be ensured by the UT administration at the rate at which it is being done for GMCH-32. “We have put a new condition that at least 80% beds are oxygenated. Oxygen cylinders will be refilled from approved vendor at the same rate as is being charged from GMCH-32. All three have agreed and will try even for 100% oxygenated beds,” said Yashpal Garg, nodal officer for mini Covid care centres in Chandigarh.  Meanwhile, the UT administration has given Infosys sarai building in PGI to Sri Guru Granth Sahib Sewa Society for 100-bed Covid care centre. “In view of the excellent work done by the society in setting up 50-bed centre at Bal Bhawan, Sector 23, the Infosys sarai has been allotted to it to set up a 100-bed centre with oxygen facility,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida. Apart from this society, the UT also issued two permission letters to Sartaj Lamba, founder, Be Sure Buddy Private Limited, for setting up a centre at Aurobindo School, Sector 27, and Amar Vivek, trustee, Sri Sathya Sai Gramin Jagriti, for a centre at Badminton Hall, Government Girls’ Senior Secondary School, Sector 8-B, Chandigarh.

After being rebuked by the Gujarat HC, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Tuesday has revoked its earlier notification of April 5, exempting Ahmedabad residents from having to show a negative RT-PCR report requiring only their Aadhaar card. Following several other states, Gujarat made it mandatory for all passengers arriving in the state to carry an RT-PCR negative report not older than 72 hours. Interestingly, the AMC’s decision came after the Gujarat high court pulled up the state government over ‘failing in its supervision of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-residents-now-need-ve-rt-pcr-report/articleshow/82394094.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||‘No quarantine, no records being maintained for thousands of migrants returning to hills’||NAINITAL: As thousands of migrants return to remote parts of Uttarakhand following curfews in several cities across the country, village heads say that unlike the first wave, no one is being quarantined, no records are being maintained and even the administration is not being informed about the arrivals. Speaking to TOI, village heads from several hill districts said that last year they had developed makeshift quarantine centres, arranged food and sanitisation using their own funds but they are still to be reimbursed and therefore, this year, they have decided to not do anything. “We arranged food, water, soap and other basic facilities for people returning from the cities. The government had promised that they will release money and reimburse us but even a year later, we have not received anything,” said a gram pradhan from Pauri, the district that has maximum number of migrant workers in other cities. She added that some people had returned to her village a few days ago but she decided neither to visit the family nor inform the administration. “Why should we take the risk when no one is bothered?” she said, nonchalantly. Meanwhile another pradhan from Nainital’s Okhalkanda said that he has not received any direction from the administration and therefore hasn’t done anything to keep a tab on the returnees. “Earlier we were recording each and every detail. We would visit the houses and enquire about the family’s health but this time, there hasn’t been any such direction from the administration,” he said. According to the state migration commission, over 80,000 migrants have returned to villages and the number is expected to go over one lakh by mid-May. Experts say that if left unchecked, the migrants will contribute to an increase in the number of cases. “Last year, the administration was more vigilant and a large number of people travelling to hills were being tested. But there hasn't been any such step this year yet. Already, grim reports are coming from hill districts of large number of people falling sick and just going on home isolation without proper advice," said social activist Anoop Nautiyal, who is closely tracking the Covid-19 situation in the state. Officials meanwhile claimed they are making sure the returnees are quarantined. Naintial district magistrate Dheeraj Garbyal said that the administration has created city and block-level monitoring teams to keep track of migrants. “We have identified over 2400 people who have returned so far and are making sure that they are quarantined. We have also made extensive arrangements to test people coming from outside the state and no one is being allowed into the district without a Covid-negative certificate,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-quarantine-no-records-being-maintained-for-thousands-of-migrants-returning-to-hills/articleshow/82393318.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Elgar case accused file quashing petition, HC seeks state, probe officer’s response||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Tuesday directed the Maharashtra government and investigating officer Shivaji Pawar to repond to petitions filed by activists Rona Wilson (42) and Shoma Sen (62), accused of alleged Maoist links in the 2018 Elgar Parishad case, in Pune. Wilson and Sen are seeking quashing of their prosecution on the grounds of faulty prior sanction issued by the state government. Their petitions also cite an independent US digital forensic report by Arsenal Consulting of possible ‘planting’ of incriminating documents into Wilson’s laptop by an unidentified hacker. A bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale also directed the National Investigation Agency, which has conducted probe in the case since January 2020, to file its reply to Sen’s quashing petition. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for NIA said it would be filing it soon, but objected to the petitions saying it was based on an independent forensic report. Senior counsel Indira Jaising and Anand Grover appearing for the accused activists saidthe petitions have challenged the prior prosecution sanction issued by the state “at the relevant time in 2018” which the state must respond to separately, as must the original investigating officer in the case. “Is the NIA speaking for the state?” asked Jaising adding, else the state and the IO — who has been made a part — has to reply as direct allegations have been made that information was suppressed from the sanctioning authority when computers were handed over for analysis after their seizure in 2018. Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare said he would take instructions and reply for the state. Both the petitions claim that the evidence against them is “fraudulent” and based solely on electronic records allegedly recovered from laptops seized from Wilson’s home. Wilson cited the US forensic report to contend they are “framed by somebody”. The NIA, however, said his entire petition does not mention framed by who, “if at all it has even happened”, hence is “vague” and cannot be considered at this stage. “The record allegedly comprises a series of purported letters allegedly written by and exchanged between the co-accused and members of CPI(Maoist) proscribed organization under UAPA,” they said adding there is “not a single corroborative evidence”. The FSL report of November 15, 2018, is “silent” about the existence of any “malware” or of any “tampering with the electronic evidence,” said Sen’s petition. The HC posted the matter for further hearing in June second week and sought the assistance of all counsel as it said it was a very technical issue that would be argued, which Jaising said will be “perhaps for the first time”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-elgar-case-accused-file-quashing-petition-hc-seeks-state-probe-officers-response/articleshow/82396044.cms||---
---||Dehradun||With travel suspended due to Covid crisis, families send remains of deceased to Haridwar through courier, get rituals done online||DEHRADUN: For many families who are unable to travel due to the Covid-19 situation, last rites have shifted online, with families sending last remains of the deceased through courier to priests in Haridwar who are conducting the ash immersion ceremony and thereafter, the other post-death rituals online. Parikshit Sharma, a priest at Har-ki-Pauri ghat in Haridwar, said, “A number of people across the country want to perform last rites of their family members in Haridwar but are unable to travel due to the pandemic. Many of them are now sending the asthi (remains)through courier. Our priests perform the rituals for them while they watch it online.” With a surge in Covid-related deaths, many family members of those who died due to the disease are also in quarantine, making it impossible for them to travel for conducting rituals. “People want to perform last rites for family members with due rituals but the situation is such that it is not possible for many to do so in the present circumstances. Conducting the ceremony online has therefore emerged as an alternative,” said a priest at Kankhal in Haridwar. Also, another reason for the emergence of the online option is that many priests are not willing to do the ceremony physically for families which had a Covid-related death for fear of contracting the infection. Even if they agree, they ask for a high fee. Ajay Diwan, a businessman who recently lost his father to Covid-19, said he paid a priest Rs 3,500 for a small puja that costs around Rs 1,000. Some organisations have meanwhile stepped in to provide services to bereaved families. Last Journey Funeral Services, a firm that conducts last rites, is now offering to take a Covid-infected body to a cremation ground and video-call the family from there as the body is placed on the pyre. Talking to TOI, Rishabh Jalan from www.lastjourney.in said, “We have a team of 25 people working in shifts who cater to the needs of people from performing last rites of families who have to stay in isolation to organising online prayer meetings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/with-travel-suspended-due-to-covid-crisis-families-send-remains-of-deceased-to-haridwar-through-courier-get-rituals-done-online/articleshow/82393328.cms||Abhijeet Singh

---||Chandigarh||Mohali district runs out of anti-Covid vaccine, no sessions for two days||MOHALI: The Mohali health department has run out of anti-Covid vaccines and there will be no jab sessions for two days. However, the civil surgeon said they may receive the next batch of vaccines by Wednesday, after which the process would restart. Mohali started vaccination on Tuesday morning, but within few minutes the stock was exhausted and many beneficiaries had to return without getting jabbed. The vaccine was being administered at 30 centres across the district and the main centre was at Dr Ambedkar Institute of Medical Sciences in Phase VI, which was closed by 10am. Civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said, “Yes, vaccine stocks have exhausted and we expect to get it by Wednesday, after which we will restart the process.” At present, Mohali, which is administering both Covishield as well as Covaxin, is yet to start vaccinating 18 to 44 years category as Punjab is still to get its share of doses. Approximately 8,000 beneficiaries in categories of 60+, 45 to 59 years, healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) were being vaccinated in Mohali daily for the past many days. The civil surgeon said to date 85,188 FLWs have been given the first dose, of which 75,397 got Covishield and 9,791 Covaxin, while 5,172 got the second dose, of which 5,009 got Covishield and 163 Covaxin. A total of 11,368 HCWs have been given the first dose, of which 10,863 got Covishield and 505 Covaxin; 5,560 HCWs have been given the second dose, of which 5,460 got Covishield and 100 Covaxin. In the category of 60 years and above, 52,324 have been jabbed for the first dose, of which 48,414 got Covishield and 3,910 Covaxin, while 10,424 have been given the second dose, of which 9,805 got Covishield and 619 Covaxin. In 45 to 59 years group, 66,864 have been jabbed for the first dose, of which 59,778 got Covishield and 7,086 Covaxin, and 6,006 have been given the second dose, of which 5,564 got Covishield and 442 Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-also-runs-out-of-vax-no-sessions-for-2-days/articleshow/82394096.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Some hospitals gear up to become self-reliant in terms of O2 supply||PUNE: Some small and medium-sized hospitals in the city are gearing up to become self-reliant by setting up oxygen generation plants on their premises in the wake of the unprecedented crisis of the life-saving gas in PMR. “Unlike big hospitals, small and medium-sized health hubs depend mainly on the daily supply of oxygen cylinders from outside. A sizeable number of them are now setting up a plant that separates gases from a mixture in the atmosphere to generate concentrated oxygen that can be supplied to hospital beds through a pipeline, negating the need to buy pressurized liquid oxygen from outside sources like distributors and refillers," said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India. Mahesh-Smruti Multispeciality hospital, a 52-bed unit, will have one such plant functional on its premises in Manjari by May 25. “We went through harrowing times in terms of managing the oxygen supply from outside in the last three weeks. Hence, we decided to become self-reliant. The oxygen generation plant has cost us Rs19 lakh. Its daily capacity to separate oxygen from the atmosphere is equivalent to 25 jumbo cylinders,” said hospital owner and physician Milind Lohakare. A jumbo cylinder contains 7,000 litre of compressed medical-grade oxygen. The hospital's struggle to get the daily requirement of oxygen is still far from over. “ We have stopped taking new admissions and even asked a few admitted patients to see if they could shift to some other hospitals. We have to manage patients on the daily supply of cylinders till our plant gets operational,” said hospital director and ophthalmologist Shubhangi Lohakare. Oyster and Pearl hospital is also exploring the idea of setting up the oxygen generation plant. “The uncertainty has pushed us to think of becoming self-reliant," said paediatrician-neonatologist Amita Phadnis, who is the hospital’s director. Orthopedic surgeon Ramesh Ranka of Ranka hospital said, "I have requested the Indian Medical Association to support small hospitals by setting up the oxygen generation plant of their own with a daily capacity of generating oxygen equivalent to 100 jumbo cylinders. I am still spending 60% of the working time only in managing oxygen supply which has although comparatively improved since the last three days.” Medical expert Siddharth Dhende who runs a small hospital at Nagpur Chawl in Yerawada, said, “The supply of medical oxygen has slowly started improving in Pune. However, many hospitals still have to beg and borrow oxygen cylinders to continue daily patient-care services.” Sagar Gaikwad, chief administrative officer, Citi Care hospital Pimpri, said, “Many small hospitals cannot go for creating their own oxygen plant. Hence they have increased their back-up in terms of the vendors, who supply the oxygen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/some-hosps-gear-up-to-become-self-reliant-in-terms-of-o2-supply/articleshow/82394118.cms||Umesh Isalkar

If the president is not interested in coming, there is nothing we can do. The administration cannot come to a halt for one person. Vice-president John Manoj conducted the meeting,” secretary R Vijayanand told TOI. Azhar was clearly unhappy with the development. “I am given to understand that some tainted members of the apex council, who are facing an enquiry under 41(1)(b) of the HCA constitution, are scheduling meetings of the apex council in violation of 7(1)(a) of the constitution which is self-indicative of collapse of administration in HCA. All I want to say is, let’s go by the constitution. Those facing an inquiry should get their names cleared by the inquiry authority before administration can resume. It is unfortunate that members facing charges want to sit in apex meetings by painting themselves white. I cannot allow this and will use all legal options to prevent the collapse of moral & ethical Governance in HCA.” Azhar had communicated to stakeholders on April 30 that the apex council meeting cannot be convened now as an inquiry is on against against five office-bearers — John Manoj, Vijayanand, joint secretary Naresh Sharma, treasurer Surender Agarwal and councillor P Anuradha. Tuesday’s meeting was attended by John Manoj, Vijayanand, Sharma and Agarwal. Anuradha attended the meeting online. Azharuddin, the players’ panel nominees Parth Satwalkar, and Subhadra Suri and the CAG nominee were absent. The meeting decided to shelve plans for a proposed cricket camp due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. “Giving pension to former players is a long-pending demand, and we decided to implement it from December 2020,” Vijayanand said. The apex council also decided to grant Rs 5 lakh ex gratia to the family of former Hyderabad player Ashwin Yadav, who passed away recently. “Decisions taken at the AGM should be implemented immediately. Therefore, we will be sending appointment letters to the CAC, CEO, CFO and other committees, which were approved at the AGM. The matter regarding the appointment of the ombudsman and ethics officer is in court. Hence we didn’t refer to that,” Vijayanand said. He also said that it was decided to give Rs 10,000 towards maintenance of each ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hca-apex-council-defies-azhar-meets/articleshow/82394974.cms||Solomon S Kumar

---||Pune||2nd dose delayed for many, experts say longer gap okay||Pune: The ongoing vaccine shortage in the state has delayed the second dose of Covishield for scores of beneficiaries. Many in the city said they are now past the eight-week interval between the first and second shot. In March, the Centre had extended the gap between Covishield doses from 4-6 weeks to 6-8 weeks. Experts later said further delays will not impact protection. They cited examples of the UK and Canada, where gaps between doses have been extended to 12 and 16 weeks respectively. But worried citizens said health officials in the region should ensure the follow-up shots are administered as soon as possible. Data shows that as on May 2, the district had over 99,000 people due for their second jab of Covishield.  Ashok Kanetkar, an 81-year-old retired cardiac surgeon and wife Anjali (76), got their first dose of Covishield on March 6 (they were at eight weeks three days ago). “The state government has been using all of its vaccine stock in the last few days for the 18-44 group. What about senior citizens? We cannot be partially vaccinating those who need protection the most,” Kanetkar said. Prem Kumar Snehi (66), a resident of Mundhwa, got his first Covishield shot on March 10. He's still searching for sites for the second dose. He said, “I was turned away from both public and private hospital sites. On Monday, officials at one centre told me to check in after eight days. There’s now a big question mark on when my second dose will be.” It’s a similar case with Rajendra Singh Baoni (80) and wife Rani (70). The couple said they have been trying to get the second Covishield dose for hte past two weeks. “My wife got her first shot on March 14. I got it on March 18. Both of us will complete the eight-week interval in the next few days.” Leading health experts said a gap of even 12 weeks between Covishield shots should not be a problem. Gangandeep Kang, professor of microbiology at CMC, Vellore, and an expert on vaccines said, “A recent study by Public Health England (pertaining to the UK variant) has shown 65% protection against symptomatic Covid-19 and 80% against severe form of the disease after a single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield in India). In the UK, the recommended gap between two doses is 12 weeks. In Canada, authorities have opted for up to 16 weeks between two doses of the same vaccine, aiming to give more people one dose than fewer people two doses.” Kang said those who have not been able to get their second Covishield dose eight weeks after the first, “need not panic”. Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid-19 task force, said, “The Centre has recommended a six to eight-week gap between the first and second Covishield shot. A delay in getting the second dose due to logistical issues should not cause panic. The gap between two doses of this vaccine can stretch up to 12 weeks. This does not apply to Covaxin as its second dose is to be taken four to six weeks after the first.” Giridhar Babu, member of the Epidemiology, Surveillance and Research group (constituted by the ICMR National Task Force) said, “The government of India guidelines should be followed for the dosage schedule. But if the second Covishield dose is delayed beyond eight weeks, beneficiaries need not worry. However, they must get it as soon as possible.” (With inputs from Piyush Bhusari)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2nd-dose-delayed-for-many-experts-say-longer-gap-okay/articleshow/82394097.cms||Neha Madaan

Around 15 of the accused were later remanded to police custody by the court for two days while rest were sent to the central jail. In another follow up action by the police at the same locations, additionally 43 persons were arrested for bootlegging related offences. Ajni police and it’s counterparts from other units had come under heavy stone pelting as bootleggers and gamblers had resorted to pelting stones on the vehicles of the cops. Three women home guards were also injured during the attack. The cops had a tough time bringing the accused to the police station as a mob of around 300-400 women and children had attacked police.

After a few days, any one of them will remain there. Depending upon requirement, they are allowed to use a private hired vehicle to commute between Chandigarh and Barotiwala and also to stay there round-the-clock,” states order issued by Yashpal Garg, nodal officer of oxygen supplies in Chandigarh.  The order further reads that Dr Manjit Singh, medical officer, GMH-16, will continue to coordinate with M/s Inox, Barotiwala, with the assistance of these officers.The UT administration has already roped in three vendors for refilling of cylinders to be used by health institutions of the city.Garg said, “The ministry of health and family welfare has fixed the daily quota of 20MT of medical oxygen for UT from Inox, Barotiwala. This medical oxygen is being utilised for GMH-16, GMCH-32 and the Covid hospital in Sector 48. Recently, three oxygen generation plants were commissioned at these three hospitals.” However, there is an additional requirement for refilling of oxygen in cylinders in these three government hospitals. The private healthcare institutions also require medical oxygen and PGIMER’s requirement is met from a separate quota. After meeting the daily requirements of GMCH-32, GMH-16 and Sector 48 Covid hospital, the remaining oxygen, out of 20MT quota of UT, will be provided to the private refilling vendors to cater to the needs of the other government hospitals and private healthcare institutions in the city. Garg added that they are monitoring supply to these private institutions too.Anaesthetic Gases Pvt Ltd (AGPL), Sector 22-A, is the approved private refilling vendor for GMCH-32, GMH-16 and Sector 48 Covid hospital. AGPL is also refilling cylinders for private institutions. Later, two more vendors—Chandigarh Gases, Industrial Area, Phase I, and Super Gases, Derabassi—were roped in to provide oxygen, out of the UT quota, for refilling cylinders for both government and private institutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/oxygen-supply-ut-deputes-two-officials-at-baddi-plant/articleshow/82394107.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh issued notice to the ministries of law and home affairs for a stand on the petition. The petitioner, a law student, alleged that the GNCTD (Amendment Act) 2021 is in violation of Articles 13, 14 19 and 239AA of the Constitution of India. Skrikant Prasad claimed that the Act, which came into force on April 27, “re-defines Delhi government as the lieutenant governor” and curbs the Delhi assembly’s power to conduct proceedings. “The Act provides that the opinion of the LG must be obtained before taking any executive action on decisions of the Delhi government, on such matters as may be specified by the LG,” the petition argued.

---||Pune||Hotspots down in civic limits, up in rural areas||PUNE: The Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations have reported a drop in the number of micro-containment zones in their respective limits, mostly due to the decline in fresh Covid-19 cases and an increase in recoveries over the past two weeks. In contrast, the number of Covid-19 hotspots has gone up from 399 to 453 in just one week in the rural areas, which include 13 tehsils and 14 municipal councils. Around mid-April, PMC limits had 497 micro-containment zones. Now, the number stands at 254. Similarly, the neighbouring PCMC had 3,000 hotspots in mid-April, which has dipped to 2,171 this week. Health officials from both the civic bodies said stricter restrictions have helped curb the spread of the contagion and caused a 45% dip in containment zones in PMC limits and a 30% dip in PCMC limits. A PMC official said this was the first time the number of micro-clusters dropped since it began to climb up in February. “The active cases in PMC limits have dropped from 54,600 on April 19 to 40,701 now. Around 89 buildings and 104 societies are now marked as micro-containment zones. Two weeks ago. over 200 buildings and as many housing societies were declared micro-containment zones,” the official said. In PMC, the Hadapsar-Mundhwa, Sinhagad Road and Dhankawdi areas have continued to report more cases and so, have more micro-containment zones. On Tuesday, Pune ZP chief executive Ayush Prasad laid out a comprehensive plan on Covid mitigation. “We have allowed gram panchayats to hire doctors and paramedical staff on contractual basis. They would be paid as per the charges fixed under National Health Mission. The gram panchayats are also allowed to convert ZP schools and high schools into isolation facilities. The ZP will provide financial assistance for basic infrastructure, such toilets. Sanitisation is to be done at hamlets and areas where positive patients have been reported during the week. Patients who can’t be home isolated should be admitted to a nearby Covid Care Centre,” he said. No public event, like cricket matches or bullock cart races. will be allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hotspots-down-in-civic-limits-up-in-rural-areas/articleshow/82394108.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Ahmedabad||HC wants remdesivir demand, supply data||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday ordered the state government to place before it details of distribution of remdesivir injections and demand from districts and corporations. The chief justice asked the advocate general to supply the details on demand and allocation in the form of a chart during the next hearing on May 11. During the hearing, the government told the HC that its distribution agency exhausts its stock every day and it has adopted a policy of allocating the medication on the basis of requirements judged by the severity of patients’ illness. There is no distinction between a government and private hospital anymore. The advocates’ association, which is a party to the litigation, complained that supply is much lower than demand for all districts. The high court asked the Centre whether it could increase the central remdesivir quota once production by seven manufacturers has risen from 34 lakh to 1.03 crore vials. Assistant solicitor general Devang Vyas submitted that every state communicates its requirement to manufacturers and promised that allocation would be increased. Since the Union government has centralized allocation of remdesivir injections, it planned allocation of 3.07 lakh vials to Gujarat between April 21 and May 9. The state government has asked for 4 lakh vials more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-wants-remdesivir-demand-supply-data/articleshow/82394114.cms||---

At one centre in Sector 20, those above 70 years alleged that there had been no vaccine for the past five days. As per the official data, only 2,056 persons were vaccinated in all the categories on Tuesday, which included 819 beneficiaries in the 18+ age group, 66 healthcare and frontline workers received first dose and 74 the second. Those in the age group of 45 years and above faced a tough time and 354 received first dose and 743 second dose. Members of the Residents’ Welfare Association (RWA) in Sector 20 said their request to the administration to arrange vaccination for people in the age group of 70-75 years had fallen on deaf ears. These people have got the first dose and the second was due, but due to shortage, there have been no vaccination sessions at the dispensary in Sector 20 for the past five days, the members alleged.The association appealed to the administration that as corona cases were on the rise and people in societies lived close by, there were chances of infection spreading rapidly. Due to the stoppage of vaccination, the elderly waiting for the second dose have been worried for the past few days, said association president KK Jindal. RWA members asked the district administration and district civil surgeon to issue orders to arrange vaccines at the Sector 20 dispensary. Sources said the administration was short of vaccines.The sites for 18 years and above category included urban health centre (UHC) in Sector 16, government dispensary in Sector 25, Government Ayurvedic Dispensary in Sector 9, community health centre (CHC) in Raipur Rani, primary health centres (PHCs) in Pinjore and Kot with a target of 100 vaccinations at each centre.

---||Mumbai||Rs 589 crore cheating case: FIR against 4 power co directors||Mumbai: The city’s economic offences wing (EOW) police have registered a case against four directors of a power generation firm and several others for transferring its compulsory convertible debentures (CCDs) with a face value of Rs 137 crore to another company illegally without the knowledge of key office bearers. The market value of the CCDs is Rs 586 crore. C Kalaiselvan (35), a director with SKS Power Generation Company Ltd (SPGCL), on behalf of his company, lodged an FIR at the MIDC police station recently. The SPGCL’s power generation plant is in Chhattisgarh while it’s headquarter is in Mumbai’s Andheri area. Four old directors of the firm have been named as accused in the FIR, which is now being probed by the EOW. “We have registered a case of cheating. The total cheating amount is around Rs 589 crore,” said Niket Kaushik, EOW chief. In 2018, SKS company was in debts and the matter went to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). Later, this company was taken over by a Singapore-based firm, Agritrade Resources Ltd. The new company allowed the old directors in SKS to continue on their post. “One of the accused directors of SKS, transferred 13 lakh and 700 CCDs into his own company, Berrio Global (in Mauritius). The new owners of SKS had given this director Rs 75 lakh for spending for SPGCL’s official work. A year later, he showed the entries in his books of accounts as repayment of loan,” said an officer. In the meantime, the CCDs were transferred from SPGCL to Berrio Global and the accused showed that Rs 75 lakh was spent on purchase of these CCDs. “It’s alleged that the accused fabricated the minutes of the meeting to show that the complainant company’s then CEO was present through video conferencing in the board meeting which was held to get approval from key office bearers,” said inspector Rajesh Kewle. It’s alleged that the accused directors and others had also transferred 57,000 equity shares (market value Rs 3 crore) of SGPCL to Berrio Global. No arrest has been made yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rs-589-crore-cheating-case-fir-against-4-power-co-directors-in-mumbai/articleshow/82396047.cms||Mateen Hafeez

---||Nagpur||Govt aims to set up 300 PSA oxygen plants across the state||Nagpur: The Maharashtra government is mulling setting up around 300 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants across the state to make general and rural hospitals, and other health facilities self-reliant. The decision was taken to achieve a targeted production of 350 tonnes of oxygen for the health infrastructure. In the backdrop of rising Covid surge in the second wave and stress on health infrastructure, especially with spiralling oxygen demand, Maharashtra government is planning to become self-sufficient in oxygen production to a large extent by increasing it’s existing capacity. During the ongoing pandemic, Maharashtra had to depend on sourcing oxygen from Bhilai, Raipur, Rourkela and other places to supply it at Covid hospitals. In yet another development, state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte is also learnt to have written to the cabinet secretary requesting additional 200 MT of oxygen and also 10 cryogenic tankers for transportation. Even tankers and cylinders are in short-supply in the state. According to sources, the state government has assigned the commissioner of skill development, employment and entrepreneurship to play the role of coordinator among various agencies, government departments and units across the states. The districts have already sent their proposals to the commissionerate, which would now place them before the government for scrutiny and review. “At least 10 places in every district on an average would have PSA oxygen plants now,” said an official. The district collectors are expected to arrange for funds to set up PSA plants at government hospitals and health facilities through District Planning and Development Council (DPDC), State Disaster Relief Fund, Corporate Social Responsibility and also from the special budgetary allocations of the government of India. Nagpur district administration is aiming to set up PSA plants at a numbers of places like Government Medical College and Hospital, Mayo Hospital, AIIMS and also other places. There is an effort to take help of Mahagenco to set up oxygen plants at Koradi and Khaparkheda thermal power plants too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govt-aims-to-set-up-300-psa-oxygen-plants-across-the-state/articleshow/82394150.cms||Soumitra Bose

Shrey Hospital Pvt Ltd, where eight Covid patients died in a fire on August 6, 2020, through its director Bharat Mahant asked the HC to remove the seal and allow it to function and serve Covid patient as case numbers soar. It requested the court to modify the earlier order passed on February 26, when a division bench directed the AMC “not to remove or open the seals applied at the premises of Shrey Hospital without the permission of this court and not to permit the management to once again start the functioning of the hospital without the permission of the court”. The petition said the hospital has 45 beds with an ICCU and can immediately add 10-15 beds. There is a 1,000-litre oxygen tank and all beds are connected with a central oxygen line. It can serve Covid patients well in this crisis when beds are not available. The hospital also claimed that it had treated 410 Covid patients and when there was recovery ratio was 82%-83% in the state, Shrey Hospital had a 92%-93% recovery ratio. It also has dedicated staff.

An investigation officer said the accused - V Surya, 19, of Chinnamathampalayam, R Sanjeevi, 21, of Rathinapuri and V Siva, 23, of Karamadai - were friends of ganja peddler Manikandan, of Rathinapuri, who was murdered by a Suresh, a resident of the same locality, and eight of his friends in February last year. “Suresh had married Manikandan’s ex-lover when he was in jail in connection with a ganja case. When Manikandan forced her to live with him, Suresh and friends attacked him on January 25 last year and he succumbed to his injuries a few days later. Suresh and friends were then arrested and lodged in jail,” the officer said. Since the murder accused were in jail, Manikandan’s friends decided to take revenge by plotting to kill Suresh’s close friend M Mathankumar, 24, of Jeeva Nagar at Saibaba Colony. “He was residing at Kottaipirivu with his family. On Sunday night, Siva and Surya invited him to consume liquor. When he went, the two, along with their friends Sanjeevi and Ashwin, attacked him with sickle.

---||Goa||Government plans 8 step-up hospitals to address mortality rate||PANAJI: The state government has decided to set up 8 step-up unit hospitals across the state to admit Covid patients with comorbidities and reduce the mortality rate. Chief minister Pramod Sawant issued directives to officials to initiate setting up of a step-up hospital at Dr Shama Prasad Mukherjee stadium, where patients who do not require oxygen can be treated. Two more step-up hospitals will be made operational by May 5, at Chicalim and Cansaulim. Sawant said that more such hospitals can be set up in each block at Pernem, Bicholim, Valpoi, Canacona and Curchorem. Sawant said that by Wednesday, step-up hospital will start. Sawant said that he has spoken to health minister Vishwajit Rane to allot doctors and nurses at the stadium facility. He said that the doctors of the concerned primary health centres (PHC), community health centres (CHC) and of the neighbouring PHC/CHC will come together to operate such hospitals. Sawant said that special orientation will be organised virtually by the consultant of GMC for medical officers and nursing staff of PHC/CHC on the checklist to monitor the patient and how to tackle comorbid condition in positive cases. He said the step-up hospital will not have oxygen, but if the oxygen level drops, then the patient would be shifted to hospitals. The chief minister had a meeting with Rane and reviewed the Covid-19 situation with medical superintendent, health officers of directorate of health services. The meeting was also attended by chief secretary Parimal Rai, secretary (health), Dean of GMC Shivanand Bandekar, director of health services, consultants of GMC and CMOs. After interacting with health officers, chief minister emphasised on home isolation measures so that the patient goes to the hospital timely. “Proper monitoring of home isolated will help in reducing their complications,” Sawant said. The collectors and deputy collectors will arrange logistics for setting up such step-up hospitals besides ambulance/balrath buses for transportation of patients. The collectors will be directed to issue directives to respective deputy collectors to take necessary action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-plans-8-step-up-hospitals-to-address-mortality-rate/articleshow/82395026.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal cases stuck below 18k for a week, experts suspect RAT effect||Kolkata: The surge in daily new Covid cases in Bengal has halted in the past six days. While the number remaining stagnant looks like a a good sign, health experts said it was too early to say if cases had plateaued and that the curve was flattening. But the restrictions in crowd gathering, they said, seemed to have had an impact in the number of daily case count. Also, experts said, chances of rapid-antigen tests (RAT) giving false negative was high. The massive surge began from April and by the second week, another 1,000 positive cases on a daily average started adding to the Covid load. The number of fresh cases swelled to 17,207 on April 28, with doctors fearing the number to reach 20,000 by May-end. But the number has not reached the 18,000-mark with only marginal rise, ranging between 300 and 200 in the past six days. There was a slight decline by 14 cases on Monday. Doctors also said the rising number of deaths should be a concern for the state. Currently, the state has been testing between 55,000 and 56,000 samples a day. But sources in the health department said around 35% of them were RAT, especially in areas, where RT-PCR test was not available. “There is a caveat to RAT, where all positive samples are positive but chances of this test giving false negatives is high. Another concern is the conventional RT-PCR test might fail to detect the mutants in some cases. That is why we need to have a lab auditing done regularly,” said physician Sukumar Mukherjee, who is also on the board of the state’s global advisory board to fight the pandemic. The state health department on Tuesday told all government labs to push their RT-PCR testing to the maximum. “We need to stress more on RT-PCR than rely on RAT so that we can scale down the chances of missing out positive cases,” said a source at Swasthya Bhawan. “The restriction in crowd gathering especially on election rallies/meetings and the partial lockdown in places could be a major reason for Covid cases to stop spiralling in the past few days. But it is too early to celebrate. We still need to keep the containment measures up in the strictest of the sense,” said paediatric intensivist Prabhas Prasun Giri, associate professor at Institute of Child Health. “There is a lull in the exponential rise in the past few days, which is a good sign. But we need to wait for the next two to three weeks to be sure whether we have reached a plateau, peak or decline in the surge. Response of the people to Covid-appropriate behaviour will absolutely play a major role in breaking the chain,” said Mukherjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-cases-stuck-below-18k-for-a-week-experts-suspect-rat-effect/articleshow/82394158.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Nagpur||Despite 70-day curbs, Vidarbha positivity rate high||Nagpur: Lockdown-like restrictions have yielded good results in Mumbai and Pune, but Vidarbha is still to achieve the desired control on Covid-19 infection despite near 70 days of restrictions in many districts in the region. Amravati had been the first district of Maharashtra to introduce restrictions on February 22, followed by Buldhana and Akola and then Nagpur. In short, Vidarbha was under restrictions for more than a month longer than other parts of the state. Despite this, the region is still to witness drop in number of new cases, the way Pune, Mumbai and even Nashik have witnessed so far. As on May 4, Maharashtra government’s state-wide restrictions have resulted in decline in cases, sample positivity rate, death rate — especially in Pune and Mumbai. But, Vidarbha is still reporting similar number of new cases, while deaths have increased. According to doctors, this is an outcome of rural spread of Covid-19. The Nagpur branch of Indian Medical Association has already started sensitizing its members about rural spread. TOI spoke to some of the doctors working in tribal and rural Vidarbha to know about the ground conditions. Dr Ashish Satav, who has been working in Melghat for years, said malnutrition increases the risk of Covid-19 in the region. “We are trying to provide nutritious food to all category age groups. Number of patients is increasing, but many of them with mild to moderate infection are recovering too,” he said. Dr Yogeshwar Kalkonde from Gadchiroli claimed fatality in rural area will be low. “Rural population is exposed to various infections since childhood. So, death rate is supposed to be low. But, cases will still be more in terms of numbers. Nowadays, all have smart phones through which we are guiding people in rural areas,” he said. Vaccination has also an important role in this. “More people have been vaccinated in Pune and Mumbai as compared to Amravati and Nagpur. Due to this, three weeks of lockdown was enough to bring positivity rate under control there. Whereas, a fresh surge has started in Amravati and Akola,” said Dr Anurag Bahekar from Gondia. On May 4, state government has specifically included Nagpur, Amravati, Chandrapur and Gondia districts into the list of 15 districts in the state where daily number of cases is going down. However, sample positivity rate of these districts is still high. In Amravati, positivity rate was under 9% in March. It has risen above 18% on May 3. In Nagpur, the sample positivity has seen constant increase and reached 22% mark now. Doctors have called for speedy and 100% vaccination in Vidarbha, especially in rural areas as restrictions are not enough to reduce the positivity rate. “In next 10 days, many urban areas of Maharashtra, including Nagpur, will report decline in cases which may bring some relaxations in the restrictions. This is going to be an important phase for Vidarbha as we are still reporting cases at higher rate,” said a senior member of Nagpur’s Covid Task Force. He added that the task force has been insisting on a major push to vaccination in rural Vidarbha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-70-day-curbs-vidarbha-positivity-rate-high/articleshow/82395016.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

BJP MLA from Kandivli Atul Bhatkarlkar wrote a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray stating, “States such as Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh have amended their laws and granted 50% concessions in fees. The state government must amend the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fees) Act, 2011, and ensure a 50% reduction in fees,” said Bhatkalkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-demands-50-cut-in-pvt-school-fees/articleshow/82401186.cms||---
---||Delhi||What good is the infra if not used in pandemic?: Delhi HC on mohalla clinics||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Tuesday suggested utilising mohalla clinics, which were set up by the Delhi government, during the raging crisis. “If you have created this infrastructure, what is the real worth of it? What good is it if it can’t be used in this pandemic?” justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli remarked. The bench stated that a mohalla clinic could be shifted to a nearby government school in these times with required medical staff and doctors as all schools were shut because of the pandemic. Delhi government’s senior advocate Rahul Mehra said he would respond with the relevant information on this aspect on Wednesday. “How can your mohalla clinics be of use?” inquired the bench. Mehra responded submitting that most mohalla clinics had single point of entry and exit besides the fact that due to the lack of space inside, social distancing norms couldn’t be ensured there. “Probability of infection is high. There is no waiting area and there is one doctor and a nurse. It is primarily looking into 257 other tests.” Additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma pointed out that the pandemic had been raging for a year now and a mohalla clinic could be the perfect place for dissemination of Covid-related information. “They are the foundation of the triage. A valuable resource,” said Sharma. Mehra, however, pointed out that for Covid, mohalla clinics wouldn’t be of use at all. “It is like a 20-feet container. There are two small rooms. One or two people from the mohalla or the locality come. That’s the very nature. It is meant for that particular community of 1,000 people in the locality,” he said. Mehra also stated that in case mohalla clinics are used for dissemination and if they become super-spreaders, then the Centre should take responsibility. “We don’t want numbers to go up.” He highlighted that mohalla clinics were meant for the smallest of communities in a particular area. The bench, however, underscored, “Covid is not an affluent society problem. It can happen to people who go there.” Meanwhile, Delhi government’s advocate Satyakam said, “There were 212 different kinds of blood tests happening in the mohalla clinics. And Covid tests were happening in some slightly bigger mohalla clinics. We have restricted them because of fear of spread.” “You could shift your mohalla clinics to the other location. Government schools are closed. Secondly, it is not a waste of resources. You have 450 doctors. We need doctors,” the bench said. Mehra informed the bench that the doctors at these mohalla clinics offered more of a community service. “These are doctors who are doing it over and above. These doctors are not sitting at home,” the counsel added. The court also noted that there was a major dearth of information on Covid-19. It asked Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to step in. “People are not even aware of the symptoms and what they are expected to do when there are symptoms. There is a complete lack of information. People have oxygen concentrators but don’t know how to use it, how to keep it. People are using them in AC rooms. What kind of concentrators one should go for. How to use an oxygen cylinder. ICMR should step in. You should circulate audio clips, video clips, graphics,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-on-mohalla-clinics-what-good-is-the-infra-if-not-used-in-pandemic/articleshow/82395023.cms||Aamir Khan

The slain foreign terrorist — identified as Hamas alias Asrar alias Saria — was involved in the killing of two councillors and a policeman in Sopore on March 29 this year, a top police officer said. Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Kashmir range, Vijay Kumar said that on a specific input provided by Kupwara police regarding the presence of terrorists at Nathipora, the joint cordon and search operation was launched. When the search team closed in on the suspected spot, the hiding Lashkar terrorists fired upon security forces, triggering the encounter, during which the former were given an opportunity to surrender but they didn’t. Finally the two were killed and security forces recovered arms and ammunition, including an AK-47 rifle and an Insas rifle, from the site of the encounter. Further search is in progress. Police said, based on the similarity with a photograph, the slain local terrorist could be Wasim Ahmed Lone of Hatlangoo in Sopore. His family is being called to identify the body. Meanwhile, as a precautionary measure to maintain law and order in Sopore police district, the authorities have suspended internet services in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-lashkar-terrorists-killed-in-sopore-encounter/articleshow/82397144.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Nagpur||Only 14 IMA docs respond to HC call to serve Covid-19 patients, with conditions||Nagpur: Only 14 doctors out of Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) 3,000 members have come forward to offer their services for Covid-19 patients at AIIMS, after the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court invited them to help out in the pandemic. “The IMA members must also consider the clarion call for their services by AIIMS. We would request all its members to volunteer services as specialists there,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said in the last hearing while asking IMA to submit a list of doctors. The IMA, however, defended the low numbers, saying that many of its members are already overburdened and around of them 1,000 are senior citizens. “This is the reason only 14 doctors have shown their willingness to offer their services,” IMA city president Dr Sanjay Deotale, who was present in the HC auditorium, informed the bench. After his statement, the judges also noted that IMA’s stand indicates that there are certain conditions put by these 14 doctors. “We don’t think that with these conditions the offer of these doctors could be accepted by any of the Covid hospitals. At this emergency hour, what is required is commitment and dedication. However, the IMA is at liberty to approach the concerned Covid hospitals, including AIIMS, and submit the offer to them for their dedicated and committed services, if they wish to do so,” the judges said, before adjourning the hearing till 12 noon on Wednesday. In the last hearing, the HC had asked the collector and NMC commissioner to consider sending some doctors from Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on deputation or fresh medical graduates to AIIMS. They were further told to make a request to Air Force Maintenance Command to send doctors and nursing staff from their hospital for Covid duties. Buy Heparin for GMCH from DPDC, mining funds: HC GMCH dean Dr Sudhir Gupta informed HC that it wasn’t getting even a single dose of low molecular weight Heparin injection, which is very useful in treating Covid-19 patients. He informed that though GMCH had placed an order to supply 6,500 injections with Pfizer company, it had received nothing till date. “We direct the dean to place his requirement regarding all these drugs with the collector. On receipt of his application, the latter would endeavour to make available all these drugs by utilizing the District Planning and Development Council (DPDC) and the District Mining Funds,” the judges said. They also asked FDA joint commissioner Vijay Kose to assist Dr Gupta in this regard. “If any generic drug is available, the joint commissioner shall supply the necessary details of the same to the dean,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-14-ima-docs-respond-to-hc-call-to-serve-covid-19-patients-with-conditions/articleshow/82394159.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Kolkata||KMC to arrange for Cov death certs, send ambulance to ferry patients||Kolkata: KCM on Tuesday told borough and ward coordinators to ensure a hassle-free cremation of Covid victims, particularly those dying at home. The KMC health department will also send ambulances with oxygen cylinders to homes of Covid-positive patients requiring immediate hospitalization due to drop in oxygen saturation as well as for transfer of patients from one facility to another. These were some of the key decisions taken at a meeting chaired by Firhad Hakim immediately after the board of administrators (BoA) was revived on Tuesday following a state municipal affairs department notification. On Election Commission instructions, the BoA was dissolved in April ahead of the state assembly polls. Now that the election process is over, Hakim and other board members resumed their charge on Tuesday. The municipal affairs department notification also empowered ward coordinators to start normal functioning as civic representatives. “Following instructions from the BoA chairman, ward coordinators will now help the cremation of Covid patients dying at home. In case the family doesn’t have the confirmatory Covid report, we will take the body to Peace World for preservation. On receipt of a Covid-positive report, we will take the body to a designated crematorium. If the report is negative, the body will be handed to the family,” a KMC health department official said. Hakim asked ward coordinators to take the responsibility of arranging for a death certificate in case a Covid victim died at home and help the family get a hearse. This apart, ward coordinators across 144 wards will now step in to help families who lose their members at home before getting a confirmation on whether the person had contracted the novel coronavirus or not. KMC health department sources conceded that there had been prolonged delay in clearing papers after Covid deaths as a result of which, civic body personnel, on many occasions, could arrange for cremation after decomposition had begun. This burning problem was discussed at the meeting, ward coordinators cited recent examples of an 80-year-old Covid victim in Sakherbazar and a 39-year-old woman from Fern Road, who had succumbed to Covid at home but the bodies could be cremated hours later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-to-arrange-for-cov-death-certs-send-ambulance-to-ferry-patients/articleshow/82394170.cms||Saikat Ray

He reportedly resorted to the extreme step due to financial problems. The deceased was identified as B Abhilash Naik, 33, a constable with Madannapet police station. Abhilash along with his family was staying at Baladanamma Basthi in Malakpet. In 2011, Abhilash had married Indra Jyothi and they have two sons. In 2014, Abhilash secured a constable job and he was working at Madannapet police station in Hyderabad. Two days ago, Abhilash dropped his wife and their two sons at his in-law’s house in Kodad and returned home. On May 3 morning, Abhilash went to work and returned home at 3 pm. “After reaching home, Abhilash had lunch and went to the first floor room to sleep. At 10 pm, his brother Prabhu Naik returned home and their mother told Prabhu to call Abhilash for dinner,” Malakpet sub-inspector (SI) Subhash said. As Abhilash did not open the door for a long time, Prabhu along with a neighbour, Ashok, broke the latch and found him lying dead in a pool of blood. “Abhilash slit his throat with a blade. During the preliminary probe, we found that he had borrowed money from several people. We suspect that financial problems could be the reason for his suicide. There was no suicide note,” the SI said. A case was registered under Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/malakpet-constable-ends-life-due-to-financial-woes/articleshow/82395019.cms||---

Police have secured all the accused. The Sulur police identified the deceased as M Vasanth, 30, of Kakkan Nagar at Singanallur, and his friend Mahesh, 35, of Pallapalayam near Sulur. A police officer said Mahesh had on Monday night entered into an altercation with his neighbour Saravanan, a ganja peddler who had come out on bail a few days ago, as he suspected the latter of pelting his house with stones. “However, their relatives intervened and pacified them.” On Tuesday morning, the officer said, a gang led by Saravanan waylaid Vasanth, who was travelling on a motorcycle with his friends Mahesh and Prem, at Pallapalayam. “The gang attacked Vasanth and Mahesh, who retaliated. They hit Vasanth on his head with floor tiles and stabbed him. They also attacked Mahesh with knives and fled after damaging the motorcycle. Prem managed to escape without any injury.” While Vasanth died on the spot following severe blood loss, Prem, with the help of passers-by, took Mahesh to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), where he succumbed to his severe injuries. Preliminary inquiry revealed Saravanan had attacked and murdered the two with the help of his brother Sathish and friends Hari, Dinesh and Srinath. “Saravanan had sustained minor injuries when the two put up a fight to save their lives. He is admitted to the CMCH,” the officer said. The Sulur police have registered a murder case against the five, who are likely to be produced before a judicial magistrate on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/five-member-gang-stabs-two-to-death-lands-in-police-net/articleshow/82394160.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The doctors met health minister Vishwajit Rane at the secretariat and asked that more doctors be brought onboard. The chief minister Pramod and Rane later visited GMC to check oxygen requirements, accompanied by the doctors. “Authorities directed that more oxygen be supplied,” said association president Dr Pratik Sawant. The association in a letter stated that the doctors had conveyed their issues regarding the need for more health workers, shortage of oxygen supply and other logistic issues. “The second wave of the Covid pandemic has seen a high surge of cases. The burden of morbidity and mortality has been beyond the control of facilities available at hand. The demand and supply of health services and facilities has taken a hit, depleting all available resources,” the association stated on Tuesday. “We appeal to the government to look into the issue of shortage of oxygen supply and take necessary action on an urgent basis. We appeal to the public to take preventive measures, opt for personal lockdown, vaccinate yourselves and have faith in the health system,” the association further stated. The association added that the administration has been very supportive.

---||Pune||More than twice as many men than women died in state’s 2 Covid waves||Pune: A state-wide mortality comparison by the public health department between the first and second Covid waves in Maharashtra has revealed that twice the number of men as compared to women lost their lives to the contagion.Of the total mortalities till January 2021 in the state, 30% were women and 70% men. During the current upsurge in Covid cases, which began around the start of February this year, the analysis showed that 28% of the mortalities were women till March 15 and 72% were men.A senior state health department official told TOI, “The analysis was done to know whether age group patterns or gender differences have changed during the current upsurge in comparison to trends last year. There aren’t significant changes in these parameters between the two periods.”Data showed that of the roughly 50,666 Covid mortalities from March 2020 till January 2021 in Maharashtra, 35,491 were men and 15,172 were women. Three of the dead persons were transgenders. From February 1, 2021 till March 15, 2021, another 2,243 Covid fatalities were recorded in Maharashtra, of which 627 were women and 1,616 men.Apart from the presence of higher number of comorbidities and greater propensity to step out for work or social life in case of men, disease specialists said biological factors seemed to be at play.Piyush Chaudhari, infectious diseases specialist at Jehangir hospital, Pune, told TOI, “Relatively milder disease in women compared to men can be explained by higher interferons and Interleukin 10 production in females, among other such biological factors. A virus-infected cell releases ‘interferons’ causing nearby cells to heighten their anti-viral defences, while Interleukin-10 is an essential immunosuppressive cytokine, with the ability to resolve inflammation and promote wound repair.”He said estrogen, a female hormone, could also be at play, as it could lower the activity of harmful pathways (as well as increase the activity of useful pathways) associated with inflammation, vascular permeability and lung oedema.International studies over the past year have pointed out this trend. A meta-analysis of 31,11,714 reported global cases by the Centre for Rheumatology Research, UCL, London, in December 2020 had revealed that while there was no difference in the proportion of men and women with confirmed Covid-19, male patients had almost three times the odds of requiring intensive treatment unit and higher odds of death compared to female patients.Another US study from Houston, based on data from electronic medical records, published earlier this year stated that among the hospitalized patients, men were more likely to have complications, require ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, and had higher mortality than females, independent of age.A report compiled by the PMC health department has revealed similar data.Health experts also said more exposure to the virus due to work-life as well as more men being smokers than women could be responsible for the higher number of fatalities among them. Of the total Covid-19 deaths in the PMC limits, 67% were men and 33% women. Besides, comorbidities also played a major role in causing more deaths among men.“Men venture out more as compared to women. They have to travel for work and other duties. So the number of deaths among men is higher,” said Sanjeev Wavare, a senior official of the PMC health department.As per the death audit carried out by the civic administration, of the total 5,526 deaths in the municipal areas, as many as 3,713 were men and 1,812 were women. One transgender also died due to Covid-19 infection.As per the PMC data, around 4 lakh citizens in the civic limits have tested positive. Of these, 57% are men and 43% women.Health activist and medical practitioner Abhijit More said socializing during the pandemic was also a possible cause behind the high number of deaths among male patients. “It was observed that many men continued socializing even during the pandemic. They were more active in such activities and public gatherings during the peak Covid time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-than-twice-as-many-men-than-women-died-in-states-2-covid-waves/articleshow/82394167.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Nagpur||Beware of adoption messages on social media, it’s illegal: Experts||Nagpur: Social media has been flooded with messages about children orphaned due to Covid-19 and how people can adopt them by simply reaching out to a number mentioned in the message. Legal experts warn that indulging in any such activity is nothing short of ‘child trafficking’ because adoption involves a very comprehensive legal process. In India, adoption process is solely under the purview of Centralized Adoption Resource Agency (CARA), which is a statutory body under the Union ministry of women and child development. This agency then has a State Adoption Resource Agency (SARA) to coordinate at the local level. So, regardless of a prospective parent approaching an NGO or an orphanage, all applications will ultimately be routed to CARA. Well-known lawyer Shyam Dewani said if your adoption process is not registered with CARA, then it’s illegal. “The law is very clear and there are two things you must not do. First, don’t forward such messages to anyone regardless of who sent it. Second, don’t ever call on that number because out of the goodness of your heart, you wish to adopt that child,” he said. “If you do any of these things, then knowingly or unknowingly you become part of a larger criminal conspiracy. And people must use some common sense too that you just can’t call up a number and take home a baby. We are talking about a human being here, not some product on online site,” said Dewani. These fake or illegal social media messages can get extremely creative to pull at people’s heart strings. Emotional messages about a child being found wandering after both parents died due to Covid-19 and how he needs a new home, are being circulated. Social activist Shahid Sharif said even if such a child is found, s/he cannot be ‘passed’ on to anybody who is ready to take responsibility. “I have worked closely with the Child Welfare Committee and the protocol is that upon finding such a child, the local police have to be informed. After the paperwork at police station, custody of the child is given to CWC officials who then arrange for accommodation in an authorized place,” said Sharif. TOI spoke to a couple who had adopted a child a few years ago and they were shocked on how easily people fall for fake WhatsApp messages. “It’s probably to do with lack of awareness. In fact in India, the process is lengthy and stringent, but it’s for the benefit of all,” said the parents. “The waiting list itself is for six to seven months for your application to be considered. After acceptance, it could be few more months before you get to see a baby. Maybe these messages are aimed at people who want to bypass this system and bring home a baby within days or weeks. But then every night you will sleep with the fear that the authorities can land at your door and take away the child,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/beware-of-adoption-messages-on-social-media-its-illegal-experts/articleshow/82394166.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The petition was filed by Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Amit Chavda and Leader of the Opposition (LOP) in the assembly, Paresh Dhanani. Their counsel Anand Yagnik submitted that after assessing the situation on Covid-19, the MLAs have come to the conclusion that they should be allowed to spend their Rs 1.5 crore for 2021-22 on creating facilities for Covid-19 treatment. They sought HC directions on the grounds that they are not allowed to spend more than Rs 25 lakh on creating health infrastructure, whereas there is a dire need to immediately create infrastructure for Covid treatment. An ambulance costs Rs 20 lakh, setting up an oxygen plant will take about Rs 30 lakh, buying oxygen concentrators will take Rs 35,000 to Rs 75,000 and RTPCR testing machines cost nearly Rs 25 lakh.

---||Coimbatore||Dist logs 1,509 fresh cases; four deaths take toll to 733||Coimbatore: The district, which is reeling under severe drug shortage, recorded 1,509 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, when the tally jumped to 84,206 from 82,689 on Monday. With this, the number of active cases has touched a new high of 8,596. With 1,105 patients getting discharged from various treatment centres, the number of recovered patients has increased to 74,877 on the day. Presently, the recovery rate stands at 88.9%. The Covid-19 toll, meanwhile, rose by four to 733. This is the highest number of deaths to be reported in a single day in the second wave. Three of the victims - a 47-year-old man, a 55-year-old woman and a 62-year-old man – died of bilateral bronchopneumonia in the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital in three subsequent days starting Thursday last week. They didn’t have any comorbidities. The fourth victim was a 79-year-old hypertensive, diabetic woman who died on Thursday. Her sample tested positive for the virus only on Sunday. Presently, there are only 527 beds vacant in government hospitals and another 962 in the private sector. While 239 beds with oxygen facilities and 16 with ventilators are available in the government sector, 437 oxygen beds and 55 ventilator beds are available in the private sector. The drug shortage has, meanwhile, hit many people in the district. A youngster, Vendhan, had appealed on social media for a link to procure two doses of Tocilizumab shots for his 62-year-old father, who was on high flow oxygen support. KG Hospital, where he is admitted, is also trying for the drug. Tocilizumab, the immunosuppressive drug that could prevent a severely sick Covid-19 patient from going into ventilator, has been unavailable for more than a month, doctors said. Dr Varun Sundaramoorthy, infectious diseases specialist, Kovai Medical Centre and Hospital, said, “Tocilizumab suppresses the immune system, preventing lungs from inflaming further. We give it to patients when steroids fail to yield any results.” He said six out the seven patients, on whom he administered the drug so far, have recovered. Dr A Murali, Covid-19 nodal officer at PSG Hospitals, said Itolizumab injections, a replacement for Tocilizumab, was also in short supply. “We have been managing by giving patients a higher dose of steroids.” Shortage of antiviral drug Remdesivir also continues to haunt both the hospitals and patients. While the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation has provided a special counter and helpline to procure the medicine, the shortage is stark. “Remdesivir supply meets hardly 20% of our requirements, forcing us to prioritize and give it to younger patients in the early stages of infection,” Dr Murali said. KMCH, however, said it has adequate doses of Remdesivir. The hospital administers it only on patients who have severe infection or whose condition could get serious. Doctors said they didn’t have data on how the drug shortage was affecting the death rate. A doctor with the CMCH said, “Death rate has not increased compared to earlier months. We are yet to analyse how the absence of drugs is affecting the morbidity and duration of hospital stay.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dist-logs-1509-fresh-cases-four-deaths-take-toll-to-733/articleshow/82394169.cms||---

They plan to raise a few objections and suggestions that may include the omission of the Kanjurmarg dumping ground from the flamingo sanctuary, and the mangroves along the Eastern Express Highway. “We are also questioning why organic waste is likely to be allowed to be handled inside the sanctuary area, and what steps are to be taken to stop waste water of industries, bio-medical units from coming to the sanctuary,” said D Stalin of the Vanashakti NGO. Environmentalist Debi Goenka of Conservation Action Trust added, “We are raising a strong objection about the non-uniform no-development zone. Previously, no construction could occur within 10 km distance of the sanctuary. Now, the boundaries of this eco-sensitive zone varies from 0km to 3.89 km.” Spread over 1,690 hectares area, the TCFS was declared a sanctuary in May 2018. B N Kumar of NatConnect Foundation, welcomed the proposal for buffer zone in the eco-sensitive zone of the sanctuary but also opposed the commercial project undertaken by the NMMC near the Thane creek. Activist Nandakumar Pawar of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishthan hoped that “the buffer zone idea will be implemented in letter and spirit to end anti-environmental activities like quarrying of the Parsik Hills”.  TCFS is home to 12 true mangrove species, 39 mangrove associates, 167 species of birds including flamingos, apart several species of fish, butterflies, insect and other mammals. The greens are upbeat about the scope for eco tourism at the sanctuary, akin to the Marine Biodiversity Centre at the Airoli end which has become a popular haunt for bird watchers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaithane-sanctuary-draft-needs-more-inputs/articleshow/82396101.cms||Vijay Singh

The state government, which had promised free vaccination for the 18-44 years age group, has given orders for only Covidshield from the Serum Institute of India (SII) and have not yet placed an order with Bharat Biotech for Covaxin for this category. Officials stated that Covaxin would cost them Rs 100 extra per vaccine and the government would have to increase their budget for the required seven crore doses. Rajasthan has ordered 3.75 vials initially from SII and have received nearly five lakh doses so far. But, they have not yet contacted Bharat Biotech for Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-keeps-costlycovaxin-away-from-state-campaign-tovax-18-category/articleshow/82395038.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Get Covid test report in 30 mins at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International airport||AHMEDABAD: Travel regulations mandating a Covid negative RT-PCR report on arrival in various states including Gujarat is often a hindrance for passengers travelling in emergencies. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport has now set up an RT-LAMP testing facility outside its international terminal, by which passengers can get tested for Covid and get their reports in 30 minutes. A Twitter post by the Ahmedabad airport said, “SVPI Airport has the additional RT-LAMP facility along with RT-PCR outside the terminal building. RT-LAMP allows quicker detection of COVID-19 virus. It is approved and recommended by the ICMR and the state government.” “This technology, AbbotID, is based on isothermal amplification and has been approved by ICMR as an RT-PCR equivalent for rapid Covid-19 testing. Although the results are rapid, scalability is limited and is currently used only at sites such as airports where the required turnaround time is less than one hour. The machine can do only one test at a time. This test also costs significantly more than RT-PCR tests,” said Dr Bhavini Shah, chief microbiologist, Neuberg Supratech. This facility has been set up with a private diagnostics company, Neuberg Supratech, which was among the first designated pathology laboratories for Covid tests. Sources said similar facilities exist at Kochi, Bengaluru, Delhi and Mumbai airports. According to the prices fixed by the Gujarat government, an RT-LAMP test will cost Rs 4,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/get-covid-test-report-in-30-mins-at-svpi/articleshow/82394176.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Nagpur||Experts suggest insulin use to tackle ‘mini pandemic’ of mucor in Covid patients||Nagpur: Medical experts are recommending use of insulin to control blood sugar in Covid patients on steroids, as the city is witnessing many recovered patients subsequently falling prey to fungal disease mucormycosis. Instead of prophylactic, highly expensive anti-fungal drugs, senior medical practitioners are in favour of administering insulin to even non-diabetic Covid patients to guard against future complications. City’s renowned ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon Dr Nandu Kolwadkar, who has performed 22 surgeries on mucormycosis patients in three weeks, called the disease trend a ‘mini pandemic’ of sorts. Calling it a fallout of steroid use, Kolwadkar also underlined the need to control sugar while treating Covid. Dr Nikhil Balankhe, intensivist of Viveka Hospital, said cheap insulin dose costing within Rs15-20 to prevent uncontrolled surge in blood sugar is more sensible than administering 10 antifungal Posaconazole injections worth around Rs6,000. “Steroids drugs have a track record of success against Covid-19, but it has inherent quality of pushing up blood sugar. This is leading to vulnerability to fungal infections and diseases like mucormycosis,” said Balankhe. “There is a prominent link between steroids, diabetics and fungal infections. Apart from judicious use of steroids, it’s crucial to ensure insulin is administered in the patients once the blood sugar goes past 200-220 even if patient is non-diabetic. Also, a check on serum albumin is a must, as its levels fall,” he said. He advocated good nutrition along with high protein diets to increase resistance. Dr Jay Deshmukh of Sunflower Hospital said use of anti-fungal drugs like Voriconazole and Posaconazole may lead to resistance developing. “One of the key measures to fight fungal infection is to use double masks and check blood glucose diligently by administering insulin to diabetic patients,” he said. Dr Deshmukh also advocated the stringent protocol of limiting dose and duration of steroids in patients. “The anti-fungal drugs like Posaconazole are higher antibiotics, which are often prescribed in patients post organ transplant and chemotherapy,” he said. Another concern now among medical experts is that the highly expensive Isavuconazole capsules, costing around Rs21,000 for a strip of seven capsules, is in high demand, and often in short-supply due to rampant use. Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease specialist, said there is a trend of fungal infections in Covid patients. “There is a strange but unclear connection between Covid patients and mucormycosis. We are witnessing cases of mucormycosis even in non-diabetic patients. There have been cases of mucormycosis even in home isolated patients and also those who were not on steroids too, which is a concern and intriguing fact,” he said. Dr Shinde suggested that strict sugar assessment during hospitalization and also during the course of treatment is required. “Sugar, if detected, has to be controlled with insulin. Hospitalization period has to be curtailed and CT scan for fungal infection is also required for early detection of any anomaly,” said Shinde. He also pointed out that the air quality is not maintained in many hospitals in India, which plays a crucial role in such fungal disease spreading through air-borne spores.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/experts-suggest-insulin-use-to-tackle-mini-pandemic-of-mucor-in-covid-patients/articleshow/82395057.cms||Soumitra Bose

On Monday, Amit Goswami (18) fell off the terrace of a two-storeyed bungalow in Piplod and died. Amit, who lived in Milan Society behind Rahul Raj Mall, was playing a game on his mobile phone while lying on the terrace wall when he fell down, said the police. Cops uspect that while playing, Goswami must have dozed off and accidentally fell on the ground floor. Amit’s father Santosh Goswami works as a driver and they live in a room on the terrace of the employer’s bungalow, cops said. According to police, at about 4.30 am when Santosh woke up to have water, he did not find Amit in the room. He went to the terrace as the boy often used to go there at odd hours to play games. Santosh, however, saw Amit’s mobile phone near the terrace wall but could not find the boy. When he checked, Amit was lying on the ground floor but was conscious. The boy was rushed to New Civil Hospital where the doctor declared him dead before admission. “The boy succumbed on the way to the hospital. The parents told us that he often used to go to the terrace to use his mobile phone. His mother had also rebuked him a couple of times for his addiction of playing game on mobile phone,” said a police official. He added that in the past too Amit had dozed off on the terrace while playing game on the phone.

The transfer order was issued last month.“There was a lot of confusion between regular intelligence section staff and station intelligence section staff. There should be only one intelligence section (IS) functioning under the city police commissioner. Hence, we are discussing dissolving the station IS staff system soon,” Davidson Devasirvatham said.According to police sources, the city police commissioner held a meeting with deputy commissioner of police (law & order) G Stalin and assistant commissioner of police (IS) Ramesh Krishnan a few days ago on dissolving the station IS staff system.“The station IS system should be dissolved immediately as its members are facing a lot of corruption charges,” a police officer said.The city police have an intelligence section (IS) directly controlled by the city police commissioner. The role of the IS is to gather vital intelligence information across the city. They would convey the information to the police inspectors who in turn would pass it on to the assistant commissioner of police (IS) and city police commissioner.The city police have 15 intelligence section (IS) officers for 15 police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/graft-intelligence-section-staff-of-seven-police-stations-transferred/articleshow/82394175.cms||A Subburaj
---||Mumbai||Can’t adjust entire refund against outstandings, rules HC in relief for taxpayers||Mumbai: The Bombay high court recently held that income tax (I-T) officers cannot adjust the refunds due to taxpayers against outstanding demands in excess of the limits laid down in instructions, circulars and guidelines issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). This order comes as a relief, especially for India Inc and high net worth individuals where the amounts at stake are significant. If refunds that are due are fully adjusted against any tax demand, even if the amount demanded has been appealed against, it adversely impacts taxpayers. According to Sanjay Tolia, partner at Price Waterhouse & Co, “This is a welcome judgment, especially during the pandemic when taxpayers need funds to meet their day-to-day administrative and operative expenses. This judgment will strengthen the requests of taxpayers to I-T officers to refrain from adjusting the entire amount of the refund against outstanding demands and restrict the adjustment to the limit specified in the instructions issued by the CBDT.” In this case, the I-T returns for the financial year 2012-13 filed by Vrinda Sharad Bal, a proprietor of a land development firm, was selected for scrutiny. Consequent to this, a tax demand notice of Rs 6.1 crore was raised. The I-T officer adjusted the refunds due for three subsequent financial years. However, the refunds adjusted were more than 20% of the tax demand that had been raised—the limit prescribed under latest CBDT instructions. The taxpayer filed an appeal against this demand and sought a stay. While a stay on recovery of the balance demand was granted, the I-T officer reserved the right to adjust other refunds arising to the taxpayer against the balance amount of dues. This pattern continued and refunds for two subsequent financial years (FY18 and FY19) were also adjusted against the outstanding tax dues. This led to Bal filing a writ petition with the Bombay HC. In the petition, Bal highlighted the financial difficulties that businesses were facing due to the pandemic and lockdowns. It was also pointed out that CBDT’s office memorandum dated February 29, 2016, which deals with stay on demand, provides that the I-T officer can adjust refunds only to the extent of 20% of the tax demanded. The writ petition sought a refund of the excess amount that had been adjusted. The HC held that the CBDT’s instructions issued from time to time need to be applied. It ruled that any amount adjusted from the refunds over and above the limits prescribed was to be returned to the taxpayer with applicable interest. Refunds arising in future would not be adjusted until the disposal of the appeal filed by the taxpayer for the financial year 2012-13, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cant-adjust-entire-refund-against-outstandings-rules-hc-in-relief-for-taxpayers/articleshow/82396149.cms||---

However, the police have declared three other accused to be absconding.According to Gondal police, body of Ajaysinh Jadeja, a resident of Sainik Society in Gondal town, was found tied to a stone and dumped in a well on the outskirts of Gondal town of Rajkot district on April 28. Deceased had gone missing on April 25 from his home.Ajaysinh’s sister Hina Jadeja had lodged a complaint with Gondal police and named Sachin Dhaduk as one of the suspects. Based on the complaint, police launched a probe and questioned one of Dhaduk’s close aides.“While probing this case, we got a lead that five youths were arrested for pelting stones on a public transport bus in January this year. The accused suspected that Ajaysinh had given cops a tip off about their involvement in the incident which led to their arrest and so, decided to avenge it. We called a minor boy for questioning and he spilled the beans and confessed of killing Jadeja. Three other accused — Sachin Dhaduk, Vivek Barad and Jayveersinh Jadeja — are on the run,” police said.“On April 25, Sachin came to Ajaysinh's house and asked him out.

---||Kochi||Only critical patients will be admitted to ICUs: Kerala health department||KOCHI: With Covid intensive care unit (ICU) beds getting full in government and private hospitals, district health authorities have decided to admit only those patients whose oxygen saturation level drops persistently and who need high frequency nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy to ICU. They will also consider the patient’s overall health condition. It has also decided to discharge the patient from an oxygen bed in the hospital once his/her condition stabilizes instead of waiting for the patient to become negative. A sub-committee has been constituted to prepare a guideline on ICU admission in the district. “The decision was taken to ensure frequent monitoring of patients in the critical unit. HFNC is an alternative to ventilator. Those who need more than 10 litres of oxygen per minute need non-invasive ventilator support. Such patients need frequent monitoring in the ICU as their heart rate will increase. However, the need for ICU admissions is rising. We give priority for frequent down shifting – shifting a patient from ICU to ward where one needs only oxygen support through cylinders. If the current situation continues, we fear UP or Delhi-like situations here if no lockdown-like measures are enforced to contain the spread of the infection. Sadly, the containment measures are not proper,” said a member of the district programme management and supporting unit (DPMSU). “On Tuesday too, many people were on the streets despite the government imposing lockdown-like restrictions,” added the official. The district had witnessed 20 to 25 ICU admissions per day till the end of April. Later, the number of patients in the ICU has started coming down in the last three days. There were only 368 patients in the ICU on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the district disaster management authorities have started identifying industrial cylinders for converting it into medical purposes after sanitizing it. Around 1,200 to 1,500 industrial cylinders have been identified so far of which, 400 to 500 cylinders have been converted into medical ones after sanitization. These cylinders have been mobilized to small-scale hospitals in Ernakulam. If any hospital faces difficulty to procure oxygen through vendors, the nodal officer can alert the oxygen war room around six to eight hours before the hospital runs out of oxygen. Officials in charge of the war room contacts vendors and make arrangements to transport oxygen to the respective hospitals. Authorities have identified eight vendors for this purpose. “We have also identified seven oxygen filling plants in Kochi and we are filling it from there. There are oxygen tanks in major Covid treatment facilities in Ernakulam. The cylinders are used as a back-up in small hospitals only. We are continuing with the process of identifying more industrial cylinders,” said a district official. Current daily oxygen consumption (both Covid and non covid) in Ernakulam comes to around 15 tonnes. “Earlier, 200 to 250 oxygen cylinders of 5.5ft height were supplied daily to government hospitals. Now, around 300 to 350 cylinders are being supplied on a daily basis. Demand for small cylinders has also increased,” said another official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/only-critical-patients-will-be-admitted-to-icus-health-dept/articleshow/82393431.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Delhi||Centre looking into Mumbai's experience of using oxygen||NEW DELHI: Amid the tussle over Delhi government’s demand for 900 metric tonne oxygen, the Centre is looking into Mumbai’s experience, which was using around 240-245 MT when the financial capital had over 80,000 active cases. The national capital, which has an allocation of 590 MT, has been demanding higher quota from the Centre, arguing that it has over one lakh active cases at present with a large number of Covid patients admitted across hospitals requiring oxygen. Data sourced from the Centre from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) showed that between April 20 and May 1, after cases peaked, the city needed between 220 and 245 MT oxygen. During this period, the active cases ranged between 57,000 and 85,000. On an average, the Mumbai’s oxygen requirement is around 270-275 MT, including for Covid patients, although supply by the Maharashtra government is to the tune of 230 MT, according to information shared by BMC with the Centre. At the start of May, the city had over 30,000 beds with around 9,500 occupied in the oxygenated category and with 2,900 in the critical ICU segment and around 1,500 with ventilators. The Centre is looking at Mumbai’s oxygen supply management, along with the experience in other states. “But Maharashtra had very high active cases, which at one point of time had crossed 90,000 and the health infrastructure is similar. We are seeing how they had managed with much lower supply,” said a source, adding that detailed instructions had been issued by the administration to the medical personnel to ensure that there was little wastage, while ensuring that patients had 93-94% saturation. While Mumbai has easier access to liquid medical oxygen, the city administration had also prepared for a possible second wave by creating large storage facilities, which helped hospitals in the financial capital during the latest surge. Meanwhile, a Delhi government statement said, “The 900 MT calculation is based on Centre’s estimate of how much oxygen an O2 bed requires. Neither Centre nor court has raised any issue on our calculations..”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-looking-into-mumbai-experience-of-using-oxygen/articleshow/82395073.cms||---

Jitendra, who had toiled 10 years to fulfill his dream of becoming gram pradhan, however, was graceful to accept the defeat and said, “My wife lost, but neither she nor I am upset as this defeat is due to the failure of administration in checking fake voting even though I had made three complaints to election officials.” Talking to TOI on Tuesday, Singh said, “I am committed to my wife and will look after her. I will continue working for the people and will again contest next election or will field her if the seat is again reserved for women.” In a very close contest, Nidhi bagged 525 votes but lost to Sonika Devi who secured 564 votes and won by a small margin of 39 votes. “I am thankful to all the villagers as they stood with me, but the fact is that if my complaints against fake voting been taken seriously by administration, the result would have been different,” claimed Hathi Singh. People in Ballia and adjoining districts were keeping an eye on Karan Chhapra village head election which shot into prominence after the news of Hathi Singh giving up his celibacy vow and getting married at Dharmnathji temple of his village on March 26 went viral on social media after the seat was reserved for women. “I bowed to the wishes of my supporters to see me serving the village for change and development. When the gram pradhan seat of my village was reserved for women, they searched a bride for me in a day as the date for filing nomination was April 13,” he said. Even though it was not auspicious time for weddings as per Hindu traditions, the supporters, Hathi Singh tied the knot with 25-year-old Nidhi ahead of nomination filing last date since the auspicious ‘lagnas’ for wedding began only from April 20. Singh, who had worked in the Gulf for few years, had returned to his native village and started farming along with social service as he nurtured ambition of being in active politics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/man-breaks-celibacy-vow-but-wife-loses/articleshow/82395065.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Chandigarh||Explain cow vigilantes’ power to raid homes: Punjab and Haryana high court||CHANDIGARH: In a significant move, the Punjab and Haryana high court has directed the Haryana government to inform the court about the power or authority vested in cow vigilantes to raid homes of citizens. “Haryana is directed to address the court on the power/authority of vigilantes to raid the houses of the citizens. Such actions are prima facie illegal and amount to taking law into their own hands by private individuals. This is contrary to the Rule of Law,” observed the high court while seeking a reply from the state government. Justice Sudhir Mittal of the HC passed these orders while granting bail to Mubbi, alias Mubin, a native of Mewat in Haryana in relation to an FIR registered against him by the Mewat police under the cow protection law. The allegations in the FIR against Mubin are that the local Gau Raksha Dal, led by its district president, raided his house and found a bull, a cow, and a calf tethered there. The petitioner ran away from the spot and could not be apprehended. The cow vigilantes discovered instruments of slaughter in the house and informed the local police. An FIR dated March 11, 2021, was registered at Bichhor Police Station in Nuh district under various sections of the Haryana Gauvansh Sanrakshan and Gausamvardhan Act, 2015 and related charges under IPC. In his plea for bail before the HC, the petitioner’s counsel submitted that Section 3 of the aforementioned Act prohibits cow slaughter but the facts of this case do not reveal the slaughter of any cow and, thus, Section 3 is not attracted. Section 8 of the cow protection law prohibits the sale of beef. However, as there was no slaughter, there is no question of the sale of beef and, thus, Section 8 is also not attracted, the counsel said. The counsel also argued that the local Gau Raksha Dal and its district president were not authorized to raid the house of the petitioner and they are themselves guilty of the offence of trespassing. Hearing the arguments, the high court issued a notice to Nuh police and the Haryana government seeking a reply to the contentions raised by the petitioner. The high court ordered the petitioner to appear before the SHO on May 10 for investigation and the SHO concerned has been directed to release Mubin on bail upon him joining the investigation. The matter has been fixed for July 19 for the next hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-to-haryana-what-is-the-authority-of-cow-vigilantes-raiding-citizens-homes/articleshow/82393418.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Delhi||2,000 beds ready, 1,000 more in a week; but lack of oxygen delays patient intake||New Delhi: The capital has over 2,000 beds ready for Covid-19 patients and work is happening on war footing to set up 1,000 more ICU beds. However, the oxygen crisis has caused a delay in providing these much-needed beds to patients. Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre at Radha Soami Satsang Beas in south Delhi’s Chhatarpur was restarted last week with 150 oxygen beds, with plans of increasing the capacity to 5,000 eventually. However, only about 300 of the 500 beds are currently operational. Another 500 have been added but due to the lack of oxygen, which resulted in a major crisis on Monday, these beds can’t be used. Another centre on the campus of Sant Nirankari Samagam Ashram in north Delhi’s Burari also has 1,000 beds ready, but unable to admit many patients because of oxygen shortage. On Tuesday, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and health minister Satyendar Jain visited two upcoming Covid care centres near Lok Nayak and GTB hospitals. “To augment the number of ICU and oxygen beds, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had decided to convert Ramlila Maidan into a Covid care centre. We visited the location to take stock of the 500 ICU beds being set up there,” Sisodia said. He tweeted that the work was happening on a war footing and the beds were expected to be ready by next week. He also tweeted that Delhi salutes everyone involved in the creation of the Covid hospital in such a short time by working day and night. Jain tweeted that work was on in full swing for the 1,000 ICU beds in both the upcoming centres. The Delhi government said that it is working to increase the capacity in its hospitals from 5,200 to 7,200 beds. ‘Government is working round-the-clock to convert non-Covid hospitals into Covid hospitals to increase capacity,’ a statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2000-beds-ready-1000-more-in-a-week-but-lack-of-oxygen-delays-patient-intake/articleshow/82395087.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The younger patient noted her anxiety and extended his support. Chauhan was discharged after four days of hospitalization, on Tuesday. Civil Hospital authorities said Chauhan was brought to the hospital with 90% oxygen saturation. Due to her age, the family wasted no time and brought her in a private vehicle. She was stabilized with medication and oxygen, but what about loneliness? “Maulik, a fellow patient, saw her lost in thought and feeling sad. Thus, he started talking with her,” said a Civil Hospital official. “He learnt that she had never been away from her family members and was scared. He pacified her and got her to talk with her family on video calls.” The official added that she had not operated a mobile phone on her own, so Maulik would make the calls a few times daily. The duo also forged a friendship. They would chat whenever possible. Chauhan’s family said Maulik was a benefactor who provided her support when she needed it. “We have many such heart-warming tales in Covid wards, because of the uniqueness of the infection,” said a Civil Hospital official. “It doesn’t allow anyone to be with the patient. Thus, with the physical recuperation, the patient also requires psychological support. The staff does everything to keep the feeling of loneliness at bay. But many patients, after getting a bit better, help others.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/99-year-old-finds-friendship-support-from-30-year-old/articleshow/82394190.cms||---

The figure of victorious SP candidates was higher but foul play by officials under pressure of BJP ministers and leaders resulted in defeat of many of our candidates,” he added.Senior Congress leader Ajay Rai also claimed that party supported candidates had won four ZP seats in Badagaon, Sevapuri and Pindra areas.BSP district chief Navin Bharat said six candidates had been supported by the party in ZP election and three emerged victorious. “Our one candidate was declared winner, but under pressure of a Union minister and a UP minister the result was changed. Recounting of votes is taking place for two seats, where our candidates are in fray.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bjp-lags-behind-in-kashi-zila-panchayat-elections/articleshow/82395081.cms||---

District disaster management authority has communicated that if the hospital fails to furnish a satisfactory explanation, action under the Epidemic Disease Ordinance and Disaster Management Act will be taken against the hospital management. The private hospitals were earlier directed to allot 50% of beds for Covid treatment owing to soaring number of cases in the district. Deputy collector disaster management G K Suresh Kumar said that some of the hospitals failed to comply with the directive following which the show-cause notice was issued. Meanwhile, MLA G R Anil inaugurated the Covid ward at Nedumangadu district hospital on Tuesday. Covid wards will also begin at Peroorkada and Neyyattinkara hospitals run by the district administration. The district panchayat will take care of medical expense and food of Covid patients. The panchayat is set to purchase antigen kits, PPE kits and thermal scanner for Covid treatment in panchayat-run hospitals. A hospital at Vellarada was converted as a secondary-line treatment (SLC) centre on Tuesday. As many as 300 beds are available in this hospital of which, 225 will be devoted to SLC and 50 for patients being referred under KASP. Non-Covid OP will continue to function in the hospital. Two domiciliary care centres each were taken over at Thiruvananthapuram and Chirayinkeezhu taluk on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the district recorded 3,388 new Covid-19 positive cases on Tuesday. The active cases in the district further soared to 29,689. As many as 1,989 persons recovered from the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/show-cause-notice-to-six-private-hospitals-in-tvm/articleshow/82397222.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Private bed numbers rise from 5,505 to 6,500 in a week||KOLKATA: In a continuing effort to ramp up Covid beds, private hospitals across the city have added more than 500 beds in the past one week. This is apart from satellite units and a stadium and Haj House, which two private hospitals have converted into Covid hospitals. From 5,505 Covid beds in private units on April 27, including 500-odd ones at satellite facilities, the number reached 6,500 on Tuesday. AMRI is also taking over Salt Lake stadium and setting up a 250-bed facility there. The group has already added 43 beds, most of them for critical care, in five days and has also repurposed some general beds into ICU/HDU facilities. The group is running 90 beds across its three satellite facilities. It is also adding 80 beds at the satellite facilities. TimesViewIf medical and other experts are to be believed, we may not have yet reached the peak of the surge in Bengal. The number of beds has grown over the last few weeks but it has been overwhelmed by the surge in the disease.Black-marketing and sudden price surges are pointers to demand-supply gaps in some other essentials, including oxygen. We need to be prepared.“From 150 beds a week ago, we have augmented the number to 165, which include 41 critical-care beds. We are trying to add more every week,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO Peerless Hospital. Fortis has put in 20 more beds to take up the count to 122, while CMRI has taken up the number from 189 to 227. “We have 253 Covid beds now at R N Tagore Hospital with 120 critical-care ones. It is becoming a challenge to add more beds due to the admissions for non-Covid critical-care patients and emergency non-Covid surgeries. To mitigate the bed crisis, we have added 200 Covid beds with 80 critical-care ones at our Narayana Howrah and Narayana Barasat units,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (east) Narayana Health. “From 135 beds a week ago, we have taken up the number to 179. We are procuring equipment so that we can add 20 more HDU beds,” said Subhasish Datta, general manager, operations, Ruby General Hospitals. A group of 10 businessmen in the city has also pitched in to support the hospitals’ efforts to quickly increase beds and add equipment. Entrepreneurs of Kolkata, as the group is calling itself, also has Kolkata Gives and Rotary Club of Calcutta Visionaries as partners. They have helped add 225 beds in two hospitals, including 75 critical-care ones. They have provided 50 Bipap ventilators. “We are in talks with Anandaloke, Mission of Mercy and Vishudhanand Hospital for increasing Covid beds,” said group representative Sagar Daryani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-bed-nos-rise-from-5505-to-6500-in-a-week/articleshow/82394193.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Goa||Goan seamen ask govt for vaccine priority||PANAJI: The Goan Seamen’s Association of India has appealed to the chief minister, NRI Commission and DG Shipping to accord priority for vaccination of seafarers in the age group 18-45. President of the association Frank Viegas said shipping companies are not accepting crew who have not been inoculated and said there is an urgent need for seafarers to be given preference as their jobs are at stake. “Many companies are trying to bring their vessels directly to India for crew change due to the restrictions on international travel. On Tuesday, some seamen couldn’t join a ship that arrived in India for crew change because they weren’t vaccinated,” Viegas said. The association stated that Goan seafarers are unable to book appointments for vaccination at the sole private hospital that has begun vaccinating 18-44-year-olds. It has requested for at centre to be set up in Goa as the only vaccination centres for this age group have been set up in port trust hospitals in Mumbai, Kolkata and Cochin.“A vaccination centre in Goa for seafarers is very much the need of the hour,” he said. If vaccinations don’t start, Indian seafarers will be at a loss and shipping companies could give preference to crew from other companies, he said. “…there is demand for vaccinated seafarers by ship owners (cargo and cruise) and this is very much going to affect the Indian shipping industry where Indian seafarers are second in the world in terms of crew supply. Many countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, UK, Canada, UAE, etc, have already banned crew change for Indian seafarers and to those with a recent history of travelling to India. Ship managers and crewing firms have echoed the same sentiment,” the association stated in their letter. The waiting time is worrying seafarers and leading to a lot of uncertainty in them joining work, Viegas said, adding that the vaccination centres are not giving preference to seafarers below the age of 45 and continue to vaccinate only 45 and above. “Seafarers require adequate time to complete both the doses before joining ships in order to ensure that they don’t miss out on the shots. If our seafarers are not vaccinated at the earliest possible, then the only option left for ship managers operating in India is to freeze crew change for Indians, a situation which will further affect the morale of Indian seafarers as well as increase of stress and frustration amongst Indians due to job loss,” the association stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goan-seamen-ask-govt-for-vax-priority/articleshow/82395155.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||Compassion unites Hyderabad during Covid-19 crisis||Seniors step out for Gen Z Name: Forum for Senior Citizens Area: Tarnaka Notwithstanding their age – most of the members in this 300-people-strong team are 70 years and beyond -- members of this forum have come together to ensure that residents of their area are vaccinated. And to make that happen, this group has not just collated detailed information about centres offering the vaccine, but are also facilitating transport and other arrangements for those that need assistance to get the jab. So far, they have helped about 150 to 200 people get their shots. Interestingly, while they call themselves a forum for senior citizens, it isn’t just the elderly that are being supported by this group. Also reaching out to them in large numbers are people between 18 and 44 years of age, seeking help with getting the vaccine. “When the process starts, we will certainly help these young people as well as it is our only hope against the Covid-19 virus,” said G R S Prasad Rao, vice-president of the group. At 73, he says that years of habit – of helping those in distress – is hard to give up, especially in such times of crisis, despite the advancing age. …......................... Using tech to ferry medical help Name: Resident Welfare Association (West Zone) Area: Madhapur-Hi-Tec City-Gachibowli (and beyond) Using its connections with industry bodies -- like the Society for Cyberabad Security Council, Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association among others – the team spread across the city’s IT corridor is playing a key role in helping affected families with medical leads. From organising beds in hospitals to ferrying oxygen cylinders to the homes of those in need to even arranging homecare for those in isolation, these members are doing everything they can. Their latest offering: a mobile app that can assist the government in streamlining the vaccination drive, when it opens for all above 18. “We are preparing to approach the state government to explore how we can tie up with them to make this app useful. The purpose is to guide residents, registered on CoWin, to the accurate vaccination centre and ensure that it is a safe and smooth process for them. We also want the app to check overcrowding at any centre,” said Uday Shankar Peyyeti, vice-president of the United Federation of Resident Welfare Associations, who also oversees the western corridor initiatives. He hopes that the app will be rolled out in the next two weeks. ….......................... Keeping livelihoods afloat Name: Old Dairy Farm Resident Welfare Association Area: Within Osmania University It might be a small cluster comprising 63 households, but the association here is certainly setting an example for many others around the city. Thanks to the efforts of the team, this pocket – most of the people here are employed as house helps, drivers, masons etc -- has not only remained unaffected by the virus thus far, but has also managed to keep the livelihoods of its residents afloat. “There is a lot of fear among people living in apartments about the virus being carried into their homes by people working for them. To put such concerns to rest, we took up a two-pronged approach,” said Syed Khaled Shah Chishti Hussaini, general secretary of the association. He added: “While on the one hand we gathered people from the area and educated them about sanitisation, double-masking and Covid symptoms – so that they can alert us in case they feel discomfort – on the other hand we personally made calls to their employers to inform them about the various precautionary measures that these residents are taking while reporting to duty. That helped build the employers’ confidence and these poor people didn’t have to lose their jobs.” The association is also offering vaccination education to those still in doubt. ….................................. Delivering help, pan-India Name: Ajuli Tulsyan Team: Covid Taskforce An entrepreneur by profession, Ajuli recollects the trauma that her family recently went through when her cancer-affected father-in-law needed a bed in a city hospital. He had mild Covid-19 symptoms. After rejections from at least half a dozen (or more), she says, the family finally found shelter in one; but the experience left them shaken forever. Soon afterwards, she started the Covid Taskforce that connects people from across major cities in India – existing Covid help groups and conscientious individuals – who facilitate help for patients and their families. In the last three days alone, the team reached out to seven people across Ranchi, New Delhi and Hyderabad. If someone managed to get a hospital bed in time, another got a prescribed dose of Remdesivir when needed. “Today we are a team of 59 people and growing. Apart from active groups, we are also tying up with reputed doctors to assist those that need home care/consultation. I have also reached out to Sonu Sood (a call with him initially inspired me to start this) and offered to do whatever we can. It is our time to give back to society,” Ajuli said.  …....................... Caring for frontliners, furries Name: Anuradha Reddy Work: Mask distribution; feeding animals Moved by the work that some of our frontline workers put in – police personnel, GHMC’s sanitation staff, and even the TSRTC team -- sometimes at the cost of their own health and life, Anuradha started distributing masks and sanitisers among these people within her colony. She even helped them with basic essentials like tea and soaps. “I must also add the rich experience of feeding birds, cows in my area and the street dogs (in the Secunderabad area) who have become my friends. Their smiling faces, in such trying times, add value to my life. These dogs actually recognise my car horn and me now!” Anuradha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/compassion-unites-hyderabad-during-covid-19-crisis/articleshow/82395090.cms||---
---||Delhi||With supply, all can get jab in 3 mths: CM||New Delhi: Delhi can vaccinate all its people in three months if sufficient Covid vaccines are provided, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday after visiting Radha Soami Satsang Beas in Rajendra Nagar to review the vaccination drive. “Visited the vaccination centre at Radha Soami Satsang Beas in Rajendra Nagar. Excellent arrangements. Youth are coming out in large numbers to get vaccinated. If the vaccine is provided in sufficient quantities, we can achieve our target of vaccinating whole Delhi in 3 months,” Kejriwal tweeted. Delhi had over 7.8 lakh vaccines in stock as on Wednesday. Over 90,000 people have been vaccinated in the past 24 hours, while 34.8 lakh have got the vaccine since the launch, including 7.6 lakh who have received both doses. “The process of vaccination has started successfully but I think more supply of vaccine is the fundamental requirement right now. We have received a very less quantity of vaccines. Now the kind of infrastructure we have developed, based on that we can ramp up the vaccination drive within 24 hours,” said Kejriwal. Delhi currently has 4,11,030 doses in stock — 1,17,370 Covishield and 2,93,660 Covaxin — supplied to it by the Centre. Out of the vaccines bought by Delhi government, 3,77,120 doses are available — 2,54,230 Covishield and 1,22,890 Covaxin. Delhi government has already requested the manufacturers of Covishield and Covaxin to provide 67 lakh doses each within three months. The chief minister added that the drive for the people in the 18-44 age group had begun in both private and government sectors. “Yesterday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and health minister Satyendar Jain visited several government vaccination centres to review the drive. I am here to review the drive in private centres.” Meanwhile, Kejriwal again pointed at the scarcity of oxygen in the city. “Whenever the oxygen level of a patient goes down, that person should immediately get oxygen support. For the past several days, we have been battling the scarcity of oxygen. Delhi government is working hand in hand with the central government,” he said. “We completely understand that the central government is responsible for ensuring oxygen to the entire country. But our only hope is that it will provide Delhi its own quota of required oxygen,” Kejriwal said. “During this tough time, we have also received massive support from the Supreme Court and the high court.” Delhi government, Kejriwal added, is working to increase the number of oxygen beds across the city. “We are arranging more and more oxygen concentrators and cylinders to run these beds.” The chief minister said a decision on continuing the lockdown would be taken based on the Covid situation. “Right now the citizens of Delhi themselves want this lockdown to continue to stop the spread of the virus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-supply-all-can-get-jab-in-3-mths-cm/articleshow/82417070.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Readers Corner||Art, books and baking kept me engaged By Shubha Holla My experience of the lockdown, as a student, had its ups and downs. Being confined to our homes with no outside interaction with friends was tough; but there was nothing I could do about it. I am, however, lucky to have a family that supported me in these uncertain times. I came up with some fun activities to keep myself engaged at home. My mother enrolled me in to different online classes where I learnt to draw and sketch some Mandalas and Zentangles, spiral art etc. They worked as some kind of a stress buster for me. I also started reading Harry Potter books that are wonderful and kept me busy. Amid this pandemic, I picked up baking -- cakes, muffins,cupcakes and lots more – and now, have come to love sprinkles. I had also learned the piano and can now play many tunes like our national anthem, some Bollywood songs etc on it. After a few months of the lockdown or so my online school started. Even my teachers started finding new websites to help students understand concepts while at the same time ensuring that we had fun. My teachers are the best, as even in these hard times, they make time for students to help them learn instead of wasting our time. I also learned coding which taught me how to build games, apps, websites and many more. All this apart, the lockdown gave me time to spend with my family and we played multiple games together. Now I only hope that we can go back to our normal lives soon. Of course, even then we should follow all necessary precautions by wearing a mask, using a hand sanitizer and maintaining social distancing. Life in the pandemic was tough but I had a lot of fun too. I also ensured that I always remained positive and learnt to look at the current challenge of lockdown as an adaptive learning experience that we’ve all faced with. (The writer is a class 7 student at St Michael's School, Old Alwal) …............................... I formed a new friendship with nature By Kasturi Chatterjee Little did I ever think that Covid-19 will bring a 360-degree change in my life. Along with all the threats and challenges Covid has gifted me my ‘me-time’, and truly speaking I am cherishing every moment of it. In the name of lockdown, I got cut off from the world around me, but I am lucky to have an opportunity of being close to nature and the universe. Trust me it is indeed a unique experience which cannot be expressed through words. As these days, there is a considerably less morning rush, I take the privilege of soaking myself in the golden hues of the early morning sun and get rejuvenated for the day's work. The sleep laden silvery romantic moonlight awaits to wash away my day’s fatigue, through a dreamy restful slumber. I forget my worries, my pain and wake up to a fresh morning of new hope and vitality. I enjoy my new found friendship with the greenery around me. They reach me through their sweetness and fragrance. I get intoxicated by the rhythm of the falling rain. I feel light on my feet when the wind caresses me on my lips and my cheek. A sip of cinnamon tea with the approaching dusk, the chirping of the homebound tired birds, a whiff of happiness for being able to celebrate life, take me to a state of trance and I thank God for blessing me with life. Covid-19 has been a great teacher. It has taught me to accept the present, to have faith in myself and to ignore worries. It has taught me to be content and thankful for having two square meals a day, a roof to shelter me and my family and have my loved ones around me. The virus has made the future uncertain, so let's live, love and be thankful till we are alive.

At least eight persons have reportedly ended lives in Saurashtra region in the last 12 days after testing positive for coronavirus or after their family members got infected with the deadly virus. A 50-year-old electrician, who had tested positive for Covid-19, ended life by jumping off the fourth floor of Rajkot civil hospital on Tuesday morning. The deceased Jaga Bhalgamadiya was a resident of Saipur village, about 20km from Rajkot city. Police suspect that Bhalgamadiya feared that he would die of Covid-19 infection and so he might have taken the extreme step. “We will be taking statements of the hospital staff, family members of the deceased to ascertain the reason behind Bhalgamadiya taking such an extreme step,” added police. Bhalgamadiya is survived by a wife and two children — a daughter and a son. Police said that he was admitted to the Covid ward on the fourth floor of Rajkot civil hospital last week. On Tuesday morning at about 7 am, Bhalgamadiya was seen running down the lobby of the fourth floor before he jumped off. He fell to the ground and died on the spot. Police said that CCTV footage showed hospital staff members trying to save him after the fall, but it was too late. A day before, Bhalgamadiya had talked to his younger brother over a video call. In the second incident, a 45-year-old Covid-19 patient jumped to death from 4th floor of a hospital building in Bhavnagar civil hospital on Tuesday afternoon. The deceased was identified as Arvind Kalotra, a resident of Anand Vihar in Bhavnagar. He had tested positive for the coronavirus five days ago and was shifted to civil hospital after his condition worsened. He was being treated on the fourth floor of the hospital building from where he jumped and died on the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/two-covid-ve-patients-jump-to-death-in-rajkot-bhavnagar/articleshow/82392671.cms||---
---||Kochi||Mutant strain attacks young and old people alike in Kerala||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: People who are younger and considered safer to Covid-19 in the first wave than the elderly people with immunocompromised conditions may well be at equal risk or more in the second wave, going by the nature of Covid-19 deaths in the Capital this year, especially in April. Men and women, mostly aged between 30 and 40, are falling victims to Covid-19 in the district. April saw nine deaths of people aged below 50 and the list includes a 36-year-old woman on April 27, a 42-year-old man on April 27, a 41-year-old man on April 26 and a 35-year-old man on April 19. There was also a pregnant woman in middle 30s who succumbed to Covid-19 complications. A 30-year-old woman died of Covid on May 2. Even in the last three months, there were three instances of people aged between 33 and 36 dying of Covid-19 in the district. Health officials have noticed that many of these cases were late presentations and were characterised by cytokine storm syndrome (CSS); an exaggerated and uncontrolled immune response to a pathogen. In cytokine storm, the body starts attacking its own cells instead of fighting the pathogen. Overproduction of cytokines puts enormous stress on the organs leading to organ damage and failure. “There could be two reasons for young people getting sick and even dying due to Covid-19. Many of those above 45 are vaccinated and are more confined whereas youngsters are not vaccinated and move around more freely and they fall sick. We also noticed a change in pattern of virus infection between the first and second wave. The first strain mostly attacked people who were weak, old and had other ailments. In the second wave, the mutant strain infects even those who are considered to be immunocompetent. That’s where the danger lies. This infection now happens irrespective of age and in no time gets complicated,” said a health official associated with Covid treatment. The health team also dealt with cases of late presentation. “Some people take symptoms lightly and believe that it would settle. In case of cytokine storm, complications occur so rapidly and by the time the patient is brought to hospital it would be too late to save them. It’s very important to monitor oxygen levels and seek medical care. The nature of reaction of some patients to cytokine storm has been so puzzling,” the official said. The deaths were also characterized by Covid-induced coagulopathy; a bleeding disorder which impairs blood’s ability to clot. According to webportal dynamed, it is one of the most significant prognostic factors in patients with Covid-19 and is associated with increased mortality and admission to critical care. Covid mortality among other age groups has also not dropped either in the district. As many as 54 Covid-19 deaths were confirmed in the district in last four days alone with 28 Covid deaths being confirmed on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mutant-strain-attacks-young-and-old-people-alike-in-tpuram/articleshow/82393452.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Medicine supply improves, oxygen still hard to get||KOLKATA: The dearth of oxygen cylinders in the market continued to plague the kin of Covid patients requiring oxygen support at home in the city and other parts of the state. Though the supply of medicines, prescribed for Covid treatment, has improved in the city, the situation is dire in the districts with both Remdesivir and Tocilizumab being in short supply. Several oxygen banks have come up across the city in the last few days to replenish empty cylinders. “Earlier, we used to refill barely 4,000 cylinders a month. Now, we have been refilling more than 500 cylinders a day. People are coming from nearby districts and standing in queue for hours to get their cylinders refilled. How can I overcharge them, given this situation?” said Swapan Kumar Panda of Oxyline services in Baghajatin. However, the availability of new cylinders remains a problem. Unlike Delhi, there is no dearth of oxygen supply to hospitals or refilling cylinders. Unscrupulous retailers and pharmacists are demanding a huge premium to sell the cylinders that they have stashed away. “Two days ago, a person even quoted Rs 80,000 for an empty 20 litres oxygen cylinder. I had got the number from a social media post,” said Tanumoy Naskar, a Covid volunteer who has been working relentlessly to arrange oxygen cylinders, beds and medicines for people. The drug shortage though has improved in the city with a steady supply of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab in the past 10 days. But medicine suppliers reported severe shortage of both drugs in several districts and raised the issue with the Union health ministry. “The shortage is especially acute in Burdwan, Birbhum, East and West Midnapore and large parts of north Bengal,” said Sajal Ganguly, general secretary of the Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/med-supply-improves-oxygen-still-hard-to-get/articleshow/82394198.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Delhi||Vax registration still a puzzle for many||New Delhi: Ramesh Kumar has been providing his auto services to people coming out of the vaccine centre at Lajpat Nagar from Monday. But unlike those who are getting the Covid-19 vaccination, the 44-year-old auto driver is unaware of the registration process. Kumar is one of the many people from the marginal sections of the society who are keen on getting the jab, but have no idea how to go about it. “I was not eligible for the walk-in facility at the centre, which was available for those above 45 years of age,” said the auto driver. Prakash Sharma, a 55-year-old auto driver waiting for passengers outside the centre, however, said he got inoculated at a medical centre in Sriniwaspuri. “Many of my peers are ignorant about the vaccine. They don’t know its benefits. For them, life revolves around driving their auto and earning enough money by the end of the day,” said Sharma. “They have no idea how to go about the registration process as well. Even if they have a phone, they lack guidance.” Another auto driver Kulbeer Kumar was also not aware of the CoWin app. He said he had only heard of Aarogya Setu. The 19-year-old from Punjab said he would get the shot at his village. Rizwan, who sells fruits at the Bhogal market, mistakenly believed that he got vaccinated after he was given an injection a few months ago when he was unwell. “Only recently I realised that it was not the Covid vaccine as I was not eligible then. I have heard about CoWin, but I will need help from someone to access it,” he said. A few NGOs are helping people get registered for the jab. Abu Sufyan, member of Delhi Youth Welfare Association, an old Delhi-based NGO, claimed that “many are coming to us for registering on the app or the website as they are unaware or have no internet access. We are helping some of them. But the government should create a situation for such people to access the vaccines as well.” Protsahan India Foundation said that it was trying to spread awareness among three lakh people residing in Uttam Nagar slums and nearby areas about the need for them to get vaccinated. “We are distributing government messages on the efficacy of vaccines. We have design and digital labs in the slums where we connect with young girls through online classes and explain them about the Co-Win registration procedure,” said its founder director Sonal Kapoor Singh. “We are dispelling many myths too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vax-registration-still-a-puzzle-for-many/articleshow/82417142.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

---||Bhopal||Patients in home isolation left to fend for themselves||BHOPAL: Despite the instructions and guidelines issued by the government for monitoring the health of positive patients who are in home isolation, several patients have been left to their own resources. More than 5000 patients are currently in home isolation in Bhopal alone and directives issued by health department state that district Covid control and command centres (DCCC) should call each patient twice a day and monitor their health and progress. Despite this, majority of patients are not receiving any phone calls, said sources. Especially the patients who had got their samples tested at private laboratories of the city are the most impacted. “I and my wife, my brother, sister-in-law and both my parents had tested positive on April 8. We got ourselves tested at a private laboratory and kept ourselves in home isolation and took all the precautions. By the grace of god we all recovered and on April 26 and received a negative report. But we didn’t receive a single phone call during the entire home isolation period from health officials”, said a patient from a residential society in Katara Hills, whose six family members had tested positive. Another couple from Rohit Nagar area of the city who had tested positive on May 3, said, “It’s been almost two days but we are yet to receive any call from government sources asking about our well-being or informing us about the requisite precautions”. Another patient from Shahpura who got himself tested at a government facility went on to add, “I first approached government facility near Char Imli on April 19, but when I did not receive any information regarding the report and my wife also showed symptoms we went to AIIMs to get ourselves tested after a couple of days. A day later we received a report saying that we are positive. I did not receive any phone call for next 6-7 days and it was from April 30, i.e., nearly 10 days after testing positive that I started receiving a call once a day asking about my well-being.” Similar sentiments were expressed by two women patients from Ayodhya Nagar who said that despite testing positive 14 days ago, they are yet to receive a call from health authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/patients-in-home-isolation-left-to-fend-for-themselves/articleshow/82396143.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Delhi||Army sounds alarm over reduction of oxygen quota for Base Hospital in Delhi Cantonment||NEW DELHI: The Army has sounded an alarm over the Delhi government reducing the daily oxygen quota for its Base Hospital in Delhi Cantonment, stressing that its reserves may run out if the shortages are not addressed in time. The Army has taken up the urgent need for additional allocation of oxygen supplies for the Base Hospital with the defence ministry and state authorities, even as it also arranges large cylinders on its own from nearby places. “The Base Hospital, which has been converted into a 450-bed Covid facility, has a daily requirement of 3.4 metric tonne of oxygen in the form of cylinders. The Delhi government was allotting only 1 MT till now. It further reduced it to 0.42 MT from Monday night onwards,” said a senior Army officer on Tuesday. “There is no cause for immediate panic because there are adequate oxygen supplies available at present. But the situation can turn grave because the allotment is not enough to meet the requirements and the reserves will eventually run out,” he added. Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, incidentally, had written to defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday to call for the Army’s help to set up Covid facilities with 10,000 oxygenated non-ICU beds and 1,000 ICU ones. While the Army is scrambling to make arrangements for additional oxygen supplies for the Base Hospital, which is packed to capacity with serving and retired personnel as well as their dependents, the sharp cut in its daily quota has left military authorities stunned. With the 15-lakh strong armed forces facing a major upsurge in the number of Covid patients, military hospitals all over the country are overstretched. “Military hospitals are also catering to civilians wherever possible,” said another officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/army-sounds-alarm-over-reduction-of-o2-quota-for-base-hospital-in-delhi-cantt/articleshow/82395159.cms||---

Less than two weeks ago, KMC had made a similar request to housing complexes. Last year, many housing complexes had converted their community halls and clubs into safe homes but in the second wave, RWAs had been apprehensive that a patient’s condition might suddenly spiral out of control given the severity of the virus this time. They are also uncomfortable about lack of transparency over the legal liability in case of deaths there. But Monday’s state advisory asked the RWAs to tie up with government or private medical facilities to set up the units at their complexes. “The current advisory has a lot of clarity and we would convert two of our community halls in the complex into isolation centres. We can accommodate around 20 patients in the facilities. We will approach government officials and try and get the safe homes ready at the earliest,” said Deepak Agarwal of Diamond City West in Behala, which now has 60 Covid patients. Some complexes, like South City, have started a dialogue with a private hospital and hope to set up the isolation centre in a week. “A private hospital officials visited us. We plan to convert 10 guest rooms in our club into isolation centres that will be managed by the hospital. It should be ready by next week,” said MV Viju, joint secretary of the resident welfare association. The Urbana management are in talks with a private hospital to convert their spacious community hall into an isolation centre but opposition from some residents halted the process. “Residents want the club to be turned into a safe home but the club doesn’t have an attached toilet, a must for an isolation centre. We are in talks with the residents’ body,” said Debjani Mukherjee, director, Urbana facility management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-offers-help-to-set-up-cov-isolation-units-at-high-rises/articleshow/82394235.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also announced financial assistance for auto rickshaw and taxi drivers on Tuesday. “To deal with coronavirus, we have imposed a lockdown in Delhi. This was essential to curtail the number of cases and to break the chain. We’re well aware that any lockdown creates a financial crisis for people, and especially for the poor. It hits the daily wage workers particularly hard, following which it becomes difficult for them to run their homes,” Kejriwal said in a digital press conference. Kejriwal said that free ration would be provided to around 72 lakh ration card holders of Delhi for the next two months. He, however, clarified that one should not assume that the lockdown would continue for the next two months. “Let us hope that the cases begin to decrease and the lockdown is lifted early. However, to help the poor through a financial crisis, the government has decided that for the next two months, free ration will be distributed to all ration card holders,” he said. He said that auto rickshaw and taxi drivers were also facing a tough time as their daily earnings had depleted. Last year, more than 1.5 lakh drivers were provided a one-time financial assistance of Rs 5,000 each by the Delhi government and the same is going to be given again to help them during this financial adversity, said the CM. “We are undergoing a very difficult period and the second wave has been extremely dangerous. All of us are witnessing that there is so much sadness everywhere, people are troubled and are falling ill all across. This is the time to help each other, this is the time to become a good human being,” Kejriwal said. “This is not the time for politics; everyone should work together,” he said further. “If someone is ill then one can offer help by admitting them to a hospital. If someone is not getting a bed, help them find a bed. Even the smallest piece of information can be helpful. Aid can be given by providing oxygen cylinders,” he said, adding that if an entire family has fallen ill, assistance can be provided by giving them food or by giving financial assistance to those who might need it. Ensure ration, cooked food for poor: Petition A petition has been filed in Delhi High Court seeking immediate provision for rations and cooked food for those who do not have ration cards. Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan has filed the petition. “The lockdown has resulted in loss of livelihoods, which is causing intense financial distress and food insecurity among the economically weaker sections,” stated the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-relief-free-ration-to-all-beneficiaries-for-two-months/articleshow/82395247.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Goa||Lockdown needed to save lives: UGDP||MARGAO: United Goans Democratic Party (UGDP) has made out a strong case for a lockdown in Goa stating that it was essential to “save lives, save time and strengthen the health system that is presently overloaded.” “Have a small lockdown and then gradually return to activities, controlling social contacts. There is immediate need to put in place effective strategies to contain the infection and then one will see very low number of cases,” UGDP president Dr Jorson Fernandes said. He further pointed out that several members of Covid-19 task force of India and AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria have focused on the need for a complete lockdown in the country to break the chain of the virus, highlighting that the new double mutant variant of coronavirus is more infectious and lethal and that it threatens the full healthcare infrastructure “Losing precious lives at the altar of economic activity and livelihood is what is being advocated by the BJP dispensation which resorted to the imposition of Section 144 and declaring some areas as micro-containment zones. The result of the sheer irresponsibility in not declaring a lockdown is there for everyone to see, from the statistics. Yet, our politicians refuse to open their eyes, thus compounding the tragedy, solely for economic reasons,” Fernandes said. The UGDP castigated the state government for “pretending that everything was under control” while praising the Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD) and the Trained Nurses’ Association of India, Goa unit, for “nailing the lies of the politicians.” “People had been crying hoarse about the shortage of beds, shortage of oxygen due to which some even have died. What happened about the assurances and reassurances from our much-loved politicians who time and again lied that there was no shortage of oxygen and beds despite the family members of patients resorting to social media with pleas for oxygen and ventilators,” Fernandes said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lockdown-needed-to-save-lives-ugdp/articleshow/82395241.cms||---

Regional officers were asked to provide the lists. The list that we had sent to the Centre mentions 14 industries but later on we found some more. Officials have now also reported some other industrialists that have nitrogen plants of their own,” said an MPPCB official, requesting anonymity. Notably Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on Sunday reviewed the progress of converting nitrogen plants into oxygen plants in the country. Considering the requirement of medical oxygen amidst the Covid-19 pandemic situation, the Government of India is exploring the feasibility of conversion of existing nitrogen plants to oxygen plants. Existing nitrogen plants in MP may be spared for the production of oxygen. Details sent to MP were also tabled at the Prime Minister’s meeting where process of converting the existing Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) nitrogen plants for the production of oxygen was discussed at length. Some of the officials, however, state that it would not be feasible since Carbon Molecular Sieve (CMS) are the core of nitrogen plants whereas Zeolite Molecular Sieve (ZMS) is required for oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/14-nitrogen-plants-in-mp-may-be-converted-into-oxygen-plants/articleshow/82396148.cms||P Naveen

This year, farmers of Prayagraj and neighbouring Kaushambi are forced to sell watermelon at Rs 6 or Rs 7 per kg in wholesale mandis, unlike last year when they sold it for Rs 12 and Rs 14 per kg. They said lockdown and poor market conditions have hit profit, as very few customers are booking orders in fruit and vegetable madis these days. Agriculture expert Manoj Srivastava told TOI, “Farmers in Asrawal Khurd, Mooratganj, Laxmanpur, Ijuha and adjoining villages grew watermelon and cucumber in thousands of acres this year. After making investments, it is worrying they are unable to get right price for their crops.” Sujeet, a farmer said, “Farmers in Prayargaj and Kaushambi region cultivate watermelons and melons using seeds of hybrid variety. These crops have a higher TSS (Total Solid Sugar) value and are cultivated using the mulch film cultivation technique.” Ordinary watermelons are green on the exterior and bright red inside. But the hybrid varieties elon have different colours. Vishala, a hybrid watermelon, is yellow on the exterior and bright red on the interior, while Anmol, another hybrid variety, is green on the exterior and yellow on the interior). Moreover, a majority of farmers did not grow tomatoes and ladyfingers in trans-Ganga belt of Prayagraj this year as their crop in 1,700 acres were ruined by neelgai last year. Over 2,000 farmers of Kaushambi and Prayagrajhave urged state government to provide them some relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/over-2k-farmers-feel-pandemic-pinch-fail-to-get-good-price-for-watermelons/articleshow/82395186.cms||---

Researchers from IIT Madras and from the UK, who developed a paper-based sensor that will show up the antibiotics in a few minutes with the change in colour of the paper, tested it for ciprofloxacin, triclosan and amoxicillin and heavy metals chromium, lead and copper. It is making a portable device with the sensor that can be used at home.Prof S Pushpavanam, department of chemical engineering at IIT-M, said the cellulose-based paper coated with a chemical specific to the antibiotic/heavy metal changes colour when it interacts with polluted water. The colours are the products or a third chemical formed due to the reaction.“We make a design like a club in a playing card and have a chemical specific to an antibiotic or heavy metal in each of the three lobes. We then pass the water sample from the end of the club. It passes through all the three lobes, each having a chemical reaction and changing colour depending on the presence of the antibiotic or the heavy metal. The intensity of the colour produced gives its quantity. So, we can do a whole range of antibiotics using one strip,” said Prof Pushpavanam, who led the research team along with Prof T Renganathan.The research was funded by the Centre’s Department of Science and Technology in collaboration with UK’s Natural Environment Research Council and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council under the Indo-UK Water Quality Research Programme.Studies have shown antibiotics in surface water possibly due to effluents from wastewater treatment plants, aquaculture and livestock production activities and untreated sewage.Unlike a blotting paper where an ink spot can spread in all directions, here water passes through a specific channel. A laser jet printer with an ink cartridge having a wax-like material is used to print a pattern on the paper coated with a chemical to let the water pass only through the non-printed region in a particular direction. The paper’s porousness allows water to flow without a pump.“We generate a calibration chart which can quantify the antibiotic/heavy metal in water with that of the intensity of the colour produced. The more the antibiotic, the more the colour intensity,” he added.The team is working on developing a portable sensor which can also be taken to a places like lakes for on-site testing. “You could also possibly use your mobile phone camera to capture images and analyse the image to understand the concentration of the metal or antibiotic,” he said, adding that the team is working to detect pesticides and early detection of diseases like cervical cancer using the concept.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/iit-m-develops-paper-based-tool-to-find-antibiotics-in-water/articleshow/82394234.cms||---

This came in light of a statement by Dr Randeep Guleria, director of AIIMS Delhi, on Monday where he urged citizens not to overuse it due to its harmful effects. Dr Hemant Patel, member of the executive committee of International Radiology Society, said HRCT is not used as the primary diagnostic tool, but its importance in this pandemic should not be undermined – the course of treatment is decided based on CT severity score. It cannot be picked up by a chest X-ray alone,” he said. Dr Sahil Shah, a radiologist and joint secretary of Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA), said the figure of one HRCT equals 300 X-rays is also misleading. “New technology has reduced radiation compared to earlier times,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hrct-needed-to-know-covid-19-spread/articleshow/82394229.cms||---

Those seeking admission will have to contact CCR landline number 0712-2567021 or on WhatsApp (7770011537, 7770011472) with health details of the patient.Within half an hour, the CCR will take a call on whether the patient can undergo treatment at home or is to be allotted a hospital bed.If hospitalization is required, then software module at the CCR office will show latest bed availability status and a ‘reservation’ will be done. The patient will get two hours to reach this particular hospital, failing which the bed will go back into ‘vacant’ pool and be allotted to the next in line.However, patients who land up directly at any hospital cannot be denied treatment. The hospital has to start the treatment and at the same time inform CCR about it, so that an available bed can be searched for.Similarly for essential drugs like Remdesivir etc and oxygen supply to hospitals, special teams have been formed. These teams will monitor allocation and supply of these essentials to hospitals.How It WorksFor admission, contact CCR landline 0712-2567021 or on WhatsApp 7770011537, 7770011472CCR will function 24/7 and will also help in coordinating essential drugs and oxygen supplyWithin 30 minutes, CCR will evaluate if patient needs hospital bedCCR software will show bed availability and reserve bedPatient will get 2 hours to reach hospital, failing which bed will go back into vacant pool||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/now-all-covid-beds-in-dist-only-through-control-room/articleshow/82394232.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Closing time had been advanced by an hour in recent weeks as cases increased. The bars attached to the outlets continue to be closed."It is unlikely that the wine shops would be shut; they will function within restricted timing," a Tasmac official said.Under the new pandemic restrictions ,the state government has announced that all sale outlets run by the government and public sector undertakings will be permitted to operate from 8 am to noon. It did not specifically mention Tasmac, which is owned by the Tamil Nadu government. “We are expecting a separate order regarding the functioning of the shops during the restricted hours soon,” the official. Last year, all Tasmac wine shops were shut for more than 40 days following the outbreak of Covid-19. The crowds at these shops hardly ever follow social distancing norms, but they remain a source of daily revenue for the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-govt-might-restrict-hours-tasmac-shops-can-stay-open/articleshow/82394213.cms||---
---||Delhi||Lives on brink as O2 remains scarce in Delhi hospitals||NEW DELHI: Rainbow Children’s Hospital in Malviya Nagar sent out a distress call for oxygen around 10pm on Tuesday. The hospital has around 90 patients, including 20 new-born babies, four of them on ventilators. “We failed to contact the oxygen supplier and only narrowly averted a disaster,” said Dinesh Vashisth, vice-president, operations. “Yesterday, we didn’t admit new patients being uncertain of oxygen supply, but today had to take in some because they had come for deliveries.” For the second consecutive day, Jeevan Anmol Hospital in Mayur Vihar teetered on the brink of disaster. The hospital received stocks early on Tuesday but only to last till the evening. To its relief, the hospital received fresh supplies by 10.30pm and are adequately stocked till Wednesday afternoon. The hospital authorities have been instructed to keep demand low. Earlier, the hospital had advised patients to think of alternatives. At the hospital, a 30-year-old woman told TOI, “My mother is in the ICU. There are no ICU beds in Delhi. Where will we take her?” she moaned. Several hospitals flirted with disaster before remedying the situation at the last moment. Sama Hospital in Siri Fort, with 30 critical patients, had a heart-stopping moment at 4.30pm with only an hour’s oxygen left. Indian Spinal Injuries Centre in Vasant Kunj stared at a post-midnight crisis until the authorities arranged replenishment at 1.45am. At the time this story was written, the authorities were still trying to restock the gas at Jeewan Mala Hospital, opposite Maharani Bagh, which sent an alert about depleted supplies at 10.24pm. Lajpat Nagar's Institute of Brain and Spine asked its Covid patients to shift to other hospitals because it was running out of oxygen. With help from various quarters, including a tweet from actor Sonu Sood, some oxygen cylinders were somehow procured. On Tuesday, several cylinders bearing the names of patients stood in the hospital’s parking lot. One of the cylinders was owned by Mohit Gupta, a Delhi High Court lawyer whose mother, Madhu Gupta, was hospitalised on April 30. “Where could we have shifted? Where are the beds and the oxygen for our loved ones in Delhi?” Gupta asked. The best he could do, and after strenuous effort, was to get an oxygen cylinder for his mother. At Batra Hospital in south Delhi, there were no new admissions. Security guards at the entrance told people there were no beds vacant. The facility has been beset with oxygen problems for several days now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lives-on-brink-as-o2-remains-scarce-in-hosps/articleshow/82395282.cms||---

---||Kolkata||New faces, old warhorses to take oath||Kolkata: A combination of young faces, veteran leaders and representation from different strata of society—right from multi-crore businessmen to a daily wage earner—is set to form the Bengal legislative assembly as the newly elected MLAs prepare to swear in from Thursday. But questions were raised about female representation, as only 39 woman MLAs will be sworn in, making for merely 13% of the total members in the legislative assembly. Trinamool had fielded 50 woman candidates, among whom 32 won the elections and at least three others—including chief minister Mamata Banerjee—lost by a thin margin. “Our chief minister has always been focused on women’s empowerment and that has reflected in the representation of women, be it in the party or in the legislative assembly. The progression will continue,” said Chandrima Bhattacharya, ex-cabinet minister who won from Dum Dum North. Partha Chatterjee, one of the longest serving Trinamool MLAs since the party’s first election in 2001, also supported the induction of more women in the assembly in future. Winning from Mamata Banerjee’s home turf Bhowanipore, Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, who had been ridiculed for his age and health by his BJP rival, Rudranil Ghosh, said on Wednesday he felt ecstatic being the senior-most MLA at the age of 78 and would love to mentor young MLAs. “I have always loved teaching and would take the opportunity to mentor the newly elected youngsters. Many met and called me in the past two days, seeking advice and guidance,” he said. One such “student” was Trinamool’s first-time MLA from Sonarpur South, actor Lovely Maitra (30), who was the party’s youngest face in the legislative assembly this year. “He (Chatterjee) is like a father figure. I have always admired him. I have asked him to guide me,” said Maitra. Among MLAs across all parties, the youngest was the sole winner from Sanyukta Morcha, Naushad Siddiqui (28), who represented Rashtriya Secular Majlis Party from Bhangar. Also in the team will be four-time MLA from Kasba, Javed Ahmed Khan, who also happened to be the richest MLA, according to the affidavit, which mentioned property and assets worth Rs 30 crore. “I pay for 10 civic staff members who go around and solve any problem related to drainage or other municipal work, particularly in Ward 66. They receive their salary from my personal fund for 10 years,” Khan said. He added even in Ward 108, home to 40,000 voters, filtered water was distributed by a local NGO as surface water was inadequate. “I have been paying for the filtered water for two years,” he said. The team also has Chandana Barui, a Madhyamik-pass young homemaker from Saltora in Bankura who lives in a mud hut without electricity. She has three children and a husband who works as a daily wage labourer. “That’s the blessing of democracy that blurs the barrier of caste, gender and class. I will raise my voice at the assembly and strive to work for the betterment of my village and the entire constituency,” said Barui, who has won on a BJP ticket. The assembly will also see the likes of Subrata Mukherjee, who will take oath as an MLA for the 10th time. “In my long tenure, this was the toughest election,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-faces-old-warhorses-to-take-oath/articleshow/82388017.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Ahmedabad||‘Ensure civic bodies heed state policies’||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday pulled up the state government for not being able to rein in municipal corporations and allowing them to follow policies contrary to the state’s. The observation related to hospitalization through 108 EMRI ambulances and the entry into the state upon furnishing negative RT-PCR reports. Chief Justice Vikram Nath said, “The state has to take care that none of the corporations do their manmaani (act on their whims and fancies).” The Chief Justice added: “We will not tolerate it. Corporations have to act in accordance with the state policy and we want confirmation in this regard from the state. They cannot act on their own.” The AMC defended its policy of hospitalization of Covid-19 patients only through 108 ambulances, saying it was for admission on government quota beds for free treatment and not for other beds in private hospitals. The system was meant for the needy and there was a rationale behind it, the AMC submitted. The high court asked the state what it had to say in this regard. The government law officer ducked the question, which led the CJ to comment, “All right if you don’t want to answer that question. You have accepted the state has failed in its supervision of (municipal) corporation.” The CJ added: “It is working as an undisciplined child. It is independent, but it is under the state supervision only.” The CJ went on to say: “A corporation is an executing body on behalf of the state, which has a policy in place and the corporation does not want to follow the policy. That is why we wanted answers from both (the corporation and the government).” The AMC counsel objected to the comment of ‘undisciplined child’ and replied, “We are working in tandem. The analogy of a mischievous child is not proper.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ensure-civic-bodies-heed-state-policies/articleshow/82394255.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Poor to get free treatment for Covid-19: CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan||BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that poor in the state will get complete Covid-19 treatment free of cost. He was reviewing the Covid situation with the core group through video conferencing on Tuesday. He also directed that the treatment in private hospitals across the state should be offered at the cost capped by the state government. If there is violation and overcharging by hospitals strict action should be taken against them, he said. The chief minister also directed to ensure that prices of ambulances in the state are uniform fixed per km basis. He directed the ministers incharge of various districts to ensure that they visit and review arrangements at Covid Care Centres in rural areas. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has said that the time for the final strike on the corona has come. For conducting the Kill Corona campaign, the government team as well as the team of villagers should be formed at the village level, who should support the government staff in the survey work. Also, after the survey, this team will cooperate in following the corona guideline if needed in future while staying in the village. The mobile numbers of the team members should also be displayed on the portal, so that there is constant contact with them. Chief Minister Shri Chouhan was discussing about the Kill Corona campaign by video conference from the Chief Minister's residence on Tuesday. Chouhan said that this is the right time to completely eradicate and control the infection through Kill Corona campaign. This is to ensure that not a single infected person remains hidden. The state of infection is constantly improving in the state as with the decrease in the number of positive cases the number of healthy people is also increasing continuously. He said that efforts would have to be made by strategizing to completely eradicate corona infection. Work will have to be carried out for the survey of each village and house under the Kill Corona campaign. Along with the government staff, a team of local people of each village should be formed. It should include interested workers, panchayat officials, members of Jan Abhiyan Parishad and social workers of all villages. This team should cooperate, coordinate with the government staff to identify patients with corona symptoms, give them medical kits and get them checked. Chief minister said that in addition to sub-health centres in large villages, fever clinics should also be set up. He said that the village level teams should be formed for continuous monitoring of infection, so that even after the survey, if any person gets signs of infection, then the teams should cooperate in getting him examined, giving medical kits, making arrangements for home isolation, making transport arrangements for shifting to Covid Care Center and hospital as per requirement. Similarly, ward wise committees can be formed in municipal and municipality corporation areas. Chouhan stated the need for extensive public awareness in connection with Kill Corona campaign. He said that along with the use of various mediums of mass communication, arrangements for mobile announcements should be made in the municipality, municipal corporation areas. Corona Help Centres should be set up. Public awareness should be made in connection with the campaign through beat of drums in rural areas. He said that the protocol of home isolation should be followed effectively. In the absence of proper arrangements at home, the infected person should be taken to quarantine centres or Covid Care Centre with the consent of the villagers. Arrangements for basic facilities, food etc. should be made at the centre. Funds should also be arranged for this. He said that in the same way, at the district and janpad level, a team should be formed under the leadership of the chief executive officer, which should include MPs, MLAs, public representatives, besides social workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/poor-to-get-free-treatment-for-covid-19-chouhan/articleshow/82396150.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana high court tells Centre to save lives as Haryana fears oxygen shortage deaths||CHANDIGARH: Considering the severe shortage of oxygen in Haryana, the Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday directed the central government to take necessary steps at the earliest to save lives. “Needless to observe that this court expects that necessary steps are taken at the earliest to ensure there is no further loss of life due to paucity of oxygen in the state. In case of crisis, the state is at liberty to draw from the ‘buffer stock’ of oxygen created under Supreme Court (SC) orders dated April 30 passed on the issue,” ordered a division bench comprising Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh. The HC passed these orders after senior advocate Rupinder Singh Khosla, who has been assisting the HC as amicus curiae, and Ankur Mittal, additional advocate general, Haryana, apprised the court about the oxygen crisis in Haryana. Khosla pointed out that a very serious situation has arisen in Haryana as its quota of oxygen has been reduced by 20 metric tonnes (MT) from the Panipat plant. Besides, the plant has overheated and is, thus, not functioning at 100% capacity. The allocation of 70 MT from the Rourkela plant in Odisha takes around four days to reach Haryana. Mittal submitted that the situation is so critical that several lives may be lost in the state in the next 24 hours in case of non-supply of oxygen. It was also asserted by Haryana that in case it is allowed to get oxygen from even one plant, situated at Panipat, which is geographically well located and can cater to needs of all districts, it shall be able to meet its demand. The high court also asked the states of Punjab and Haryana to make efforts to supply oxygen to patients on oxygen support at home, as such arrangements would reduce the pressure of Covid-19 patients on hospitals. The HC asked both the states to do so after Chandigarh informed the court about its plan to do so in the Union Territory. “In case proper oxygen supply is available to those patients who are on oxygen support at home, it would reduce the pressure on the administration as well as on the government and private hospitals. We also believe that advisories have also been issued by various health departments to patients to stay at home if their condition is mild to moderate. In such circumstances, even home delivery of oxygen cylinders can be considered by the state preferably by municipal authorities as health personnel are already overburdened…. Apart from providing succor to the inflicted public, it shall prevent hoarding of oxygen,” observed the HC. The counsel representing the Punjab government, like Haryana expressed the same difficulty with regard to procurement of oxygen from Odisha. According to him, they have been allotted quota from a plant in Rourkela which is not easy to transport to Punjab. Vehicles, coming by road, take a number of days to reach the state. The Punjab government’s counsel said that the state should be allotted oxygen from plants situated nearby. Before the court rose for the day, Satya Pal Jain, additional solicitor general, submitted that the issue as highlighted has been brought to the notice of the authorities concerned at the Centre. “The matter was being seriously examined. A decision was likely to be taken either by today evening or tomorrow,” Jain told the HC. The case would next come up for hearing on May 7. Explore possibility to use case property, states toldDuring the hearing of the matter, the HC was informed that certain seized medicines and oxygen cylinders may have been retained as case property, and the same need to be released. These medicines and oxygen cylinders were seized by the police from hoarders or those involved in black-marketing of these items. On this, the HC directed Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh, to ascertain whether such a situation is existing in the two states and the UT, if so, provisions of law under which same can be released. More ventilators sought for regionBoth Haryana and Punjab and UT of Chandigarh apprised the high court that they have requested the central government for the supply of more ventilators. On this, Jain, who is representing the Union government, assured the bench that he would examine the matter at the earliest. HC seeks info on unused ventilatorsAt the time of the hearing, the HC was informed that certain ventilators are lying unused at institutes of medical sciences, Mohali, Barnala, and other places in Punjab. It was requested that all such ventilators need to be put in use immediately in the wake of the surge in Covid-19 cases. On this, the counsel for Punjab submitted that instructions have already been issued. The bench asked both Punjab and Haryana to inform the court about such unused equipment on the next date of hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/as-hry-fears-deaths-over-o2-paucity-hc-tells-centre-to-save-lives/articleshow/82395240.cms||Ajay Sura

He had little hope of getting his money back, but a friend asked him to call the 155260 helpline and report it. Prakash did, and to his surprise, within hours the siphoned money was tracked and the account frozen. Ramandeep Singh had a similar experience when he paid Rs 74,380 on May 3 to some people who promised him oxygen concentrators. The money transferred to the crooks account was blocked the same day on which he lodged a complaint. “The response was amazing and the process was very easy. I give full marks for this service,” Singh said. With a sharp increase in cons related to Covid-related procurements, the citizen financial fraud portal (helpline 155260) is proving a blessing. Delhi Police commissioner S N Shrivastava urged people to use this service in case they were duped. The process of reporting a crime is remarkably easy — dial the number and provide minimum details of the fraudulent transaction. “A token is generated and the beneficiary bank, wallet or merchant is alerted to trace and stop the defrauded amount,” explained Shrivastava. “With a digital alert sounded, it stops the flow of the defrauded money. In case the funds are shifted to another financial intermediary, the process continues repeating till the amount is put on hold.” The victim is notified by way of an SMS containing the reference number of the complaint and a link to www.cybercrime.gov.in, the website on which a formal and detailed complaint is required to be lodged by the victim within 24 hours. Appropriate police proceedings follow to retrieve the money and to trace the fraudster. If no formal complaint is received within 24 hours, the money so stopped is released by the intermediary bank to travel as per the beneficiary’s instructions. Sources said Union home minister Amit Shah was keen on such a mechanism. Shrivastava said, “This initiative, under the aegis of the Union home ministry, helps in real-time incident reporting, transmission, escalation, estoppels and resolution with the singular objective to prevent the defrauded money from exiting the financial ecosystem and ending up in the hands of the fraudster either in cash or as goods purchased over e-commercial sites.” The initiative has been hailed because of the time factor of the redress. The chances of tracking the siphoned money and stopping its travel is the highest in the first few hours. In the normal course, with victims having to lodge complaints or visit police stations, precious time is lost. Delhi Police has increased the call-taking capacity of the helpline and plans to scale it up to cater to the growing demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-cybercrooks-target-the-desperate-in-time-of-crisis-police-portal-to-the-rescue/articleshow/82417316.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Chennai||Head constable, 55, dies of Covid-19||Chennai: An armed reserve head constable died of Covid-19 in the wee hours of Tuesday, taking the death toll among the Chennai police to eight during the second wave of the virus spread. The deceased, S Kamalanathan, 55, of the Puzhal police, joined the department in 1999 as a constable. He was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital on April 25 after he tested positive for Covid-19. However, his condition worsened and he died without responding to treatment around 1.30 am on Tuesday. He had been working as a driver for Jaffer Sait, a retired director general of police (DGP), said an officer. In 2020, during the first phase of the pandemic, at least 10 personnel among the city police died of Covid-19. At least 11,500 police personnel were infected last year. In the second phase, at least 4,200 police personnel were infected. While 3,700 personnel were discharged from the various hospitals, 500 others remain at the various Covid centres and government hospitals in the city. The city police organised an exclusive Covid care centre at Anna University in Guindy by modifying a hostel block on the campus. The Covid care centre has an 800-bed facility to accommodate police personnel infected with the virus. Earlier in 2020, the city police had organised a similar centre for police and frontline warriors on the IIT Madras campus, modifying the Mahanadhi hostel block and providing accommodation for about 1,500 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/head-constable-55-dies-of-covid-19/articleshow/82394265.cms||---

This is the highest GST collection in the state in a single month since the GST regime began in 2017.  The April 2021 collections were a steep 380% higher than April 2020 when the country was in lockdown. The collections were also 29% more than March this year.  Officials say typically GST receipts in April are the highest in the year since they reflect transactions made in March, which is the end of the financial year. “The impact of the lockdown-style curbs in Maharashtra will actually be seen in the May GST collections,” said a senior official. “Since March is the last month of the financial year, companies undertake stock clearance and this usually reflects in higher GST revenues in April,” said a senior officer.  In April 2018, the GST receipt was Rs 16,727 crore, while in April 2019, it was Rs 18,123 crore. “In that sense, the record-breaking receipts for April 2021 was on expected lines. GST collection for April has been growing by Rs 2,000 crore each year. Last year was an anomaly because of the national lockdown,” the officer said.  GST is the main revenue earner for the state government. Maharashtra’s GST collections are the highest in the country. Since GST is a consumption-based tax, it reflects purchasing power in the economy. GST includes SGST, CGST, IGST and cess.  Maharashtra had ended pandemic-struck 2020-21 which saw a national lockdown, with GST collections that were 11% lower than 2019. Data showed that the state collected Rs1.6 lakh crore worth of GST in 2020-21 compared to Rs1.8 lakh crore in 2019-20. The receipts had dipped by Rs 20,609 crore. GST collections were the lowest in April and May 2020 during the peak of the national lockdown owing to the lack of economic activity. The main recovery came with the onset of the festive season in October 2020.  When the state budget was tabled on March 8, the target for SGST collections had been revised. Though the target for 2020-21 had been set at Rs 1 lakh crore, the state had collected Rs 88,000 crore. The budget documents said, “The tax collections are not showing the expected buoyancy due to the pandemic and non-receipt of compensation cess from the Central government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-states-gst-collection-hits-record-high-of-rs-22k-cr-in-apr/articleshow/82402235.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Situation is terrifying in rural areas because there is dearth of health facilities, shortage of doctors, lack of awareness and resources,” he said. “Because of lack of testing in rural areas, the infection is spreading,” Nath said. “Like urban areas, there are far too many bodies waiting for last rites at the crematoria and burial grounds in villages,” he said. Nath said that the real picture in rural areas is not getting out due to lack of connectivity. “But to hide its incompetence, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government is continuously suppressing the actual Corona death statistics,” Nath said. “The people of the state are seeing the real number of deaths in the crematoria every day. Instead of hiding the figures, the government should reveal the actual numbers to effectively fight against the spread of the virus,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/covid-scene-terrifying-in-rural-areas-says-nath/articleshow/82396153.cms||---

Miscreants were intercepting cylinders at refilling plants, hoarding and then selling these at inflated prices. The Kumaon division of Uttarakhand STF on Tuesday nabbed a black marketer from Kichha town on US Nagar and seized 55 oxygen cylinders, including 19 empty ones. “We sent one of our personnel to the shop, who pretended to get an oxygen cylinder for an ailing family member. The accused said he charges Rs 4,000 per cylinder,” said superintendent of police (STF) Ajay Singh. Zafar Ali, the accused, used to work in gas welding before he took to oxygen black marketing. A team led by sub-inspector KG Mathwal and eight constables arrested the accused. Shivam Doniyal, a resident of GMS road, said “When looking for oxygen cylinders for my father, I came across several contact numbers online. When called these numbers would ask me to meet at a certain location without revealing much detail. Thankfully, I managed to get a cylinder on a friend’s reference and blocked the other numbers.” Dehradun police also arrested six persons allegedly involved in refilling oxygen cylinders illegally in Patel Nagar area on Monday night. Police said the accused, including the employee of a hospital, had stolen oxygen cylinders meant to be supplied to hospitals. Police had received a tip off about some people refilling cylinders near a park in Niranjanpur. The cylinders were later returned to hospitals. Dehradun district magistrate Ashish Srivastava, along with sub-divisional magistrates, have been making rounds of different areas, warning medical suppliers and shop owners against black marketing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/black-marketing-of-oxygen-cylinders-on-the-rise-in-hills/articleshow/82393485.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Huge turnout for vax on Day 2 for 18+, drive largely a smooth affair||NEW DELHI: Praveen Chopra, a scientist, and his wife Sarita Chopra, a dentist, had chosen the slot for vaccination at the government co-ed secondary school in Jangpura on Tuesday. The Chopras were among the many couples at the vaccination centre. As things started to settle down at the vaccination centres on the second day of the 18+ vaccination drive, there was a huge crowd of people who arrived at regular intervals to get vaccinated. At the Jangpura school, many had complained of a delay on Monday. Things, however, had become much smoother at the centre a day after. TimesViewVaccination is key to controlling the spread of coronavirus. But the process of getting vaccinated cannot be a casual affair. Authorities should ensure that everyone queuing up for the jab is properly masked and maintains social distance.Bikas Kumar, a teacher who was managing the drive at the school, said, “Till about 1 pm today, over 400 people have been vaccinated. Yesterday, we had vaccinated over 600 people despite the delay.” Kumar pointed out that the vaccination drive had started late on Monday and hence, there was a long queue. “Today, we started on time and are making sure that there is social distancing in place,” he asserted. Gulshan Tomar, a civil defence officer deployed at the centre, said that people were less anxious on Day 2. “They are waiting for their turn with patience,” he added. At the centre, IT professionals Ankur Sharma and his wife Preeti Pathak were accompanied by Sharma’s younger brother Ankit, a civil engineer. “We had booked it fast and we specifically chose this centre as this was the closest from our home.” The family felt that it was good that the vaccination drive was taking place in a government school as it had a lot of space.“We also chose this centre as they were administering Covaxin, which is apparently better to deal with the mutant variant,” said Ankit. Many at the Lajpat Nagar vaccination centre were, however, not so happy with the setup. “I did expect a crowd but not this much waiting time,” said Manvi Jayant, a designer from Jorbagh, who was waiting for her turn with a token number. Dagar family members Prateek, Manvi and Ashish had arrived at 11 am, but got the jab only at 2 pm. “They’re not maintaining the queue well and there is no protocol being followed here. Social distancing has gone for a toss,” the family complained. “They could have used more rooms. This is a big school and there are enough classrooms to be turned into vaccination rooms,” the Dagars suggested. Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, Chirag Dilli, however, wore a deserted look around 2.30 pm. Ranjit Singh, the vaccination centre in-charge, stated that many people had come early in the morning, some as early as 6 am. Among the few people trickling at the centre were brothers Sagar and Ayush Gupta who said that “it took us only 20 minutes to get inoculated. The whole process was smooth.” “We hope that when we come for our second dose, we experience a similar situation,” the brothers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/huge-turnout-for-vax-on-day-2-for-18-drive-largely-a-smooth-affair/articleshow/82395328.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

As part of this, IRDAI has asked insurance companies to set up MIVs in 500 villages across the country in the first year and gradually scale this up to 1,000 villages in the subsequent two years. In these model villages, insurance companies will have to work towards covering the entire populations and their properties, farms, machineries, vehicles and different village-level services, among others. The idea of this initiative is not only to boost insurance penetration but also ensure that people in the rural areas start understanding the concept of insurance and its benefits. “The efforts in selected villages need to be continued for a minimum period of three to five years so as to make the insurance benefits visible to the community,” IRDAI said in a paper issued on Monday. IRDAI has stated that insurance companies need to study the risk profile of villages, their insurance needs and design their products accordingly. Besides, they will also have to engage insure-tech as well as fin-tech firms for support in product design and implementation of the concept using technology at all the levels of insurance processes from marketing, servicing, loss assessment to claims settlement. IRDAI has suggested that to make the premium affordable, financial support from governments as well as institutions such as NABARD and CSR funds must be explored. Insurance companies have been advised to tap various initiatives of the rural development ministry as well as network of SHG members and bank correspondent Sakhis (BC Sakhis) for insurance product distribution and servicing. “At present 11,189 BC Sakhis are present in 11,552 villages of 330 districts of 18 different states,” it added. Insurance companies have been told to explore tie-ups with different farm input suppliers, financial institutions, rural services providers to target distribution of small ticket, short duration or tailored products. Besides, the insurance watchdog has stated that as bank assurance has proved to be more acceptable than any other traditional intermediary, banks in rural areas can be used for selling rural and agriculture insurance products. It has also asked senior officials of insurers, preferably CEO or CMDs, to periodically monitor and review the progress of implementation of the MIV initiative in their respective selected villages. The regulator has sought comments from the stakeholders by May 17, 2021. GFX: WHAT CAN INSURERS OFFER IN MIV? -- Weather index products or hybrid products combining weather index and indemnity-based insurance protection for various crops that remain uncovered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) -- Flexible farm insurance package policies targeting comprehensive needs of crops, livestock, farmer, farm implements -- Separate products for high value agriculture, contract farming and corporate farming community as their needs are different -- Even states can be offered macro insurance covers based on pre-defined parametric weather indexes covering large complex risks arising out of natural catastrophes affecting the agriculture ecosystem and rural economy.

The civic bodies are also planning to approach the LG in this regard. Mayors of North and East Delhi Municipal Corporations said that some centres were receiving less than 70 people daily, resulting in wastage of infrastructure and resources. “Since these centres have stock of vaccines for at least one week, they can be allowed to give slots to certain number of people above 18 years every day,” said North Corporation mayor Jai Prakash. “We wrote to the chief minister that there is low turnout at certain polyclinics due to the lockdown. Our existing infrastructure can be used to reduce the rush at newly created centres. Crowding at vaccination centres may further spread Covid,” he explained. The civic body claimed to have so far vaccinated more than 2 lakh beneficiaries at its health centres. South Delhi Municipal Corporation leader of house Narendra Chawla said that the Delhi government had closed five of their vaccination centres where people above 45 years were getting inoculated. “The Delhi government has closed vaccination centres in West Zone’s Raghubir Nagar, Subhash Nagar, Madipur, Tagore Garden and Bindapur. When the entire Delhi is suffering and vaccination is the only remedy, the government is playing politics by closing vaccination centres,” he alleged. SDMC education committee chairman Mukesh Suryan said that they were ready to offer their infrastructure and services during this crucial time. “We run minimum 2-3 schools in every ward and if vaccination centres are opened in each ward, people will get vaccination facilities closer to their home. We have written to the Delhi government, but are yet to get any reply,” he said further. Delhi government officials had on Monday said that the vaccination for 18+ had just started and hence, the number of centres was limited. In future, more centres will be included, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/allow-drive-for-18-at-corpn-sites/articleshow/82395375.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Cases in the state reported a slight increase from Monday but were still under 52,000. However, fatalities in the state rose to 891 -- a 57% jump from 567 on Monday. The state’s daily case fatality rate touched 1.7%, higher than the last few days. With this, the state’s caseload touched 48.2 lakh and the total toll rose to 71,742. Even as cases in 12 districts were reporting a decline, daily detections were on the rise across the other 24. To control spread of infection, a few districts have announced a local lockdown. The Kolhapur administration has decided to impose a strict lockdown from Wednesday for 10 days during which only milk and medicine supply will continue every day. Other essential shops will remain shut. The Baramati tehsil administration has decided to impose a ‘strict lockdown’ in the town and 94 villages from May 5 till May 11. Amid rising cases and deaths, Sangli guardian minister Jayant Patil announced a complete lockdown in the district for 8 days starting midnight of May 5. Meanwhile, from the pandemic’s highest single-day tally of 11,206 on April 4, the city on Tuesday was less than a fourth at 2,554 cases. While daily toll has been worrying, with the highest in the second wave registered on May 1 (90), the figure has been dropping for 3 days – 79 (Sunday), 78 (Monday) and 62 on Tuesday. Officials said tests have dipped in the last few days. But daily toll may take a few days to decline. Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the death audit committee on Covid-19, said the situation in the city has been stabilising for 15 days. “Deaths may remain high for another few days until demand for ICU beds doesn’t drop sharply.” In another indicator of dropping infection rates, active cases in the city dropped to 56,465 from almost 90,000 a fortnight ago. “The number of people out on streets has dropped, malls and restaurants are closed. The effect of restraints are apparent,” said a civic officer. In the most positive development, BMC chief I S Chahal said, “Our city has 7,409 Covid-19 beds vacant today, including 100 ICUs at 6:13 pm.” From mid-April when there were less than 10 vacant ICU beds, the BMC dashboard on Tuesday morning showed 56 vacant ICU beds in the private sector and 42 in the public sector (2 more were added later). In BMC-run KEM Hospital in Parel, daily admissions dropped to 15 as against daily average admissions of 52 in April. KEM dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said there are 255 patients admitted right now. “Totally, we have 478 beds for Covid-19 patients,” he said. Daily deaths too have dropped from 6 a day to 2 on Monday. Health minister Rajesh Tope said the state’s positivity rate has declined from 27% to 22% in 10 days and rate of recovery is on the rise. Daily discharges were way higher than detections (65,934).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-wave-plateauing-in-city-but-strict-lockdowns-in-3-districts/articleshow/82394288.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Allahabad||Plans for O2 pipeline in two hospitals of Prayagraj||Prayagraj: At a time when a large number of Covid patients have been struggling to find oxygen cylinders in different hospitals of the city, including both government and private hospitals, authorities of Swaroop Rani Nehru (SRN) and Tej Bahadur Sapru hospital, also called as Beli hospital, promise a better future. The administration has decided that patients of these two hospitals would be provided with life-saving oxygen, not through the present system but oxygen pipelines. It has been decided to install the network of pipelines using which the oxygen would be provided to the patients at their bedside itself. Ward number 4, 15 and 16 at SRN and 112 beds at Beli hospital would be provided with an oxygen pipeline. At SRN, the work would be done for Rs 13 lakhs while at Beli, the oxygen gas pipeline would be installed for Rs 41.5 lakh. PWD has invited online tenders for these works till May 6. “The tenders have been floated and we hope that once the tender is allotted to the selected agency, the work of laying the pipeline will be completed within a week”, said chief medical superintendent of Beli hospital, Dr Kiran Malik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/plans-for-o2-pipeline-in-two-hospitals-of-prayagraj/articleshow/82395335.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Tollywood debates how to bridge political divide, handle backlash||Kolkata: Trinamool’s victory in the assembly elections seems to have had its effect on professional and personal equations in Tollywood. While some so-called apolitical artistes have started warming up to Trinamool, some Trinamool celeb supporters, who had distanced themselves from all things political before the elections, are now back to praising the newly elected party and its governance ability. Before elections, various artistes had made their allegiance towards parties of their choice obvious—some contested the elections and some were vocal about their views—but Barrackpore’s newly elected Trinamool MLA Raj Chakrabarty ruled out any possibility of them being targeted for their different political opinions. Rudranil Ghosh, Srabanti Chatterjee, Paayel Sarkar, Tanusree Chakraborty, Parno Mittra, Yash Dasgupta and Papiya Adhikari had contested on BJP tickets, while Debdut Ghosh was a Left candidate. Kamaleswar Mukherjee and Sreelekha Mitra supported the Left. “They can always have a different ideology and still work peacefully. I love Rudranil a lot. He will continue to be my friend,” he said. Srabanti has been cast with Trinamool MP Dev in Leena Gangopadhyay and Saibal Banerjee’s ‘Khelaghar’. Some still fear certain privileges and services might be restricted for some. Actor-turned-BJP leader Rupa Bhattacharjee is apparently used to hearing it is difficult to cast her for her political allegiance. Rupa is not “scared of the backlash”. “I want to see if the new government finds out why so many of us joined BJP. I would be happy to see a reformed Trinamool running the show. I want to see a government that honours the space for artistes, irrespective of their political colour.” Promising not to change, she said, “But I wonder what will happen to those who joined the party and lost. Only time will tell how they will handle the backlash.” During his campaign, Rudranil’s “mafiaraj” comment against Swarup Biswas, president of the Federation of Cine Technicians & Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI), had created a controversy. “I have been working for my technicians. I have organized free vaccines for 2,500 of them. I will start the process of health insurance for technicians and organize tests for them. Detractors can say what they want. God bless them,” Swarup said. Insiders claimed not everyone might be beneficiary of FCTWEI’s kindness. “Let them start a project. The non-cooperation will then begin,” said an insider. Rudranil insisted he had not been “against technicians”. “I spoke against a wrong and don’t regret my words. The party knows where correction is needed,” he said. Talks are on about BJP celebs, including Rudranil, changing political colour again. “I quit Left in 2009. In 2014, I was invited to support a party and I did that without being a TMC member. Seeing the corruption, I moved out. In 2021, I joined BJP. What can I do if not compromising with wrong gets me a chameleon label?” Rudranil said. Actor Rwitobroto Mukherjee, who had co-directed the viral video of ‘Nijeder motey nijeder gaan’ against fascist forces, ruled out friendship with anyone from BJP. “I can’t forgive BJP’s utter mismanagement of the Covid crisis. People are dying. A celebrity can have an ideology but I can’t be friends with those not critical of this state-sponsored murder,” he said. Will Rudranil want to extend an olive leaf? Recently, he liked Parambrata Chatterjee’s insta post on the death anniversary of the latter’s mother. “I want our friendship to remain. But if people don’t want to be friends with me, it is their problem, not mine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tollywood-debates-how-to-bridge-political-divide-handle-backlash/articleshow/82388107.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Allahabad||Sangam dons sombre look amid heavy rush of people coming to immerse ashes||Prayagraj: In a sharp contrast to the scene over a month ago when pilgrims from across the country used to arrive at Sangam to take holy dip in the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna, there is a rush of people coming to cremate bodies or immerse ashes of their loved ones who have died amid the deadly second Covid wave.Since a fortnight, queues of bodies are seen everyday at cremation ghats of Prayagraj. A priest at Sangam said, prior to the pandemic, around 100 people used to visit Sangam everyday to immerse ashes of their kin, but since the last month, 300-400 people are coming every dayDuring weekend lockdown, around 300 people arrived at Sangam for immersing ashes, while on week days, the number goes up to 400.Apart from those from Uttar Pradesh, many people from Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi and other states are also arriving at Sangam for the same purpose.Ram Singh, who came from Shahjahanpur with an urn filled with ashes of his 110-year-old father Hajari, said, “It was difficult to reach here due to the pandemic. But I would not have forgiven myself if I didn’t immerse my father’s ashes in Sangam. Now, my father’s soul will rest in peace.”“The scene at Sangam has changed completely. Previously, one could witness crowds taking holy dip, but now we only see people arriving here to immerse ashes of the dead. It is heartbreaking. Let’s pray to the Almighty for the safety of our people,” said Kadedeen Yadav, in charge of Jal Police, Sangam.Abhishek, a local priest said, “Earlier, about 100 people used to visit Sangam everyday for immersing ashes. Now, 300-400 people can be seen. When my clients ask over the phone about when to come here for immersion, I suggest them to wait until the number of Covid-19 cases decline significantly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/sangam-dons-sombre-look-amid-heavy-rush-of-people-coming-to-immerse-ashes/articleshow/82395373.cms||---

The panel led by Mahavikas Aghadi leaders — guardian minister Satej Patil, ministers Hasan Mushrif, Rajendra Patil-Yadravkar and Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Mandlik — was leading comfortably on 17 of the total 21 seats at the end of seventh round of counting of votes. The counting of main one round and a mini round of less votes was remaining at the time of going to print. Earlier in the day, counting of votes cast for reserved category candidates total five in number were counted. MVA panel won four reserved seats. Bharatiya Janata Party backed Mahadik-Patil-Narke led panel won one seat that of Shoumika Mahadik, Bharatiya Janata Party’s district president of Mahila Morcha. She is the daughter-in-law of Mahadevrao Mahadik, who fielded one of his family members for the first time in the last 25 years. Former MLA Sujit Minchekar of MVA led panel won comfortably. Also, Navid Mushrif, son of minister Mushrif, was leading with comfortable votes. However, sitting MP Sanjay Mandlik is expected to get a shocker as his son Virendra was trailing behind other candidates. The voters for the election are the representatives sent by small cooperative dairies located at village and tehsil levels. They collect milk from farmers and supply to Gokul dairy. There are around 4,359 voters out of which 4,349 had cast their vote on Sunday. The Gokul gets milk from almost every village of the district, processes it and supply packaged milk to cities such as Mumbai and Pune. It the largest milk cooperative in the state. Over 5 lakh litres of milk is supplied only to Mumbai. The dairy has annual turnover of over Rs 2,300 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mva-backed-panel-leads-in-17-seats-in-gokul-dairy-poll/articleshow/82392751.cms||---

Farmers asserted that they would not stop protests in Punjab or at the borders of Delhi. Assembly of farmers in protests continued unabated on Tuesday, the second day of restrictions in Punjab. A large number of farmers, including women, assembled at protest sites outside Barnala railway station, toll plazas at Mehal Kalan on Barnala-Ludhiana road, at Badbar on Barnala-Sangrur stretch of national highway, at Lehra Bega village toll plaza situated on Bathinda-Chandigarh national highway and nearly 100 more points across the state. In Barnala, protesting farmers even assured support to shopkeepers dealing in non-essential items. Protesters have also purchased 15 new air coolers, which have been installed at the protest site at Barnala railway station. However, protesting farmers have agreed to follow Covid guidelines and urge people to get vaccinated and wear masks, maintain social distancing wherever possible and drink kaadha. Despite these assertions, there are differences among farm groups about increasing the intensity of protests when the country is passing through tough times on the Covid front. In the absence of unanimity on this, farmers have disregarded the appeals of the Punjab and Haryana governments to downsize at protest sites and are calling on farmers to start returning to Delhi borders after they are done with wheat harvesting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-let-up-in-farmers-protest/articleshow/82394285.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Chennai||No fresh cases spike in three zones||Chennai: The number of fresh Covid cases in three zones in the city has remained near constant for the past week, according to corporation health experts. “We are not sure of the reason, but there is no steep increase like last month,” said a zonal health officer. The three zones are Kodambakkam, Teynampet and Adyar. They have been reporting 450-550 fresh cases daily in comparison to 300-odd this time last year. But that number has not risen in the past week. While the civic body doesn't not publish zone-wise numbers of fresh cases, they update the active cases every day. The city added about 10,000 active cases in April but the numbers have not risen steeply since. On April 16, the city’s active cases numbered 22,420 and by April 26, they rose to 31,142. But since then, it has remained around that number. Only on May 3, was there a slight increase to 32,785. “In fact, at zonal level, we maintain graphs on fresh cases and share them with senior officials. We have been collecting more swabs and have begun testing more than 28,000 every day. The test positivity rate is around 20-21%,” said an epidemiologist. “It is difficult to say whether this will lead to a dip as we are not aware of the peak yet. But with restrictions in place, there will be certain stability. However, we are yet to hit the peak,” the epidemiologist added.Senior corporation officials who didn’t want to be named said it was too early to come to any conclusion. “We have ramped up many measures ensuring that patients get tele-consultation and video consultation, which ensures they do not end up in clinics and hospitals increasing rate of transmission. In April. as there was a panic, people rushed to clinics and hospitals. Now, panic is less. People are ensuring they stay home and follow the covid protocols. All that has helped us,” said the official. The incidence of symptomatic patients at fever clinics continues to be around 10%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-fresh-cases-spike-in-three-zones/articleshow/82394291.cms||---

Sheth admitted to the police that he had asked Garasiya to get the injections for him. Cops are questioning the duo about the source of the injections. “We suspect that Garasiya must have got injection from the quota of the hospital where he works,” said a police official. The two accused were booked under the Essential Commodities Act and Disaster Management Act. Police said that the injections cannot be possessed or sold without a proper license and neither of them had any of it. The injections, currently, are being directly supplied to the private hospitals based on their requirements through proper government channels.

Ironically, in this prevailing grim situation, not a single Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or ventilator is functional in the district. Even RT-PCR test facility has not started due to lack of diagnostic kits and samples are sent to Gaya for tests. Only truenat and rapid antigen tests are being conducted in the district. District magistrate Saurabh Jorwal told this newspaper on Tuesday that a machine has been made available for starting RT-PCR test in the district and infrastructure is also ready, but the bio-box required for it is not yet available. Due to this, RT-PCR testing has not started in the district. On being asked about lack of functional ICU in the district, the DM said, “All efforts have been made by the administration for commissioning of an ICU at Aurangabad sadar hospital and all preparations have been done. Treatment can start there any time now. We have also written to the health department to provide technical staff for commissioning ventilators.” The DM also said that the district administration has sufficient oxygen cylinders. “There is no shortage of oxygen in the district but it is not possible to give oxygen cylinders to those who are in home isolation,” he said. He added: “There may be shortage of oxygen flow meters. However, National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) officials here have assured us to provide a stock of flow meters. A letter has been written for the same to the health department also.” The DM also said that Remedesivir injection has also been made available to the district administration. Elaborating on the overall preparations to fight against Covid in Aurangabad district Jorwal said that four dedicated Covid care centers with a capacity of about 200 beds have been set up in the district. “One is the PNB care center located at Aurangabad Block Colony, where 40 beds have been prepared with all facilities. Apart from this, 50 beds have been made at Daudnagar, 25 beds at Siris and 50 beds at Yadav College are ready. Covid patients are not being treated at sadar hospital,” Jorwal said. District public relations officer (DPRO) Krishna Kumar on the other hand said, “An average of 400-500 new cases are coming up in the district every day. On Monday, 384 cases were reported, while on Friday, about 498 cases were reported. A total of 4,368 Covid active cases have been reported in the district till May 3.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aurangabad-hosp-lacks-icu-ventilator-facilities/articleshow/82392740.cms||---

---||Mumbai||BMC resumes vax drive, makes CoWin regn must for first dose||Mumbai: Growing crowds at vaccination centres has prompted the BMC to restrict proportion of walk-ins among 45-plus recipients to 20%; the remaining 80% will be done only through appointments made on Co-Win. Officials said since Mumbai will receive 1lakh doses by Tuesday night, both first and second doses will be available for now. Those seeking the first dose will need an appointment through Co-Win, while those coming for the second dose can walk in. The BMC statement said there will be separate queues for first and second dose seekers. Meanwhile, Balabhai Nanavati hospital became the third private facility to start Covid vaccination for all above 18 years on Tuesday. But it may be a while before more major private hospitals get into the drive given lack of assurances about supply. After a four-day hiatus, immunisation for the 45-plus opened in public centres on Tuesday with 20,000-odd doses borrowed from the stock meant for the 18-44 years group. Centres had serpentine queues in which 60 and 70-year-olds waited for hours. Vaccination on Wednesday will only start post noon, BMC said. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said there was enormous demand for the second dose. “We will be replenishing doses earmarked for 18-44 group from the stocks we are scheduled to receive on Tuesday night,” he said. The city could vaccinate 26,944 people from the 45-plus group with the borrowed doses. The token drive for 18-44 will continue at the five vaccination centres, strictly through appointments, Kakani said. The city had received around 20,000 doses for the younger age bracket. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the state’s stocks dropped to as low as 25,000 doses on Monday, but got replenished on Tuesday morning with 9 lakh doses. “This too will last just two days,” said Tope. He said the state which has a potential of vaccinating over 5 lakh in a day should be given vaccines as per its performance. Civic officials also said one lakh doses were too little for the drive to gain momentum. Tope added that the state has issued a purchase order to buy 13.8 lakh Covishield doses and 4.7 lakh Covaxin doses for the 18-44 group. “We had purchased 3 lakh vaccines to begin the drive for this age group from May 1 and we have administered nearly 1 lakh doses. We are looking at opportunities to buy more vaccines,” said Tope. He said the state will have a one-on-one meeting with SII CEO Adar Poonawalla once he returns from the UK. The current shortage has forced the elderly to launch a frantic search. Shubha Patel (67) went to three vaccination centres in Mumbai for her second dose of Covishield, but returned home without the shot. Patel said the BMC’s message on which centres will be operational came very late on Monday night and by the time she reached one in her ward, there was a serpentine line in front of her. "I stood in the queue in the blistering heat. There was no communication, no enquiry desk,” said Patel. Shyam Iyer (70) said his son was trying to book a slot online for him and his wife, but it was not working. "When we went for our first dose in mid-March, we had taken an online appointment in a private hospital and it went smoothly. But now, private hospitals don't have stocks for the second dose. Such crowded vaccine centres increase the risk for senior citizens,” said Iyer, who managed to get his second dose after a wait of nearly 2.5 hours at a Chembur centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-resumes-vax-drive-makes-cowin-regn-must-for-first-dose/articleshow/82396165.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Kolkata||‘Taunts like Didi, o Didi, Bermuda comment reflected in ballot box’||Kolkata: If a section of Kolkata’s women’s rights activists are to be believed, BJP partially lost its plot the day the party chief in Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, ridiculed chief minister Mamata Banerjee at a rally in Purulia and asked her to “wear a Bermuda” if she wanted to “show her leg”. Added to that were Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Didi O Didi’ chant at rallies. Women’s rights activist Anuradha Kapoor pointed out such slogans impacted voters. In March, around the time the poll campaign began in Bengal, Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat had said in Dehradun that girls wearing ripped jeans, showing their knees, were setting a “bad example”. “During the campaign, a person no less than the Prime Minister of our country ridiculed our chief minister. The state BJP president used misogynist comments against her. High profile leaders, like Yogi Adityanath, said women in the state were not safe but himself said ‘women are not capable of being left free or independent’. Such toxic masculinity was called out by women in Bengal,” she said. Social worker Piya Chakraborty, who was part of the think tank behind ‘Nijeder mote nijeder gaan’ video against fascism, also believed such a discourse had its effect on voters. “These leaders never took into account the gender factor. Women were put off. The Bermuda comment impacted the urban woman. But the tone of ‘Didi O Didi’ reflects the larger mentality of the party and how they look at women. It violated the progressive, liberal spirit of Bengal,” said Chakraborty, who claimed their video also offered perspective. Politicians have often banked on this kind of discourse with an eye at the vote bank. Kapoor pointed out that a large number of women candidates this time did not shy away from calling out those making misogynist comments. Such discourses would have to change as women voters were now aware and vocal, she said. Ghosh’s Bermuda comment apparently did not go down well within his own party. “The comment is sexist. Neither the original Bengal wing of BJP nor swayamsevaks of RSS support it. . Many within our system agree the party paid the price for passing such irresponsible comments,” said a BJP worker, in the party since 2013. On May 2, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, tweeted the election results were a “hard-hitting reply to BJP’s ‘Didi o didi’ jibe which was nothing less than an attack on a woman and her dignity”. The same day, Srivatsa YB, national campaign in-charge of Indian Youth Congress, tweeted “every time prime minister said ‘Didi o Didi’ like a roadside romeo, BJP lost five seats in Bengal”. West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairperson Ananya Chakraborti had also urged people to protest against the Bermuda comment. “I didn’t know how many seats BJP lost during that jibe. Anyone from Bengal, except for the bhakts, will not take it well. It violates all decency levels and is a direct assault on the culture of Bengal and a chief minister,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/taunts-like-didi-o-didi-bermuda-comment-reflected-in-ballot-box/articleshow/82388133.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Aurangabad||‘Rumour virus’ against vax hits Nanded village||Aurangabad: The health department in rural Nanded district is facing the daunting task of convincing the inhabitants of tribal-dominated Bamanguda Gaunkhedi village in Mahur taluka of Nanded district that the vaccine against Covid-19 is not harmful. “Villagers are claiming that upon getting vaccinated, youths are becoming impotent while elders are dying within a few days,” gram panchayat member Devendra Tobe told TOI on Tuesday. “The villagers have pledged against taking the vaccine following such rumours on social media,” he said. The village, about 350km from here, is situated in the deep tribal belt on the state border and falls under the jurisidiction of gram panchayat Sattiguda. It has a population of around 400 people. Tobe said that the village police patil, some educated people and health staff from neighbouring places have been roped in to convince the villagers but they are refusing to get inoculated. A villager Maruti Gedam said that everyone in the village believes that the spreading of the virus is a conspiracy and that vaccination is a part of it. “Everyone is scared that the vaccine will wipe out the population.” Mankubai Todsa, a woman from the village, said, “We all fear that this vaccine will cause fever and death . We have received messages on WhatsApp and also watched some videos.” The villagers are demanding a written assurance from the state government that there will neither be any side-effects nor harm to their lives. Medical officer Saroja Adhe said the village falls under Sindhkheda primary health centre. “It is a tribal belt and the residents are claiming that they will die if they get vaccinated. Their fears are the result of WhatsApp forwards they came across recently.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/rumour-virus-against-vax-hits-nanded-village/articleshow/82392767.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Role reversal: Many dash out of Delhi in search of bed, oxygen||NEW DELHI: The family of Jitender Kathpalia, 51, of Sector 11, Rohini, was frantic. His oxygen level was dipping but searches in hospitals, calls on helplines and SOS posts on social media provided no leads to a hospital bed with oxygen. With no other solution in sight, the family drove him to Chandigarh where he is recuperating. “Only VIPs and people with clout can get a bed in Delhi these days,” muttered one of Kathpalia’s relatives. With ICU beds in Delhi now all occupied and oxygen beds scarce, desperate patients are being transferred to nearby cities in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. The situation is a reversal of last year when Delhi was the hub for patients from the neighbouring states. As Surender Singh of Vasant Kunj told TOI, “Even though the bed-availability portal showed that some hospitals had a few ICU beds vacant, the ground reality was different. There was none available.” When Singh’s parents-in-law both reached precarious oxygen levels of 77-78%, the despairing family decided to no longer waste time searching for ICU beds in Delhi and arranged an ambulance to take the two to Gwalior, where relatives had made arrangements at a private hospital. “Some of us stood in a queue for five hours to get an additional oxygen cylinder that we needed for the 7-hour journey to Gwalior,” Singh added. East of Kailash resident Mukesh Kataria shifted his relative’s four-member infected family to a private hospital in Bathinda, Punjab. “The condition of two was deteriorating. There was no assurance of oxygen from any of the hospitals in NCR despite higher charges being quoted,” Kataria said. The Bathinda stay is costing the patients Rs 8-10,000 per day. “We have also rented a house for the isolation of two family members who were relatively better.” Balwinder Sareen also helped a friend’s family move to Mohali for treatment. “The couple was living in Gurgaon. When the husband’s SPO2 went down to 88-89%, we drove them in an ambulance to Mohali. The ambulance fare was just Rs14,000, while open loot is going on in Delhi-NCR for ambulances, medicines and hospitals,” alleged Sareen. Aware of patients from Delhi reaching his state, Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh said that any person seeking treatment there would not be denied. Chief secretary Vini Mahajan similarly asked the Punjab health authorities to ensure that outstation patients were treated fairly. Ludhiana and Mohali districts have seen a big influx of patients from outside the state and last week the deputy commissioners of these districts raised the issue of outsiders putting additional pressure on the existing healthcare infrastructure. Dr G B Singh, director of health services, Punjab government, said that though the health department is not maintaining data on outstation patients, around 20 individuals from Delhi and NCR are admitted in Punjab hospitals every day. “They are given admission on the basis of availability of beds,” the director said. Chandigarh is an easy choice for many frustrated Delhiites. Neena Gupta, 57, was rushed to the city from Delhi in a private car equipped with an oxygen cylinder. “For two days, I did the rounds of Delhi for a bed for my mother,” said Gupta’s son. “A friend suggested I should book a bed in a Chandigarh hospital. By the time we reached here, her oxygen supply was almost gone, but we got her admitted quickly.” Chander Thakur, who lives in Ambala district’s Naraingarh, too brought his brother from Faridabad to Chandigarh. “There was no bed available in Delhi or NCR,” he said. Confirming that patients from Delhi-NCR were recovering in Chandigarh’s hospitals, professor Jagat Ram, director, PGI, said, “We are getting patients from Delhi, mostly those who couldn’t get a bed there. However, we caution kin not to risk the travel to Chandigarh if the patient’s oxygen level is low.” Many others are opting for hospitals in Gurgaon, Sonipat, Panipat, Hisar, even Panchkula and Ambala. Haryana home and health minister Anil Vij insisted that at least 40% of the patients in Covid facilities in Haryana were from Delhi and UP. “We take a humane approach, so don’t bar patients from outside our state. Whether in private or government hospitals, you will find a substantial number of patients from Delhi and NCR cities,” said Vij. At present, Gurgaon has 2,447 Covid patients in its hospitals, of whom only 979 are Gurgaon residents. The rest include 1,027 reportedly from Delhi, 195 from UP and 246 from other states. Hospitals in UP are also being accessed. There are 40 Covid patients, including 13 women from Delhi, recovering in a private hospital in Mathura. Richa Srivastava, who lives in Dwarka in southwest Delhi, said she had to admit her husband in Nayati Hospital in Mathura after failing to find a bed in Delhi. “After testing positive, he was in home isolation when he began suffering breathlessness. But there was no bed available, so our relatives managed one in Mathura,” explained Srivastava. At least 10 Delhi residents are admitted in Anand Hospital in Meerut. According to Dr Subhash Yadav, “The patients from Delhi approached us through references either from a known person or the administration.” (Inputs from Agra, Meerut, Haryana and Punjab)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/role-reversal-many-dash-out-of-delhi-in-search-of-bed-o2/articleshow/82395419.cms||---
---||Mumbai||CAT can decide ex-CP’s challenge to probes: Bombay HC||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Tuesday expressed its prima facie opinion that a petition filed by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh to challenge the inquiries ordered against him “can be adjudicated by Central Administrative Tribunal.” The HC said it found “no urgency” in his petition and adjourned it to June 9 on a request by his lawyer Sunny Punamiya, who said both his senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi and Aabad Ponda were not present. Singh had filed a petition to challenge two orders passed by the state on April 1 and 20 for preliminary enquiry by DGP Sanjay Pandey under the service rules and an inquiry into allegations made by a police inspector against him. The state had brought in special counsel and ex-advocate general Darius Khambata to oppose Singh’s petition. Khambata raised a preliminary objection of maintainability of the petition. He also said it was “infructuous” as the DGP, Pandey, had recused himself from both inquiries. Besides, he said there was “no real urgency”, adding, “These are complaints of a service nature and his remedy lies before the CAT.” The inquiry ordered on April 1 was for suspected violation of service rules, Singh had said. The police officer Anup Dange whose complaint was to be inquired into raised a grievance that he was not even made a party. Senior counsel Navroz Seervai, appearing for Pandey, said he endorses Khambata’s submission about Singh’s plea being infructuous and not maintainable as he can approach CAT. Singh had also sought a probe by the CBI into “aspects of criminal conspiracy and malicious attempts to thwart” its preliminary inquiry into his allegations of “corrupt malpractices” against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh, as directed by the HC on April 5. ASG Anil Singh, appearing for CBI, did not really have to make any submissions. The HC said “in view of Khambata’s statement”, there was no urgency in the matter and it was adjourning the matter to beyond vacation only on Punamiya’s request so as to not put him “in trouble.” HC clarified pendency of petition would not bar Singh from approaching CAT for any relief. Singh’s plea said the state’s order on the preliminary inquiry “is ex-facie, illegal.” Singh said he had met Pandey, who he said had offered to “mediate” and requested him “to withdraw” his March 20 letter to the chief minister against Deshmukh. Singh said he had recorded the WhatsApp calls made to Pandey later and submitted its transcript to the CBI on April 19 to challenge the inquiries ordered against him. Days after his petition, Pandey recused himself from the inquiries. The preliminary inquiry order “is merely a retaliation in vendetta by Deshmukh”, said Singh’s petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cat-can-decide-ex-cps-challenge-to-probes-bombay-hc/articleshow/82394303.cms||---
---||Surat||SMIMER’s intern doctors demand AC accommodation, go on flash strike||Surat: Around 170 intern doctors at the Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER) went on flash strike on Tuesday, demanding that they should be provided air-conditioned accommodation in hotels so that they can keep a safe distance from their family members and prevent them from getting infected. The medical students have been given duties in Covid-19 hospital of SMC-run SMIMER. They were given separate accommodation in hostels of Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU), Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) and SMIMER on Monday. But they complained of poor facilities.“We have demanded AC rooms and separate bathrooms. We want to be treated in a similar way intern doctors in Ahmedabad are treated. We are not demanding accommodation in any star hotels but in any simple hotel,” said a doctor leading the strike on the condition of anonymity. “In SVNIT, 20 of us have to share one bathroom after serving in Covid ward, which is not hygienic,” he added. After Surat Municipal Corporation threatened to take stringent action against the protesting doctors, they are now in double minds over the next plan of action. “Our demands are genuine, but since the authorities are threatening us of legal action, we are deliberating over the next step,” the doctor added.Meanwhile, the SMIMER administration has called it an unlawful strike. “We provided good accommodation facilities to students yesterday with transportation, food and refreshments. But they are demanding AC rooms which is not possible in current situation,” said Dr R K Bansal, dean, SMIMER. “If the interns refuse to carry out their duties, we are constrained to take appropriate actions against them. We will take actions against the interns under The Epidemic Disease Act and The National Disaster Management Act,” Bansal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/smimers-intern-doctors-demand-ac-accommodation-go-on-flash-strike/articleshow/82392800.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Samastha organ lauds minority support to LDF||Kozhikode: In a tacit admission that minority Muslim votes could have gone in favour of LDF in many seats in assembly polls, the mouthpiece of Samastha Kerala Jem-Iyyathul Ulema –EK Sunni faction traditionally aligned to IUML –has said that if the secular society in Kerala and minorities supported LDF, then it was a sign of true, secular democracy. The thumbs-up to the support by the minorities to LDF in the editorial published by Suprabhatham daily, which also made a strident criticism against Congress leadership, explains the shift in minority votes towards LDF, especially in seats where Congress candidates were in the fray. The daily said that while Pinarayi Vijayan was repeatedly reiterating that CAA will not be implemented in state, there were many Congress leaders, notably KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran, who did not utter a word about it. Lashing out at Mullappally, the editorial said he didn’t bother to turn up at Nemom where K Muraleedharan was the candidate despite the seat being located next to KPCC head office. “How can Congress emerge victorious when there are KPCC presidents like this,” the editorial said. It alleged that a leader from north Kerala, who tries to portray himself as close to Rahul Gandhi, was able to scuttle Rahul’s interventions in many minority issues. “If secular Kerala foresaw this attitude by a section of leaders in the Congress and stood with the LDF and if they got the support of minorities, then it is true secular democracy,” the editorial said. The strident stand by Samastha will force IUML to undertake a thorough look at the electoral debacle and come up with explanations. The shift in Muslims votes towards LDF was perceptible in constituencies where non-IUML candidates were in the fray. Also it is suspected that some EK Sunni votes were lost in Tanur and Azhikode where IUML candidates PK Firos and KM Shaji lost. Meanwhile, amid social media protests over IUML’s poll performance, most of which are directed at IUML national general secretary PK Kunhalikutty, former education minister P K Abdu Rabb raised a veiled criticism against him on Facebook. It is a fact that people elect representatives to various temples of democracy for a period of five years. When we forget that, the impact of the blow we receive will also increase. We should not forget how Prophet Mohammed described those who fled from the warfront, he said. “We cannot fault people if they say that some of us erred in understanding democracy and secularism. Democracy is not dominance over people,” he said. Rabb also criticized fielding of tainted candidates in some constituencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/samastha-organ-lauds-minority-support-to-ldf/articleshow/82393557.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 80-year-old punished 38 years after lie about bank lockers||MUMBAI: In a case the court termed “unique”, 38 years after a now 80-year-old Nepean Sea road resident was booked for lying to Income Tax officers by claiming that his family had no bank lockers when in fact he had one in his name and two in his wife’s name, a magistrate court recently convicted and sentenced him to imprisonment until the rising of the court. In such a sentence, the convicted accused has to sit in court until the day’s proceedings conclude. The court rejected the defence submissions that bank lockers are usually looked after by wives and they are aware of the transactions. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate, I R Shaikh, found octogenarian Kishanchand Gupta guilty under provisions of the Income Tax Act and the Indian Penal Code for offences related to making false statements. The maximum sentence is three years’ imprisonment. Special public prosecutor Ravi Goenka cited the deposition of the two prosecution witnesses, including an I-T officer, to seek Gupta’s conviction. The court said while the accused was bound by law to speak the truth, he intentionally made a false declaration on oath about the lockers. “I do not accept the argument of the defence on the point that bank lockers are most often looked after by wives who would know all the transactions. From the evidence it is clear that the accused had all knowledge about the joint lockers, and he also operated them,” the court said. It also held that nothing was brought on record to show that the statement made by the accused was later retracted. Seeking punishment for the accused, Goenka submitted that that Gupta had intentionally given false information and concealed the existence of the lockers with an intention to cause financial loss to the government. Gupta’s lawyer, however, urged the court to consider that he was 80 years old, was unwell and had suffered a lot due to the case being stretched for long. The defence also submitted that this was his first offence and it was committed unintentionally. The lawyer sought leniency in sentencing. “It is a unique case before the court which has been pending since 1983. It is seen years together have passed…Considering the age of the accused and other circumstances on record, I am of the considered view that this is a fit case to extend leniency to the accused,” the court said. Gupta was fined Rs 25,000. It was the prosecution’s case that during a search of Gupta’s residence and other places on February 18, 1983, Gupta had denied before the officer that he had any bank lockers, while his wife revealed her jewellery was kept in three bank lockers. He later claimed he was unaware. In court, Gupta denied the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-80-yr-old-punished-38-yrs-after-lie-about-bank-lockers/articleshow/82395422.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Last year also, SIIC had supported its incubated companies to develop indigenous products like Swasa N-95 mask and Noccarc V310 ventilator. The manufacturing challenge task force will be led by Prof. Amitabha Bandyopadhyay, Professor In-charge, Innovation & Incubation, IIT Kanpur, Srikant Sastri, President, TiE Delhi-NCR, and Rahul Patel, Head of Strategic Initiatives, SIIC, IIT Kanpur. Prof. Abhay Karandikar, Director, IIT Kanpur, has appealed to entrepreneurs to apply for the challenge. “IIT Kanpur carries a legacy of serving the nation in times of urgent need. When the first wave of Covid-19 hit India, SIIC incubated companies stepped up to deliver Swasa N-95 masks, which became a household name for protection and the Noccarc V310 ICU ventilator. Both products, developed locally, were testament to India’s capability to innovate at par with global standards. As the second wave hits India, IIT Kanpur and SIIC have decided to support more indigenous innovators, this time to address the oxygen crisis in the country. I urge all eligible entrepreneurs to participate in Mission Bharat O2.” Prof. Bandyopadhyay said, “SIIC and IIT Kanpur have a history of delivering quality products as per the country’s needs. We did it with the Noccarc ventilator; we will do it again with Mission Bharat O2. We urge young innovators to come up in large numbers to support the nation at this time.” Oxygen concentrator is a medical device with limited scope for product innovation, and hence SIIC plans to decentralise the manufacturing process by engaging quality SMEs across states. An ideal case scenario would be to work with a set of manufacturers in different regions with the target production capacity of 100 units per day initially and scale up gradually. Srikant Sastri said, “Entrepreneurs usually get carried away by a big idea without acknowledging whether the problem it solves is as big. With Mission Bharat O2, SIIC IIT Kanpur has taken a step toward solving a major crisis the country is grappling with today. We believe the team will make a mark with its combined entrepreneurial experience and vision to serve the nation.” All eligible Indian SME manufacturers can apply online on the website https://www.bharato2.in to participate. The initiative will help ease the pressure on hospitals and save lives. Mission Bharat O2 makes a strong case for leveraging local, indigenous talent to innovate the manufacturing and supply chain for oxygen concentrators and plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/siic-iit-k-launches-mission-bharat-o2-challenge-to-combat-shortage/articleshow/82395416.cms||---

Sarpanch Constancio Miranda told reporters that the woman was taken to hospital at around 6am on Tuesday by her husband, but was refused entry owing to the large number of patients already inside the casualty department. She stayed with her husband in their car, patiently awaiting their turn to be allowed inside the hospital. However, as the hours passed, her condition worsened, and she died in the car at around noon, before she could get any medical attention. Her last rites were performed on Tuesday evening. The incident has sparked outrage over the crumbling healthcare system of the state. Although the South Goa district hospital has been upgraded to 500 beds from 390-odd earlier, there has been no scaling up of medical and paramedical personnel. Consequently, the already-overstressed doctors and nurses have to attend to an increasing number of patients, thereby stretching manpower resources further. Seeking admission at the hospital for serious patients is turning out to be a Herculean task, as it is for doctors managing patients in home isolation. A doctor, a private practitioner, told TOI that one of his patients in home isolation who needed hospitalization, got a bed only after 12 hours of waiting outside the hospital. Ambulances, too, are not readily available at primary health care centres to take patients to the hospital, and it takes hours for one to be arranged, even for doctors. “If this is the case of doctors, imagine the plight of patients who seek assistance on their own,” another doctor told TOI. A senior hospital official attributed the situation to the suddenly overstrained resources of the hospital. “We are working out the best solutions with the limited resources available at our disposal,” he said. “We are trying to have a dedicated medical team at the swab centre itself, to identify patients needing urgent medical attention.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/waiting-outside-south-goa-hospital-49-year-old-woman-dies-in-car/articleshow/82395429.cms||---

The state also reported 85 Covid deaths, after which Covid toll reached 3,015,” said Abhishek Tripathi from Covid Control room. The number of recoveries also touched a new high, with 5,659 people getting recovered from the infection in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, district magistrate Ashish Srivastava on Tuesday asked hospitals in need of Oxygen supply with at least 24 hours of stock in place. “All hospitals should provide information to the district administration 24 hours in advance for treatment, oxygen and other necessary resources … so that the requirements of the hospitals can be met on time,” said Srivastava. A lapse in alerting the administration on due time and if it results in something untoward, the hospital will be held solely responsible, the DM added. Director general (DG) health Dr Tripti Bahuguna on Tuesday formed two committees in Garhwal and Kumaon to monitor oxygen supply and usage in hospitals. As per the orders, the team of Dr Bharti Rana working with the health directorate and Dr Meetu Shah will monitor the ICU beds and oxygen consumption of hospitals in Garhwal division. “Dr Rashmi Pant and Dr Shailja Bhatt will audit the ICU and oxygen consumption at hospitals in Kumaon. This has been done after reports came in of hospitals using oxygen irrationally. There are complaints that hospitals have admitted patients to ICU when there was no need,” the order adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/daily-spike-crosses-7k-mark-as-ukhand-records-highest-cases-in-a-day-ever/articleshow/82393561.cms||Ishita Mishra

The arrested accused has been identified as Prince Dalal and a double-barrel gun has been seized from him. The reason behind the brawl and the subsequent murder is yet to be ascertained. Dalal is being questioned, police said. Olympic medalist and wrestler Sushil Kumar’s name has also figured in the investigation, the cops said. Kumar has, however, denied his involvement in the matter. “They weren’t our wrestlers, it happened late last night. We have informed police officials that some unknown people jumped into our premises and fought. There is no connection of our stadium with this incident,” he claimed. The incident took place around 1am. The cops received a call regarding firing inside the stadium and rushed to the spot. Five cars were found parked at the spot, which were seized by the cops. “A probe revealed that the brawl broke out among Sushil Kumar, Ajay, Prince, Sonu, Sagar, Amit and others in the parking area. The injured people were shifted to a hospital,” the additional DCP said. Several teams have been formed to track down the alleged people. Technical evidence relating to the incident has been obtained. The details of the recovered vehicles are also being obtained from the authority concerned, the cops said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/23-yr-old-wrestler-killed-two-friends-injured-in-brawl/articleshow/82417419.cms||---

In a virtual meeting of Adhivakta Kalyan Sangharsh Samiti on Tuesday, its convener Ravindra Sharma asked the chief minister to announce a family health cover for advocates as they are also officers of courts and might get infected with Covid-19. Apart from this, they do not have any source of income as the courts have been closed due to the pandemic in compliance with the orders of the Allahabad High Court. Sharma said, “It is very sad that the statements of even the government advocates to provide relief to lawyers were being overlooked. In the present time, the advocates are not only struggling for their bread and butter, but are also facing health problems. Several advocates have lost their lives in this pandemic and their family members are in financial crisis.” “A family health insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh is must for advocates and their families. The chief minister should consider this issue and demand,” Sharma added. BL Gupta, president of the Income Tax GST Bar Association said that the family health cover for advocates is a need of the hour as the income of lawyers is almost zero during closure of courts. Vinay Awasthi, general secretary, Sales Tax Bar Association, Avinash Bajpai, former president, Lawyers Association, Dinesh Verma, president, Commissionerate Bar Association and others also attended the virtual meeting and supported the demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/lawyers-demand-rs-5-lakh-health-insurance-cover-for-self-family/articleshow/82395455.cms||---
---||Dehradun||With Kailash Mansarovar Yatra unlikely for 2nd year in a row, KMVN stands to lose Rs 5cr in revenue||PITHORAGARH: With the Kailash Mansarovar and Adi Kailash Yatra likely to be cancelled for the second year in a row, stakeholders like hoteliers, pony owners and guides stand to incur huge losses. Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam (KMVN), nodal agency for the Kailash-Mansarovar yatra on the Indian side, stands to lose revenue to the tune of Rs 5 crore this year, as pilgrims taking the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra (with generates close to Rs 4 crore) also take the Adi Kailash Yatra (which generates Rs 1 crore revenue) in the Kumaon hills. Unlike Kailash Mansarovar yatra, Adi Kailash pilgrimage is entirely on the Indian side. The Kailash Mansarovar yatra every year starts in June and continues till September. Around 1,000 pilgrims participate in the pilgrimage in 18 batches. The trail passes China through Lipulekh Pass in Pithoragarh district. KMVN general manager Ashok Joshi told TOI, “The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) holds preparatory meetings with the KMVN in the first week of February. Following this, KMVN meets with Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Public Works Department (PWD), the district administration and other stakeholders to finalise details. However, like last year, these meetings were not held this year either. Basu Pande, chairperson of an organization that conducts the Adi Kailash yatra, told TOI, “In February, when cases of the coronavirus were low, a lot of people enquired about the Adi Kailash yatra but as the cases started surging in March, everyone backed out and no bookings were made.” Surendra Singh, a local resident, told TOI, “May hoteliers, pony owners, guides in Byas Valley will suffer for two years in a row.” “With the Adi Kailash yatra not happening, I haven’t earned a single penny in the last two years from my establishment,” said Dhanraj Garvayal, who owns a hotel in Garbyang area of Dharchula, Pithoragarh, which falls on the Kailash Mansarovar and Adi Kailash route. “I am entirely dependent on the Adi Kailash Yatra and have not been able to earn any living since last year,” said Mangal Singh, pony owner who ferries Kailash pilgrims. Since it started in 1981, the Kailash-Mansarovar yatra was put on hold for the first time last year. In 2019, nearly 1,000 pilgrims had taken the pilgrimage in 18 batches. Apart from the KMVN, ITBP and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) as well as the Pithoragarh district administration are responsible for the yatra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/with-kailash-mansarovar-yatra-unlikely-for-2nd-year-in-a-row-kmvn-stands-to-lose-rs-5cr-in-revenue/articleshow/82393567.cms||Prem Punetha

With the help of these seeds, soybean crops will be sown on over 50,000 hectare. The farmers are currently busy in preparing the land and expecting normal start to the monsoon from first week of June to start sowing. Dyandeo Wakure, district agricultural superintendent, said, “During last year, supply of defective seeds from various agencies were reported which was one of the reasons for seed germination failure. The farmers had to resort to re-sowing, but most of them faced economic losses. Since then we are asking farmers to keep some share of the crop with them for making good quality seeds. Now, we have have around 13,000 quintal of seeds ready with the farmers. Their seed coat is intact and it can surely germinate if soil and water requirements are met properly.” He added, “Since last one year we are training the farmers to make soybean seeds out of their harvest. They can store such seeds for up to two years. We have advised the farmers to start sowing only after their locality receives 75mm to 100mm rainfall.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/farmers-keep-13000-quintal-of-soybean-seeds-ready/articleshow/82392803.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Captain Amarinder Singh’s SOS to Modi, Shah: Need more oxygen, tankers, fear loss of lives||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday sought the immediate intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to ensure uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen in the state. He also sought additional allocation of 50MT liquid medical oxygen from a nearby source and 20 additional tankers. The CM sent separate letters to Modi and Shah, as the number of Covid patients on varying levels of oxygen support in the state touched 10,000. Expressing deep concern over an imminent loss of lives due to oxygen shortage, the CM said with mounting caseload, he was unable to increase Level II and Level III beds due to oxygen availability constraints. The state was facing the prospect of shortage of oxygen beds, he said, pointing out that the Centre had expressed inability to even allow Punjab’s local industry to undertake commercial import of liquid medical oxygen from Pakistan through the Wagah-Attari border, which is geographically proximate. Further, despite the assurance that “adequate supply would be ensured to us from alternate sources, I regret to point out that this has not happened”, said Amarinder. The total allocation of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) from outside the state at present is 195MT, of which 90MT is from Bokaro in eastern India. The balance 105MT comes from facilities in Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. However, Punjab is not getting its daily allocated quota, said the chief minister. The existing backlog for Punjab from these facilities is 5.6MT from Panipat in Haryana, 100MT from Sela Qui at Dehradun in Uttarakhand, and 10MT from Roorkee. Pointing out that Punjab had now been given to understand by the Centre that there would be likely disruption of liquid medical oxygen supply from today from Panipat and Barotiwala, the CM said this would cause great stress on the already limited oxygen availability in the state, thus causing a medical emergency, including risk of loss of life for the large number of patients who are in critical condition and on regular oxygen support. The disruption should be avoided, he said, adding that, if necessary, the state must be compensated immediately from a nearby additional source. Referring to the shortage of tankers, the CM said the state was airlifting two empty tankers daily to Ranchi, with the filled tankers returning by road from Bokaro on a 48-50 hour journey. The CM said the state government had already requested the Centre to allocate 20 additional tankers (conducive to rail travel) to allow for the regular evacuation of 90MT liquid medical oxygen from Bokaro on a daily basis, but had been told that only two would be provided, and even those were yet to come.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capts-sos-to-modi-shah-need-more-o2-tankers-fear-loss-of-lives/articleshow/82394332.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Param Bir and Waze made unpardonable mistakes, says Deshmukh||Nagpur: Former home minister Anil Deshmukh on Tuesday levelled fresh allegations against former Mumbai commissioner of police Param Bir Singh and suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Waze claiming that they had committed grave, unpardonable mistakes in the cases relating to the explosive-laden SUV found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence and subsequent murder of the vehicle owner, Mansukh Hiran. The senior NCP leader was in Nagpur for a two-day tour. Deshmukh said he had to remove Singh as Mumbai CP after Waze and his ‘dubious’ roles started coming to fore in the bomb scare and Hiren murder cases. “If Singh wanted to make allegations against me, then why did he not say so when he was Mumbai CP? He started levelling allegations against me after I removed him from the post. Singh was also angry as I had taken away the two probes from under his supervision and given them to the ATS,” said the former home minister. “The two cases are now being probed by the NIA, and the suspicious roles of Singh and Waze will come to fore.” Singh had alleged that Deshmukh tried to extort Rs 100 crore from bars, restaurants and other establishments through policemen, and also interfered in the suicide of a Gujarat-based politician in south Mumbai. Deshmukh said every day fresh allegations of corruption and malpractices are surfacing against Singh. “Some police personnel like Ghadge (Bhimrao) and Dange (Anup) have filed complaints against him. Businessmen, like Ketan Tanna and Sonu Jalan, too have complained that Singh extorted money from them.” Deshmukh said he had approached the Bombay HC seeking justice in view of the allegations made against him in the FIR filed by the CBI last month. “There had not been a single allegation against me in my entire 30-year career in politics. Hence, I have now approached the judiciary for justice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-param-bir-and-waze-made-unpardonable-mistakes-says-deshmukh/articleshow/82394411.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Goa||More curbs in Goa, restaurants and non-essential shops closed||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday said that the state government has decided to enforce additional restrictions to control the spread of Covid-19, which includes closure of non-essential shops and restaurants only being allowed to provide takeaways. The chief minister also said that lockdowns at the panchayat and municipal-level were not necessary and that they should instead follow the state government’s restriction orders. Speaking to reporters, Sawant urged panchayats to allow shops selling essential items to stay open in public interest. Failing this, there could be panic buying, he said. He also asked panchayats and MLAs not to stop people from going to work. “Considering the sentiment of the people of the state and increase in Covid cases, shops selling non-essential will not be allowed to operate. Only those selling essentials will be allowed to stay open. At restaurants, dine-ins will not be allowed. However, these establishments can continue to operate their kitchens for takeaway service,” Sawant said, on Tuesday. As per the state government’s Sunday order, restaurants with 50% sitting capacity would be allowed to remain open between 7am and 7pm. However, restaurant kitchens were allowed to provide home delivery and takeaways anytime. Sawant said that markets in municipal and panchayat areas are allowed to function with social distancing. On Monday, the state government had extended the 4-day lockdown, which began on Thursday 7pm, till May 10, with several additional restrictions. However, for the past two days, panchayats and municipalities across the state have begun issuing self-lockdown orders. Reacting to this, Sawant said, “Looking at all the conditions, when we say lockdown, all essential services should be allowed to operate. If these people stop essential services, then they will create panic among people. I urged all municipalities and panchayats to keep essential services open.” The chief minister said that panchayats and municipalities should follow the state government order and keep all essential services open. He said that panchayats and even MLAs are not allowing people to go to work. “Lot of people work in government departments, including the health services where they are fighting the pandemic. If they are not allowed to go to work then we won’t be able to handle the pandemic. Many are working in the pharmaceutical sector. In a lockdown, you cannot stop people going to work.” The chief minister said that he has been saying that people should not come out of their houses unnecessarily. But those who are working have to step out. “Follow the state government order and there is no need for any additional lockdown orders,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/more-curbs-in-goa-restaurants-and-non-essential-shops-closed/articleshow/82395564.cms||---

Window panes in their room were shattered in the explosion. According to Muzhakunnu police, Mohammed Ameen (5) and his brother Mohammed Radeeh (18 months) were injured when they were playing with the ball shaped ice cream cup they had picked up from the lane near their house. Ameen has been admitted to Pariyaram medical college with shrapnel injuries in his chest and leg. Police said the injuries were not serious. Muzhakunnu inspector Suresh Kumar said the kids were playing with the ice cream cup inside their home when it burst. “They didn’t know that the ice cream cup contained a crude bomb. It went off when the kids hit it with a stick. The crude bomb was made by stuffing explosives and stone pieces inside the ice cream cup,” he said. According to the police, there had been seizures of such crude bombs before and rival political parties have been using them for carrying out political violence. “We had carried out a search in the area recently in the run up to the elections but could not find anything.

---||Hyderabad||Eatala Rajender land row: Telangana high court bins collector’s report||HYDERABAD: In a major relief to dismissed health minister Eatala Rajender, the Telangana high court on Tuesday directed the state government not to initiate any action based on the report of Medak district collector on the alleged land grabbing by Jamuna Hatcheries and asked the government to follow the due process of law. Coming down heavily on the collector and his team of officials for entering the private property of the former minister’s family, Justice T Vinod Kumar refused to accept the report of the collector. He faulted the action of the collector for entering the premises in the name of identifying the assigned land without issuing any notice. Terming the collector’s action as a violation of fundamental rights, the judge said: “Even encroachers have to be notified when you (government) intend to act on them.” Justice Kumar took up a house motion and heard an urgent petition filed by Jamuna Hatcheries, run by Eatala’s wife Jamuna and son Nithin Reddy, who urged the court to restrain the government from taking any coercive action against them. The judge gave four weeks to the government file a counter and asked it not to rely on the collector’s report. Eatala was removed from the state cabinet two days ago and an official inquiry was ordered into allegations of land grabbing by him. Appearing for the petitioners, senior counsel D Prakash Reddy said the action of the authorities was unilateral and high-handed and even confirmed them as encroachers of government land within hours of launching a probe. Citing the collector, the judge also rejected the government contention that this was only a preliminary probe. The collector mentioned in his report that he had conducted a detailed field inspection. “Can a detailed field inspection take place without notifying the affected parties,” the judge wondered. He further asked, “Assuming for a moment the poultry was set up on an assigned land, what were the authorities doing when sheds were erected, when power connection was given and when poultry was set up and run.” Stressing that the collector had totally ignored the principles of natural justice, the judge directed the government to initiate the process by following the law. The judge gave an interim direction to the government not to interfere and not to resort to any coercive action based on the collector’s report. He posted the case to July 6 for further heding. Prakash Reddy said a team comprising 200 officials from revenue, police and survey departments barged into Jamuna Hatcheries unit at Achampet and Hakimpet villages in Medak district without issuing a notice and without showing any regard towards the bio-sensitive zone in which poultry is bred. The petitioners also sought directions from the court restraining the authorities from entering the premises of their poultry and interfering in their business and possession of their land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-land-row-hc-bins-collectors-report/articleshow/82395561.cms||---

On the lines of the pulse polio campaign, several teams of the health department will visit door-to-door and create awareness among the people by informing them about Covid symptoms. The team will provide medical kits to people suffering from coryza, cold, cough, and fever at their doors. Ashwini Gautam, district programme officer of National Health Mission said that in view of the fact that the deadly coronavirus was spreading its wings in rural areas and infecting a large number of people, a special campaign was being launched from Wednesday to create awareness among the villagers and provide them medicine and treatment at their doorstep. The teams, consisting of two members, would tell the villagers about the new symptoms of Covid-19 disease, its prevention, medical examination and treatment facilities. Moreover, if the team finds anyone having symptoms, it will provide medicines too. Each team will have two members from the Asha/Anganwadi worker/teacher or supervisory committee. Each team would be equipped with a medical kit. The campaign could be extended a few more days, Gautam said. District community process manager Yogendra Pal said that the teams would prepare a list of infected persons and pass the information to block and district headquarters. The people whose names are in the list would be medically examined at the nearest examination centre. The teams would have a work plan format, reporting format and a medical kit, Pal said. He has asked the people not to overlook fever, cough and coryza. “Never think that these symptoms are of common flu. They can be symptoms of corona. Diarrhea is also one of the symptoms. Contact a doctor and get done a Covid-19 test and start treatment as per the report”, he further said. He has advised the people to stay connected with doctors through telemedicine, get their sugar and blood pressure examined, consume lukewarm water, sanitize hands, wear a mask and maintain a two-yard distance from others.

The incident pertaining to the case happened on April 28 around 8.45am shortly after the woman, native of Mulanthuruthy and a clerk at higher secondary regional office in Chengannur boarded Punalur Express from Mulanthuruthy station. According to her statements, she was alone in the compartment and when the train departed, the accused came in, assaulted and robbed her. When he dragged her by hair to the washroom she jumped out of the train. The high court and women’s commission had registered suo moto cases after the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/accused-in-train-attack-case-caught/articleshow/82393592.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Mysterious underground fire keeps villagers on toes in Gomia block||Bokaro: An underground fire erupted due to unidentified causes near villages in Badkagada area under Tilaiya panchayat in Gomia block of Bokaro district on Tuesday. The place of occurrence is close to the Bokaro river on the foothills of Luggu Hills. Local administration pressed teams to inspect the spot and began efforts to douse the flames by putting mud and soil with the help of earthmovers but to no avail. The administration asked locals to refrain from venturing nearby the fire zone. Local sources said that besides large flames of fire, the water in the ponds near the spot turned hot. “The flames were about 15-20 feet high due to which the soil also turned black,” said a villager. Experts believe the fire was a result of the presence of methane gas since the area has huge coal reserves. Villagers said that till date such an incident has never happened in Tilaiya but a few years ago it had happened in Laiyo (Ramgarh) on the other side of the river when fire raged for five days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/mysterious-underground-fire-keeps-villagers-on-toes-in-gomia-block/articleshow/82394171.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Hazaribag SDPO Nazir Akthar on Tuesday informed that the incident occurred near Sonharakhurd under Barkatha police station. “The car didn’t notice the stationary military vehicle, leading to the collision. The impact of the collision was so severe that the car was completely smashed and all the three members, including a woman, died on the spot. With great difficulty late in the night, we retrieved the bodies from inside the car and sent for them post-mortem today (Tuesday) morning.” Akhtar added the military vehicle has been seized and FIRs have been lodged from both sides. “Family members of the deceased drove down from Uttar Pradesh to complete the formalities,” he said. The mishap lead to the traffic on the Delhi-Howrah Road getting halted for several hours till the accident site could be cleared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/3-dead-after-car-collides-with-military-vehicle-carrying-o2-in-hbag/articleshow/82394052.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The cops have joined hands with the fire brigade men to sensitize the hospital authorities. “We have started organizing mock drills in the hospitals across the city. The idea is to prepare hospital staff in case of emergencies including fire incidents,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner. The police officials said that almost every hospital is full of patients, most of them suffering from Covid-19. “In case fire breaks out, the hospital staff should know how to act quickly and save the lives of the patients. They should know where the exit is and how the patients can be taken to safety quickly. These mock drills will continue for some days,” the police said. The fire brigade has in the past conducted similar mock drills and even checked if the hospitals have NOC from the fire department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/police-fire-brigade-conduct-fire-drills-in-vadodara-hospitals/articleshow/82392508.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||‘Two crematoriums in Steel City become super spreaders’||JAMSHEDPUR: The two crematoriums in Jamshedpur -- Parvati Subarnarekha ghats -- are working round the clock as the number of Covid deaths are on the rise in the district and health experts said the sites have now become hotspots of the viral infection. Sources said even after the government put a cap on the number of people attending cremations, several relatives flout the rules and there is hardly any space left for social distancing when the bodies are being burnt. Mahesh Sahu, whose father died of Covid on Sunday, said he cremated his father at Parvati Ghat and several people who attended the last rites were found positive. Talking to TOI, Mahesh said he performed the rituals without wearing PPE kits. Experts say such action is against the Covid protocols. Mahesh is not alone and not a single person at the ghat was seen wearing PPE kits. Even drivers of vehicles ferrying the bodies were not seen wearing any protective suits. A Parvati Ghat official, D K Bhatt, said relatives of Covid victims adhered to protocols while performing the last rites last year, but people seemed to be lax this time. "Now, crematoriums will be super-spreaders of the virus soon if no action is taken up," he said. Dr Anita Banerjee, who retired from MGMMCH, said the district administration should set up a police picket at both the crematoriums and ensure that all rules are followed. She said the number of persons accompanying the bodies must be strictly restricted so that there is no overcrowding. She said the need of the hour is to be extra cautious and such loopholes can just be fatal and add to the already rising Covid numbers in the city. Meanwhile, the campus of the crematoriums are not being sanitized and the area is not being cleaned by civic bodies regularly, which is adding to the woes. Notably every day more than 50 bodies are being brought to both the burning ghats here. As many of the bodies are being burned in conventional wooden furnaces due to non-availability of electric furnaces the area needs to be cleaned and sanitized on regular intervals, which is not being done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/2-crematoriums-in-steel-city-become-super-spreaders/articleshow/82394109.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Migrant workers begin journey back home||VISAKHAPATNAM: Amid the raging second wave of Covid-19 and fears over fresh lockdown, several migrants have started heading to their native places over the last few days in Andhra Pradesh, at least on a very small scale. Even though it seems like a déjà vu situation from last year, it is more of a calculated move on the part of migrants this time based on their harrowing experiences from the lockdown period last year. Employment uncertainty, fears over their health due to the second wave, growing financial burden, and ongoing health crisis in the cities have fuelled these reverse migrations. The nationwide lockdown had come as a bolt from the blue for this vulnerable workforce, triggering a mass exodus of migrants last year. Thousands of people had been seen walking back home on their foot for days on end, braving scorching temperatures and hunger pangs. At least one lakh people from states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and migrants within Andhra Pradesh had to take shelter in relief centres in the state for several weeks before restrictions were eased last year. Speaking to TOI, M Venku Naidu, a construction worker from Srikakulam and currently working in Visakhapatnam, said that lack of public transport and closure of state borders had made things miserable for the migrant workers in 2020. “But this time, we want to take things into our control. There was no employment for at least half of the year in 2020. This seems to be repeating for us during the second wave again. In the absence of any work, we may not be in a position to pay rents, living costs, hospital bills or any other expenditure,” said Naidu. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) had come to the rescue of migrant workers when the lockdown sparked the reverse migration and employment loss during the first wave last year. There were several days where nearly 50 lakh people worked under the scheme in Andhra Pradesh. Kusini Kanaka Rao, a migrant worker from East Godavari, said that several people continued to stay in villages, even before the second wave as things have not fully improved on the Covid-19 front. “Only the breadwinners have migrated again to cities, leaving the kids and women in their native places. We do not know how the partial curfew from May 5, Wednesday, would turn out for the migrants. Covid-19 has dealt a severe financial blow to the working class as several people have been rendered jobless,” said Rao. M Jogarao, a labour contractor from Madhurawada area, said the reverse migration has started at least a week ago. “The rumours over lockdown is the major reason for it. Several construction works have come to a halt,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/migrant-workers-begin-journey-back-home/articleshow/82392871.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Speaking to the media on Tuesday, Singhal said that the state government wants to make sure that every mandal that does not have any other health facility, such as a community health care centre or hospital, has at least two PHCs. “The health department has identified 280 mandals that have only one PHC. Of these 280 mandals, 116 do not have any other health facility. One mandal in the state does not have a single PHC, which would now get two PHCs. One more PHC has been sanctioned to seven tribal mandals. It is estimated that the construction of these PHCs would cost about Rs 346 crore, while the recruitment of doctors and staff and other consumables may result in an annual expenditure of about Rs 165 crore,” said Singhal. Singhal said that the Group of Ministers on Covid-19 would meet on Wednesday to discuss strategies to contain the increase in number of daily Covid-19 cases. “The in-charge ministers of the districts would conduct meetings with the respective district collector to plan the containment of the pandemic. The state would get about 12,000 Remdesivir injections on Tuesday night. About 22,000 injections are already available with government hospitals, while 14,000 doses were supplied to the private hospitals on Tuesday,” said Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/state-sanctions-176-new-primary-health-centres/articleshow/82392882.cms||---
---||Ghaziabad||300 families hit: RWA of Ghaziabad condo in SOS to government||GHAZIABAD: The RWA of a housing society in Indirapuram sent an SOS to the UP government on Tuesday, saying over 300 families living there were affected by Covid-19 and it needed urgent assistance to contain the spread of the virus that has ravaged the condominium of 1,002 flats since mid-April.  The RWA also claimed there have been nine deaths in the last 30 days and residents were running from pillar to post for oxygen and hospital beds. TOI could not independently verify the exact number of active cases or deaths in the society — Amrapali Village, off Delhi-Meerut Expressway, located in a densely populated part of Indirapuram. Officials in the health department said they would “look into” the numbers the RWA had shared. Strangely, the society was sealed by the Ghaziabad administration only a day before the SOS, on Monday. No emergency measures to check the spread of the virus have been initiated. There are no ambulances or medical teams deputed there either. According to the RWA, there are five critical patients in the society who need oxygen and hospitalisation. Senior district officials this correspondent spoke to were not aware of the problems the society was facing. The RWA said there were around 20 Covid cases in the society on April 10. Within no time, the condominium was in the grip of an outbreak. By April 21, 120 people had tested positive, claimed the RWA, adding the number of infected people on May 4 was around 350. RWA president Deepak Kumar said they had apprised the administration through Amrapali Village’s official Twitter handle on April 21, but no measures were taken. “The society was sealed by the district authorities some two weeks after that tweet. However, the sealing order issued on May 3 mentions April 25 as the starting date of sealing,” Kumar told TOI. “The situation is so bad that a resident called me many times on Monday to find a hospital bed for her husband, who is critical. We have eight oxygen cylinders with us and are providing them to families of critical patients. But getting them refilled is a huge challenge. At present, all cylinders are empty. We have sent a person to Aligarh with the cylinders and keeping our fingers crossed,” Kumar said. Dinesh Kalra, an Amrapali Village resident, said his 34-year-old son’s oxygen levels had fallen to 83 and he was not able to get an oxygen cylinder. “My son and I had tested positive on April 25. His condition suddenly started deteriorating on Monday. At one point, he was not able to sit up. As going out was not possible, we sought online consultation with private doctors and gave him medicines. His condition has improved now, and we are just hoping that he does not require hospitalisation.” Even after the tweet to the state government seeking help, the RWA said the local administration had not contacted it. Officiating district magistrate Krishna Karunesh and officiating chief medical officer Dr Sunil Tyagi said they would look into the issues. Both the DM and the CMO are indisposed. Additional city magistrate and incident commander Vinay Kumar Singh said he would try and get beds for critical patients in Covid hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/300-families-hit-rwa-of-ghaziabad-condo-in-sos-to-government/articleshow/82395599.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Business||5G trials: Govt keeps Chinese companies out||NEW DELHI: Chinese telecom vendors Huawei and ZTE have not found a place in the government’s ambitious 5G trials, in a clear signal that business relations with the country’s neighbour will remain restricted, amid growing concerns around network security and prevailing tensions in diplomatic and military relations. The trials are a precursor to 5G auctions that are expected to start late this year, or early next, and absence here means that there will be very little chance of the Chinese companies finding many takers at the time of actual network deployment, top sources told TOI. Officially, the department of telecom (DoT) approved 5G trials’ permissions to mobile operators (Reliance Jio, Airtel, Vodafone Idea and MTNL) who said they will partner with network providers such as Sweden’s Ericsson, Finland’s Nokia, South Korea’s Samsung and state-owned C-DOT. Jio will also be conducting trials using its own indigenous technology. The move comes weeks after the government had taken decisive steps towards securing the mobile ecosystem by making amendments to the telecom licence rules, mandating that after June 15, equipment can be procured only from ‘trusted’ sources that have been approved by a designated authority. This, say sources, was a “clear enough signal” to be wary of procuring from the Chinese companies. While refusing to speak on participation of Chinese companies, telecom secretary Anshu Prakash said that conducting trials will reduce the time between auction of 5G spectrum and the rollout of the high-speed networks. “In the past, trials for new technologies happened after spectrum auctions. But we have recently issued new guidelines for experimental spectrum and spectrum trials based on which the trials are being undertaken. Mobile operators can choose the vendors and technologies, and the type of equipment they would like to install,” Prakash said. The telecom secretary said 5G field trials would also include test on India-specific applications in socially-relevant sectors such as health, education, agriculture, traffic management and others. “The trials will also enable real-life testing of 5G devices and handsets.” In December last year, the government had said that it will prepare a list of “trusted sources”, a move aimed at countering the rising threat of Chinese equipment, after the Cabinet committee on security approved the National Security Directive for telecom. As part of the policy, the National Cyber Security Coordinator will act as the Designated Authority and would also notify alist of sources from whom “no procurement” can be done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/5g-trials-govt-keeps-chinese-companies-out/articleshow/82397154.cms||Pankaj Doval

Finally, the girl managed to give water to her father, right before he passed away in front of her. The incident took place at the tiny village of Koyyanapeta under G Sigadam mandal in Srikakulam district. Locals said that 44-year-old Asiri Naidu lived with his wife and children in Vijayawada where he worked as a daily wage labourer. Apprehensive of a lockdown, the family was on its way back to their native village on Sunday. But villagers did not allow the family in, fearing that they might be carriers of the virus and asked them to stay at a hut on the outskirts of the village. Naidu, who is believed to have been suffering from Covid-19, was having trouble breathing and collapsed near the hut. Even as his health deteriorated, no one came forward to help the man and take him to a hospital. Moved by her father’s plight, his daughter tried to get close to him and give him water without heeding the advice of her parents. The 44-year-old drank a gulp of water and breathed his last. As the video went viral, revenue officials and activists of some political parties went to the village and performed Naidu’s last rites as per Covid-19 protocols. They assured the family members of help.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/young-girl-gives-father-water-as-he-dies-in-front-of-her-video-goes-viral/articleshow/82392909.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Visakhapatnam||Pricey cremations add to woes of bereaved families||VISAKHAPATNAM: Vizag is not only an expensive place to live, but also to die. As the Covid-19 toll mounts, last rites have become expensive affairs. Last rites rituals in the city are currently priced at Rs 30,000–50,000, adding to woes of grieving families. “We are helpless because people assisting in cremation at burial grounds are saying that there is high risk of infection. So, they are demanding more money,” said Prabhakara Rao, who recently cremated his father. Rao adds: "Even after paying Rs 50,000 for the cremation, we were unable to see our loved one for the last time. The final rites of deceased are draining people emotionally and financially.” KB Rao, another person grieving the loss of a loved one, said that ward boys and attendants at hospitals are asking for more money to pack bodies in zipped bags. “We paid Rs 3,000 to ward boys to carry the body to the ambulance from the hospital and another Rs 2,000 for their PPE kits. For firewood, we were charged Rs 10,000 at the burial ground,” he said while adding that he paid Rs 10,000 for the ambulance and another Rs 10,000 was spent on other expenses. “Ambulance service owners are working like a syndicate,’ he alleged. G Srijana, commissioner of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), said: “We have fixed a price of Rs 3,000 per final rituals at Gnanapuram burial ground where cremation of people dying of Covid-19 are being sent. We have given instructions that if the family of the deceased is poor, cremation should be done for free.” Nevertheless, cremation agencies have continued their loot not only in Vizag but also in other parts of the state such as Vijayawada, Kakinada, Srikakulam, Guntur, Nellore and other district headquarters. Many agencies that offer comprehensive cremation services are approaching patients at hospitals where they have links with hospital staff. Visakhapatnam district collector V Vinay Chand said, “We have already instructed concerned departments of focus on the issue. If anyone is found demanding or charging more money, action will be taken against them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/pricey-cremations-add-to-woes-of-bereaved-families/articleshow/82392929.cms||Siva G

He had turned 43 last month and was battling the deadly Covid virus since more than a couple of weeks at a city hospital. Reporting domestic cricket — any age group — was Ruchir’s forte. His write-ups brought recognition to many players who went on to become stars. A fine example is Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Ruchir had written an article on the former India captain when Dhoni played at the Ajni ground in an Inter-Railway tournament. Soon after the news of Ruchir’s demise spread, Twitter was flooded with grief as cricketers, both past and present, expressed their condolences. Ex-Mumbai and Vidarbha veteran Wasim Jaffer was in disbelief. He described Ruchir as “one of the nicest journalists”. Vidarbha skipper Faiz Fazal said he shared a special bond with Ruchir ever since he started playing. Faiz admonished Ruchir for not “spending too much time in the middle”. “You deserved a hundred, Ruchir Bhai,” he tweeted. Others to offer condolences on the social media were Umesh Yadav, Irfan Pathan, RP Singh, Aakash Chopra and S Badrinath. Someone commented that “a lot of domestic players in this IPL owe their careers to Ruchir”. Ruchir’s heart beat for cricket so much so that he had once contacted BCCI media manager Maulin Parikh to know about domestic fixtures three months in advance. “He had to attend a family function but didn’t want to miss matches. He said he would convince his family to have functions on non-match days,” wrote Parikh. Hailing from Parasia in MP, Ruchir was an aspiring cricketer. He had attended former selector Sanjay Jagdale’s cricket camp in Indore for a couple of years. He was also the Chhindwada district table tennis champ. After completing MBA from Tirpude College, Ruchir worked as a marketing executive for a couple of years. He then joined Hindi newspaper Dainik Bhaskar and later moved to The Hitavada. In March 2008, Ruchir joined TOI. His career highlight was covering Vidarbha’s Ranji titles. That the players hugged him as soon as they won the trophy, saying “bhaiya, hum jeet gaye” is testimony how they regarded him. However, no one got a chance to hug him one last time. Ruchir, who was cremated on Tuesday evening at Mankapur ghat, leaves behind wife and two kids, 2 brothers, parents and other relatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/jaffer-fazal-among-many-who-grieve-for-tois-ruchir-mishra/articleshow/82394684.cms||---

The order clearly defines essential items and services to include medicines, vaccines, medical equipment, groceries, vegetables, fruits, dairy products and all types of food. Even trade associations say e-commerce giants continue to deliver a whole gamut of non-essential items despite the restrictions. TOI also tried buying stuff from a couple of portals. The delivery for a pack of hosiery items ordered on April 28 was received on May 4. The Break the Chain order was applicable on both dates. After that, TOI also placed orders for a deodorant and a toy from two different portals. The orders were accepted, and the summary shows that the items would be delivered by May 11 and 13 respectively. The state government order on curbs is applicable till May 15. None of the items TOI purchased were in the essential items list mentioned in the state government order. When TOI pointed out the issue to NMC, a deputy commissioner said since it has been brought to the notice the matter will be looked into. There was no response to a message seeking comments from district collector Ravindra Thakre. This has evoked sharp reactions from trade associations, who alleged that authorities are turning a blind eye to e-tailing corporates. Dipen Agrawal, president of Chamber of All Maharashtra Trade and Industry (CAMIT), said, “E-commerce giants have continued supplying non-essential goods unbridled. All our attempts to draw attention of authorities towards this blatant flouting of norms has been in vain.” Agrawal said, “Such step motherly treatment by the administration has resulted in piling up of dead stock in trader’ godowns and on the other hand the uncontrolled operation of e-commerce has resulted in increasing Covid cases even though traders, who are considered as supper spreaders, are under lockdown.” “Earlier, when brick and mortars shops were closed, trade of non-essential items continued through e-commerce. As trade associations raised objections, the order restricted e-commerce deliveries to essential items. However, even trade of other goods continues unofficially,” alleged BC Bhartia, president of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT). He said the matter has been taken up at various levels. They also plan to write to the chief minister. Ashwin Mehadia, president of Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC), said he was not aware that e-commerce deliveries of non-essential were happening despite the orders. Since it has been pointed out, he promised to take up the issue with concerned authorities. ILLEGAL HOME DELIVERIES * Break the Chain order restricts e-commerce deliveries to essential goods * Essential items include food, vegetables, fruit groceries and medicine * The order is applicable till May 15 * Major e-tailers are selling non-essential goods too * TOI got delivery of hosiery items, and orders for a deodorant and toys were also accepted||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/e-tailers-breaking-break-the-chain-orders-delivering-non-essentials/articleshow/82394731.cms||Shishir Arya

Such actions are prima facie illegal and amount to taking law into their own hands by private individuals. This is contrary to the Rule of Law,” observed the high court while seeking a reply from the state government. Justice Sudhir Mittal of the HC passed these orders while granting bail to Mubbi, alias Mubin, a native of Mewat in Haryana in relation to an FIR registered against him by the Mewat police under the cow protection law. The allegations in the FIR against Mubin are that the local Gau Raksha Dal, led by its district chief, raided his house and found a bull, a cow, and a calf tethered there. The petitioner ran away from the spot and could not be apprehended. The cow vigilantes discovered instruments of slaughter in the house and informed the local police. An FIR dated March 11, 2021, was registered at Bichhor Police Station in Nuh district under various sections of the Haryana Gauvansh Sanrakshan and Gausamvardhan Act, 2015 and related charges under IPC. In his plea for bail before the HC, the petitioner’s counsel submitted that Section 3 of the aforementioned Act prohibits cow slaughter but the facts of this case don’t reveal the slaughter of any cow and, thus, Section 3 is not attracted. Section 8 of the cow protection law prohibits the sale of beef. However, as there was no slaughter, there is no question of sale of beef and, thus, Section 8 is also not attracted, the counsel said. The HC issued a notice to Nuh police and the Haryana government seeking a reply to the contentions raised. The matter has been fixed for July 19 for the next hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/what-power-do-gau-rakshaks-have-to-raid-homes-asks-hc/articleshow/82397164.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Goa||Self-lockdown could trigger panic: Sawant||PANAJI/MARGAO: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday said that panchayats will create panic by going into a complete self-lockdown even as a few more panchayats imposed a voluntary lockdown on Tuesday. While on Monday several panchayats in Bardez and Canacona had opted for a self-lockdown, on Tuesday, many more, this time from Salcete taluka, besides a few more from Bardez, joined the move. However, as such powers are invested solely with the district magistrate under the Disaster Management Act, the directorate of panchayats, on Tuesday, approached the government to intervene. “Essential services must be kept open 100% else it will create panic in villages. The panchayats must allow essential services to operate throughout the day. My only appeal is to people to not leave their home unless absolutely necessary and to abide by the restrictions imposed by the government,” Sawant said. A similar situation was seen last year during the first wave when several panchayats underwent self-lockdown. Sources in the directorate of panchayats said that there is already an order from last year in force prohibiting individual panchayats from going into a self-lockdown. The state government had imposed a 4-day lockdown, which concluded on Monday. However, the chief minister had immediately extended the restrictions till May 10, with a few changes. Several villages and towns across South Goa on Tuesday decided to go in for a voluntarily lockdown for the next few days, while some others have chosen to extend the current restrictions and adding more Congress MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco drove around Curtorim in a rickshaw on Tuesday announcing an eight-day lockdown. “We will be able to win against this virus only if we stay home and stay safe,” he said. At the emergency meeting of the Aquem Baixo village panchayat, it was decided to impose additional restrictions instead of a lockdown. The Cuncolim municipality issued a public notice stating that non-essential outlets would be remain closed from May 4 to May 10. Grocery shops will remain open from 7 am to 11 am, and hotels and restaurants will be permitted “take away” services. Essential services will be exempted from the restrictions, the notice states. Traders associations in several towns, including in Margao and Curchorem, also decided to keep their units closed for the next few days.  Carmona village panchayat declared a partial lockdown. The village panchayat of Siolim-Sodiem issued an order on Tuesday calling for a lockdown up to May 16 to break the chain of the virus. The panchayat also warned of action, including cancellation of establishment licence and sealing of shops. After one of the highest number of active Covid-19 cases in the state were reported in the Porvorim constituency last week, two panchayats, Salvador do Mundo and Penha de Franca, in Bardez taluka, decided on Monday to go on a voluntary lockdown, till May 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/self-lockdown-could-trigger-panic-sawant/articleshow/82394750.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Goa||Coastal village bodies in Salcete opt for lockdowns||COLVA: Fearing the spread of Covid-19, coastal villages in Salcete have adopted resolutions to impose lockdowns. Varca will enforce a complete closure of all establishments, including essential services, from May 4-9. When asked about whether his panchayat is overriding the restriction of the government by disallowing even essential services, sarpanch Charlton Lourenco said the panchas were unanimous in their decision. Cavelossim, hub of star hotels, has imposed an order stalling of all kinds of commercial activity from Monday noon. Terming it as enforcement of stricter measures, Cavelossim sarpanch Denisio Dias said that while essential services will remain open from 6am to 12 noon, others will be kept shut. He said that this is an order under the Disaster Management Act. The neighbouring panchayats of Betalbatim and Majorda villages too have imposed similar restrictions. In Orlim, the lockdown will be on from May 5-11, but essential services will remain open from 7am to 12noon. Orlim sarpanch Tamica Rosa e D’Silva said they had to resort to this as 25 villagers have tested positive, while one death has been recorded. In Colva, which has 260 positive cases and 3 deaths on record, shop owners and business establishments will be allowed to remain open from 6am to 11am. Benaulim sarpanch Vencila Fernandes said that the lockdown will tentatively be from May 6-12. Carmona panchayat has resolved that from May 5–19, business timings will be restricted from 7am to 12 noon. Sarpanch Allwyn George said these special measures have been taken under Section 60/2 of the Goa Panchayat Raj Act. Terming it as enforcement of stricter measures, Cavelossim sarpanch Denisio Dias said that while essential services will be allowed to remain open from 6am to 12 noon, others will be kept shut.

Some hospitals have even tied up with adjacent hotels to admit patients and ensure their regular health monitoring. In Kozhikode, which has about 48,572 active Covid cases, Aster MIMS has set up a makeshift hospital in its one-acre parking lot. The hospital is now working on two more makeshift facilities with ICU near it to cater to the growing demand for ICU beds. "The ICU hospital beds are fully occupied in majority hospitals though many have kept aside 30-50% beds for Covid treatment. Since we also have to cater to non-Covid patients (and there is no reduction in non-Covid patients during the second wave), we decided to start temporary field hospitals with ICU beds. We set up one such hospital with 25 beds and it was filled up in no time," said Farhan Yasin, CEO, Aster MIMS and vice-president, Association of Healthcare Providers (India) (AHPI), Kerala chapter. Aster MIMS has shared this makeshift ICU-bedded hospital with four-five AHPImember hospitals in the state. Major hospitals exploring optionsMany of them have shown interest, and we have also shared our plan with the state health department. This is the best option available if all ICU beds in the government and private hospitals get filled with Covid patients. This is cost effective than immediately constructing buildings, and we can admit more patients too," Yasin said. In Thiruvananthapuram, which has 28,315 active cases, major hospitals like KIMSHealth are exploring various options after their ICUs are filled. “The demand for Covid acute care is increasing. We are looking at several options – makeshift hospitals on our nursing college campus, setting up beds in community or marriage halls or rope in corporates to set up treatment facilities on their campus,” KIMS Healthcare Group chairman Dr M I Sahadulla said. Dr Jayakrishnan A V, chairman of IMA's committee for vaccination promotion and coordination, said only 120-130 private hospitals are offering Covid treatment despite the government order to keep 50% beds in all hospitals for the purpose. "The hospitals offering Covid treatment are overburdened. Many of them are tying up with hotels to admit the not-so-serious patients. More hospitals need to be roped in for Covid treatment," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-private-hospitals-begin-makeshift-icu-facilities-for-covid-care/articleshow/82397169.cms||Preetu Nair

Sources in the tourism industry said that many resorts and hotels, which have been told not to take in new guests, are still holding on to their outstation staff in the hope that operations can restart once the situation improves. “A few restaurants are open for takeaway, but many are shut as there are no tourists. Though the current situation is going from bad to worse, some owners have retained their staff as things may improve by next month. Beach shack staff have all gone back to their native states,” Shacks Owners Welfare Society, general secretary, John Lobo said.” “Some resorts are shut and some are operating with basic staff,” Calangute sarpanch and hotelier Shawn Martin said. Other businesses too are hoping that the situation improves soon. A two-wheeler garage owner said he had kept his shop open for urgent repairs, but had to shut down after the police told him to. “I’m waiting for the lockdown to end,” he said. The owner of a four-wheeler garage and metal fabrication shop said he has been unable to undertake any work for the last two weeks as all oxygen cylinders have been diverted for medical use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-bizmen-hope-restrictions-improve-situation/articleshow/82394841.cms||---

State party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said that “it has been observed” that those opting for home isolation are roaming about, leading to the spread of the virus. Tanavade met Sawant to discuss measures to break the chain. “Keeping restaurants open at 50% capacity would add to the spread of Covid-19, hence we have suggested that restaurants are closed for dine-in and only takeaways allowed,” Tanavade said. He also said that some private doctors are advising patients that have Covid symptoms not to go for testing, and instead to home isolate and take medicines. He said that people follow this advice, and later, when their oxygen levels drop, they are rushed to Goa Medical College (GMC), where the situation goes out of hand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/strictly-monitor-home-isolated-bjp-tells-cm/articleshow/82394847.cms||---

We had also directed him to place on record the plan made by him for procuring these drugs. These directions are yet to be complied with,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shuke and Avinash Gharote said.While passing a slew of directives, the bench directed FDA to take all the details from the depot manager of Cipla Pharmaceuticals and authorized persons about the receipt of Tocilizumab injections. He was also directed to collect the data from pharmacists to whom these imported injections are supplied from the depot or through the company’s agent.“This portal, as stated by the collector, is going to be started in a day or two. Therefore, we would remind the joint commissioner to ensure that the details regarding Tocilizumab’s availability with the city pharmacists would also be available on the portal. We would once again direct the joint commissioner to comply with these directives by placing on record a detailed affidavit on record,” the judges said.Collector starts tendering process for oxy plants at govt hospsAfter getting Rs 2.05 crore from WCL, as directed by the HC, collector Ravindra Thakare on Tuesday filed an affidavit stating that the tendering process for installing oxygen plants at GMCH, IGGMCH and AIIMS have been started. He informed that the process to set up more plants at 16 government hospitals at Kamptee, Narkhed, Bhiwapur and Katol along with eight rural hospitals had also begun from the DPDC and district mining funds. An order to procure 130 ventilators has also been placed with a Vishakhapatnam company for Rs 2.88 crore from the same funds.Thakare added that from CSR funds to be received from MOIL, oxygen plants would be established at Shalitinitai Meghe, Lata Mangeshkar, National Cancer Institute and Mure Memorial hospitals.In a meeting held by the chief secretary on April 15, the collector had informed that the former directed all districts to procure 15-200 oxygen concentrators for individual patients and later those would then be kept at the government and municipal hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-asks-fda-to-inform-on-tocilizumab-availability-for-uploading-on-new-portal/articleshow/82394856.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The interns, who are set to join Covid-19 duties as fresh health manpower, want a written assurance about the stipend and Covid duties.

They have also demanded health insurance cover and implementation of quarantine period after Covid duty, as per the protocol. “Our counterparts in Mumbai and Pune get Covid allowances up to Rs50,000 and we want the same allowances in other parts of the state too,” said one of the protestors. The doctors said that Mumbai Municipal Corporation has contributed to the interns’ allowance in Mumbai while Pune Municipal Corporation has allotted Rs30,000 per month allowance to interns in Pune GMCs. They are expecting the same from NMC in Nagpur. At present, NMC does not any allowance to intern doctors. “Nurses are getting Rs1,000 per day allowance from the government.

On the first day, the hospital witnessed admissions of 20 patients, while on Tuesday, one more was hospitalised, Umraskar said. Though the hospital has a capacity of 60 beds, it has been brought down to 30 beds due to Covid SOPs. “The hospital is treating patients with mild symptoms,” he said. “There is a separate room for a general OPD. It will continue with other regular health checkups of patients, but for regular admission cases, patients will be shifted to Hospicio for treatment,” he said.

Amma Unavagam scheme was introduced by J Jayalalithaa in 2013 to serve food at subsidized rates. The canteens also served free food during the pandemic lockdown. CM-elect Stalin ordered restoration of the name board and the portrait at the eatery and sacked two party workers for vandalism. Saidapet MLA and former mayor Ma Subramanian, who supervised the restoration work at the canteen, tweeted that legal action would be taken against them as per the order of the party chief. The JJ Nagar police have arrested Navasundar and Surendar on charges of trespassing and using obscene words. They were later let out on station bail. AIADMK joint coordinator K Palaniswamy and coordinator O Panneerselvam said violence and political incivility of DMK workers have come to the fore again. TTV, PMK founder flay DMK cadres While the welfare facility has been of immense help to people during crises like floods and pandemic, damage to their leader’s photo has caused anguish, they said. AMMK chief TTV Dhinakaran tweeted saying the incident was an example that DMK men would never reform. Pattali Makkal Katchi founder Dr Ramadoss said that though it is natural for ruling parties to make changes in accordance with their policies, people will not forgive DMK for unleashing something which they had apprehended.

The Gujarat Medical Teachers Association (GMTA) has threatened to go on strike from Monday. Simultaneously, contractually appointed medical teachers too have submitted a charter of demands. GMTA’s central council meeting is scheduled on Wednesday. Nearly 1,700 tutors, assistant professors, associate professors and professors of six medical colleges of the state including 300 from Vadodara have threatened to hold protests and go on strike from May 10 if their demands are not met by then.GMTA’s demands include regularization of salaries for ad hoc teachers. For regular faculty members, the association wants salaries to be regularized for the remainder of their service period. This must be done in a single order, the association in a representation to Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani has stated.“The medical faculty trusted the government and hence did not take an aggressive stand. But the government has failed to look into our demands and hence it is now forced to give an ultimatum,” said GMTA Vadodara’s secretary Dr Beejaysinh Rathod. Contractually appointed medical teachers on the other hand said that their gross salary is even less than senior residents and after tax deduction it becomes even lesser than first year residents. They have demanded at least 40% raise in their current salary, appropriate sick leaves, earned leaves, maternity, paternity, academic leaves and regular conduction of Gujarat Public Service Commission (GPSC) so that contractually appointed medical teachers can come into GPSC pool.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/medical-teachers-across-state-threaten-stir-over-pending-demands/articleshow/82392519.cms||---
---||Nagpur||HC seeks reply from state, Centre in plea to revive govt drug manufacturer MAPL||Nagpur: Giving some hope for revival for Maharashtra Antibiotics and Pharmaceuticals Limited (MAPL), the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has sought a response from the central and state governments over an intervention application praying for utilization of its facilities to manufacture drugs like Remdesivir for Covid-19 patients. Intervener Suresh Gotmare, through counsel Arun Agrawal, contended that facilities at the Hingna MIDC plant could be utilized now for production of Covid-19 vaccines under mission ‘Covid Suraksha’ and also for setting up a medical oxygen plant. “By this application, the intervener invited our attention to the facilities already available in the factory, a subsidiary of Hindustan Antibiotics Limited (HAL), a Government of India undertaking. A copy of this application should be furnished to the government pleader Ketki Joshi and assistant solicitor general of India (ASGI) Ulhas Aurangabadkar. We request them to seek instructions in the matter,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said. Incorporated in 1979, the company commenced commercial production in May 1981. It was primarily a generic pharmaceutical formulation manufacturer that can produce tablet, capsule, dry and liquid injectables. It was the only public sector unit in central India from where lifesaving medicines were supplied to government hospitals in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, besides Maharashtra. The intervenor, former general secretary of MAPL Employees Association, said the company’s plot is on lease from MIDC for 95 years from August 1, 1979, and it holds a huge area of 50,585 sq m lying unutilized. On August 21, 2015, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis along with then Union minister for pharmaceuticals, chemicals & fertilizers Hansraj Ahir, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari and many MPs and MLAs visited the factory and announced its revival at a cost of Rs100 crore. However, nothing moved thereafter, as HAL refused to release the funds. The intervenor pointed out that MAPL, having World Health Organisation compliant facility, can manufacture 2,580 lakh tablets, 656 lakh capsules, 302 lakh dry injectable (vials), and 71 lakh liquid injectables per annum. During this pandemic, the factory could be once again put to use for manufacturing medicines, lifesaving drugs and vaccines. He said all former employees and their association were willing to offer their services to resume production. The public sector undertaking has HAL as a major shareholder with 59% stake, while SICOM and IDBI hold 33% and 8% stake respectively. After its net worth turned negative in 1995-96, the company was referred to the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) and IDBI was appointed as operating agency. The BIFR declared it as a sick unit after it accumulated losses of Rs156 lakh in 1996. As both BIFR and Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (AAIFR) couldn’t formulate MAPL’s revival scheme, it was closed down. It, however, led to retrenchment of over 300 employees and thousands of others from ancillary industries from Vidarbha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-seeks-reply-from-state-centre-in-plea-to-revive-govt-drug-manufacturer-mapl/articleshow/82394914.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||State removes restrictions on mahua flowers for tribals||Nagpur: In a bid to provide employment opportunities and empower tribals, the Maharashtra government on Tuesday removed all restrictions on the collection, sale and transport of mahua flowers.Tribals in the state have been exempted from permit or pass for the collection, purchase, transport, sale, or possession of any quantity of mahua flowers. To prevent non-tribals from taking undue advantage of the proposed free trade in moha, conditions continue to be imposed vide provision under Rule 5 of Mahua Flower Rules 1950 for grant of licence in Form ‘MF-I’ & ‘MF-2’ for sanctions of licence for trade.The restrictions for tribals have been removed based on the recommendations of the six-member Vikas Kharge committee set up on February 8, 2016. Now there will be no restrictions on the collection and sale of mahua by tribals. Mahua being a forest produce, it needs a transit pass (TP) but the condition was already removed in 2017.As mahua flowers are used to produce liquor on a large scale, its trade is governed by the provisions of the Bombay Prohibition Act 1949 & Bombay Mahua Flowers Rules 1950. Due to restrictions, tribals were allowed to collect moha for their bonafide domestic use and can also store up to 25 kg, while non-tribals were allowed to store up to 5 kg.During the open period, relaxation for storing and trade of mahua for tribals was permitted by the excise department up to 75kg while for non-tribals it was 25kg. Now, these restrictions will be removed for tribals. As per the recommendations, now licence will be required for the trade of moha but only tribal self-help groups (SHGs) and recognized tribal development bodies will only get the licence.As per the GR, the maximum annual limit of the licence has been fixed at 500 quintals. State wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre hailed the decision stating that mahua flowers were mostly used to produce illicit liquor but the latest move will help boost processing units based on mahua.According to APCCF (NTFP) TK Choubey, the government has already approved setting up of five mahua processing units to produce various food products in Nagpur, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Dhule and Amravati circles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-removes-restrictions-on-mahua-flowers-for-tribals/articleshow/82394971.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

He was 99. He is survived by two daughters. Kalyanam’s younger daughter Nalini said that he breathed his last at her residence in Padur on Old Mahabalipuram Road in the city at 3.30pm. “He died of age-related ailments. He passed away at home, but we have to give him oxygen support,” she said. Kalyanam’s last rites will be performed at Besant Nagar crematorium in Chennai at 1.30pm on Wednesday. Born in Shimla on August15,1922, he was associated with Mahatma Gandhi from 1944 to 1948. According to Kalyanam’s biographer Kumari S Neelakandan, he was in Sevagram Ashram in Maharashtra and was engaged in compiling the letters sent to Mahatma Gandhi in various languages. Kalyanam was last witness to Gandhi’s killing Neelakandan said, “Perhaps, he was the only living witness to Bapu’s assassination. When I asked how far he was from the Father of Nation during the assassination, Kalyanam said he was a few inches away from the Mahatma.” Kalyanam was preserving letters written by Gandhiji, a cheque bearing his sign and other literature associated with him. “One of his last letters was on schooling the Congress,” Neelakandan said. A cheque for ₹35 issued to him by Gandhiji was one of Kalyanam’s valuable possessions. Kalyanam was proficient in Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Tamil and English. A staunch follower of Mahatma Gandhi, he was also associated with Rajaji in the 1960s. “After the demise of Mahatma Gandhi, he was associated with the Red Cross and regional commissioner of the SC/ST commission covering the southern states,” he said. During the past two decades, Kalyanam was actively engaged in gardening, numismatics and stamp collection. “Some of Gandhiji’s practices that Kalyanam followed till his last days were waking up at 4am and emulating his humbleness and simplicity,” Neelakandan said. Kalyanam had donated a few crores of rupees towards philanthropic activities in Chennai including health sector, he added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/gandhijis-ex-personal-secretary-dies-in-chennai-at-99/articleshow/82397184.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

As many as 65 employees were transferred by the general administration department on Monday. The order has made five mutual transfers, in addition to transferring several employees to posts within the secretariat as well as those in several organizations outside. Those who have been shunted out of the secretariat have been transferred to organizations like state higher education council, RTI commission, Norka Roots, IMG, minority commission, council for food research and development, commission for backward classes, DHS, directorate of scheduled tribes, Kerala warehousing corporation, MDB, Kerafed, Kerala House in New Delhi, Matsyafed, Kollam fashion technology institute, Natpac, centre for continuing education, higher secondary directorate, youth welfare board, printing directorate and Munnar engineering college. A majority of those who have been transferred are members of pro-UDF associations. “Most of those who have been transferred to offices outside the Secretariat are from pro-UDF employee unions. It is a usual practise followed in such transfer matters to send employees of unions that are not in power to comparatively lessrelevant posts or other offices outside the secretariat,” said additional secretary J Bency who is also the president of pro-Congress employee organization Kerala Secretariat Association. Sources at secretariat said that these transfers also ensure promotion for employees at secretariat. “Once an employee is promoted, he is transferred on deputation to an organization outside, so that the person below him is elevated. In most cases, employees of the pro-ruling front are retained in the Secretariat,” said a senior official with the general administration department. Sources added that the order was kept ready during the election period and was issued on May 3, immediately after ensuring that the LDF government has retained power. However, pro-CPM employee unions dismissed malintentions in the promotiontransfer order. “There is no politics in the said order for the transfer and promotion of employees. It was issued on May 3 so that it is not delayed till the new cabinet comes, which would mean a wait till May 18. There are four employees who would retire on May 31 who are awaiting promotions, which would mean that if the order is delayed till then, they would get only 10 days in the post. There are employees from both unions in the transfer list,” said additional secretary P Honey, who is also the president of pro-CPM Kerala Secretariat employees’ association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-massive-transfer-of-employees-at-secretariat/articleshow/82397180.cms||KP Saikiran

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore viral deaths, cremations don’t match||COIMBATORE: There seems to be a mismatch in the number of Covid-19 deaths declared by the state government and the number of bodies cremated or buried as per the Covid-19 protocol in Coimbatore district. According to government’s media bulletin, the number of people who died due to the infection between April 26 and May1 in the district was13. But the number of people cremated/buried in Coimbatore city as per Covid-19 protocol for the same period was more than 210. People who died of coronavirus within the city limits were cremated at four places –Athupalam, Nanjundapuram, Kavundampalayam and Chokkampudur — and buried at multiple burial grounds including the ones at Selvapuram, Poo Market, Podanur, Kovaipudur and Sugunapuram. According to the data collected by TOI, 205 people were cremated in crematoriums and five people were buried in one burial ground following Covid-19 protocols in the city over six days. There is also a time lapse between the actual date of death and updating the fatality in the media bulletin. On an average, a crematorium receives at least10 to12 bodies in a day and health officials are worried that the numbers would go up in the coming days. Till date, Coimbatore has recorded 733 Covid deaths and 84,206 virus cases. Many come to govt hosps when it’s late Going by this date, the death rate is just 0.9% which is extremely low. Ahealthsourcesaid, “As many as140 bodies of Covid patients were sent from Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) between April 26 and May 1 and on average, at least 22 such bodies are being sent out of the hospital. The main reason for such a high number of deaths is people are referred by private hospitals to CMCH at the last minute when saving them becomes difficult. If only they would havecomeearlier,they wouldhavebeen saved.” Thesourcesaid, “Closeto40% of thebodies belong to outsiders who have been undergoing treatment in the district. As it is risky to take the bodies to their respective districts, they werecremated/buriedin thedistrictitself.People from all the districts in the western region and some from other southern/central districts visit the city for treatment.” Last Friday, volunteers from Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazagham buried three bodies. On the same day, the Popular Front of India buriedthebody of a60-year-old manfrom Palani andJeeva Shanthy trustburiedthebody of a60-year-old manfrom thecity. Whilethe volunteers confirm they died on the same day, there was no mention of them in the media bulletin. An official from the health wing of the corporation said that they do not include the namesof the peoplebelongingtoother districts in the district’s count. Even going by their stand, there is amismatch between the data. When contacted, deputy director of public health G Ramesh Kumar said, “There are instanceswhere peopledieduetoother complications after they were declared negative. Such deaths are considered as Covid-19 deaths. We are transparent.” The district collector S Nagarajan refused to comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coimbatore-viral-deaths-cremations-dont-match/articleshow/82397207.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The girl had approached cops a few days ago after Virsinh Damor began abusing her family by messaging them on mobile phone. According to the police, Damor had been harassing the 22-year-old woman for the past five months. “He began sending her messages on her mobile phone and often abused her. Damor also sent vulgar photographs to the complainant many times,” said Hardik Makadia, ACP (cybercrime). Damor, 24, a college dropout and resident of Santrampur taluka, also made fake Instagram accounts in the name of the complainant and even uploaded her photos on it. He later sent friend request to the complainant’s friend through the fake Instagram accounts. Accused also sent abusive messages to the family of the complainant’s fiancée. “Damor who works in a firm, is a neighbour of the woman who had shifted to Vadodara from Mahisagar a few months ago. They were in a relationship, but separated. He created the fake profile with the intention of breaking her engagement.

NZP officials were informed by the Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) orally that the RT-PCR tests of these lions were positive. MP is home to the highest number of tigers in the country (526), and several other species. Officials say, the zoos, tiger reserves, national parks, sanctuaries and safaris were already on alert following an advisory from the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) regarding possibility of spread of Covid-19 virus among wild animals and deaths of lions. “With Hyderabad zoo lions testing positive we would be more cautious. However, there won’t be any random testing. Collecting samples from lions and tigers in the zoo is not that easy. It will cause undue stress on them. But if we find any of them sick, we will follow the protocol,” says Upendra Yadav, of Gwalior zoo, which hosts lions, tigers and leopards along with several other wild animals. MoEF advisory, which was sent to MP among other states, calls for reducing human-animal interface citing reports of animals contracting the disease from both symptomatic and asymptomatic human carriers of Covid-19. It says, field functionaries must be Covid-19 negative when they are deputed for duties and should follow Covidappropriate behavior. Besides, the constitution of a taskforce/rapid action force with field managers, veterinary doctors and frontline staff has been advised to manage the situation as quickly as possible. Officials have also been asked to set up essential services for emergency treatment of animals and their safe release back to natural habitats as and when required. Also, the advisory mentions enhancing disease surveillance, mapping and monitoring systems through coordinated efforts amongst various departments. The MoEF has asked chief wildlife wardens of all states and Union territories to close down the national parks/ sanctuaries and other protected areas to tourists immediately and also to take all preventive measures to stop the transmission and spread of the virus from humans to animals and vice-versa. The advisory says “In view of spread of Covid-19 in the country and reports of deaths of lions due to Covid-19, it is felt that there are possibilities of spread of the virus amongst animals in national parks/sanctuaries and other protected areas and also transmission of virus from human to animals and vice-versa.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-zoos-tiger-reserves-on-alert/articleshow/82397218.cms||---

But the scene on Tuesday at the city’s premier 3,800-bed Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital was something I have never seen before – not even when the city was hit by natural calamities. Patients were struggling for breath and their relatives were crying for help. “My husband needs high flow oxygen, this is not enough,” cried a woman at around 1pm. After nearly 20 minutes, a stretcher moved the patient into the emergency room of tower III. Doctors told his wife that she should accompany him. There were at least 15 ambulances parked inside the hospital. Other patients waited inside private cars, cabs and autorickshaws. Some just sat or lay down wherever they could. By 1.30pm, a hospital employee, who sat at the entrance and took down the patients’ names, clinical details and time of entry, asked the security guards to close the gates. “There is no more space here. Please ask ambulance drivers to line them up on the road. We will let them in as soon as we clear beds,” he said. Within the next ten minutes there were four ambulances at the gate. “My wife is critical. I want doctors to see her,” said a man opening the doors of an ambulance. Inside was a woman in her mid-thirties. “Her oxygen level is dangerously low. Please let me in,” he said. Some people complained that patients in private ambulances were given priority and those in 108 were being pushed behind. The cries were louder on the other side of the Covid tower block, where bodies were being moved into the mortuary. At least seven bodies, packed in body bags, were moved to the mortuary in less than an hour. Relatives crowded the mortuary counters for early release. “Here, take this card,” a ward boy told a wailing relative. “Don’t bother waiting for the free hearse. Book this guy. I will ensure early release of the body,” he said. Most private hearses charged between ₹4000 and ₹18,000 to ferry bodies to different crematoriums. Desperate relatives paid whatever the ward boys and hearse services asked. It reminded me of what a policeman posted at the hospital told me a couple of days ago: “The number of deaths that happen in Covid wards is a lot more than what you see in the press releases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-between-last-hope-and-first-wail-life-hangs-in/articleshow/82397219.cms||---

Every other Bengalurean undergoing Covid-19 test is turning positive: the city's positivity rate touched an all-time high of 55% on Monday. The rate improved to 33% a day later. Active cases breached the three-lakh mark. On Tuesday, the city reported 20,870 Covid-positive cases and 132 deaths out of Karnataka's total count of 44,632 fresh infections and an all-time high of 292 deaths. Read AlsoKarnataka: Oxygen distribution needs robust systemThe deaths of Covid-19 patients in Chamarajanagar and Kalaburagi hospitals in less than 24 hours due to non-availability of medical oxygen have exposed the lack of a sturdy distribution mechanism as well as official bungling.Small hospitals reported two deaths on Tuesday following oxygen shortage. Major hospitals continued to turn away critical patients for lack of beds. Covid-19 vaccination plummeted to less than 10k per day. Coronavirus live updatesBengaluru's average of 20,000 positive cases per day comes at a time when the authorities have consciously decided to reduce testing from 1 lakh tests per day to around 40,000/60000 daily.   Though political and bureaucratic circles have been trying to build a narrative around the double-mutant virus and how aggressive it has become in the recent weeks, the reality is that the hunt for ICU beds and oxygen is taking a toll on Covid-positive persons and their families. "This is definitely not the time for anyone to get Covid in Bengaluru," said the brother of a 44-year-old man, who died at his residence three days ago after failing to get an ICU bed. Sources in the health department told that helplines get around 4,500 calls per day and 1,500-1,700 of them are queries related to hospitalisation. Around 500-550 calls pertain to ICU beds and ICU ventilators. In fact, non-availability of hospital beds for the common man took a political turn on Tuesday when Bengaluru South's BJP MP Tejasvi Surya and three BJP MLAs alleged that there was a bed-blocking scam and more Covid-19 patients could have been saved had the BBMP been more efficient and competent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-positivity-rate-hits-55-active-cases-cross-3l-mark/articleshow/82397223.cms||Rakesh Prakash
---||Chandigarh||Donate blood before Covid shot, say medicos as blood banks dry up||Amritsar: Doctors and blood banks have raised concerns over shortage of blood in the absence of donation camps, an essential component of health services. They have urged people, especially those in the age group of 18 to 45 years, to donate blood before getting vaccinated. Dr Sarabdeepak Singh Riar, in-charge, blood bank, Jallianwala Bagh Memorial Civil Hospital said they had a deficit of 6 to 8 units of blood every day. He said earlier, they used to give around 25 units of blood a day but now they could only 12 to 14 units. Saying that almost every blood bank in the state faced the predicament, he said, “To cope overcome deficit, we are requesting people from 18 to 45 years of age to donate before vaccination because after vaccination it is not advisable to donate blood for the next 60 days.” Conceding to the disruption in normal blood supply, managing director, Hartej Hospital Dr H S Nagpal said the blood was required in case of trauma, gynaecological isssues etc. “In a few cases, donors accompanying patients met the demand but many times, there are no donors with the patient or the same blood group is not available. Then blood has to be arranged from an outside source,” he explained. Dr Avtar Singh, managing director, Amandeep Medicity said the saving grace was that the demand for blood had also decreased due to deferral of elective surgeries and lesser trauma cases. “Despite this, there is a scarcity of blood and we are barely managing,” he said. Doctors in private hospitals also gave a representation to the deputy commissioner about poor oxygen supply and sought to put a cap on the price of oxygen cylinder. “Earlier, an oxygen cylinder was available for Rs 210 but now it is being sold for around Rs 600,” he said. When asked about the overall Covid-19 cases in the district, Dr Nagpal said there were indications of improvement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/donate-blood-before-covid-shot-say-medicos-as-blood-banks-dry-up/articleshow/82394363.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Chennai also reported the highest number of new cases — 6,228 cases, followed by 1,608 in Chengalpet, 1,509 in Coimbatore and 1,152 cases in Tiruvallur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-logs-over-21000-new-cases/articleshow/82397237.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Elections over, fuel prices start going north again||Kolkata: Marathon elections over, fuel prices have started rising after more than two months. A day after the poll results were declared in Bengal, and in three other states and a Union Territory, petrol became dearer by 17 paise a litre and diesel by 21 paise a litre. On Tuesday, a litre of petrol cost Rs 90.76 and a litre of diesel Rs 83.78 in the city. In Kolkata, petrol and diesel rates had reached an all-time high of Rs 91.76/litre and Rs 84.54/litre, respectively, on February 20. The issue being a thorny one amid elections, prices dropped steadily thereafter except on February 27, when petrol became costlier by 24 paise a litre and diesel by 15 paise. Prices plunged dramatically from March 24 with the first phase of the eight-phase Bengal polls being held on March 27. In fact, between March 25 and April 15, both petrol and diesel rates dropped four times by a total of 74 paise/litre. Since transportation costs of everything — from vegetables to vaccines — depend on fuel prices, citizens are likely to feel the pinch while buying essentials now. The small increase or decrease in fuel rates may look otherwise insignificant, but weighs a lot in the transport sector. For every paisa increase, transportation costs rise by 1%, said Sajal Ghosh, the secretary of Federation of West Bengal Trucks Operators Associations. The fuel price hike has also put bus operators at a disadvantageous position. “Passengers and transporters have been worst-hit by the pandemic. We were struggling to operate buses under the old fare structure. The state government did not revise fares because of the polls. We have no other option but to stop plying buses unless fares are now revised,” said Tapan Bandyopadhyay, secretary of Joint Council of Bus Syndicates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/elections-over-fuel-prices-start-going-north-again/articleshow/82395034.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

On the inaugural day, around 350 persons were served packed lunch, which comprises rice, dal, chicken curry and vegetables along with bottles of mineral water. Speaking on the occasion, Ranchi archbishop Felix Toppo said, "God has been good to us and this goodness needs to be shared with the less fortunate, especially at this difficult moment." Bishop of Ranchi, Theodore Mascarenhas, stressed that the church will continue to work for the poor and help the needy as long as possible. "We are living in a very difficult time and the pandemic shows no signs of ebbing. This free lunch service has been made possible because of the generosity of good people who are contributing voluntarily to the cause. The church will continue this service daily, as long as it can, since those attending their sick ones, admitted at Rims have neither time nor resources to prepare meals for themselves," Mascarenhas said. The free lunch distribution is being conducted adhering to all government rules and regulations of social distancing and public safety, he said. Responding to a query, Mascarenhas said a beginning was made with around 350 people and the number would be enhanced to 1,000 plus in the coming days. "We appeal to all citizens of Ranchi to join and support us in this worthy cause. Anyone can help by approaching us," he added. The free lunch boxes are distributed by the Ranchi Catholic Youth volunteers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/catholic-church-launches-free-lunch-service-kin-of-rims-patients/articleshow/82394192.cms||Tapas Biswas

Nadda will then meet the 77 newly elected MLAs, 18 MPs and state BJP office-bearers to dissect the election results and take stock of post-poll political violence. The main purpose of the meeting is to send out a message to party ranks that the central BJP leadership stands solidly with them. A host of BJP national general secretaries are expected to visit Bengal in the wake of the post-poll violence. “Our party karyakartas will reach out to victim families across the state,” Nadda said on Tuesday. The BJP bagged the support of 2.28 crore voters in Bengal. State party leaders will push the “Sonar Bangla cause” and launch a campaign to tell people how things are unfolding as they had feared. The central leaders are also going to take a call on whether the newly elected BJP MLAs will take oath amid “violence and arson continuing unabated” in the state. “We will stand as one against the ruling Trinamool,” Nadda said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nadda-to-stage-dharna-at-bjps-kol-hq-today/articleshow/82395006.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Baby with rare condition to get Rs 16 crore jab||VADODARA: Four-months-old Dhaiiryarajsinh Rathod whose rare life-threatening medical condition needed a Rs 16 crore injection will eventually get the shot on Wednesday. The money for the injection was raised through crowdfunding online as well as by various groups in the state. Rajdipsinh Rathod and Jinal Rathod were left with no choice but to approach citizens for help when they learnt that the drug Zolgensma used to treat the Spina Muscular Atropy Type 1 would cost Rs 16crore. It would also have invited customs duty of Rs 5-6 crore. Rajdipsinh said that an amount of Rs 16.13crore had been raised for Dhairyarajsinh. “The additional amount will be spent towards his hospitalization, follow-up treatment and other expenses,” he said. Dhairyarajsinh was admitted to a hospital in Mumbai on Tuesday and the drug will be administered on Wednesday. He will be discharged after keeping him in observation for a day. The family had begun approaching people and a portal that raises funding for such needy persons. The government also waived off the customs duty for the injection after requests from various quarters. “We were able to raise the money in 42 days. Even we had not expected that this would happen so fast. Dhairyaraj had to be given the injection before he was one-year-old. Else, he would have developed breathing trouble,” said Rajdipsinh, who works for a private company in Godhra. The family belongs to Kanesar village in Mahisaggar district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/baby-with-rare-condition-to-get-rs-16cr-jab/articleshow/82393167.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Form all-party task force to tackle pandemic: Left parties||Ranchi: Concerned with the high number of Covid-19 deaths in the state, Left parties on Tuesday demanded setting up of an all-party task force to tackle the problem. In a joint statement, CPI, CPM and CPI(M-L) and MCC said people in the state are panic-stricken because of the severity of the virus during the second wave apart from lack of beds, oxygen and Remdesivir. While Jharkhand is struggling with the pandemic, the central government has left the state to its fate, the statement rued. CPI(M-L) state secretary Janardhan Prasad said, "The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on people. A large number of the rural populace is also affected by the viral infection. Under the situation, it is not wise to depend solely on the bureaucracy to handle the pandemic." He demanded that the government must provide comprehensive treatment facilities at block, sub-division and district levels." Prasad added that as Prime Minister Narendra Modi was focused in winning the election in West Bengal, the second wave has reflected the lack of preparedness of the government to handle the pandemic. Alleging that the Union government was discriminatory against Jharkhand in the distribution of vaccines, the Left parties also demanded that the Centre must provide more doses to Jharkhand. Moreover, the vaccination centres should be increased to avoid the rush, they said. The parties added that test reports of RT-PCR should be given within 24 hours and also increase the number of testing. The government should also provide food and medicines to people living in home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/form-all-party-task-force-to-tackle-pandemic-left-parties/articleshow/82394196.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||‘Concerned’ PM calls guv on state violence||Kolkata: PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday called up state governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to enquire about the post-poll violence in Bengal. “PM called and expressed... concern at the worrisome law-and-order situation. I share the grave concerns,” Dhankhar later tweeted. The BJP claimed nine workers had been killed in Bengal since Sunday’s announcement of election results. “The Trinamool is full of intolerance. I have never seen such post-poll violence,” BJP national president J P Nadda said. Former RS MP and losing Tarakeswar candidate Swapan Dasgupta tweeted “reports of molestation or worse of women” and tagged Union home minister Amit Shah. But Birbhum SP Nagendranath Tripathi denied “any instance of rape”. “There have been incidents of violence and arson and every case is being investigated,” he said. “I have alerted everyone that it was fake news”. Kolkata cops have registered a murder case in the Beliaghata incident in which 30-year-old BJP trade union leader Abhijit Sarkar was killed on Sunday night. Nadda visited the family on Tuesday. The Congress and CPM, too, slammed the post-poll violence. Congress Bengal minder Jitin Prasada called it “unacceptable” and CPM secretary Sitaram Yechury questioned why the Trinamool had “unleashed such mayhem”. A National Commission for Women team, headed by chairperson Rekha Sharma, will be visiting Nandigram to probe allegations of violence against women. A National Human Rights Commission team, too, will be visiting the state. Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday termed BJP’s allegations of violence as “propaganda” and said she had appealed for “peace and calm” and all her party workers had been told to remain at home. Iterating her claim that BJP was trying to “create communal riots”, Banerjee told a private television channel: “They are trying to create confusion with fake videos.” Hooghly police said they were questioning two persons for possible involvement in the murder of Gopal Patra. Of the other four deaths, a 54-year-old Trinamool worker was stabbed to death in East Burdwan while returning home late on Monday. Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien said: “BJP IT cell could have given trolls some time off after results. All cases on social media are BJP intra-party fights. There are three BJP factions in Bengal and they hate each other.” Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra questioned the veracity of some social media posts by senior BJP leaders. “One leader posted claiming 1,000 families in Nanoor where out on the streets. Did he mean 40,000 people were out on the streets and none saw? It is a fake news factory. During elections, they insinuated against Bengal by their infiltrator, Kashmir and Rohingya barbs. But people voted for TMC, for they could see the difference between reality and fiction,” she said. Former Union minister and Trinamool vice-president Yashwant Sinha said: “Mamata has not even been sworn in yet, the BJP has already started its political machinations by holding nationwide dharna against her. What about Covid, my dear chaps? Or even that does not matter before your politics. Shame, shame.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/concerned-pm-calls-guv-on-state-violence/articleshow/82396127.cms||---
---||Ranchi||CM launches emergency 02 supply service for hospitals in Ranchi||RANCHI: Chief minister Hemant Soren on Tuesday inaugurated the Sanjivani Vahan service in Ranchi to provide oxygen cylinders to the city’s private hospitals for Covid patients in case of emergencies. Flagging off three trucks at his Kanke Road residence, Soren said, “The trucks will be loaded with jumbo oxygen cylinders and will be ready to move at a moment’s notice. In case a hospital runs out of oxygen supplies, the trucks will replenish their stock.” The Ranchi district administration has been mandated by the National Health Mission’s Jharkhand chapter to keep 150 modified jumbo industrial oxygen cylinders at all times for the service. As many as 100 of the total cylinders will be stocked at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) and the remaining 50 will be kept at the Risaldar Baba Urban Community Health Center in Doranda. While the trucks will be equipped with GPS trackers, four drivers have also been deputed for round the clock duty. The administration has deputed three para teachers each at Rims and at the Doranda CHC to coordinate with the hospitals in case of exigencies. Jharkhand has so far maintained steady supply of oxygen at the hospitals. “But we have to remain prepared so that incidents like Delhi, Gujarat and Karnataka, where patients died at hospitals due to lack of oxygen, do not happen here,” a senior health official said. “We are working towards ensuring unhindered oxygen supplies at the hospitals. But many hospitals suddenly complain of oxygen shortages as the number of patients on oxygen support increases. Then there is panic everywhere,” Soren said. He said that the service will be opened in Jamshedpur and Dhanbad in the coming days. After Ranchi, the two industrial towns are worst hit in the second wave of the pandemic. District transport officer Praveen Prakash, who has been appointed the nodal officer for the service, said they did not get any calls from the city’s private hospitals on the first day. However, one of the six para-teachers deputed in the service did not join duty as he is in home isolation after getting infected with on April 18. “The teacher has informed the administration in writing. His replacement is being arranged,” Prakash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cm-launches-emergency-02-supply-service-for-hospitals-in-ranchi/articleshow/82394194.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: After swearing-in sans pomp, Mamata Banerjee to focus on Covid control||KOLKATA: Mamata Banerjee, who will take oath for the third straight term as chief minister on Wednesday, is likely to lay down the roadmap for Bengal’s battle against Covid immediately after a pared-down swearing-in. After the programme at Raj Bhavan at 10.45am — shorn of pomp because of the pandemic — Banerjee is scheduled to head directly to Nabanna, where she will most probably chair her first meeting to deliberate on Covid-control measures. Senior bureaucrats and medical experts are likely to attend her first meeting, in which several Covid-control issues and vaccine procurement modalities will be discussed. Sources said one of the most important things on the agenda would be how to flatten the Covid curve in surge zones in Kolkata and North 24-Parganas, and ways to ease pressure on healthcare facilities that are getting overwhelmed. Another important point would be a route-map for vaccine-procurement and a potential rollout in state facilities immediately. Banerjee has repeatedly said that Covid was her first priority, “and everything else will have to wait”, even telling senior officials who called on her that nothing else mattered more than saving lives. At the meet, Banerjee is also likely to touch on the rollout modalities for the ambitious basic income scheme for women heads of 1.6 crore Bengal households — a key promise in the Trinamool poll manifesto — which has a proposed budgetary layout of Rs 12,900 crore. Banerjee said the swearing-in ceremony would be a “small function”, limited to a few people. Invites have gone out from Raj Bhavan to several prominent people, among them BCCI president Sourav Ganguly and senior state assembly leaders. Others present would be Abhishek Banerjee, Subrata Bakshi and actor Dev, along with poll strategist Prasant Kishor. Former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Left Front leader Biman Bose, state Congress president Adhir Chowdhury and former opposition leader Abdul Mannan are also on the list of invitees. Bhattacharjee is unlikely to attend, as he has not been keeping well; Chowdhury said he hadn’t received any invite. Invites have also gone out to BJP state president Dilip Ghosh and the party leader in the outgoing assembly, Manoj Tigga. Ghosh is unlikely to attend, party sources said. The BJP will hold a nationwide stir in protest against “attacks” on its party workers in Bengal, which will coincide with Banerjee’s first day in office. In 2016, too, BJP had chosen to stage a similar protest. Senior TMC functionaries Partha Chatterjee, Subrata Bakshi and Firhad Hakim are likely to be among the attendees. However, sources indicated that only Banerjee is likely to be sworn in on Wednesday. Raj Bhavan also did not release any official communique on any cabinet ministers being sworn in. It is likely that cabinet portfolios may be allocated after MLAs are sworn in from Thursday. “The cabinet allocations may be done only from Sunday,” said a source. Cabinet allocations for the Mamata Banerjee government, in its third term, assumes significance after several key ministers defected to BJP ahead of the polls. Between Suvendu Adhikari and Rajib Banerjee, there were four cabinet berths. Two ministers from North Bengal have lost the polls. Former finance minister Amit Mitra and senior minister Purnendu Bose did not contest the polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-swearing-in-sans-pomp-didi-to-focus-on-covid-control/articleshow/82396045.cms||---

---||Kolkata||It’s just BJP’s attempt to impose President rule: TMC||KOLKATA: The Trinamool Congress on Tuesday accused the BJP of “growing desperate for President’s Rule” and instigating “communal clashes” in Bengal after being rejected by voters. Five of its workers had died in post-poll violence, Trinamool leaders said. “The BJP is trying to create communal clashes after losing the poll. We will not let that happen,” Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee said, adding the violence was largely limited to places where BJP candidates had won. “Law-and-order was their (the Centre’s) baby till Monday. I will take oath on Wednesday and tackle the situation,” she told a television channel on Tuesday. “All the trips by (BJP national president) JP Nadda did not help the BJP win the election,” Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra said. “Yet another trip to try for President’s Rule? They know they can never get a popular mandate in Bengal. So they are desperate,” she added. Trinamool’s RS leader Derek O’Brien, referring to PM Modi’s call to governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Tuesday morning, tweeted: “Stop the stunts, Mr Prime Minister. Work the phones on Covid.” A 48-year-old TMC worker was murdered in Tarakeswar’s Chowtara by BJP supporters, TMC leaders said, taking to five the number of their party workers killed in post-poll violence. Four more died in East Burdwan and Khanakul in Hooghly, they added. Chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay, home secretary HK Dwivedi, state DGP P Nirajnayan and Kolkata Police commissioner Soumen Mitra called on Banerjee at her Kalighat home on Tuesday. BJP national president J P Nadda was in Kolkata on Tuesday afternoon and paid a visit to a wailing mother at her Beliaghata home after her second son, Abhijit Sarkar, died in post-poll violence. “I came to Abhijit Sarkar’s house today. His mother was wailing while some Trinamool leaders are discounting these incidents as stunts,” Nadda said after stepping out of Sarkar’s home. The BJP president also visited the Pratap Nagar house (near Narendrapur) of party activist Haran Adhikari, who too died in post-poll violence. Another BJP activist Basudev Adhikari was rushed to hospital with critical injuries. Bengal BJP has prepared a list of 273 incidents of violence, arson and molestation over the last three days in which nine people lost their lives and thousands across districts were forced to flee their homes. At a virtual press conference, BJP leaders Sambit Patra and Anirban Ganguly named a host of party workers — Uttam Ghosh from Ranaghat, Hiranmoy Sana from Bongaon, Gourav Sarkar from Bolpur, Mintu Burman from Sitalkuchi, other than Sarkar, who had captured the torture in his Facebook post before he died. In Chopra, houses of BJP karyakartas were set on fire. Party candidate Gobordhan Das’ house at Purbasthali Uttar in East Burdwan was bombed and ransacked. BJP leader Swapan Dasgupta has appealed to the Calcutta High Court’s chief justice to take suo motu action, directing the administration to stop “wave of political recriminations in West Bengal”. Left women’s wing AIDWA has named 11 Left activists, including Sanjukta Morcha polling agent from Jamalpur Kakoli Kshetrapal, who died in post-poll violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/its-just-bjps-attempt-to-impose-prez-rule-tmc/articleshow/82396142.cms||---

A total of 400 cylinders have been collected over the last three days and 400 more are likely to be collected in the next few days. The endeavour was started by Jalandhar Industrial Focal Point Extension Association and Udyog Nagar Manufacturers Association, Gadaipur on April 1. They fixed a target of collecting 800 cylinders and reached the halfway mark in three days. “Oxygen supply to the industry has already been stopped and our cylinders were lying empty. After Jalandhar deputy commissioner told us that not only oxygen but cylinders were also in short supply, we decided to collect the cylinders on our own,” said Narinder Singh Saggoo, president of Jalandhar Industrial Focal Point Extension Association. “As soon as we alerted the industrialists who use oxygen in their units and asked for cylinders, they readily agreed and started sending the cylinders. Some are even offering to contribute financially to gather more resources,” he added. “Initially, we had to exhort industrial units but soon they themselves approaching to provide their cylinders. Our first priority is to contribute our resources to save lives, business and earnings can take a pause,” said Tejinder Singh Bhasin, president of Udyog Nagar Manufacturers Association, Gadaipur. “We need to have more cylinders in circulation and industry has been quick in contributing their cylinders,” said Jalandhar DC Ghanshyam Thori.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/industrial-units-in-jalandhar-pool-in-supplies-cylinders-to-hospitals/articleshow/82394487.cms||IP Singh

The current wave however has changed the picture drastically with 37% of the daily cases getting reported from outside eight municipal corporation areas. In villages, the pandemic has struck hard taking the people with limited health infrastructure and fewer doctors completely off guard. Comparing the last 30 days (April 5 to May 4) with previous 30 days (March 5 to April 4) reveal that the earlier share of non-municipal corporation areas was average 10%, which rose to an average 32%, recording rise of 22% in a month. “Challenges of rural areas are much bigger compared to their urban counterparts primarily due to lack of healthcare infrastructure,” said Bharat Patel, a resident of Kukarwada village in Mehsana. The village has reported 45-odd deaths due to suspected Covid-19 in the past 30 days. The village has a population of 14,000 and has about 200-odd active cases. “My own family has seen about 19 Covid cases one after another. I also lost my nephew to the pandemic.” Thus, villages like Gozariya are making their own infrastructure on war footing. “In the end of April, we set up this community-run care centre wherein 20 out of 50 beds are supplied with oxygen facility,” said Shobhna Shah, coordinator of the initiative. “The village of about 18,000 population has witnessed 14-odd deaths in the recent past. We might have about 80 active cases. The community came forward and implemented stringent rules about non-wearing of masks.” Somabhai Patel, sarpanch of Goghalu village near Prantij, said that they had imposed complete lockdown for15 days when the village of 3,500 lost 20 persons in the current wave. Night curfew, curbs extended to 36 cities Putting an end to speculations of a lockdown, the Gujarat government on Tuesday extended night curfew and restrictions to seven more cities. With this, 36 cities and towns of Gujarat will be under night curfew and other restrictions until May 12. However essential services will continue to function uninterrupted. The government said the state commercial tax department has been directed to carry out random surprise checks at all establishments to ensure they observe the 50% staff capacity norm. TNN Today we don’t allow gatherings even for weddings or funerals except close family members. It’s the only way to rein in a high number of cases,” he said. Even in clusters like Radhanpur, the patients are finding it difficult to secure a bed. Dr Piyush Nai, a local doctor, said that he had to provide oxygen at home of an 88-year old patient to sustain her. “The family could not get a vehicle to transfer her, when they did arrange for one, the hospitals had no beds even as her oxygen saturation was dropping below 70%. We thus pooled in resources and arranged for a cylinder,” he said. In Saurashtra, Rajpara village in Rajkot district witnessed high mortality due to covid in the last one month. The village with a population of 1,800 witnessed 30 deaths, said ND Jadeja, a village leader. “If anyone falls sick, one must travel 30 km to Rajkot city to get treatment,” he said. Experts also pointed at factors such as lack of isolation facility, transport and local doctors who can sustain patients till they get transferred to secondary or tertiary centres. Arun Mahesh Babu, DDO of Ahmedabad district, said that identifying the issue, the focus of the district administration is to increase isolation facilities and health check-ups on war footing. “Our purpose is to reduce mortality. We are also increasing oxygen supply in the next few days,” he said. The state government too has shifted focus towards the villages. "Containing Covid in villages is going to be a challenge especially when dealing with mutant virus as villagers tend to avoid testing or don't have access to testing. Fever is generally taken lightly and self-treated. By the time help is sought, the patient has become hypoxic and turn critical," said a senior public health consultant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rural-gujarat-hit-hard-records-22-hike-in-mortality-rate-in-30-days/articleshow/82397263.cms||Bharat Yagnik

After working for about half a century, he retired at 60. After 13 years of retirement, the pandemic has become the reason for Pattani's return to his field. “My son is MA, but he lost his job in the first wave during the lockdown. As we have seven persons to feed, I again approached my acquaintances in the field and landed the job,” he says, adding that he fills up about 400-450 cylinders a day. “The work has surely increased, with long queues outside the filling stations. We are doing our best to cater to the hospitals and individuals so that no one dies due to want of oxygen.” Pattani came to the field thanks to his brother who was working with a nationalized oil company’s oxygen manufacturing unit. “I started work in the early 1970s – the work was different then, and so was technology. This time around, it’s faster with a fully mechanized process. Sometimes it gets tiring, but I know that each cylinder I am sending out is saving someone’s life. It’s our job to do our bit in these testing times,” he says. His sister had got infected with Covid-19, but she survived the scare after turning critical. “Everyday we hear someone in our vicinity either testing positive or reporting their nears and dears dead. The past one year has turned me towards spirituality. I also give my time to a non-profit organization where we try to reach out to the Covid patients as our humanitarian duty,” says the septuagenarian.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-son-lost-job-in-covid-73-yr-old-back-at-oxygen-unit-work-to-feed-family-save-lives/articleshow/82397312.cms||Yogesh Chawda
---||India||Deaths due to oxygen shortage no less than genocide: HC||PRAYAGRAJ: Expressing its strong displeasure over death of Covid patients allegedly due to shortage of medical oxygen in Uttar Pradesh, the Allahabad high court on Tuesday said the authorities responsible for procurement and supply of the gas are committing criminal acts that are "not less than a genocide". While hearing a suo motu PIL on media reports that Covid patients had died in Lucknow and Meerut due to lack of oxygen, a bench of Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar said: "We are at pain in observing that death of Covid patients just for non-supply of oxygen to the hospitals is a criminal act and not less than a genocide by those who have been entrusted the task to ensure continuous procurement and supply chain of the liquid medical oxygen." The district magistrates of Lucknow and Meerut are directed to inquire about the deaths in their districts within 48 hours and submit reports on the next hearing, on May 7. Amid allegations that Covid protocol was not followed during the counting of votes in the panchayat polls in the state, the court also directed state election commission to produce CCTV footage of several counting centres by the next date of hearing. It said in case the SEC itself finds clear violation of Covid protocol in the footage, it should come up with an action plan. The bench also took notice of the death of a sitting judge of the high court due to Covid-19 and observed, "We have been informed that late Justice V K Srivastava was admitted initially in the morning of 23rd April, 2021 in Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Lucknow but he was not taken care of till evening and it was only around 7.30 pm when his condition deteriorated that he was placed on ventilator. It was on the same night that he was shifted to Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, where he was in ICU for five days and ultimately succumbed to the infection." The HC directed the state counsel to file an affidavit bringing on record the treatment given to late Justice VK Srivastava at RML Hospital and also to explain why he was not taken immediately to SGPGIMS, Lucknow immediately on the morning of April 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/deaths-due-to-oxygen-shortage-no-less-than-genocide-hc/articleshow/82397340.cms||Rajesh Pandey

The two-week curfew from April 27 is seen to have yielded partial results, with the government allowing many sectors, including manufacturing, construction and garments factories, to operate with 50% staff and vehicle movement virtually remaining unchecked. The Covid surge is also continuing probably because of people’s recent exodus from Bengaluru to the hinterlands due to the curfew. Experts have reportedly suggested chief minister BS Yediyurappa go in for a complete lockdown without any relaxation at least till May-end so that the pandemic starts receding by mid-June in other districts. They predict cases may start declining by this weekend. The cabinet met on Tuesday reportedly to deliberate the outcome of the present curfew and the possible steps after May 12. “We will take stock of the situation on May 10 and decide on the further course of action based on experts’ suggestions,” Yediyurappa told reporters after the cabinet meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-19-total-lockdown-in-karnataka-after-may-12-contemplated/articleshow/82397354.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab 6th pay panel recommends over two-fold hike in staff salaries||CHANDIGARH: In a bonanza for government employees, the 6th Pay Commission of the Punjab government has recommended more than two-fold increase in salaries of all employees with an increase in minimum pay from Rs 6,950 to Rs 18,000 per month. Once approved by the Punjab cabinet, the hike will be implemented with retrospective effect from January 1, 2016. The report, as per the government’s commitment in Vidhan Sabha, is to be implemented from July 1 this year. The commission, chaired by Jai Singh Gill, also recommended a substantial increase in allowances as well. The average increment in salaries and pensions of employees is expected in the range of 20%. All major allowances are proposed to be increased two-fold. The report, which was submitted to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on April 30, has been sent to the finance department for detailed study and directions for placing it before the cabinet this month. The report comes at a time when the state’s economy is already deeply stressed and the financial situation is precarious due to the pandemic with taxes not going up and even GST compensation slated to end from next year. As the recommendations of the commission would likely lead to an additional expenditure of Rs 3,500 crore per annum, the finance department will examine various implications of the recommendations made by the commission before submitting the report to the cabinet. A significant hike has been proposed in pensions and DA, while fixed medical allowance and death-cum-retirement gratuity are recommended to be doubled under the scheme suggested by the 6th Pay Commission. While fixed medical allowance has been recommended to be doubled to Rs 1,000 per month for employees as well as pensioners uniformly, the maximum limit of death-cum-retirement gratuity is proposed to be enhanced from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh. Enhancement in ex gratia grant rates in the case of death of a government employee, as also in case of death in harness directly attributable to the duty performed, is another key recommendation aimed at benefitting government employees. This is significant in view of the prevailing pandemic, where a large number of government employees are working as frontline workers, with many of them having lost their lives in the line of duty. The commission has recommended that the present system of dearness allowance on the central pattern should continue and dearness allowance be converted into dearness pay each time the index increases by 50%, to be counted for all purposes, including retirement benefits. Besides recommending a simple, transparent and easy to implement pay matrix for all Punjab government employees, the commission has suggested that old age allowance for pensioners and family pensioners, at the existing intervals of 5 years from the age of 65 years onwards should continue on revised pension. It has also recommended commutation of pension to be restored to 40%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-6th-pay-panel-recommends-over-two-fold-hike-in-staff-salaries/articleshow/82397366.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: II PU exam postponed; I PU cancelled, all to be promoted||BENGALURU: The II PU exam scheduled to start on May 24 has been postponed and new dates will be announced “with at least a 15-day notice”, Karnataka primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar said on Tuesday. The minister announced that all I PU students will be promoted to the next year. Around 6.8 lakh students are slated to take the II PU exam. Earlier, the practical exams were postponed and were supposed to be held two days after the theory exams concluded. Suresh Kumar said, “Parents, teachers, principals and student organisations, among other stakeholders, requested us to postpone the exam because of a surge in Covid-19 cases. Many students have gone back to their hometowns. Officials, including some from PU wing who co-ordinate for the exams, are busy with Covid work. Taking into consideration all these factors, we have decided to postpone the exam.” Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Punjab have already postponed their exams. Some parents say decision a relief but uncertainty loomsWe are aware of concerns of other pending exams like CET, JEE and NEET. Students should not be disheartened, but must stay safe at home and continue with preparation,” he said. The classes are available via YouTube. Efforts are on to beam them on DD Chandana. Announcing promotion of all I PU students, the minister said a bridge course will be provided for them in the beginning of next academic year. I PU curriculum was reduced by 30% this year. Many students and parents said the exam postponement decision came as a relief, but added it was demotivating to find kids preparing endlessly for an exam whose schedule is not known. “When will they write it? This will be a tough year given the uncertainty,” said Nisha C, mom of a II-year PU student. “The decision should have come earlier, saving parents and students stress. Other boards and states announced it at least a fortnight ago. Many II PU students are testing positive. On I PU exams, the department should have some kind of valuation and announce how markscards will be prepared,” said BR Supreet, secretary of Oxford College Ullal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-ii-pu-exam-postponed-i-pu-cancelled-all-to-be-promoted/articleshow/82397367.cms||---
