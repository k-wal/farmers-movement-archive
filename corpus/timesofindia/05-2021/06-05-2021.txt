---||India||Only President can pick backward classes, says SC, upholds 102nd amendment||NEW DELHI: In an important decision which could have wider ramifications, the Supreme Court by a majority declared on Wednesday that only the President (read the Centre) can take decisions on declaring socially and educationally backward communities for granting reservation and upheld the 102nd constitutional amendment denuding the power of states in this regard. A five-judge Constitution bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat was unanimous on the validity of the 102nd constitutional amendment but differed on its implication for recognising socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs). The majority, comprising Justices Rao, Gupta and Bhat, concluded that the amendment has taken away the power of states to decide on designating SEBCs and now only the President can take a decision. However, Justices Bhushan and Nazeer held that states can also identify SEBCs and there would be two lists – central and state lists – of backward communities as has been the practice for the last 68 years. State governments have been expanding the list of SEBCs, the official jargon for “OBC status”, which entitles the recipient community to quota benefits, and the verdict means states will now be restricted to making recommendations to the Centre in favour of the “aspiring” backwards. The response of the Centre to the verdict could be interesting. It had said the power to identify SEBCs lies with Parliament only with reference to the central list and states can have a separate lists. But the majority of the bench felt otherwise. “By introduction of Articles 366 (26C) and 342A through the 102nd amendment, the President alone, to the exclusion of all other authorities, is empowered to identify SEBCs and include them in a list to be published under Article 342A (1), which shall be deemed to include SEBCs in relation to each state and Union territory for the purposes of the Constitution. The states can, through their existing mechanisms, or even statutory commissions, only make suggestions to the President or the Commission under Article 338B, for inclusion, exclusion or modification of castes or communities,” Justice Bhat said. The 102nd amendment was brought to give constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes and Article 366(26C) and 342-A were introduced as per which the President can notify a class as SEBC. Justice Bhat said as per the amendment, there will be only one list and it “ can only be amended through a law enacted by Parliament”. Justice Bhushan, however, said backward classes were all this while being identified by the respective state governments which provided reservation under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) and the same should continue. “The Constitution Bench of Indra Sawhney held each state government is fully competent to identify backward classes and this is why the Sawhney (verdict) directed for appointment of a permanent body, both by Union as well as by the state, and consequently commissions were constituted— National Backward Classes Commission and State Backward Classes Commission. To reverse the entire scheme, a clear and explicit constitutional amendment, was necessary. There is no express indication in the 102nd constitutional amendment that the power of the state is being taken away,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/only-president-can-pick-backward-classes-says-sc-upholds-102nd-amendment/articleshow/82416330.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Kolkata||On Day 1 in office, Mamata Banerjee brings back cops EC had transferred||KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday effected a major reshuffle of the top brass of the state police, reinstating officers who were transferred after the Election Commission took over. Banerjee reinstated DGP Virendra and ADG (law & order) Jawed Shamim in two key changes, the announcements made in her first press conference after being sworn in as CM for the third straight term. The incumbents, DGP P Nirajnayan and ADG (law and order) Jag Mohan, were posted as DG (Fire Service) and director civil defence, respectively. Both Virendra and Shamim had been transferred by the poll panel. Virendra was posted as advisor West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited, while Shamim was posted as DG (Fire). The state home department also revoked the suspension of senior IPS officer Vivek Sahai, reinstating him as the director of security. The EC had acted against Sahai and immediately suspended him after the CM was injured in Nandigram during her campaign there on March 10. The District Officer (DM) of East Medinapur District, Vibhu Goyal, too was removed. “Our former DGP Virendra is now back. His retirement is in May. So he will be returning to his office for a few days. Jawed was ADG (law and order). He is being brought back. The present DG will be handling fire services and ADG (law and order) will handle civil defence,” Banerjee said at a press conference. Among the other major reshuffles, Gyanwant Singh — acting as director of security after Sahai’s suspension — has been made additional director of security. He will have the additional charge as ADG (armed police). Sanjay Singh will be the new ADG (Western zone). While Manoj Kumar Verma is back as CP Barrackpore, Ajay Kumar Thakur, the DIG Operations at CID, will be the new Asansol CP. Arnab Ghosh is the new CP of Chandannagar. The present CP of Chandannagar, Gaurav Sharma, has been made the new CP of Siliguri. It is the post in which he had served earlier. Two IPS officers — Mitesh Jain, CP of Asansol-Durgapur Police and Mukesh (DIG) Barasat Range — have been sent on compulsory waiting. The districts got 14 new SPs. Many of these officers were on compulsory waiting, effected by the EC.

---||India||Covid-19: Fresh cases at 4.13 lakh, deaths near 4,000 in a day||India's second Covid-19 wave turned even grimmer on Wednesday as both daily cases and deaths surged to new peaks. The country reported over 4.12 lakh new cases, 10,000 higher than the last peak, while the day's death toll climbed close to the 4,000 mark at 3,980. India recorded 4,12,784 new cases, by far the highest single-day count in any country so far. This was the second time that the tally breached the 4-lakh mark, after 4,02,351 infections were recorded on April 30. Alarmingly, the record surge in cases came out of a reduced number of tests conducted the previous day. On Tuesday, testing in the country had dropped to 15.4 lakh, down from 16.6 lakh on the previous day and 4 lakh less than last week's peak of 19.4 lakh tests conducted on April 30. As a result, the test positivity rate (TPR) for the last three days climbed to 24.4%, more than two percentage points higher than the rate on the same three days last week. TPR is the percentage of total tests that come out positive for the virus. A high TPR indicates higher prevalence of the infection as well as inadequate testing that allows more positive patients to go undetected. Deaths almost touched the 4,000 mark on Wednesday as at least five major states reported their highest fatalities in a single day. These included UP, where 357 deaths were recorded, Karnataka (346 fatalities), Punjab (182), Haryana (181) and Tamil Nadu (167). The toll in Maharashtra crossed 900 with 920 deaths reported in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, active cases in India crossed the 35-lakh mark, with more than 78,000 active cases being added to the tally on Wednesday. With daily cases staying over 3 lakh for 15 days now, recoveries have grown rapidly leading to a relatively lower rise in active cases over the past week. Amid a massive surge in infections, Karnataka reported 50,112 fresh cases on Wednesday, becoming the second state after Maharashtra to breach the 50,000 milestone in daily cases. Cases rose in Maharashtra as well, with the state recording 57,640 new infections, up from 51,880 on the previous day. Karnataka was among at least 12 states and UTs that recorded their biggest surge in daily cases. The others were Kerala (41,953 fresh cases), Tamil Nadu (23,310), Bengal (18,102), Punjab (8,015), Uttarakhand (7,783), Assam (4,826), J&K (4,716), Himachal (3,842), Goa (3,496), Puducherry (1,819) and Mizoram (238).

---||India||Supreme Court to Centre: No contempt, but deliver 700MT O2 to Delhi||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday disapproved of and stayed Delhi high court's contempt proceedings against the Centre and its senior bureaucrats over supply of medical oxygen to Delhi and said distribution of available oxygen needed a pan-India approach for equitable apportioning given spiralling Covid-19 cases in the country. When solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed the court that per capita allocation of oxygen to Delhi, that is allocation against the number of active cases, was higher compared to similarly placed states, the bench said it would review the requirement of 700 MT oxygen on Monday but asked the Centre to ensure supply till then. The SC said while Delhi HC would continue to monitor the ground situation on the management of Covid in Delhi on all aspects, from now on, the supply of oxygen to Delhi by the Centre would be outside its purview. The bench asked the Centre to inform by Thursday how it is going to maintain a steady flow of oxygen to all states. "Supply to one state (like Delhi) should not be at the cost of another state," the bench said, adding an important caveat. Solicitor general Mehta said the availability of oxygen was adequate to meet the demand but admitted a systemic failure in transportation logistics. "We are doing our best to meet the demand of Delhi, which as per the expert panel would be met with 415 MT of LMO but the Delhi government is continuing to increase its demand by the day, from 400 MT to now 900 MT. The supply of oxygen is rationed on an equitable basis keeping in mind the demand from other states," he added. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said the present formula of oxygen requirement of states on the basis of number of ICU and non-ICU oxygen beds, along with caseload, required revisiting by experts drawn from a wider cross-section of professionals, including hospital management experts.  The present mechanism was devised and monitored by Dr V K Paul of Niti Aayog, Dr Randeep Guleria of AIIMS, the director general of ICMR, and the director general of health services. It said the Centre's efforts were not to be faulted but the court could not be oblivious to the needs of the capital and supply of 700 MT to it should be maintained. Importantly, the court said the Centre need not be held back by the requirement of floating tenders for importing oxygen to meet the demand caused by surging number of Covid patients. "Pending finalisation of the global tender for supply of oxygen, the Centre can import on standalone basis. You can even do away with the tender process," it said, seeking to relieve the bureaucrats of the fear of being faulted and prosecuted for not following the usual norms while making emergency purchases. Staying the Delhi HC initiated contempt proceedings, the bench said the Centre would ensure supplying 700 MT of oxygen to Delhi for the next four days subject to review on Monday. It also took over from Delhi High Court the judicial scrutiny of oxygen supply to Delhi, which reached 555 MT on Tuesday from a central pool availability of around 9,000 MT. Justice Shah concurred with the SG that the issue required a pan-India approach and no state should be supplied oxygen from the allocated share of others. "However, the ground situation in Delhi, where people are running from hospital to hospital to find an oxygen bed, has to be addressed. And we have already passed an order asking the Centre to maintain supply of 700 MT of oxygen till May 10, when we will review the requirement after hearing all sides," the bench said. When additional secretary in home ministry Piyush Goyal explained the oxygen procurement and supply mechanism with trepidation, given the contempt sword of HC hanging overhead, the bench said, "Please be in ease of mind. You all are working round the clock. Hauling up officers for contempt does not help. Contempt is to be resorted to only when it is wilful violation of court orders. The present is a pan-India problem." While staying the contempt of court action against the Centre and its officers, including Sumita Dawra, the Supreme Court said, "Courts taking recourse to contempt actions is not going to resolve the problem faced by Delhi. The country is facing a serious and unprecedented humanitarian crisis. The problem can be solved by active cooperation of all stakeholders. When the Supreme Court looks at the issue, it has to look from the perspective of the entire country. But we cannot be oblivious to the needs of Delhi." On the present mechanism devised by the expert group for allocation of oxygen to states, the bench said, "We are not faulting the Centre or the expert group for this. It is a bona fide exercise. But in view of the experience of short supply of oxygen, the Centre could have a re-look at the mechanism and formula for allocation of oxygen, especially the linkage between ICU-non-ICU oxygen beds and their requirement of oxygen." It added that many patients on stretchers in hospitals or getting treated at home also needed oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-to-centre-no-contempt-but-deliver-700mt-o2-to-delhi/articleshow/82418377.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Supreme Court refuses to re-examine its 1992 order setting quota limit at 50%||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to re-examine its 1992 verdict, which put a cap of 50% on quota, turning down the plea made by various states that the ceiling fixed by court be scrapped and they be allowed to grant reservation beyond it. A five-judge Constitution bench said that its three decade-old verdict in the Indra Sawhney case has stood the test of time and rejected the plea of states that 50% ceiling needed to be relaxed due to changed social dynamics. The bench, comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat, unanimously decided that the cap on reservation was fixed "to achieve principle of equality and with an object to strike a balance which cannot be said to be arbitrary or unreasonable". "To change the 50% limit is to have a society which is not founded on equality but based on caste rule. Democracy is an essential feature of our Constitution and part of our basic structure. If the reservation goes above 50% limit which is reasonable, it will be a slippery slope, the political pressure makes it hard to reduce the same. Thus, answer to the question posed is that the percentage of 50% has been arrived at on the principle of reasonability and achieves equality as enshrined by Article 14 of which Articles 15 and 16 are facets," Justice Bhushan said in his judgment. The verdict may have implications on reservation to economically weaker sections (EWS), which also breaches the 50% rule and the matter is pending before SC. Almost all the state governments put up a united front before the apex court to press for removal of the cap. The bench, however, stood firm, holding that that the 50% cap can be breached only in extraordinary and exceptional cases. “What was held by the Constitution Bench in Indra Sawhney case on the relevance and significance of the principle of stare decisis clearly binds us. The judgment of Indra Sawhney has stood the test of the time and has never been doubted by any judgment of this court. The Constitution Bench judgment of this court in Indra Sawhney neither needs to be revisited nor referred to a larger Bench for consideration,” the bench said while rejecting the plea of state governments, including that of Maharashtra, for referring the issue to a 11-judge bench. “There can be no quarrel that society changes, law changes, people change but that does not mean that something which is good and proven to be beneficial in maintaining equality should also be changed in the name of change alone,” the court said as it rejected the plea that the changed dynamics of society warranted that the 50% quota was scrapped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-refuses-to-re-examine-its-1992-order-setting-quota-limit-at-50/articleshow/82418666.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The pathogen has adopted "hit and run" tactics to breach the immunity many people developed during the first wave as also due to vaccination, Prof Vijay Raghavan said, pointing to changes in the virus and the role of new variants with higher transmissibility and disease severity in the second wave. "A phase three (of Covid-19 pandemic) is inevitable given the high levels of circulating virus but it is not clear on what timescale this phase three will occur. Hopefully, incrementally but we should prepare for new waves," Prof Vijay Raghavan said. The possibility could not be wished away as long as human hosts were available for infection and the only way to reduce this vulnerability was through safe practices and vaccination. "The best time to change our behavior is now," he said emphasising on the need to adapt Covid-appropriate behavior. "What we do, what we need to do does not change because of the virus. Masks and distancing are critical and most effective," he said. Infections and vaccinations are likely to cause "adaptive pressure" on the SARS-COV2 virus, triggering new kind of changes, he said. Scientific studies were on to examine likely alterations to tackle any upsurge in future. Times ViewWith the government acknowledging the inevitability of a third Covid-19 surge, the planning to deal with it should begin now. The government must prepare for cases exceeding what is anticipated. Advance planning and preparation can help avoid a repetition of the tragic circumstances caused by the second wave. At the same time, rapidly scaling up vaccination and other measures to minimise the spread must go hand in hand.Explaining why the second wave has been larger and much more severe, Prof Vijay Raghavan said: “Phase 1 was a generalist approach of the virus and phase 2 now has fitter viruses arising due to post-immunity due to previous infection. Variants of concern represent better adaptation and are triggered by human population.” While assuring that the infections caused by new variants will plateau, the principal scientific advisor cautioned that immune evasive variants and those which lower or increase disease severity will arrive in the future.

People from Cooch Behar had to take refuge in neighbouring Assam. People from South 24 Parganas have suffered a double tragedy. Months ago, they were hit by Amphan and now they are facing Mamataphan,” Nadda said on Wednesday without making a mention of “tortured communities”, unlike some Bengal BJP leaders. The BJP president promised to take up the cause in a democratic way. Nadda assured BJP karyakartas that helplines were being put in place for people to contact the party. He was in no mood to demand President’s Rule in Bengal. “There is a procedure for that. The governor generates a report and the MHA examines it. As far as the party is concerned, we are going to take up the cause on our own strength,” Nadda said, highlighting the “sab ka saath, sab ka vikas and sab ka vishwas” approach. Responding to Trinamool Congress’ “fake video” allegation that was later endorsed by the state police, the BJP president said: “Send me the video clips. We will take care. But don’t tell me about the state police. They had said during the attack on me on my way to Diamond Harbour that it came from disgruntled men from our side.” Before the press meet, the BJP president paid a visit to victim Shobharani Mandal’s Jagaddal home in North 24 Parganas. He also read a “pledge” along with 77 newly elected BJP MLAs at the state party office on taking up the cause of Bengal people under provisions of the Constitution. Reports of violence, meanwhile, came pouring in from Indas assembly constituency in Bankura where BJP booth agent Arup Ruidas was found hanging from a tree after he was killed allegedly by Trinamool marauders. In Birbhum’s Suri, BJP worker Uday Hazra was badly injured. In Sainthia, houses of BJP workers were allegedly ransacked. The house of Aziza Khatun, convenor of the party’s minority morcha in Birbhum, too was ransacked. On Wednesday evening, violence spread in Murshidabad’s Burwan, Bharatpur and parts of Kandi. Acting on complaints that women and children were rendered homeless over the past 24 hours, the DIG (investigation) of National Human Rights Commission on Wednesday constituted a team of officers to verify the allegations and report within two weeks. NHRC has already formed a team to conduct “on the spot fact-finding investigation”. “District administration and local law and order enforcement agencies appear not to have acted to stop such violation of human rights of the affected persons,” NHRC said in a press statement. National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has written to the state’s chief secretary raising concerns over violence affecting children. It has sought an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/80000-forced-to-abandon-homes-in-bengal-bjp-chief/articleshow/82420328.cms||---
---||India||Amid Covid surge, farm groups say defy lockdown||BATHINDA/AMRITSAR: Farm organisations agitating against the Centre's agri-marketing laws have urged residents of Punjab to oppose the Covid-induced lockdown by converging on the roads on May 8. Terming the lockdown a means to conceal the failure of governments to ramp up essential medical facilities and frame a scientific policy to deal with the pandemic, farmers' groups from Punjab on Wednesday appealed to every family to send at least one member to the protest sites along Delhi borders. The call to violate lockdown - shops have been asked to stay open, too - came after a meeting at Delhi's Singhu border. Representatives of Punjab farmers will suggest opposing lockdowns across the country at a meeting of the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha scheduled for Friday. There are plans to move larger jathas to the protest sites on May 10 and 12. Arrangements will be made for Covid vaccination on the sidelines of the lockdown defiance, sources said. According to farm leaders Baldev Singh Nihalgarh and Balbir Singh Rajewal, the "death rate of 1.4% due to coronavirus is like that of any other ailment". Times ViewAt a time when the number of Covid-19 cases has reached record levels in India, such a decision is extremely irresponsible. The Punjab farmer organisations must reverse their decision. If they don’t, the government must act to prevent large gatherings."Governments are acting under the garb of Covid to snatch the rights of people and worsen their economic condition. The lockdown is proving disastrous for migrant workers and all this will eventually go against farmers." Buta Singh Burjgill, another farm leader, said, "We have been witnessing the coronavirus for 13 months. This lockdown has proved insufficient to deal with the situation... It seems the lockdown has been imposed as per the diktats of BJP and PM Narendra Modi." A jatha left for Delhi from Amritsar on Wednesday to join the agitating farmers. "There is no issue of Covid-19 at all with the farmers; they are in Chardi Kalan. We are using the NH and, if stopped anywhere, we will sit there in dharna," Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said, when asked if the jatha members had got themselves tested for Covid. He said nearly 8,000 people were going to Delhi in tractor trailers. "The presence of so many women in our jatha vindicates our stand that every farmer household is fearful of the consequences of enforcing the three new farm laws."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-covid-surge-farm-groups-say-defy-lockdown/articleshow/82420697.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Delhi||SOS calls for O2 down from 60 to 10 in 3 days||New Delhi: From Friday, a Delhi government control room will monitor the real-time dashboard on oxygen supply and demand in the city. The government has also roped in e-commerce giant Amazon to track the vehicles carrying liquid oxygen to the capital. Ashish Kundra, principal secretary, transport department, and OSD, health department, told reporters on Thursday that Delhi government was ramping up the capacities to transport liquid oxygen in the city. “The state government has a GPS tracking system for the 41 tankers carrying oxygen to the city. A dashboard has been prepared, and Amazon has been roped in as a partner to track the vehicles carrying the liquid oxygen to Delhi,” he said. Kundra said the control room would be set up by May 7 to monitor the real-time dashboard of the oxygen supply and demand in the city. He added that the increased allocation of oxygen for Delhi had come as a respite for hospitals and patients. “From the 60 SOS calls from hospitals on May 2, the number of SOS alerts came down to 10 on May 5. The supply side change has had an immediate impact,” he said. The official said that while supply has been strengthened by Delhi government, containerised cargo movement via trains had also helped, with the railway route increasing the oxygen from 120 metric tonnes till May 4 to around 360 MT on May 5. “The railway supplies and containerised cargoes are an efficient way of transporting liquid oxygen,” said Kundra. “Delhi is gradually ramping up capacities to transport liquid oxygen.” He said while the oxygen supply chain has become more efficient due to the use of trains, Delhi was also getting oxygen supply from nearby areas in Panipat through tankers and containers. “Delhi government has appointed two IAS officers at the Kalinga Nagar facility of Tata Steel where oxygen is produced. The government has formed a decentralised management system for the distribution of oxygen within the city to various hospitals and institutions,” Kundra said. The official also said that all district magistrates were tracking every refilling station and making sure oxygen reached the earmarked destination. The health department had also issued an order to revive the dealer network of oxygen cylinders. All dealers who were providing industrial gases have been linked with the refillers and they are providing cylinders to the retailer outlets for the use of citizens, Kundra said. “Having created a buffer stock of oxygen, 505 D-type cylinders have been distributed among 11 deputy commissioners,” Kundra added. “Delhi government makes an appeal through this medium for the donation of cylinders.” Those who want to donate cylinders can log in to www.delhigov.in and click the Covid donation tag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sos-calls-for-o2-down-from-60-to-10-in-3-days/articleshow/82444880.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Kolkata||Negative report must for inter-state bus, train travel||Kolkata: The Bengal government on Wednesday made a negative RT-PCR test report mandatory for passengers arriving from other states by trains and buses. CM Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said the state will carry out random surveys at bus termini and railway stations to check if passengers are carrying the reports. Moreover, random RAT tests will also be conducted at places and those found Covid positive will be sent to quarantine centres. Railway officials said the matter has been discussed and they can follow the Maharashtra model where it is mandatory for passengers from specific states to carry negative RT-PCR test reports. Maharashtra had made it mandatory for all passengers coming from Delhi NCR, Kerala, Goa, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand to get a Covid-negative certificate to enter the state. Earlier, on April 19, home secretary H K Dwivedi, health secretary N S Nigam and transport secretary R K Sinha had met Eastern Railway and South-Eastern Railway AGMs and asked them to prepare a draft SOP in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic. The issue of making RT-PCR tests compulsory for those who boarded trains from other states had figured prominently in the discussion. “This way, the influx of other variants of Covid-19 can be prevented,” said an official. The transport department has also asked all inter-state passenger bus operators to make RT-PCR tests mandatory for passengers. “We are also gearing up to carry out checks at different bus termini. If necessary, we will send such passengers and operators to quarantine centres together,” said a transport department officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/negative-report-must-for-inter-state-bus-train-travel/articleshow/82415484.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Balakrishnamacharyulu was made in-charge secretary by the YSRC government after it came to power in May 2019. However, he retired on April 30, 2020, following which his term was extended for a period of one year. As his term expired on April 30 this year, the government issued fresh orders on Wednesday extending his term till April 30, 2023. The post of assembly secretary has remained vacant since 2014. The TDP government had made a senior officer in-charge secretary during its term. After the YSRC formed the government, it opted for Balakrishnamacharyulu and made him in-charge secretary.

---||Kolkata||Banks to be open from 10am to 2pm, shut on all Saturdays||Kolkata: Banks will now operate between 10am and 2pm for customers, following chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s announcement on Covid-safety restrictions on Wednesday. The State Level Bankers’ Committee later issued an advisory on reduced banking hours and also announced that branches would remain shut on all Saturdays. Banks usually function on the first and third Saturdays of a month. The former deputy chief secretary of SBI Staff Association, Ashok Mukherjee, pointed out at almost every branch, employees were contracting the novel coronavirus. “The reduced banking hours is a welcome development. Bank employees are frontline workers who have been performing their duty despite the pandemic,” he said. The State Level Bankers Committee already issued a directive on April 26, according to which banks here have been performing limited activities. Nabin Chandra Dash, convenor of Bengal SLBC, had earlier written to all the regional heads of banks, saying that following a Indian Banks Association (IBA) directive, branches would operate with 50% workforce. The directive had also said that given the curtailed staff strength and restrictions, branches would not have to perform all functions but certain minimum duties, such as, deposit and withdrawal of cash, clearing of cheques, government transactions and remittances, would have to be carried out. Dash also clarified that besides the activities stipulated by the SLBC, if any branch offered other services, it was free to do so, depending on its staff strength. “We have not asked branches to stop any activity but listed some, which have been made mandatory. The rest is on the branches.” SLBC had earlier urged the state government to restrict banking hours for the next two weeks to minimize the risk of contamination of the novel coronavirus. According to SLBC, many of the member banks had already been advised by their corporate office to take stock of the situation, regarding the extent of the cases in their respective working zones. It pointed out ensuring availability of 50% workforce was a challenge now, given the large number of employees and family members down with Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/banks-to-be-open-from-10am-to-2pm-shut-on-all-saturdays/articleshow/82417519.cms||---
---||Business||No freezing a/c for KYC, digital proof can be final||Mumbai: The RBI on Wednesday relaxed KYC (know-your-customer) norms to enable the process to be completed remotely and prevent banks from freezing accounts in which such data has not been updated. “In respect of customer accounts where periodic updation of KYC is due and pending as on date, no restrictions on operations of such account shall be imposed till December 31, 2021, for this reason alone, unless warranted under instructions of any regulator/ enforcement agency/ court of law,” the RBI said in a circular to all lenders. Earlier, SBI had given similar instructions to its branches after a directive from the finance minister through a tweet. While the central bank’s directive gives relief to customers of all RBI-regulated entities, a larger reform is the enabling of digital KYC. Currently, banks are completing the KYC process for individuals remotely using video-based customer identification (V-CIP). This process has been extended for businesses including proprietorship firms, authorised signatories and beneficial owners of legal entities. Earlier, accounts opened using Aadhaar-based e-KYC (non-face-to-face) were treated as ‘limited KYC’ accounts. These will now be treated as fully compliant accounts. Entities looking to complete the KYC process can now use KYC Identifier of Centralised KYC Registry (CKYCR) for V-CIP and submission of electronic documents (including documents issued through DigiLocker) as identify proof. “The RBI allowing video KYC & other digital methods to complete many requirements for renewal and new KYC will ease access to formal banking and digital payments. It is timely and will have long-term positive impact,” said Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma. Besides opening savings accounts, digital KYC will also make lending easier. According to LenDenClub CEO and co-founder of Bhavin Patel, the CKYCR push will make it easy for lenders to verify customers at the lending point and further strengthen the ecosystem. “Major banks are already part of central-KYC registry and now fintech companies like us have already registered to ensure better digital and hassle-free experience for customers in need,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-freezing-a/c-for-kyc-digital-proof-can-be-final/articleshow/82417780.cms||---

Words “Sher Singh Rana jihe koee nee” (none like Sher Singh Rana) have been muted in the song even as the video remains as it is and shows Rana’s image. The song already has over 86 lakh views on Bawa’s youtube channel in three days. The song glorifies Sikh warriors, mentions the atrocities and ghallughara (genocide) they faced, has images from Operation Blue Star and also talks about fake encounters in Punjab, mentions recent issues like farm protests, the fractures within it and sacrileges. However, it features Sher Singh Rana, as it drew comparison between villainous and heroic acts. Many Punjabi netizens criticised it saying it had little connection with rest of the song.

---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: ACB unearths irregularities in Sangam Dairy bonus payments||AMARAVATI: The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has found irregularities in bonus payment to milk producers and diversion of funds to unauthorized accounts in Sangam Dairy. Sources said ACB has seized documents to establish how senior TDP leader Dhulipalla Narendra Kumar became chairman of the dairy board without the eligibility to become the board director. As per the rules, any milk producer could become member of the primary milk producers’ cooperative society only if he sells milk to the dairy continuously for a period of 180 days in a year. A member is eligible to contest the election and become board director two years after becoming the member of primary society. Sources said Narendra who become member of Chintalapudi society in 2009, had become director and chairman in 2010 within a year of becoming primary member. “It is a violation of Cooperative Societies Act, 1964,” said Ponnur legislator Kilari Rosaiah. Rosaiah said Narendra was managing director of Dhulipalla Milk Lines, another private dairy. Although Narendra quit as MD of his own dairy, he had handed over the charge to his wife which is an instance of conflict of interest and makes Narendra ineligible to continue as Sangam dairy chairman. ACB has found evidence about disbursement of the dairy profits to the unauthorized people. The dairy announced the highest bonus of Rs.12 per litre during 2019-20 in which only Rs.6 was given to producers. Rs.3.5 per litre was diverted to DVC Trust owned by the family and Rs.2.5 per litre was converted into share capital of the company. “Nearly Rs.50 crore was diverted to DVC Trust which should have been given to farmers,” said a senior official of the cooperative department, who is closely associated with the investigation. Sangam Dairy procured huge quantities of cow milk from three dairies at Rs.30 per litre and mixed the same with the buffalo milk to sell at Rs.41 per litre in the market. An official confirmed that the dairy paid Rs.200 crore to each of the three private dairies for procurement of cow milk. ”Since investigation is still under progress, we can’t comment at this stage,” said an ACB official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/acb-unearths-irregularities-in-sangam-dairy-bonus-payments/articleshow/82422900.cms||Samdani MN
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Double masking becomes common feature in Covid-19 second wave||VISAKHAPATNAM: As the daily Covid-19 caseload continues to increase, double masking has become a common feature in the second wave of the pandemic in several cities of Andhra Pradesh. Some experts have also been encouraging double masking with reports of increased transmissibility of the new mutants. Mask compliance has seen a sudden increase in Andhra Pradesh in the last one to two weeks due to the spurt in case numbers. Interestingly, the double masking phenomenon was not seen during the first wave last year. Speaking to TOI, Dr Satish Reddy, a general physician, said that an increased number of people are now wearing double masks to be extra cautious. “But if someone is wearing a good N95 mask, they don’t need double masking. But when it comes to the cloth masks or surgical masks, they can go with two masks to filter out the viral particles. There is no particular recommendation from the health agencies on double masking. But more protection is needed when the person is going to crowded places like markets, shopping malls, railway stations, etc. In either case, a single mask or double masking, tight fit of mask(s) is more important to prevent the transmission of the aerosols,” said Dr Reddy. N Ramakrishna, owner of a supermarket in Vizag city, said that he is providing his staff with two masks in view of the increasing cases. “Even though I do not have any medical knowledge, I believe two masks would be more effective in stopping the virus,” he said. Meanwhile, the state health department has decided to realign the testing strategy with the existing Covid-19 situation. The focus would be on detecting the positive cases early to initiate early treatment. Only symptomatic primary contacts would be tested to yield better results. All the contacts of a positive person would be kept in home quarantine and be monitored by ASHA workers and village/ward volunteers on a daily basis. They will not be allowed to move freely for 14 days. If they develop Covid-19 symptoms, they would be immediately tested. If they are found to be positive, they shall be triaged by the medical officer to start treatment in home isolation, Covid Care Centre, or a designated hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/double-masking-becomes-common-feature-in-second-wave/articleshow/82415889.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

His appeal came hours after the commencement of 11-day lockdown in the state from Wednesday. “Amidst an unprecedented situation caused by the Covid pandemic, I appeal to the people of the state that if social events like wedding ceremonies, where people from many places gather, are postponed for ‘sometimes’, it will help in breaking the chain of virus infection. This will be in the interest of society and your family,” Nitish said in a series of tweets. “The state government is promptly taking all necessary steps to ensure people’s protection from the Covid pandemic. The government had to take a tough decision to impose complete lockdown till May 15 in the interest of the people. Please cooperate in the fight against the virus by following the lockdown related guidelines,” Nitish tweeted. As per the guidelines issued for the lockdown, there is no ban on wedding functions. “Wedding ceremonies will be allowed with a maximum of 50 participants. No DJ or baraat processions will be allowed. Organizer of the wedding function would have to inform the nearest police station at least three days in advance,” the guidelines read, adding, “Only 20 persons will be allowed to participate in the funeral/‘shradhh karma’.” As per the guidelines, all shops, commercial and other private enterprises would remain closed during the lockdown. However, banks, insurance and the offices related to operation of ATMs will not come under the purview of the lockdown. Such offices would continue to work as usual.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/defer-wedding-functions-to-break-covid-19-chain-cm/articleshow/82414620.cms||Madan Kumar

Siddharth Bhadrecha, a third-year-student of GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri, was found hanging in his hostel room early on Wednesday morning. Siddharth, a native of Mangrol taluka of Junagadh, left a suicide note written in English wherein he said that he was ending his life due to stress. “The first few lines of the note said that he was committing suicide due to stress. But there was no mention of the reason behind the stress. We are trying to ascertain why he was so stressed. His friends had no idea of his condition and neither his parents knew anything,” said R C Kanamia, Gorwa police inspector. Siddharth had been doing Covid duty at Gotri GMERS hospital. Kanamia said, “His Covid duty was over on April 30 and he was off duty. We are not sure if his suicide was due to any work pressure. His mobile phone is locked but we will go through the call details to get more clues.” Siddharth’s room partner had a brief chat with him on Tuesday night and then left for his duty. Police claimed that his room partner told them that Siddharth didn’t appear tense or in any problem. When he returned from duty and knocked on their hostel room’s door, Siddharth didn’t answer. The door was locked from inside so he put his mobile phone camera through the window to check and saw Siddharth hanging from the ceiling. “He ended his life between 1.30am and 7 am. In his three-page suicide note, Siddharth wrote that he couldn’t be a good son and brother. He thanked his parents and even mentioned his friends as well as lecturers. The deceased said that he was lucky to have good friends and teachers who taught him a lot,” Kanamia told TOI. He also wrote about his dreams of buying a car and a motorbike, and how he wanted to live his life as a good person. Siddharth’s father is into fishing business. Investigators said that he may have planned to commit suicide as he wrote a long note. Resident doctors and interns are reeling under severe work pressure. Sources said they also complained of relentless work without break or leave. On April 23, the death of 22-year-old physiotherapy student had sparked massive outrage amog the students who had alleged that she was forced to work in the Covid-19 ward despite her comorbities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/stressed-mbbs-student-on-covid-duty-hangs-to-death-in-hostel-room/articleshow/82414030.cms||---

Godrej Properties has closed offices for the week, starting Wednesday. Goldman Sachs has declared this Friday as a ‘self-care day’, encouraging employees to take the day off. RepIndia on Wednesday announced a 4-day mental health break for its staff. The Delhi- and Mumbai-based agency has decided to shut shop from May 6 to May 9 “to afford employees the requisite time for healing, being with their loved ones and get vaccinated”. The offices of philanthropic firm Dasra, on the other hand, have been closed for two weeks since April 26, for a “14-day work quarantine”. Employees have been asked to pause their immediate work deliverables and rather focus on caring for self, family and communities. Over the last few weeks, several other companies have announced mental health breaks and vaccination & Covid leaves to help employees navigate a rough patch. In an internal note to all India employees, Goldman Sachs shared, “Many of us have been affected directly or indirectly by the pandemic. We acknowledge it has put a lot of strain on our people physically and mentally, and encourage you to prioritise your health and wellbeing, and that of your families, above all else. To support you, this Friday, May 7 will be a ‘self-care day’ for colleagues in India.” “We also recognise that many of you are supporting family, friends or your communities during this time. To help you manage these priorities, we are also providing a ‘Care for Others Day’ off for our people in India, to be used before the end of June,” the firm said in the note. Godrej Properties MD & CEO Mohit Malhotra said, “The work-from-home burnout is real and the last 13 months of Covid and the second wave have taken a toll on people, emotionally and mentally. As a company it is our responsibility to be with our employees and we understand that in tough times like these, everyone deserves a break. We introduced ‘Taking a Pause to Heal’ initiative where these three days starting May 5 plus the weekend will be a complete break from everything work-related.” This is applicable to close to 2,000 permanent employees and approximately 600 contract employees working across all locations of Godrej Properties in India. “We have also proactively given a heads-up to our customers so that the sales and customer centricity teams can take a break too,” said Malhotra. Dasra’s associate director of talent management and internal operations, Ninad Ankleshwaria, said, “Our staff members have been volunteering to raise funds and as an emergency response team to fulfil urgent needs of Covid-affected people. We realised that many of our employees were distressed due to Covid affecting themselves, their loved ones or the community at large. Thus, we acknowledge that in such dark times, it’s essential to go beyond the words of being a people-first organisation and ensure that awe prioritise caring actions towards each and everyone’s well-being.” In a statement, RepIndia CEO Archit Chenoy said, “There is no denying that this is an incredibly difficult time for the entire nation — and our workforce is no exception to that reality. We’ve all been knocked off our feet, witnessing the devastation all around us. This is a small initiative we’ve taken to give our people breathing room — whether that’s used to grieve, to recuperate or to get vaccinated. The hard truth is that we’re in a full-blown national crisis and if giving people a few days off is going to ease a tiny bit of that pressure, it’s frankly the least we can do. I hope employers across the nation are supportive towards their teams who have worked relentlessly during the pandemic and at this time do not shy away from showing compassion and basic human decency.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cos-give-staff-time-off-to-heal-handle-covid-stress/articleshow/82417750.cms||Namrata Singh

The drive to intensify immunization as a protection against Covid has been launched after the district health department collected data about the present status of vaccination of those who are 45-year-old and above. Altogether 86 vaccination centres in 16 blocks have been set up. Bhagalpur civil surgeon (CS) Dr Umesh Sharma said that the directive for intensifying the vaccination drive was issued keeping the low vaccination rate in view as per assessment of the vaccination data versus population of the district. “So far we have been able to vaccinate more than 2,60,000 residents, who are 45 years and above ever since the vaccination drive started. We are not fully satisfied with the statistics and hence steps are being taken towards intensive vaccination,” the CS added.  “It was found that vaccination drive at centres under Jagdishpur block, Sabour, Ismailpur, Rangra and Narayanpur block is slow,” Dr Sharma added. “Doctors, PHC in-charges, paramedical staff, Asha workers and others have been asked to motivate people in their respective areas to get vaccines,” added the civil surgeon saying there is no shortage of vaccines, however, we will need additional supply of vaccines for vaccination of the people who are between 18 and 45 years, when the government orders to start vaccination of this age group.” People can travel to vaccination centres with their Aadhaar card for taking vaccines even during the lockdown. District immunization officer Dr Manoj Choudhary said that vaccination is going on smoothly. “The need of the hour is to intensify the vaccination process and immunize more people as early as possible,” Dr Choudhary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/officials-to-motivate-bhagalpur-residents-for-getting-vaccinated/articleshow/82415063.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Vijayawada||Stigma still a barrier in undertaking Covid tests||Amaravati: Social activists and health experts say that many people are not undergoing Covid-19 tests in the early stages for fear of facing social discrimination. In many cases, activists said, people are rushing to hospitals only after deterioration of the patient’s health. This is resulting in severe pressure on the healthcare system as well as professionals. Doctors handling Covid-19 cases observed that there is no big difference in the strain or its impact from the first wave of the Covid-19 except for the surge in cases at the critical stage. Many patients are required to be put on oxygen support as they are reaching the hospitals at an advanced stage without having taking any medical advice or care in the initial stage, said senior medical officer at Government General Hospital (GGH), Guntur. A medical officer at Primary Health Centre (PHC) in Nutakki in Guntur district, Dr V Durga Sailaja, said that people are undergoing tests at unauthorised labs and opting for self-medication without consulting local medical authorities. “They are calling us in panic when oxygen levels dip. We are experiencing such cases almost every day,” Dr Sailaja said. However, social activist Kamal Saida, who has helped thousands of migrant workers reach home during the first wave of Covid-19, said that social discrimination is the main reason behind people staying silent on their health status. He explained that the fear of facing social boycott, particularly in villages, is greater among weaker sections, minorities and Dalits. Saida added that it was sad that there has been no appreciable difference in society’s response to the treatment of patients as outcasts even after many facing a similar situation in the past year. Five persons in the family of a retired teacher, Fareed of Rajupalem in Guntur district, died of Covid-19 as they could not muster the courage to come out in the open and get treatment in the early stage for fear of facing social discrimination, he said. “It is true that the poor are the biggest victims of the present situation. People should stop discriminating against Covid-19 patients,” said CPI(M) leader Pasam Ramarao.

The HRCT test conducted after a high court direction indicated that he is having mild infection in lungs caused by the virus. Earlier during the day, the AP high court directed the ACB and the Rajahmundry central jail authorities to shift Narendra and former cooperative department employee Gurunatham to a private hospital to conduct all requisite tests for Covid-19. The court said the orders should be implemented immediately and warned of consequences if not done so. Narendra’s counsel informed the court that Gopala Krishnan, the second accused in Sangam Dairy case, has tested positive and has been shifted to a private hospital as per ACB court’s directions. He said Narendra and Gurunatham also have Covid-like symptoms, but the ACB court has kept their petitions in pending. He further stated that though Narendra’s RT-PCR test was negative, the symptoms are persistent. As RT-PCR tests are failing in many patients, a CT scan of the lungs is required and there is no CT scan facility at Rajahmundry government hospital. He requested the court to give directions to shift Narendra and Gurunatham to a private hospital where necessary tests can be conducted and treatment can be provided if they test positive. Justice R Raghunandan Rao directed the Rajahmundry jail authorities to take necessary steps to shift both the accused to a private hospital where testing and treatment facilities are available. Narendra’s counsel also sought a certified order copy, stating that jail authorities are not complying with the court’s orders unless a certified copy is given. Justice Rao directed the standing counsel for ACB to inform the authorities about the high court’s directions and to ensure that the orders get implemented without delay. The court further said that this order will not hinder ACB in continuing their investigation in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-orders-acb-to-shift-narendra-to-private-hospital-from-rajahmundry-jail-for-covid-tests/articleshow/82415664.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Bond dealers, however, are cautious on the sustainability of the rally given the huge borrowing programme of the Centre and the states.

As a result, the benchmark yield on 10-year government bonds, which had closed the previous session at 6.02%, ended at 5.97%. Bond dealers, however, said that the small sizes in state loan auctions and cancelled government bond auctions, indicate that there is muted demand for government securities from buyers. As a result, despite the RBI support to the gilt market, yield is expected to remain range bound with an upward bias. The current muted demand in the government bond market came despite huge redemptions by the government. The statement by the US treasury secretary that interest rates in the world’s largest economy could rise soon is also weighing on the market sentiment, bond dealers said. As a result of all these factors, bond traders are expecting the 10-year yield to hover between 5.95% and 6.1% for a couple of months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bonds-rally-on-rs-35000cr-buyback-plan/articleshow/82417548.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Liquidity, priority tag for micro lenders||Mumbai: The RBI has identified microfinance as a sector that needs immediate relief due to the stress faced by the lenders and the borrowers they serve. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Wednesday announced a host of steps that would provide funds for those who lend to the micro-segment. This includes a Rs 10,000-crore refinancing to small finance banks at 4% for lending to small borrowers through a special three-year long-term repo. Small finance banks have also been encouraged to lend to microfinance institutions (MFIs, which have a loan book of below Rs 500 crore) by allowing them to classify these loans as priority sector advances. According to Alok Misra, CEO if the micro lenders’ association MFIN, the measures were announced by the RBI governor after meeting the sector’s representatives and understanding the severity of the situation. “Liquidity is the key and, I hope, along with the April announcement of Rs 50,000-crore support through financial institutions, today’s measure will help the sector,” said Misra. He added that the RBI was expected to introduce more relief as the situation evolves. “We will keep engaging with the RBI on creating systemic support for allocating a specific subtotal out of the overall liquidity support for the smaller NBFC MFIs,” said Misra. “Incentivising small finance banks to lend to MFIs, which typically face higher borrower vulnerability, is salutary,” said Crisil senior director Krishnan Sitaraman. He added that 8 out of 11 small finance banks were previously MFIs. Hence, they would be in a better position to evaluate the credit profiles of the smaller MFIs and lend. “Extending the priority sector lending eligibility to MFIs with asset size of up to Rs 500 crore will encourage flow of credit to smaller MFIs, which have been facing relatively bigger funding-access challenges. This move will cover around half of the NBFC MFIs in India,” said Sitaraman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/liquidity-priority-tag-for-micro-lenders/articleshow/82417616.cms||---

With no option left, several vehicles returned to Hyderabad and other destinations in Telangana. Krishna district SP M Ravindranath Babu told TOI that travel plans that a commuter wishes to make through the highway has to be done during the stipulated time. “The exceptions are only for emergency cases and essential services. We will not allow any vehicle to enter or exit after 12 noon,” he said. APSRTC buses were eventually allowed to enter and park at nearby bus depots. Eateries on highways were not allowed to run their dine-in business but take-aways were permitted to ensure availability of food for those plying with a valid reason. “The restrictions aren’t just there for highway or border areas. We have checkposts in place even in district borders and aren’t allowing any vehicle to ply without valid reason,” Babu added.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Tsunami of mucormycosis among Covid-19 recovered||AHMEDABAD/SURAT: If disease and death all around due to Covid-19 infection was not enough, Gujarat is also battling an exponential rise in deadly attack of mucormycosis (MM), also known as black fungus, which is typically pushing Covid-recovered back into ICUs and surgical wards. Those with uncontrolled diabetes and heavy use of steroid to survive Covid-19 complications are worst affected. Senior ENT surgeon Dr Navin Patel said, “A tsunami of mucormycosis is happening which threatens to kill patients who were saved from Covid. Rampant use of steroids during corona pandemic needs to be rationalized.” Patients are afflicted with a second round of suffering including excruciating pain, 20-30% lose their eye-sight, families run up bills ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 30 lakh and yet a big percentage succumb to the fungal infection. The MM spike is especially alarming in the current surge where doctors say they are spending 14-16 hours a day operating an average 5-6 patients daily. The unprecedented rise has triggered a shortage of amphotericin B, a key drug used to treat MM. Patients like Govind Bharwad, 57, a diabetic who recovered from Covid but remains critical due to rapid spread of MM in Surat, continue to suffer. “The patient has already been given 30 amphotericin B injections and he needs to be given it for one more week. There is severe shortage of the injection and it is being sold in black market at Rs 5,000 when its actual price is Rs 2,800,” said Togabhai Bharwad, nephew of Govind. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Atul Patel who is part of the national MM study in Covid pandemic says there are 11 patients admitted under him currently at Sterling Hospital. One of them is a 34-year-old young man who lost his eye after the fungus invaded his eye. "He has barely recovered from Covid-19 and has been put on an elaborate regime to Amphotericin B to save his life. It is a cruel double whammy," says Dr Patel. Of the 270 MM patient studies done in Diwali surge nationally, diabetes and steroid use were found to be the biggest risk factors. "Nearly 85% of MM patients with Covod-19 history had uncontrolled blood sugar and heavy steroid use," says Dr Patel. He says that in the current surge, given the high MM numbers, they have started questioning if Covid-19 itself could be a risk factor. Dr Devang Gupta, ENT surgeon in Civil Hospital, says the rise in MM cases is exponential in the past month which also saw Covid skyrocketing in Gujarat. "We are admitting an average 6-7 MM cases and operating 5-odd patients daily. Nealry 20% lose their eye-sight. If diagnosis and treatment is delayed, the prognosis is not good," says Dr Gupta. In Surat, New Civil Hospital (NCH) is adding infrastructure to handle MM patients, anticipating a rise in the numbers. "We are setting up a ward and enrolling oculoplastic surgeons for MM surgeries. We are also working to arrange liposomal amphotericin B, which is a necessary medicine for these patients," said Dr Ragini Verma, medical superintendent, NCH. Senior ENT surgeon Dr Prashant Desai, chairperson of South Gujarat Academy of Otolaryngology, said, "ENT surgeons in the city have done around 150 MM surgeries in the last one month. Earlier, they used to do only one in a year. Early diagnosis and treatment is the key to recovery."

We will fight this together, joint family||AHMEDABAD: A large joint family is sitting on the verandah outside their house in Kerala’s Kollam and singing ‘Bhai Bhai’ (brother, o brother), a popular rendition by Gujarati folk singer Arvind Vegada, trying to lighten the mood at a time when the second wave of Covid-19 has hit the country hard. Their spirit to keep the atmosphere alive comes at a time when 28 members, except three kids, have been infected with Sars CoV-2 virus. There are as many as 31 members in this joint family of six brothers, all living under one roof with their wives and children. The family has been making videos and posting them in social media circles of friends and family to send the underlying message of living life to its fullest and not getting bogged down mentally. The family has its roots in Porbander, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi and singing Gujarati songs or Gujarati garbas is their mantra to stay strong in such trying times. For the family, their tryst with the virus started on April 30 when one of the six brothers tested positive after showing some symptoms. “The next day, 16 other members of the family tested positive. Till yesterday 26 tested positive. This tally went up to 28 on Wednesday when two more members got infected. Except three children, everyone is infected with Covid-19,” said Rajnikant Raiyarela, 66. Raiyarela, the eldest in the family, is a retired bank employee with 31 years of experience. The brothers are into trading of cashew. The family has started medication under a doctor’s advice and they regularly monitor their oxygen and body temperature levels. A doctor on call has been arranged in case of emergency. The family is popular in the area and they used to regularly organize the Navratri festival garba before Covid-19. “We have been living together all these years, sharing one roof and one kitchen. We are fighting Covid-19 together and are sure of coming out as one family. In such times we realise the importance of a family. We want to spread the message that one must not lose hope and celebrate life,” said Raiyarela.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bhai-bhai-we-will-fight-this-together-joint-family/articleshow/82417074.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Construction of houses in Jagananna colonies from June 1||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had asked officials to start construction of houses for the poor in Jagananna colonies on June 1. The chief minister held a review meeting with the officials on housing scheme for the poor at his Tadepalli camp office on Wednesday. He directed the officials to complete the process for grounding the works by May 25. He said the works should not be stopped because of curfew and activities should be held from 6 am to 12 pm. He said water and electricity facilities should be provided in the colonies immediately as they are important to start construction. He said a model house should be construed in every layout and a detailed report on it should be generated later. The details on expenditure, savings, modifications and other issues can be reviewed based on the reports. He said the usage of steel will be reduced due to Covid which might result in decrease of prices and added that the state need 7.50 lakh tons of steel. He directed the officials to discuss with steel companies in this regard and ensure materials are given to the beneficiaries who would like to construct houses on their own. He said all the infrastructure facilities should be developed in layouts apart from constructing houses. The CC roads, underground CC drains, water supply, electrification and internet are the main components of infrastructure facilities and all these facilities should be provided. He said the construction of these houses during the pandemic will contribute to economic growth as workers get work and also business transactions continue due to the purchase of steel, cement and other materials. Levelling is very important in the construction of houses and about 1.95 lakh plots have this problem, the chief minister said. The chief minister said underground cable system would be used everywhere in future and there won’t be many problems once they are laid and directed the officials to ensure adequate depth and distance among underground cables related to water, electricity and Internet. He said the works of CC roads, water supply, electrification, underground internet, Clean Andhra Pradesh (CLAP) in Jagananna Colony layouts are under various departments. He instructed the officials to allot all the works to single agency and prepare a DPR in this regard without duplication. The chief minister said the state government would request the central government for additional funds for the prestigious housing project as the houses are being constructed on large scale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/construction-of-houses-in-jagananna-colonies-from-june-1/articleshow/82415585.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: ACB unearths irregularities in Sangam Dairy bonus payments||AMARAVATI: The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has found irregularities in bonus payment to milk producers and diversion of funds to unauthorized accounts in Sangam Dairy. Sources said ACB has seized documents to establish how senior TDP leader Dhulipalla Narendra Kumar became chairman of the dairy board without the eligibility to become the board director. As per the rules, any milk producer could become member of the primary milk producers’ cooperative society only if he sells milk to the dairy continuously for a period of 180 days in a year. A member is eligible to contest the election and become board director two years after becoming the member of primary society. Sources said Narendra who become member of Chintalapudi society in 2009, had become director and chairman in 2010 within a year of becoming primary member. “It is a violation of Cooperative Societies Act, 1964,” said Ponnur legislator Kilari Rosaiah. Rosaiah said Narendra was managing director of Dhulipalla Milk Lines, another private dairy. Although Narendra quit as MD of his own dairy, he had handed over the charge to his wife which is an instance of conflict of interest and makes Narendra ineligible to continue as Sangam dairy chairman. ACB has found evidence about disbursement of the dairy profits to the unauthorized people. The dairy announced the highest bonus of Rs.12 per litre during 2019-20 in which only Rs.6 was given to producers. Rs.3.5 per litre was diverted to DVC Trust owned by the family and Rs.2.5 per litre was converted into share capital of the company. “Nearly Rs.50 crore was diverted to DVC Trust which should have been given to farmers,” said a senior official of the cooperative department, who is closely associated with the investigation. Sangam Dairy procured huge quantities of cow milk from three dairies at Rs.30 per litre and mixed the same with the buffalo milk to sell at Rs.41 per litre in the market. An official confirmed that the dairy paid Rs.200 crore to each of the three private dairies for procurement of cow milk. ”Since investigation is still under progress, we can’t comment at this stage,” said an ACB official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/acb-unearths-irregularities-in-sangam-dairy-bonus-payments/articleshow/82415574.cms||Samdani MN
---||Patna||Patna: 42 oxygen cylinder regulators seized, four held in EOU raid||PATNA: The Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of the state police continued its crackdown against black marketeers and hoarders and recovered 42 regulators fitted with flow meters and pressure gauges meant for use in oxygen cylinders. Four persons were also arrested for selling these items on road number 23 at Rajiv Nagar in Patna on Wednesday morning. EOU sources said a regulator set fitted with metre and gauge hardly cost between Rs500 and 800 in the open market, but they were selling it at a whooping price of Rs7,000 to Rs10,000 to the attendants of Covid-19 patients who are in dire need of oxygen in the crisis situation. These regulators are important externally fitted parts of oxygen cylinders for operation. Sources said the arrested persons were identified as a pharmacy shop owner Vikash Kumar of Astupur at Biharsharif in Nalanda, Ravindra Kumar and his brother Jitendra Kumar of Balhma under Daudnagar police station area in Aurangabad and Subhash Kumar of Bhagwanganj, Patna. This was the third raid of the EOU’s special teams in three consecutive days in Patna. The teams have been formed for arresting those who are involved in black marketing or hoarding oxygen cylinders, regulators and important medicines used in the Covid-19 treatment. The raids are conducted on the complaints and inputs received from common people at the EOU’s dedicated control room phone number 0612-2215142, which is functional round-the-clock. An FIR against the four arrested persons has been lodged by the EOU team with the Rajiv Nagar police station. EOU sources said the accused had purchased the items from the open market at least 15 days back when acute crisis of oxygen supply had just started for Covid patients. “They stored the items to sell at exorbitant prices later,” an EOU source said. He said Rakesh is the kingpin of the racket. “The EOU team first arrested Ravindra, Jitendra and Subhas, who reached the spot for regulator delivery. After their arrest, Rakesh was also called for supplying more regulators and nabbed,” a source said, adding altogether 42 regulators with flow meters and pressure gauges were seized from their possession. Earlier on Tuesday, EOU had arrested two persons and recovered 12 large oxygen cylinders of 50 litres each from a closed shop on 90ft Road under Patrakar Nagar police station area in Patna. They were selling one cylinder at an exponential rate of Rs65,000. On Monday, EOU had arrested two brothers and recovered five oxygen cylinders of 50 litres capacity from their possession in Agamkuan. The duo was selling the cylinders at an unbelievable rate of Rs85,000 amid the present crisis situation. On April 28, a district administration team had raided a local news channel office at Anandpuri under S K Puri police station area in Patna, leading to recovery of 60 five-litre oxygen cylinders, which were being sold at Rs10,000 each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/42-oxygen-cylinder-regulators-seized-four-held-in-eou-raid/articleshow/82414750.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Bihar: Two more judicial officers succumb to Covid-19, toll rises to five||PATNA: The number of judicial officers succumbing to Covid-19 has gone up to five in the state with a family court principal judge losing his life after battling the virus for almost a week at a hospital in Patna on Tuesday. The news of his death came to the public domain only on Wednesday. The deceased senior judge, Durgesh Mani Tripathy, aged around 57 years, was posted in Muzaffarpur on January 13 this year. He was initially undergoing treatment at a hospital in Muzaffarpur from where he was shifted to a private hospital in Patna where he breathed his last. The judge was a native of Baria in the Kushinagar district of Uttar Pradesh. Senior lawyer Yogesh Chandra Verma, who is the coordination committee chairman of all three lawyers’ association of the high court, on Wednesday said more than 100 lawyers across Bihar have succumbed in the past one month. “At least 15 to 20 lawyers of the high court are among the deceased. From whichever district across the state I sought information, death reports of at least two to three lawyers from each of them have been received till now,” Verma said, adding more than a thousand lawyers across the state are infected with the Covid-19 virus. Apart from judge Tripathy, a young judicial magistrate Deepak Kumar posted in Khagaria also died of Covid-19 after remaining under treatment for several days at a private hospital in Patna. Before them, an additional district and sessions judge Piyush Kumar Srivastava posted at Sasaram died on April 30. He was the nephew of Justice Hemant Kumar Srivastava of Patna high court who retired on February 1 this year. Earlier, an additional chief judicial magistrate Amit Kumar posted at Patna civil court also died of Covid-19 at a private hospital in Patna on April 26. Railway Magistrate Manish Kumar posted at Kiul in Lakhisarai was the first Bihar subordinate judicial service officer who succumbed to the second wave of Covid-19 at a private hospital in Patna on April 20. An assistant registrar of the high court, Anand Kishore, also lost his life in Patna on Tuesday night. He was under treatment for almost a month during which he was admitted to two different hospitals in the state capital. Kishore is the seventh HC staff to succumb in Covid-19 second wave. Before him, assistant registrar Gagan Mishra, deputy registrar Nasimul Hoda, section officer Rakesh Priyadarshi, assistant section officer Saira Begum, an assistant Mayank Singh and a woman peon Praniya Devi lost their lives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-more-judicial-officers-succumb-to-covid-19-toll-rises-to-five/articleshow/82414956.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Pune||Shortage of key medicines still hinders Covid-19 care in Pune Metropolitan Region||PUNE: Supply of essential medicines continued to fall short across the Pune Metropolitan Region for the fourth consecutive week, hampering Covid-19 treatment. In addition to the chronic shortages of remdesivir and tocilizumab, doctors expressed concerns over not-so-sufficient stock of the key supportive drugs routinely used in intensive care (ICU) settings for severely-ill patients. The supply of medical oxygen, which badly hit the patient-care services in the last three weeks, has, however, started to improve gradually since the last the four days. “Besides the long-standing shortages of remdesivir and tocilizumab, we have now started facing the crunch of other drugs like sedatives, analgesics, muscle relaxants, antifungals and blood thinners,” said senior anaesthesiologist HK Sale, executive director, Noble hospital, which is one of the prominent Covid hospitals in the city. Pune district received a total of 12,000 vials of antiviral drug remdesivir in the last 24 hours, including 9,756 vials on Wednesday. This was the highest ever allocation in the Pune district so far. However, in terms of daily requirement, which has gone up to 16,000 vials, the allocation still stands low. “This has been more than a month now that the supply of remdesivir and tocilizumab has remained erratic. We do not get any vials in between the supply on some days, which remains a worry,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, Pune branch. However, the situation has slowly started improving in terms of oxygen supply, treating doctors said. “Comparatively, the supply of medical oxygen has slowly started improving in Pune. At least, there have been no distress calls for medical oxygen since the last four days,” Patil said. Having said that, quite many small hospitals dependent on a daily supply of oxygen cylinders still have to beg and borrow to continue daily patient-care services, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shortage-of-key-medicines-still-hinders-covid-19-care/articleshow/82417499.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Business||Tata Steel calls off sale of SE Asian biz||MUMBAI: Tata Steel has put its proposal to sell the Southeast Asian business on the back burner as the company enters the next phase of its plan to consolidate operations, boost margins and reduce debt. The move follows an improvement in the Southeast Asian business performance since it was put on the block in early 2019. Operating profit of the business more than doubled after growing 105% to Rs 295 crore in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Tata Steel reviewed the progress of its Southeast Asia business (which is in Singapore and Thailand) and decided to do away with its classification as assets ‘held for sale’, it said in a regulatory filing. Consequent to the reclassification, the Southeast Asia operations are presented as ‘continuing operations’ in Tata Steel’s Q4FY21 statement, it added. The management explained that the company, over the last fiscal year, “did some work on the fundamentals of the Southeast Asia business” and felt that it should focus on running it, given the upcycle in the steel industry. Besides Southeast Asia, Tata Steel’s international play includes Europe, where it is splitting its UK and Netherlands units. After separation, the focus will be on transformation, especially of the UK unit, the management said. “The company is not looking at embarking on any strategic action on the Netherlands or Europe at this time.” While the company decided to continue with its international operations, it also continues to evaluate opportunities in India, its largest market. Tata Steel, said its management, will “take a call” on Rashtriya Ispat Nigam, in which the government plans to sell its stake. It has already evinced an interest in Neelachal Ispat Nigam, a PSU based in Odisha. The management described that the company is looking at M&A to boost its long products portfolio that includes wires, bars and rods. Both Neelachal and Rashtriya Ispat are into long products. These opportunities are being considered on the back of robust earnings and cash flows. Tata Steel generated a free cash flow of Rs 23,748 crore in fiscal 2021, led by strong operating performance of its India business. It also lowered its net debt by Rs 29,390 crore to Rs 75,389 crore, and has plans to reduce it further by “more than a billion dollars” in the current fiscal. Tata Steel MD T V Narendran said the first half of fiscal 2021 was challenging following the uncertainties and complexities brought on by the pandemic. But he added that the domestic steel demand has been improving since then with accommodative policies, government spending and relaxation in mobility restrictions. He further said the second wave of Covid in India is a risk and the company is working to minimise the impact on its employees and communities while meeting the requirements of its customers. On Wednesday, Tata Steel reported a profit of Rs 8,190 crore for fiscal 2021, compared to a profit of Rs 1,172 crore in the year-ago period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-steel-calls-off-sale-of-se-asian-biz/articleshow/82417411.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Business||Covid drug: Natco eyes patent waiver||Hyderabad/Mumbai: In the first instance of a pharma company taking the compulsory licensing (CL) route to launch a Covid drug in India, Hyderabad-based Natco Pharma has filed for a waiver of patent rights to manufacture rheumatoid arthritis drug Baricitinib. The CL, if granted, will help in improving the accessibility and affordability of the drug, bringing its price down substantially. The USFDA had last November granted emergency authorisation for Baricitinib in combination with Remdesivir. At present, a limited quantity of the patented drug is available in the country, and that too, at an exorbitant price (see graphic). The patent is held by Incyte Holdings, with a licence to Eli Lilly, which markets the drug under the Olumiant brand name. The application has been filed under Section 92 of the Patents Act, which can be invoked by the Centre due to a national emergency, circumstances of extreme urgency or in case of public non-commercial use. In its application, Natco has cited the unmet medical needs due to the lack of supply and affordability in light of the grave and life-threatening national public health emergency caused by the second Covid wave as the main grounds for seeking the CL. Under the World Trade Organization TRIPS Agreement, CLs are legally recognised means to overcome barriers in accessing affordable medicines. Under the rules, governments allow a company to manufacture a patented drug without the consent of the innovator firm. In 2012, Natco became the first company to get a compulsory licence in India, which was related to a cancer drug called Nexavar. While there have been attempts to invoke the provisions again, the government has resisted regular use of the clause. Natco’s move is, however, expected to force the government to examine the application carefully given that former PM Manmohan Singh had pointed to the flexibility available under the law, although his reference was in the context of ramping up vaccination. The application puts pressure on the US drug maker, analysts said. It has only two choices — either give a voluntary licence or sue Natco for the patent, which could result in a public backlash given the soaring Covid case load and death toll in India. Natco has applied for a CL at a time when India and South Africa have approached the WTO for a temporary suspension of intellectual property rights of pharma companies so that Covid vaccines and other medicines can be accessible to poor countries. “It’s time India set up an independent committee of experts to consider and advice on compulsory licensing and use of other safeguards for Covid medical products, including medicines and vaccines,” lawyer and IP expert Leena Menghaney told TOI.In its application, Natco has urged the Controller General of Patents to grant it a CL to manufacture and market Baricitinib, both as bulk API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) and finished dosage only for Covid treatment in India till the pandemic prevails. It is also willing to pay a 7% royalty on net profits from Baricitinib sales to the patent-holder. Making its case, Natco’s application said Olumiant is not manufactured in India — less than 9,000 tablets were imported in 2019 and 2020, at an average cost of Rs 3,230 per tablet. Citing the pricing as a significant barrier, it said a 14-day regimen (one tablet a day) works out to approximately Rs 45,220 per patient, which most Indians can ill-afford. Natco said it would structure its pricing at Rs 30 each for a 4mg tablet, which translates to Rs 420 for a 14-day course, Rs 20 for a 2mg tablet (Rs 280 for the regimen) and Rs 15 for each 1mg tablet, costing only Rs 210 for the entire 14-day therapy.It also pointed out that the drug’s limited imports, which dropped from 8,870 tablets in 2019 to 8,385 tablets in 2020, would not be enough to cater the nearly 34 lakh Covid patients in India. “The tablets of Olumiant imported through 2020 by Lilly would serve at best to meet the needs of only approximately 600 patients,” Natco said in its application, a copy of which was reviewed by TOI. Why the drug matters Baricitinib is a rheumatoid arthritis drug used in combination with Remdesivir for Covid treatment in some countries. The US Food and Drug Authority granted emergency use authorisation for Baricitinib in November 2020. The drug prevents a cytokine storm and calms down the immune system by inhibiting Janus Kinases (enzymes) that send signals to the cells to make more cytokines. The use of Baricitinib with Remdesivir reduces hospital time, increases chances of survival and also has minimal associated adverse events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-drug-natco-eyes-patent-waiver/articleshow/82417797.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The new plant will generate 100 metric tonnes (MT) of liquid medical oxygen (LMO). Experts from the concerned agency, M/s ALIH, have already arrived at the site for a health assessment of the installed plant and machineries, which would be followed by trial runs of equipment. Later, integrated trial runs would be conducted before commissioning and production of LMO. The plant was constructed 10 years ago by French company Air Liquide. In addition to the supply of oxygen, VSP is also preparing a 1,000-bed Covid-19 care facility on its premises. As a first step, the facility is being made ready at Gurajada Kalakshetram at Ukkunagaram.

The temple body said it was forced to relax the curfew timings for devotees as many of them made their darshan, accommodation and travel bookings about a month in advance. Meanwhile, the Hundi collections at Lord Venkateswara temple have come down sharply due to the decline in pilgrim footfall in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases across the state and in many parts of the country. Following the announcement of the 18-hour curfew across the state, only 4,723 devotees visited the hill temple on Tuesday. The Hundi collections for the day was Rs 39 lakh. Meanwhile, the 18-hour curfew came into force across the state at 12 noon from Wednesday. The government will review the Covid situation after two weeks and decide whether to increase the duration or reduce the curfew timings. Tirupati SP Ch Venkata Appala Naidu, Chittoor SP S Senthil Kumar, and Anantapur SP B Satya Yesu Babu monitored the imposition of the curfew timings in their respective areas and ensured that all shops and commercial establishments downed shutters at 12 noon. “Only on-duty vehicles, ambulances, and other emergency and essential services will be allowed. There will be ban on movement of autos and taxis during the curfew timings. We urge people to cooperate and help contain the spread of the virus,” said Yesu Babu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ttd-relaxes-curfew-curbs-for-devotees/articleshow/82416182.cms||---
---||Patna||Patna: Academics for doing away with entrance test for UG admission||PATNA: Even as the advancement of summer vacation in universities and colleges by a month followed by a statewide lockdown has brought all the academic activities to a grinding halt, Patna University (PU) academics have suggested some steps to maintain the academic schedule. The academic calendar of PU, along with that of all other universities in the state, were derailed in the 2020-21 session owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. Most universities are yet to complete their undergraduate and postgraduate examinations. Admission to most UG and PG courses in the last academic session were also considerably delayed in almost all the institutions of higher education in the state, said the academics. Last year, PU had announced its admission schedule for UG and PG courses in April itself, but it is yet to be announced this year. And, it is likely to be delayed further with the various restrictions imposed as a result of the lockdown. Hence, it would be better if the process of admission of students to various courses is shortened and all the admissions are completed as early as possible after the last date of the receipt of applications, they said. Patna Science College physics department’s retired teacher Anil Kumar Verma said the practice of holding entrance tests for admission to the undergraduate courses may be done away with and students be admitted purely on the basis of marks obtained at Plus two (intermediate) level. This would save lots of time in holding the entrance test by calling the applicants at Patna, increasing the risk of their getting infected with the virus. “Heaven will not fall if no entrance test is held for a year or so for admitting students in different academic programmes during the pandemic,” he said. College principal S R Padmadeo appreciated the idea of doing away with the system of admission through entrance tests by making some necessary amendments in the admission ordinance. The university may approach the Raj Bhavan with a concrete proposal for getting the chancellor’s accent on a transitory regulation for doing away with the entrance test and allowing the university to admit students simply on marks secured in class XII examination, he said. PU students’ welfare dean N K Jha said the university has already entered into an agreement with a Lucknow-based firm for implementing the university management information system (UMIS) for expediting the admission process online. The announcement regarding online admission to UG and PG courses both under conventional and self-financing modes in the academic session 2021-22 would be made shortly after the end of the current lockdown, he said. Jha admitted that doing away with the entrance test would save lots of time and help maintain the university calendar. The university has already decided to stop holding interviews of candidates after the written test from the current year and abolition of the test would further ease the situation during the current pandemic. “If the statutory bodies of university like the academic council and syndicate formally pass such a resolution regarding transitory regulation for a year, the same would be sent to the chancellor for his assent,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/academics-for-doing-away-with-entrance-test-for-ug-admission/articleshow/82414792.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Bihar: Weddings, funerals super spreader as Covid-19 penetrates rural areas||BETTIAH: A sudden burst of deaths amid a largely untested rural populace increasingly gripped with Covid-like symptoms in West Champaran have bolstered the worst fears that the coronavirus has penetrated rural Bihar with its sting of death. “We are overstretched and also understaffed now with many health workers and technicians testing positive themselves,” civil surgeon Arun K Sinha said. Packed beyond capacity with Covid patients, the district’s premier hospital -GMCH- put up a ‘No Bed. No Admission’ notice on Tuesday itself. “Today we lost Dr Dharmendra Prasad, associate professor of medicine, at a private nursing home in Patna,” GMCH principal Binod Prasad condoled on Wednesday. With over a hundred deaths at hospital facilities, the number of Covid casualties, however, are feared much more with increasingly viral accounts of deaths pouring in from far-flung villages. Nine people from rural areas died either post admission or before at the sub-divisional hospital at Narkatiaganj on Wednesday. Chandrika Devi (60) from Damrapur, Dayanand Gupta (65) from BhikhnaThori, along with Rajpati Devi (45) from Bhataura village died of Covid at Narkatiaganj. Another half a dozen critical patients from rural areas also succumbed. They included Ravi Kant Nath Tiwari from Lauriya and Yashoda Devi from Nonis Tola. Local reporters said four others were dead on arrival and their kin took the bodies home. All of them were untested. Adding to wedding congregations and festival shopping, funerals of both suspected and confirmed Covid deceased have become new catalysts in the spread of coronavirus. Bhojpuri lyricist Shyam Dehati, reported in these columns, was cremated with the fanfare of the celebrity at his native village Mahui-Naukatola on April 19. “Another villager Radhey Shyam Pathak’s funeral was also conducted with traditionally elaborate rituals,” mukhiya Sudha Singh said, bemoaning that only a fraction of the village got themselves tested. “I hope the lockdown is strictly implemented in villages as people are still congregating without precautions,” she prayed, bemoaning that four more villagers have died since Saturday. “All of them went without tests even though symptoms have rampaged across,” she added. The two funerals, including folk star Dehati’s, are not the only protocol-dismissing last rites. The case of Shambhu Yadav, PACS chief and husband of Laukaria mukhiya Madhu Devi, is shocking. Yadav died of Covid at the GMCH last Friday. “A large crowd gathered as his body arrived wrapped in plastic,” a villager, not willing to be named, said, ruing: “The kin ripped open the body bag for the family and gathered crowd to have their last darshan before a well attended cremation on the banks of the Gandak.” Bairiya BDO Krishna Ram denied knowledge of any wrong doing. “Ask the police,” he advised. “I have rejoined duty after leave only yesterday. There is no station diary entry of any breach of Covid protocol,” SHO Dushyant said. Anand, the son of deceased Shamhu, too claimed that Covid protocols were followed. “We brought the body home to show mummy. People were at a distance,” he claimed. However, when asked about a picture, also available with TOI, he said: “I only took the picture. Ab log viral kar diyen to kya karen?” The picture shows the dead body open for public viewing, the thin black plastic bodybag ripped apart. Asked if he and his family weren’t afraid of becoming positive, Anand, an engineering student in Dehradun, said: “My brother too had tested positive. Pandey ji at GMCH said ‘don’t take tension. Go and be in home isolation’. We are ok.” Whn asked who is Pandey ji, he said, “A co-villager working at the GMCH.” Another four villagers in an arc of about ten km in Gaunaha block died on Tuesday-Wednesday. Pardesi Lal of Jamunia, Mohan Gaurav (32)of Baithania, Bikau Hajra (55) of Dewar and Rajeshwar Mahto (36) of Rajpur Gaon, all died suffering from high fever, cough and cold. Except for Mahto who had tested negative in the antigen test, the rest went untested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/weddings-funerals-super-spreader-as-covid-19-penetrates-rural-areas/articleshow/82414893.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha
---||Patna||Bihar: ECR GM launches app for railway employees to get medical help||PATNA: Alarmed at sudden increase in the cases of Covid-19 pandemic in Bihar, East Central Railway (ECR) GM L C Trivedi launched a mobile app ‘Sparsh’ to facilitate medical assistance to railway employees and their family members at any of the railway hospitals located under its five divisions of Danapur, Sonepur, Samastipur, Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and Dhanbad on Tuesday. According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, railways has designed and developed this app exclusively for the employees of the ECR, keeping in view the medical emergency-like situation in the country caused by the deadly second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Under the new system, ECR employees can download the app from Google Playstore in their mobile phones and utilize its services in need, he said. The app has the provision for online registration. Any employee can select a railway hospital located near his place for immediate medical assistance. This app displays various options for needy employees like of Covid-19 vaccine, RT-PCR, HRCT, Covid profile, OPD, routine medical advice and consultation with doctors. Depending on the emergency needs of the employees or patients, they can select the option and get themselves registered accordingly to avail the facility, the CPRO said. He said while the railways’ superspecialty hospital at Karbhigahiya in Patna falls under the select category of railway hospitals, other divisional railway hospitals are located at Danapur, Sonepur, Samastipur, Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and Dhanbad. However, railways has already announced Danapur railway hospital as the Covid-19 dedicated hospital for the railway employees, he said, adding Covid tests, vaccines and other medical facilities are available at each railway hospital under ECR. The app was designed and developed by ECR senior official I N Yadav in coordination with another railway official, Prasanna Katyayam, he said. About 2500 railway employees and officials under ECR have tested positive for Covid-19 so far while 10 to 12 employees died so far. Besides, hundreds of railway employees, including frontline staff, are still in home isolation and recovering fast, sources said, adding the ECR has raised its own Covid fund to benefit railway employees and their family members at a time when life has become difficult to survive sans financial support. Meanwhile, railways has cancelled Rajendra Nagar Terminal-New Jalpaiguri special passenger train (03245/03246) due to poor occupancy rate caused by Covid-19 from May 6. Railways has already cancelled 23 pairs of MEMU/DEMU special trains on different routes of the ECR in Bihar due to Covid-19 pandemic and poor occupancy rate of passengers, the CPRO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ecr-gm-launches-app-for-rly-employees-to-get-medical-help/articleshow/82415103.cms||Kumod Verma

The hospital has 40 in-patients being treated for Covid-19 and most of them are on oxygen supply. The police, on receiving an alert, reached the hospital and brought the situation under control. Police and the hospital management interacted with the district administration and secured four oxygen cylinders for immediate service. The officials have placed an order for an oxygen tanker to fill all cylinders at the hospital to avoid a recurrence of the situation. Meanwhile, officials from the government said the hospital did not alert officials concerned on availability of oxygen stock. “We are closely monitoring the availability of oxygen and beds, besides vaccine,” a senior official told media at the Covid-19 command and control centre.

Altogether 2,264 persons had their meals in the daytime and the similar number of people were expected in the night to have their meals at the community kitchens. Most of them are daily wage earners and roadside vendors. Patna DM Dr Chandrasekhar Singh inspected the community kitchens at Bankipur Girl’s High School, College of Commerce and Patna High School, Gardanibagh. The fourth kitchen is running at the Inter Miller High School. Besides, seven community kitchens set up and managed by the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) and other urban bodies are running at Gai Ghat Raen Basera, Malahi Pakadi, McDowell Chowk, Rajendra Nagar, community building near SK Puri Park, near Patna Science College, DAV School, Saguna and Saidpur. “Large number of destitute, people with disabilities, the poor living on begging, slum dwellers, roadside vendors and poor families of the neighbouring areas took their meals as all other means of earning livelihood has stopped due to the lockdown,” said the DM. All these kitchens are being supervised by nodal officers appointed by the district administration. Beside providing two meals, these community kitchens are also making people aware about the Covid protocols of maintaining physical distance, sanitizing hands and keeping cleanliness all around. “There was sufficient arrangement at all places so as to meet the daily food requirements in case of increase in the number of people Thursday onward,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-get-meals-at-community-kitchens/articleshow/82414669.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||‘No shortage of any Covid drugs’||PATNA: There is no shortage of any medicine in the state capital, claimed the secretary of Patna Chemists and Druggists Association (PCDA) Rajesh Kumar Arya. He, however, admitted that some popular brands of medicines often prescribed by doctors might temporarily run short at retailer shops. "There are over 20,000 retailers in the Patna district. It includes medicine shops attached to hospitals and nursing homes," he said. There are complaints of non-availability of some medicines in the open market recommended by doctors through telemedicine for symptomatic treatment in home isolation after being tested positive. "Important drugs in huge demand all over the state are dexamethasone, azithromycin, paracetamol, vitamin c and zinc tablets. All these drugs required for Covid kit at home are available in sufficient quantity," Arya said, adding, it was not advisable to use any of these without suggestion from doctors. As these drugs are being produced by hundreds of companies with varying brand names, their availability status in the wholesale market is judged based on their generic names or composition instead of brand names. Meanwhile, the PCDA wrote a letter to the DM for closing the movement of general traffic through GM Road, the hub of the wholesale drug market of the state, and only allow vehicles carrying drugs and injections. Arya said, the rush of private vehicles often obstructs the movement of drug transporting vehicles, some with urgently needed life-saving drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-shortage-of-any-covid-drugs/articleshow/82414608.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Kolkata||RT-PCR air-pocket awaits flyers; carriers to slash flights as traffic crash fear looms||Kolkata: Airlines fear the already poor flight loads will plummet to unsustainable levels from Saturday once the rule for mandatory RT-PCR tests for all incoming passengers kicks in. Daily traffic has already crashed from 40,000-45,000 in February-end to 20,000-25,000 in April-end to 10,000-15,000 now and the flight count will also go down. While RT-PCR tests are currently required for flyers bound for Kolkata, Bagdogra and Andal from Delhi, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Telangana and Kerala, from Saturday, May 8, all passengers will have to furnish the RT-PCR negative report before boarding any Bengal-bound flight. If a person lands without an RT-PCR report, the passenger will be quarantined for 14 days and will be required to pay for it. “Mandatory RT-PCR test for flyers will increase the load on over-stretched diagnostic laboratories. With many patients having to wait 96 hours for reports, it will be extremely difficult to get a test done, let alone obtain a result within 72 hours. This could bring down the travel figure to 5,000-6,000 from next week,” an airline official said. Carriers have also begun clubbing flights to reduce operational losses. The flight count at Kolkata airport has reduced from 230 last month to 154 on Wednesday and is expected to dip further next week. Airlines were flooded with calls on Wednesday with anxious passengers inquiring about where to get RT-PCR tests done, particularly those set to travel from smaller cities in the north-east and Port Blair where getting the test done is a challenge. There is also confusion over whether RT-PCR test is required after Indian Medical Council of Research issued an advisory stating that RT-PCR test was not required for healthy individuals travelling from one state to another. While acknowledging the need to ensure safety first, travel agents called for rapid antigen tests (RAT) on arrival as a viable solution. “Bringing down active cases in Bengal is the need of hour. RAT makes more sense as it will free up RT-PCR resources for those with Covid symptoms,” said Travel Agents Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni. Anil Punjabi, the eastern region chairman of Travel Agents Federation of India, also called for RAT tests on arrival. “The RT-PCR test may be the gold standard, but what’s the guarantee that a person who gets tested 72 hours before travel does not get infected thereafter? A RAT test makes more sense,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rt-pcr-air-pocket-awaits-flyers-carriers-to-slash-flights-as-traffic-crash-fear-looms/articleshow/82415467.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Now the three separate PILs of petitioners Shivani Kaushik, Rohit Kumar and Gaurav Kumar Singh would be heard by the division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar. A notice was issued by the high court listing section on Wednesday evening that the three PILs would be taken up for hearing by the division bench headed by Chief Justice Karol at 11am on Thursday. The division bench of Justices Singh and Shah, during at least eight hearings since April 15, had made several scathing verbal observations against the state government regarding its handling of the Covid situation. It’s the same bench which had directed the state government on Monday either to impose lockdown immediately or it will have to order that. Incidentally, the division bench of Justices Singh and Shah on Tuesday had observed that the health infrastructure of the state government may be handed over to armed forces medical services as the situation had gone beyond control. During Tuesday’s hearing, the bench had even observed that if some drastic steps were not taken at this stage, the situation in the state arising out of Covid crisisis likely to deteriorate to immeasurable proportions. “The court will be failing in its duty if necessary orders are not passed befitting the present situation in the larger public interest to ensure protection of right to life of the people in the state of Bihar,” the court had observed. It also observed that most of its directions have remained on paper and not been complied with. Earlier, the division bench of Chief Justice and Justice Anil Kumar Sinha had heard Kaushik and Kumar’s PILs together on January 13 once. Afterwards, the bench of Chief Justice and Justice S Kumar heard both the PILs together on January 30 and February 25. Singh’s PIL was filed later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/new-hc-bench-to-hear-pils-on-state-covid-situation/articleshow/82414709.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The centre has been receiving calls from jobless people living in the district. The centre is yet to address the grievances of migrant workers returning to the district from other parts of the country. Peter Miz, labour officer of Katihar Sadar, said, “We have received 2-3 calls in this regard. But, all were local residents. One person, who was a mason, contacted us for a job. But, no migrant worker has contacted us till date.” Manoj Kumar Das, labour officer of Mansahi block in the district, said a person had contacted them previous year. Niraj Kumar, labour officer, Barari, said two calls were logged and both came from Katihar. One person's name was Enayak Hussain and the other was Niranjan Kumar. Both were residents of Katihar and were look for a job. Anshu Kumar, labour officer, Kursela, said two calls were received from Katihar residents. Their details were forwarded to the authorities concerned for further action. “The call centre was activated just 2-3 days ago and it will take some more time when migrant workers will start contacting us,” he added. Ashutosh Sunny, labour officer, Manihari, said, “Two unemployed persons from Katihar talked to us and we have forwarded their applications to the deputy employment officer for necessary action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/call-centre-revived-in-katihar-for-workers/articleshow/82415001.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Venugopala Dikshitulu, who was appointed as chief priest of Tirumala temple in May 2019, had moved the high court challenging the TTD’s order on April 2 reinstating the ‘retired’ AV Ramana Deekshitulu as chief priest of the temple. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, senior counsel C V Mohan Reddy said reappointing retired priests is in violation of the Endowments Act. He said Ramana was reinstated by the TTD as chief priest at the age of 74. Venugopala has not challenged the order entirely but has sought interim relief and wants the endowments department or the TTD EO to not interfere with his current duties as chief priest consequent to the appointment of Ramana, he said. Justice K Vijayalakshmi reserved judgment on the interim order sought and asked the respondents to file counters. Another petition has been moved by Govindaraja Deekshitulu, challenging reappointment of AS Narasimha Deekshitulu.

---||Business||Smartphone prices may rise as second wave dents market||Chennai: After a robust performance in the January to March quarter, the smartphone market stares at a bleak April - June quarter as resurgence of Covid derails consumer sentiment. Customers will also be shelling out more to buy their next device as adverse economic conditions and shortage of key components is set to bring in around 10% price hike in handsets, especially in those priced under Rs 15,000. “Looking further into 2021, unfavorable macroeconomic factors will lead to a rising smartphone ASP,” Varun Kannan, analyst at research firm Canalys said. “A combination of the ongoing supply crunch on key imported components and a weaker rupee will make it increasingly difficult for vendors to maintain margins at current price levels. Consumers will bear the brunt of this cost, which will hit particularly hard in the sub-$200 smartphone segment, which accounted for 81% of the market last year,” he added. Smartphones industry tracker Counterpoint Research estimates around 4%-5% surge in smartphone prices in the coming quarter due to factors such as a shortage of chipsets and power management integrated circuits, the currency fluctuation, and due to a rise in import duty on displays , among others. Counterpoint pegs shipments of smartphones in January to March to have touched a record first quarter high of 38 million units at a year-on-year growth rate of 23% on the back of pent-up demand and the optimism of a vaccination drive. “But these numbers should be taken with caution as a second and more virulent wave of Covid-19 is currently on in the country and is likely to impact the coming quarters. The consumer demand will take a hit due to the ongoing Covid-19 wave and subsequent lockdowns,” senior research analyst Prachir Singh, noted. For instance, Xiaomi has increased the launch price of Redmi Note 10 (one of its volume drivers in the sub-$200 price segment) from Rs 11,999 to Rs 12,499 for its base model. Analysts believe more brands are likely to follow and price hikes will continue in the second half of 2021. “The measure of price hike impact is very uncertain now as we are surrounded by the second wave and a lot depends on vaccination campaign efficiency,” Canalys analyst Sanyam Chaurasia, said. “A lot will also depend on the supply side environment in Q2. Production being a factor of supply, a key focus would remain on the developments in Noida, which has manufacturing facilities for mostly all major brands,” he added. Among other price management strategies, analysts expect brands to release new models with old processors at entry-level devices. “You might also see less offers for end consumers on e-commerce and offline retailers,” Chaurasia said. Canalys expects smartphone shipments in India to plunge in the April to June quarter as regional lockdowns are set to hamper transport of raw materials and devices. Demand will be back to normalcy if vaccination campaigns are handled efficiently, the firm said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/smartphone-prices-may-rise-as-second-wave-dents-market/articleshow/82416054.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

To ease the situation, Tirupati MLA Bhumana Karunakar Reddy stepped in and on Wednesday performed the last rites of 23 bodies here. With nearly 3000-odd cases being reported daily in Chittoor district and the death toll too being on the higher side during the second wave, the hospital was saddled with the bodies of 23 dead patients. When the doctors took up the issue with Karunakar Reddy during a review meeting recently, he stepped forward to perform the final rites of all the deceased patients, who were abandoned by their family members. Accompanied by his followers and members of the Tirupati Muslim Covid-19 JAC, the Tirupati legislator shifted the bodies to a burial ground on the outskirts of the city near the Mamandur reserve forest area and performed the final rites. Karunakar Reddy urged the public to shed the social stigma and not to run away from the responsibility of performing the final rites of a deceased person. “This is definitely an hour of crisis for everyone but this is also the time to act as a human being,” the Tirupati MLA said to the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tirupati-mla-performs-last-rites-of-covid-deceased-abandoned-by-kin/articleshow/82416228.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

The sensex rallied 424 points or nearly 1% to 48,678. The address by Das allayed traders’ fears of another financial relief package for borrowers — which would have led to banks taking a hit again. As a result, bank stocks gained on Wednesday. The RBI’s latest package is aimed at helping stakeholders in the healthcare sector, hence pharma stocks too were among the top gainers. According to Dhiraj Relli, MD & CEO, HDFC Securities, the RBI governor’s announcement did not include a blanket moratorium and hence some of these fears did not come out to be true and banking stocks did not see a selloff. The day’s gains, however, came despite selling by both foreign and domestic players. BSE data showed that while foreign institutions were net sellers at Rs 1,111 crore, domestic investors were net sellers at Rs 241 crore. Such net outflows made traders jittery, market players said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bank-pharma-stocks-lift-sensex-by-424-pts/articleshow/82417588.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The then 26-year-old Mar Chrysostom was on his way to assume charge as a clergyman after completing his theological studies in Bengaluru. As he was waiting for the train to Kerala, he struck up a conversation with the porters at the station seeing the utter misery of their lives. They challenged him to stay with them to see their world of harsh toil and the well-built, over six-foot tall Mar Chrysostom, readily accepted the challenge. He worked as a porter at the station for one month. As Mar Chrysostom says in his auto biography: “After the one-month stay with them, I wanted to become a registered porter. But I had to get the metropolitan’s permission.” Though the metropolitan welcomed the idea, he insisted that he needed a clergyman for the parishes and Chrysostom had to half-heartedly drop the idea of becoming a porter. Philipose Mar Chrysostom, popularly known as Valiya metropolitan, who passed away at the age of 103 on Wednesday, was an outstanding personality widely respected and loved for his humanist ideals and inborn sense of humour. He served as a bishop for 68 years which is a record in the Indian church. The bishop was admitted to a private hospital in Thiruvalla after his health deteriorated on April 23. He was discharged on Tuesday after he regained health but his condition worsened again on the wee hours of Wednesday. The funeral will be held at the special cemetery for bishops at the church headquarters in Thiruvalla at 3pm on Thursday. Mar Chrysostom was born in Adangappurath Kalamannil, a family of priestly tradition, as the son of K E Oommen Kassessa, vicar general of the Mar Thoma Church and Sosamma on April 27, 1918. After school education in Maramon, Kozhencherry and Eraviperoor, he obtained BA degree from Union Christian College, Aluva. His commitment to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ made young Philip Oommen involve in missionary work in Ankola, Karnataka. After working there from 1940-1942, he started Theological studies in United Theological College, Bengaluru. He was ordained as deacon on January 1, 1944. Along with theological studies, he fulfilled the duty of leading the Bengaluru parish. After participating in the activities of Ankola Ashram for some time, he served as vicar of Kottarakkara, Mylom, Pattamala, Manganam and Thiruvananthapuram parishes. In 1953, he got ordained as episcopa (bishop) with the name Philipose Mar Chrysostom Episcopa. Later, history proved that he richly deserved the name of St Chrysostom of the golden tongue. He joined St Augustine’s College, Canterbury, England to pursue further theological studies. On his return in 1954, he was given responsibility of Kottayam-Kunnamkulam diocese and Mar Thoma Vaideeka Seminary. Thirumeni, as he was fondly called, had a special concern for socially and economically backward parishes. He formulated and implemented projects to improve the social, economic and cultural condition of several backward parishes. A pleasant attitude was his biggest asset. His eagerness to share the joy of life and his love for fun conversation and humour endeared him to people across religious and political spectrums. Universally known for his humour, many books have been published containing his funny anecdotes and talks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mar-chrysostom-the-priest-who-shared-the-joy-of-life/articleshow/82415619.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Surat||Gujarat: Tsunami of mucormycosis among Covid-19 recovered||AHMEDABAD/SURAT: If disease and death all around due to Covid-19 infection was not enough, Gujarat is also battling an exponential rise in deadly attack of mucormycosis (MM), also known as black fungus, which is typically pushing Covid-recovered back into ICUs and surgical wards. Those with uncontrolled diabetes and heavy use of steroid to survive Covid-19 complications are worst affected. Senior ENT surgeon Dr Navin Patel said, “A tsunami of mucormycosis is happening which threatens to kill patients who were saved from Covid. Rampant use of steroids during corona pandemic needs to be rationalized.” Patients are afflicted with a second round of suffering including excruciating pain, 20-30% lose their eye-sight, families run up bills ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 30 lakh and yet a big percentage succumb to the fungal infection. The MM spike is especially alarming in the current surge where doctors say they are spending 14-16 hours a day operating an average 5-6 patients daily. The unprecedented rise has triggered a shortage of amphotericin B, a key drug used to treat MM. Patients like Govind Bharwad, 57, a diabetic who recovered from Covid but remains critical due to rapid spread of MM in Surat, continue to suffer. “The patient has already been given 30 amphotericin B injections and he needs to be given it for one more week. There is severe shortage of the injection and it is being sold in black market at Rs 5,000 when its actual price is Rs 2,800,” said Togabhai Bharwad, nephew of Govind. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Atul Patel who is part of the national MM study in Covid pandemic says there are 11 patients admitted under him currently at Sterling Hospital. One of them is a 34-year-old young man who lost his eye after the fungus invaded his eye. "He has barely recovered from Covid-19 and has been put on an elaborate regime to Amphotericin B to save his life. It is a cruel double whammy," says Dr Patel. Of the 270 MM patient studies done in Diwali surge nationally, diabetes and steroid use were found to be the biggest risk factors. "Nearly 85% of MM patients with Covod-19 history had uncontrolled blood sugar and heavy steroid use," says Dr Patel. He says that in the current surge, given the high MM numbers, they have started questioning if Covid-19 itself could be a risk factor. Dr Devang Gupta, ENT surgeon in Civil Hospital, says the rise in MM cases is exponential in the past month which also saw Covid skyrocketing in Gujarat. "We are admitting an average 6-7 MM cases and operating 5-odd patients daily. Nealry 20% lose their eye-sight. If diagnosis and treatment is delayed, the prognosis is not good," says Dr Gupta. In Surat, New Civil Hospital (NCH) is adding infrastructure to handle MM patients, anticipating a rise in the numbers. "We are setting up a ward and enrolling oculoplastic surgeons for MM surgeries. We are also working to arrange liposomal amphotericin B, which is a necessary medicine for these patients," said Dr Ragini Verma, medical superintendent, NCH. Senior ENT surgeon Dr Prashant Desai, chairperson of South Gujarat Academy of Otolaryngology, said, "ENT surgeons in the city have done around 150 MM surgeries in the last one month. Earlier, they used to do only one in a year. Early diagnosis and treatment is the key to recovery."

According to an FIR filed by the girl’s father, Pasha Rabari, with the Anandnagar police on Tuesday, his daughter Bharti was assaulted by Vishal Thakor, aged around 20, when Bharti told Thakor not to beat the stray cow. “My daughter was returning home after paying obeisance to Lord Baliyadev. At that time, she spotted Thakor hitting a stray cow with a lathi,” said Pasha in his FIR. “She asked Thakor to stop. Thakor threatened her with dire consequences.” Pasha said that Thakor hit Bharthi’s on the head with the lathi which caused her injuries. Locals rushed her to Civil Hospital in Asarwa where she is undergoing treatment. Anandnagar police have registered a complaint of assault and are investigating the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/girl-objects-to-man-hitting-cow-struck-with-lathi/articleshow/82417534.cms||---
---||Pune||Citizens step up to donate plasma, help patients recover||Pune: Many people recovering from Covid-19 are stepping up to donate plasma at a time when the number of positive cases is rising across the city. Though a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research found that convalescent plasma therapy was not effective in reducing the mortality rate among Covid-19 patients, city doctors have found that the treatment is effective in mild or moderate cases. As the state is undertaking all efforts to battle the pandemic, recovered patients want to take on some responsibility too. Strategy consultant Ajay Munot (50) said, “I had Covid-19 in July 2020 and since I recovered I have donated plasma 13 times. The 14th donation will be made on May 7. Depending on the demand, blood banks give doses of 100-200 ml to patients. So, one donation can help at least three patients.” Sayali Kulkarni (22), a post-graduate student, said, “I have gone twice for plasma donation and I plan to do it until I have the antibodies.” Jagruti Ayachit, plasma donation worker, has noticed a rise in donors since last week. “However, there is still a shortage. On a daily basis, about 500-600 patients need plasma, but only about 200 donors step up,” she said. Many citizens who have recovered from Covid-19 are encouraging others like them to step up and donate plasma. Lawyer Charmaine Lazarus, trustee at Poona Goan Institute Leo Alphanso and former corporator of Wanowrie Abhijit Shivarkar will organise a plasma donation drive on May 10 at Poona Goan Institute, Ganesh Peth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-step-up-to-donate-plasma-help-patients-recover/articleshow/82417523.cms||---

The Congress legislator said that the plasma donation camp was organized in the memory of his late son Vishal who had been killed in an accident in West Bengal two years ago. “I could not save my son who had met with an accident in West Bengal. To help Covid-19 patients, we decided to organize a plasma donation camp in remembrance of my son. Many Covid-19 recovered patients turned up to donate plasma and 70 of them were eligible for the donation,” Lalit Kagathara told TOI. “On the occasion of my son’s second death anniversary on May 18, we are going to organize a similar plasma donation camp in Morbi town,” he added. “We should do our bit to save the lives of Covid-19 patients who are battling for lives,” he emphasized. The donated plasma was given to Rajkot civil hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/70-covid-slayers-donate-plasma-in-special-drive/articleshow/82415596.cms||---

Fire officials rescued 31 patients, including 17 suffering from Covid-19. The fire started on the first floor where medical equipment had been stored and soon spread to the other floors. On Wednesday, the hospital cordoned off the area on the first floor and continued operations. Police were informed about the fire at 10.57pm on Tuesday. A police team immediately went to the spot and found that the fire had sparked from the store room on the first floor due to a short circuit. “There were 31 patients in the nursing home. Its staff had already broken the window glasses to avoid suffocation and brought the fire under control with the help of fire extinguishers available there. Meanwhile, some fire tenders also arrived at the spot,” said a senior police officer. The firefighters and police together transferred two patients to nearby Kalra hospital. “While four patients were discharged, the rest of the patients were transferred to the second floor. None of the patients was injured in the fire,” the officer said. It was also revealed following an inspection that the fire took place accidentally due to a short circuit in the store room where medical equipments were stored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hospital-fire-17-covid-patients-among-31-rescued/articleshow/82417554.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi govt portal for supply of Remdesivir injections||NEW DELHI: Following Delhi High Court directions, Delhi government has started work on developing a portal for supply and distribution of Remdesivir injections. The portal is meant to be used by people who keep stocks, distributors and hospitals. An order by the controlling and licensing authority from the drugs control department of Delhi government claimed that the portal was available on site having URL: https://cfwcst.delhi.go.in/DHB/loxin.ases and was now operational. The notice added that all distributors and stockists dealing with the anti-viral drug had to update their data on the said portal on a daily basis with immediate effect. “User ID and passwords to all stockists and distributors have already been forwarded by NIC,” it stated, adding that all the stakeholders need to make requests through the said portal using their already issued ID and password. “The above information is to be added on priority,” it underlined. However, the site was inaccessible at the time of going to press. The portal has been operationalised after an order by the high court last week directing that instead of routing the drug through the hospitals or other medical establishments, a patient and their family should be allowed to put in a request in the portal for obtaining the injections. Overwhelmed by the surge in cases, Delhites have been scrambling for resources, often putting SOS calls on social media platforms to obtain Redmdesivir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-portal-for-supply-of-remdesivir-injections/articleshow/82444913.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Sleeves up for the shot in the arm||Instead of blossoming in the world outside, youngsters are living in a cocoon for over a year now due to the pandemic. Meeting friends, classes, assignments and socializing — everything is happening online. The vaccination drive for 18-44 age group has brought a glimmer of hope. But will it give them the confidence to step out of the house without fear and become the entry ticket to classrooms? At this month’s TOI Debate, young panellists talk about life in the pandemic and how and when normalcy can returnNagpur: The decision on taking vaccine has been left to individual choice until now, but if the pandemic has to ebb, everybody needs to get vaccinated. “Look at Israel, which is almost entirely vaccinated. Life has returned to normal there,” said Pratham Golcha, a third year student, while supporting the idea of making vaccination compulsory. Upneet Kaur Chauhan, BA final year student, too stressed the need to vaccinate all, while explaining that those not vaccinated could be potential carriers. “If the pandemic doesn’t end everywhere, it doesn’t end anywhere,” said Abhishek Yadav, a MA political science student, adding vaccination is the only scientifically proven option to end this pandemic. Taking a cautious approach, CA final year student Ritik Pahuja wants authorities to study the side-effects and exclude high-risk groups from taking the jab. Ritik said he had heard about sugar levels rising in some people after vaccination, with some even dying due to side-effects. “Such adverse events need to be investigated,” he said. In a counter view, BA final year Hanif Chimthanawala, said deaths after vaccination have been misunderstood as due to adverse reaction of vaccine. “Get vaccinated, not only for yourself but also for the safety of others like your colleagues, teachers and parents,” he said. On whether they are looking forward to attending physical classes and hanging out after getting vaccinated, Tanushree said being in the last semester, she has very few days of college left and so she would like to go out. It was a definite yes for Dhairya Maroo, a BE first year student, who said he hasn’t even seen his college yet. “Going out of home changes the environment. Socializing is important for all of us,” he said. Upneet is comfortable being online for a year even after getting vaccinated as long as she “is allowed to move out”. Sounding a note of caution, Pratham said it’s a wait and watch scenario because one never knows when situation will turn bad. “We have adapted to online learning and it will take one more year till the situation returns to normal,” he said. Abhishek expects to get back to normal life and attend physical classes only after all are vaccinated. Looking back at the last one year, when all were more or less confined to their homes and how it has affected them as a person, Vaishnavi Iyer, a first year student, said she has discovered a new self. “I learned new things I had not thought of earlier. Now, we are closer to our family than ever before,” she said. “It’s been good in some aspects and bad in others,” said Dhairya, who loves to be outdoors. But he learned new skills like drawing and cooking while staying indoors. Ashit Gajbhiye, BE 3rd year student, mostly looks at the brighter side. “Learning online saved travel time. One could also connect with people world over on social media. Earlier I used to play outside but now I work out daily at home,” he said. Upneet feels privileged to have remained indoors. “I have become reserved as I am not comfortable with sharing emotions online,” she said, adding the changes are going to stay with her. For Tanushree, it was a dreadful thought to stay indoors all the while. “But as long as there are opportunities, that will keep me going even at home,” she said. Young adults like the panellists are by default now spending more time with parents and immediate family. Talking about its impact, Vaishnavi said it’s been a bitter-sweet experience. “At times youngsters need privacy, which is missing now. But overall, family bond has strengthened as we are helping out each other,” she said. Upneet sees a change in the way she looks at her parents but for Pratham it’s the same as before. Pratham said he is now more comfortable with making online friends and the mutual respect between him and parents has only grown. Ritik is thankful his brother and sister, who were studying outside, could return to the city during the lockdown “as staying together has developed a connect”. Dhairya said he has always shared feelings with his mother, who is a teacher. “That hasn’t changed,” he said. What struck Tanushree the most is, “Men don’t contribute much in household chores and only girls are expected to take it up. It shouldn’t be a big deal if men too help in household chores.” Pratham said at least there is a realization that men are supposed to help in domestic tasks. “The chores were distributed between my brother and me. We would do stuff like playing and watching web series only after that,” said Hanif, who feels bad for some of his friends, who have been away from their families for over a year now. One thing the pandemic has taught us is that life is uncertain and things don’t necessarily work out as per plan, said Tanushree. “Sticking to one timeline isn’t going to work anymore,” she said. Pratham said there is uncertainty but one should be thankful for just being alive. “Showing little bit of empathy is really important now,” he said. All said and done, having the means and money is important, feels Upneet, who aims to become financially independent. Giving example of some businessmen to explain how the pandemic has changed our views about success, Ritik said instead of cribbing about losses, they decided to help others in need. For Vaishnavi, success still means attaining life goals. Ashit said those having enough money in the current scenario can help those in need. On a personal level, Ashit said he would be content with whatever he gets. Abhishek believes those having money are helping others. All the youngsters did their bit to help others during the lockdown last year. Upneet said she helped her father who provided meals to migrant workers and also extended monetary help to their domestic helps. Vaishnavi said she coordinated with a social organization to send material to help needy children. “As a family, we helped in sanitization of government hospitals and police stations,” she said. Apart from extending monetary help from his parents to their domestic help, Hanif said he and his cousins are providing meals to homeless people. “We provided money to our people who help in our daily life,” said Pratham. Hanif was touched the most by the way actor Sonu Sood helped migrant workers during the lockdown. Back home, Vaishanavi is moved by people reaching out to each other or just enquiring about well being. She also appreciated a woman who she said is providing clothes and meals to people in slum areas. Upneet mentioned Khalsa Aid which is ensuring oxygen cylinders for patients in Delhi” and Hemkunt Foundation. Ritik is impressed the most by the story of a vendor providing coconut water for free to patients and their relatives at hospitals. Pratham had praise for foreign players in IPL who extended help to India. Seeing a woman feeding stray dogs moved Tanushree the most. “Along with humans, we should not forget the animals too,” she said. BACK TO THE FUTURE: LIFE IN POST-PANDEMIC WORLDPeople will take mental health more seriously, become more sensitive People will sympathize with others for some time, but once we are back to normal, this mentality will fade away Certain groups who took a hit would be more humane Large chunk will forget about the pandemic in five years or so There would be more accountability. People would start demanding better things from those who govern them Hygiene would be of utmost importance||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sleeves-up-for-the-shot-in-the-arm/articleshow/82417833.cms||---

Along with augmentation of Covid-19 beds, the state launched a programme called Mission Oxygen to take its daily oxygen production to 3,000MT from the current 1,250MT per day. The state has set afloat plans to add an additional 1,800 MT of oxygen production per day in the next few months to make the state self-sufficient in meeting the demand for oxygen. Thackeray said the state was gearing up for the third wave while continuing to battle with the second wave. “We are adding more beds and health infrastructure. But I have set a target of increasing the oxygen capacity of the state. Currently the state produces 1,250 MT of oxygen and the requirement is close to 1,700MT. The remaining oxygen is received from other states as per the quota allotted to us by the Centre,” said Thackeray. Officials said 382 additional PSA plants were being set up in the state, which will generate nearly 240MT of oxygen. They said most of these plants will be operational by the end of June. Additional liquid medical oxygen plants will be set up, which will give the state another 300MT. The state will also augment the oxygen storage facility in the state. “We want to ensure that the third wave has the least impact on the state,” Thackeray said. He said task force members had been asked to guide general physicians on the use of medicines and to treat the patient better. He also said that the Centre has not been able to provide the required amount of vaccination to the state. "I am not blaming them. I know they have limitations too. But Maharashtra has the capacity to scale up vaccination but stocks are falling short,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mission-oxygen-to-increase-daily-production-to-3000mt/articleshow/82418682.cms||---

The complainant said that his card had been stuck in the machine on Monday. Darshan Shah, a retired employee of the GST department, stated in his FIR filed with Anandnagar police that the swap occurred after he withdrew money. He said that he withdrew Rs 10,000 from the ATM but his card got stuck after cash was dispensed. He said he went into the bank for help and after a while returned to the ATM and found his card was out of the machine. Shah then spotted a man who had been lingering around the ATM earlier. Shah told the man to use the ATM first. The man withdrew money and left. Later, Shah tried to withdraw money but the ATM flashed the invalid PIN message. When Shah checked the card, he realized that the man had swapped it. The man also withdrew Rs 15,000 with Shah’s card, according to the complaint. Shah approached Anandnagar police and filed a complaint. Even though it was a case of cheating, Anandnagar police registered a complaint of theft. The cops have not yet identified the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-cheats-ex-gst-official-at-atm/articleshow/82417574.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Plea for help met with fake lists of contacts||PUNE: Requests for help by users of social media are being answered by fake lists, with contact numbers and names of people who are supposedly plasma donors or can help with oxygen and other medicines. This is inconvenient for those who need help urgently and reach out to the people on the lists only to find out that their endeavours were in vain. “When I was looking for B+ plasma for my Covid positive father-in-law, many people forwarded to me a list on WhatsApp with contacts of donors, with their names and blood groups. But when I called the numbers, they were either switched off, unreachable or went unanswered. I managed to get the plasma with the help of a friend, but contacting people on the list was a waste of time,” said Ganesh Hardikar. “I reached out for help on Twitter because the issue was time sensitive and we were desperate to use all resources to procure 200ml plasma for my father. Many people sent me tweets with information of donors but they were fake. I managed to get the required plasma from Sanjeevani blood bank, said Anju Patel, from Kharadi. Anil Shukla, who was looking for help to procure oxygen for his grandmother, said, “When I reached out to people on my contact list many of them sent me forwards with details of people who could arrange for oxygen or beds. I desperately tried to connect with the numbers but they were switched off.” Rohan Gaikwad, MNS prabhag president of NIBM-Mohammedwadi, has submitted a memorandum to the Pune Municipal Corporation health department to publish updated details of dashboards of hospitals with the correct number of beds available to help people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/plea-for-help-met-with-fake-lists-of-contacts/articleshow/82417545.cms||---
---||Pune||It’s safe, give Covid jab to pregnant & breastfeeding women: Experts||Pune: Medical experts have now urged the Centre to include pregnant and breastfeeding women in the Covid-19 vaccination drive. Currently, doctors cannot advise vaccinations for this group, unless the health ministry revises guidelines. But many doctors said vaccinations for expecting and lactating women should be allowed. Pune-based gynaecologist Sanjay Gupte said, "Covishield and Covaxin do not contain any live virus. They are non-replicating virus vaccines. There is no biological mechanism that can cause infection to the mother or unborn foetus. So there is no transmission in pregnancy or through breast milk. Besides, it is unethical to deny them their fundamental right to health." Gupte is the chairman (ethical committee) of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics. "Countries like the US, UK, and Australia have included pregnant/breastfeeding women in the Covid vaccination process," Gupte said. Ahmedabad-based gynaecologist Alpesh Gandhi, president of the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI), said, "In pregnancy, there could be concerns regarding transmission to the foetus if an expecting woman is vaccinated with a live attenuated vaccine." Incidentally, the first study of Covid vaccination in pregnant and lactating women was published last month in the United States. " A similar study is currently underway abroad which uses the AstraZeneca vaccine (Covisheild in India). We can have the vaccination drive open for pregnant women once we have the adequate safety data from that study," said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, member of Centre's National Task Force on Covid-19. The government's decision to keep pregnant and breastfeeding women in the exclusion category is mainly because they were not included during the vaccine trials of Covishield and Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/its-safe-give-covid-jab-to-pregnant-breastfeeding-women-experts/articleshow/82417561.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who inaugurated the facility named after former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said that 150 beds are equipped with ventilators, while the remaining 100 had oxygen facility. The makeshift Covid facility will be gradually expanded into a 500-bed hospital. “During a pandemic, infrastructure and facilities may feel inadequate, but we are trying our best to ensure that things are brought back on track,” the CM said. The CM said: “During a pandemic, infrastructure and facilities may feel inadequate, but we are trying our best to ensure that things are brought back on track.” He added that an officer has been appointed to interact with patients’ families at least once a day. The hospital will have 24-hour oxygen backup and if there is any technical glitch, oxygen will be given through concentrators. The hospital was set up at the behest of Lucknow MP and defence minister Rajnath Singh. A spokesperson for DRDO said that it is equipped with a 20 KL oxygen tank, a dedicated power backup and bio-medical and other waste management system. The facility and treatment, including food for patients, will be free. “The hospital is being run by a team from the armed forces comprising doctors of many specialities along with nurses and paramedic staff. The medical staff has been flown in from all across the country. Intensive training, quality checks of installed equipment and Covid procedures and protocols have been completed prior to commissioning of the hospital,” the spokesperson said. Admission to the hospital will be done through the Integrated Control Centre at Lucknow as there is no walk-in facility for patients. Information on admitted patients will be available at mobile numbers 9519109239 and 9519109240. Rajnath thanks CM for help in hosp: Diwakar Tripathi, representative of defence minister and Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh, on Wednesday hailed the DRDO and the state government for having setup the makeshift hospital in a fortnight's time. Tripathi in a press statement said Rajnath Singh had thanked chief minister Yogi Aditynath for extending all help and support in establishing the 500- bed hospital at Awadh Shilpgram. “The defence minister also hopes that with the hospital now functional, critical patients of Covid-19 will get adequate medical help and best treatment possible,” Tripathi read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-opens-drdo-covid-hospital-says-putting-things-on-track/articleshow/82418665.cms||---

Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar brought up the issue of post-poll violence in Bengal less than 10 minutes after administering the oath of office to Banerjee, prompting her to remind him that she had not been in charge of the state administration for the last several weeks. “Bengal does not like unrest. I will ensure there is no violence,” Banerjee said, adding that there were “some sporadic incidents”. “I will handle law and order from today... with a firm hand and will not tolerate any unrest. I will appoint proper officers so that there is no law-and-order problem,” she said. The CM reminded the governor that “the administration was controlled by the Election Commission” for the past few weeks. Most of the “sporadic incidents” were happening in places that “the BJP had won”, she said, adding that the EC transferred numerous officers and appointed “some inefficient” officers because of which law and order had “deteriorated”. “I will ensure no one is spared. I appeal to all not to be vindictive,” Mamata Banerjee said. But not all the allegations were true, she said, adding: “There are several fake (incidents). (Photographs) of old incidents are being shared.” “You have tortured enough during the elections. Stop this torture or law will take its course. Bengal is a land of peace and harmony,” Banerjee said, telling a television channel later on Wednesday that the BJP “could not digest its defeat”. Dhankhar opened the proceedings after the swearing-in ceremony. “I hope and expect that governance will be according to the Indian Constitution and rule of law. I am getting reports from within and outside the country, people are worried.... Our first priority is to stop this senseless postpoll violence... antithetical to democracy,” he said, urging the CM to restore rule of law. “Script a new governance pattern and cooperation for one and all so that the state can prosper,” Dhankhar said, adding that his “younger sister would rise above partisan interest”. “It is not usual for a person to get a third term in a row as CM,” Dhankhar said. While wishing @MamataOfficial on assumption of office of CM called upon to effect governance as per Constitution &… https://t.co/xW4gb6C5uL— Governor West Bengal Jagdeep Dhankhar (@jdhankhar1) 1620216780000He later took to Twitter to call upon the CM to “rise above partisan stance”. “There is no alibi for inaction as the model code of conduct ended at noon on May 3,” Dhankhar tweeted. Banerjee thanked opposition leaders across the country, including Rahul Gandhi, Lalu Prasad Yadav, Sharad Pawar, Mehbooba Mufti, Omar Abdullah, Tejaswi Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav, MK Stalin, Arvind Kejriwal, on Twitter.

---||Kolkata||IT offices, corporate houses return to WFH||Kolkata: Leading corporate houses and IT companies are introducing strict Covid safety protocol following chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s directive that private offices should have 50% workforce on the premises, and some have already implemented this. While most companies at Salt Lake Sector V’s IT hub continue work-from-home, those that started partial or near-full operations on the premises have begun to draft their WFH plan. The IT and ITeS sector, which has been providing back-end infrastructure for WFH operations and mostly working away from their offices, supported the state announcement. “But for BPOs and call centres, this brings a mixed fallout. A large part of the work can be done from home, it creates flexi schedule and commute time is saved. But data security and infrastructure challenges prevail,” said Kalyan Kar, vice-president, Sector V Stakeholders’ Association. The head office of the biggest private sector corporate house in the city, ITC, is almost closed, with no one being allowed on the premises without an approval. The head office of Haldia Petrochemicals would continue with an alternate-day roster, said HPL wholetime director Subhasendu Chatterjee. He said they had been working with 30% staff strength in the head office, while in the plant, the number of shift had been increased to cut down on crowding. Berger India, MD Abhijit Roy said, had introduced WFH mode for most. “We are working with 25%-30% strength at office,” he said. Exide Industries is working with 15%-20% staff on the premises. “We are going to office on rotation. Employees are not allowed to use public transport,” an official added. Merlin Group ChairmanSushil Mohta said they had been working with 30% staff. “Only some senior employees with their own transport are going to office,” he said. The president of Confederation of West Bengal Trade Association, Sushil Poddar, said for their members, the timings had changed the timings from 10am-7.30pm to 11am-5pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/it-offices-corporate-houses-return-to-wfh/articleshow/82417620.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

To bail them out of this challenging situation several residential welfare associations (RWAs) have approached the Telangana Medical and Health Department, requesting it to open isolation centres in government and private educational institutions, function halls, community halls and stadia. The RWAs are also seeking the help of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to help their members.  “For example, if a member of a family tests positive, then that person has to be isolated. If the family is residing in a 3BHK then there is no problem, but if they are living in a single bedroom or 2BHK apartments it is tough to manage. With every passing day the number of people getting infected with the coronavirus has been on the rise. To resolve this issue and hlep our people we have contacted several NGOs,” said BT Srinivasan, general secretary, United Federation of the RWAs (UFERWA). “A few NGOs are helping us to arrange beds, oxygen cylinders etc in private hospitals,” he added. A city-based NGO, Society for Rural Development (SRD) along with the health department has set up a 15-bed isolation centre at the government hospital in Kondapur. “This facility here is taking care of the migrants and daily-wage workers. We have noticed that many families living in apartments are facing issues regarding home isolation. We can help them at this centre,” said SRD director Srinivas Reddy. “Our NGO is also helping hundreds of migrants and transgenders by distributing grocery kids. We did that last year and resumed it now,” Reddy said. The UFERWA has tied up with the NGOs to help the poor and needy. Meanwhile, the RWAs said that about one lakh people in their areas have tested positive. While some of them got admitted in private hospitals, many are under home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ngos-helping-rwas-to-arrange-beds-and-oxygen/articleshow/82417600.cms||---

The PIL, which was moved by Deepak Singh, chairperson Hruduya Foundation and a national-level shooter, questioned how medicines were being procured by the politicians without the requisite permission under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act when the public at large was unable to get it. The petitioner urged the court to direct an FIR and investigation against politicians allegedly procuring and distributing Remdesivir when patients were running from pillar to post to procure the same. The plea, filed through advocate Virag Gupta, also sought strict action against the politicians who were allegedly indulging in black marketing, as they could not procure it in the absence of a licence. The bench said it was not inclined to call any preliminary inquiry at this stage and could only consider instances where such acts had been allegedly committed within its jurisdiction. Singh further alleged that politicians were involved in “large-scale hoarding,” transfer and distribution of crucial medicines, like Remdesivir.

The last time the state had recorded higher discharges than new cases was on February 20 when against 258 new cases, 270 patients had got discharged. To put the number in perspective, just 10 days ago on April 25, Gujarat had recorded 14,296 new cases and 6,727 discharges showing a net addition of 7,569 cases in a day. The trend was witnessed across major cities on Wednesday as Ahmedabad recorded a reduction of 875 active cases, Surat 851 and Rajkot 206. Vadodara bucked the trend with addition of 389 new cases. A city-based expert said that the case count is lowering for the past few days, but reduction in hospitalization period is a conscious effort. “There’s insistence on home treatment, taking both antivirals and steroids in initial days, and conscious effort to reduce oxygen dependency. What used to be alarming levels of oxygen saturation earlier is today considered normal,” said a city-based critical care specialist. Analysis of the total cases reveal that the state added 2 lakh cases in the last fortnight, one of the fastest during the pandemic. Ahmedabad (39%) and Surat (16%) districts remained the biggest contributors, but on the brighter side, these districts recorded mortality rate less than the state average. Compared to 1.1% mortality rate in the past 15 days for Gujarat, Ahmedabad recorded 0.5% and Surat 1%. Vadodara and Rajkot however recorded higher rates at 1.9% and 2.4% respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/1st-day-of-fewer-cases-than-discharges-since-feb/articleshow/82417629.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Chennai||Now, techies develop toolkits to help people get vax appointments faster||CHENNAI: As Covid-19 vaccination opened for the 18-45 age group on May 1, though in a muted manner, and getting an appointment became a ‘fastest-finger-first’ exercise, tech tools are helping people obtain slots for inoculation. With the government making public the application programming interface (APIs) for the CoWin portal, techies have been able to build third-party tools on top of it to alert users in real-time when vaccine slots open. APIs are links between two softwares to interact. Using public APIs is legal and third parties use them to create support tools. A popular example is map APIs used by food delivery companies. Companies such as HealthifyMe, Signzy and other techies have created platforms that notify users when vaccine slots open in their districts, eliminating the need to regularly sign in to CoWin with an OTP and check. Once registered (for free), people receive alerts as soon as a slot opens via SMS, email, WhatsApp and even Telegram. Given the speed at which slots get lapped up in urban areas, the tools offer a better chance of getting appointments. Health startup HealthifyMe has launched Vaccinateme.in to make the booking process less cumbersome by providing alerts on available slots when they open. The platform is equipped with filters to customize search based on pincode, district, age, etc. with more filters on the cards. “More than a quarter million people have registered since the portal launched in the past 24 hours,” said Tushar Vashisht, co-founder and CEO of HealthifyMe. Fintech startup Signzy also has a tool that notifies availability of jabs. Users can subscribe by providing their email ID, pincode and year of birth and the bot checks every hour for vacant slots and notifies them. All personal data is used only for sending notifications and is cleared post 15 days, Signzy team says. “We are now seeing close to five registrations a minute,” said Arpit Ratan, co-founder and CBO, Signzy. Chennai-based hobbyist programmer Berty Thomas has created a website under45.in that hunts for slots in the 18-45 age group and sends alerts to people in around 60 Telegram groups he has created for different cities. The Bengaluru group, with around 16,000 members, is the largest. “I’m happy I have been able to help people get vaccines with less hassle but given the demand, the best way would be to have a defined system like IRCTC’s tatkal timings,” he said. Thomas, who himself was alerted about open slots this way, booked an appointment on CoWin and got vaccinated. Similarly, techie Shyam Sunder and three friends have developed getjab.in that sends email notifications to registered users regarding open slots. The site has seen around 100,000 registrations, Sunder said. However, such hacks have attracted criticism of excluding the non-digital population. “Even if well intentioned, the app-based slot booking process coupled with low vaccine availability have made it a ‘fastest-finger-first’ contest, which is unfortunate. Few people getting instant alerts skews it even more and that’s the issue,” researcher Rakshith Ponnathpur wrote on Twitter. Social media is also abuzz with other instances where coders have jumped the queue for shots. While TOI could not verify the claims independently, techies TOI spoke to say some developers have managed to use coding skills to go beyond just sending alerts and automate the appointment booking process entirely, which could be illegal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/now-techies-develop-toolkits-to-help-people-get-vax-appointments-faster/articleshow/82417608.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

---||Lucknow||Rural polls: BJP afloat on Yogi Adityanath's turf in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: Even as the BJP faced significant losses in Hindu religious nerve centres of Varanasi, Ayodhya and Mathura, it’s only saving grace was Gorakhpur, the home turf of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, where it was ahead of other parties, albeit by a whisker. According to reports from the district, the saffron party posted victory on 20 zila panchayat seats, which was the highest among all major political parties. The Samajwadi Party won 18 while BSP bagged four seats. BJP’s Gorakhpur region secretary, Janardan Tewari, told TOI that the party performed reasonably well in comparison to other districts. “It is because of the aashirwad (blessings) of Maharaj Ji (CM Yogi) that the opposition could not breach Gorakhpur the way it intended to,” he said, confirming the seats tally. Tewari, however, maintained that the party had been aiming at least 35 out of the 68 zila panchayat seats. The district was the epicenter of political contest between BJP and the opposition after Yogi Adityanath vacated the Gorakhpur parliamentary seat to take the reins of UP as its CM. In 2018 by elections, arch rivals SP and BSP cobbled up an alliance to defeat the BJP in Yogi’s bastion. The opposition’s joint candidate, Praveen Nishad, later switched over to BJP and, in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, won from Sant Kabir Nagar. The Gorakhpur seat was won by Bhojpuri actor-turned-politician Ravi Kishan on BJP ticket in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The situation, however, was not good for BJP in Prayagraj where SP won on 23 seats, while BJP was restricted to 13seats. This district was another political hotbed for BJP after its MP Keshav Prasad Maurya vacated the Phulpur seat (which came under then Allahabad district) in 2017 to take charge as UP’s deputy CM. In the ensuing by elections in 2018, SP’s Nagendra Patel defeated BJP’s Kaushalendra Patel by around 60,000 votes. The seat was wrested back by BJP’s Keshari Patel in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The trends, nevertheless, showed that SP managed to save its pocket boroughs of Etawah, Mainpuri and Kannauj which were keenly eyed by the BJP. In Etawah, the home district of Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, the SP won 18 of the 24 zila panchayat seats while BJP had to contend with just one. In Mainpuri, the parliamentary seat of Mulayam Singh Yadav, SP won 12 of the 30 zila panchayat seats, while BJP bagged eight. In Kannauj, the seat formerly represented by Akhilesh Yadav and then by his wife Dimple Yadav, the SP won the maximum nine seats. The Mayawati-led BSP was a major gainer in districts like Mau – the stronghold of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari – where it bagged maximum of seven seats. The party also made significant gains in some of the west UP regions like Saharanpur and Meerut where it won 16 and nine seats, respectively. Yogi congratulates winners: CM Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday congratulated the winners of UP panchayat elections. In a tweet, Yogi said the elected members should work in coordination with local administration in this time of crisis and help in saving the lives of people. He said the elected representatives should follow government guidelines and protocol of corona curfew.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rural-polls-bjp-afloat-on-yogis-turf/articleshow/82418688.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Kochi||Facing cancer, and sharing jokes||Kochi: When Valiya metropolitan Philipose Mar Chrysostom paid actor Innocent a visit at his residence in Irinjalakuda in 2013, the actor-turned politician was taken aback. He said the aged bishop shouldn’t have taken the trouble to come over to his home. “Didn’t you like my visit,” the metropolitan asked. Then, Innocent said,” I meant, a big personality like you shouldn’t have taken the pain to visit me. Rather, I would have come to your place”. Mar Chrysostom was quick to reply: “Malayalis across the world know you. But, only a few of them would recognise me. It is you who is high-profile and I should come to see you”. Innocent was suffering from non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of cancer. It was a women’s magazine that arranged his interview with Mar Chrysostom. “Though I had read some of his articles, I did not have any acquaintance with him. Both of us like making jokes, may be that is why the magazine editor chose me to interview him. I said no to it owing to the pain I was going through after chemo sessions,” Innocent said, recalling his first meeting with the metropolitan. “The next day, the magazine’s reporter called up and informed me that if I am unable to go to Chrysostom’s place, he would come to my house,” Innocent said. Innocent said the metropolitan didn’t speak a single word on theology. “He said cancer is not such a big thing. He said he also had the disease and recovered from it,” Innocent said. “Rather than talking about any religious matters, he simply cracked jokes. He asked my wife whether she would mind me mingling with women actors. Alice just laughed.” According to Innocent, the greatest lesson the metropolitan taught him is humility. “He told me that we should respect all those who are gifted with the abilities which we don’t have. We can’t climb a coconut tree. So, we should respect a person who climbs the tree and plucks coconuts,” Innocent said. When the metropolitan was admitted to a private hospital a few months ago, Innocent paid him a visit. But the metropolitan couldn’t recognise the actor. “The communists may not have faith in God, but God has faith in communists,” innocent laughed, recalling a joke made by the metropolitan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/facing-cancer-and-sharing-jokes/articleshow/82415775.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The court also warned against raising false SOSs for oxygen supply after a patient’s lawyer informed that the hospital he was admitted in had run out of oxygen. When the high court inquired with the Delhi government’s counsel, senior advocate Rahul Mehra and advocate Satyakam, they asked the officer concerned to join the proceedings. “We called upon the GNCTD to explain the position. Mr Bidhuri, OSD oxygen, joined the proceedings. He informs that he has spoken to the management just about two hours ago and he has been informed that there is no dearth of oxygen. There are 38 ‘D’ type cylinders that have been supplied to the hospital,” the bench noted. The bench accordingly dismissed the petition. “Such alarms, which are false, disturb the complete system and put unnecessary strain on the already stretched machinery...such an alarm should not be raised till supply is left with hospitals/nursing homes for six hours or less.” Amicus curiae senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao earlier in the hearing expressed concern over the manner in which the distribution of large amounts of foreign aid had been made in the form of medical equipment related to Covid-19 management. He pointed out one such instance where a city hospital had been provided with 260 oxygen concentrator machines when it had 45 ICU beds and 265 non-ICU oxygenated beds. Rao stated that the oxygen concentrators were of no avail when they came to the ICUs and the non-ICU beds could be looked after with the existing oxygen supply at the hospital. “His fear is that such random and arbitrary distribution of medical equipment may not result in the same being sent to the right quarter for the benefit of the patients. We direct the central government to look into the instance pointed out by the amicus and also to look at the allocations made till now to various hospitals and other institutions,” the court stated. Additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma had received instructions over the requisition of the Armed Forces under the relevant rule of the Defence Service Regulations for the Army and similar regulations of the Air Force and Navy. The court observed, “He states that in view of the services already being rendered for battling the Covid-19 pandemic both for the armed forces and for the civilian population, principally it has been decided not to set up field hospitals and bring in the Army for aid of civil administration.” The bench further noted that with regard to the arrangement of the engineering wing of the Armed Forces such as Army Service Corps, and Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, for setting up on war footing storage tanks of liquid medical oxygen. Sharma said the same would be considered on an urgent basis. The Centre and the Delhi government, in the meantime, were jointly directed to locate the vendors for provision of oxygen storage capacities and for other logistical support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/take-help-of-iit-dtu-to-ready-plan-for-o2-supply-hc-to-govt/articleshow/82417630.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Ahmedabad||HC calls for more restrictions||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday said the existing measures to curb people’s movements are not enough and opined that if people are not kept from gathering and moving about except in case of unavoidable circumstances, the virus infection chain would not be broken, and the public would be the “sufferer”. The bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia said the state government’s existing restrictions on movements are not enough in the present situation. People should be made aware of the grave effect of pandemic on society and that the spread can be curbed by imposing further restrictions “as may be thought fit in the present situation”. The high court, however, refrained from issuing any directions or suggestions about restrictions to be imposed, and left it to the state authorities to take action keeping in mind the welfare of the public at large. “If such actions are not taken, preventing people from getting together or moving from one place to another unless it is inevitable, the chain would not be broken and the public at large would be the sufferer,” the HC order reads. In the past, the high court suggested that the government impose a shorter lockdown to curb the spread of the disease. But the government did not follow the suggestion and instead imposed night curfew in a few cities and later extended restrictions to more towns as the Covid situation worsened. The state government insisted that a lockdown may bring misery to the poor, a view which the high court later endorsed to counter the demand for the lockdown from lawyers participating in proceedings of the suo motu PIL on Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-calls-for-more-restrictions/articleshow/82417618.cms||---

The case was registered with the Alankar police station in 2017 against the builder and his daughter. Police had arrested the builder and his family members in 2017. Subsequently, some family members secured bail from the court. However, his daughter did not report to the court or to the police. The Economic Offenses Wing (EOW) of Pune police in a statement on Wednesday said, “The court issued the proclamation orders on Tuesday and asked the builder’s daughter to produce herself in court on May 28, 2021.” EOW officials said, “We conducted a search for the daughter, an officer with her father’s company, but she is not traceable and a report in this regard has been submitted in court.” According to police, the builder floated several companies and called for investment in the form of fixed deposit and other schemes, promising handsome returns. But he did not return the primary investment and interest to investors after maturity. Police said that the builder, his daughter and others collected investments worth Rs48.85crore but did not return them. Police also invoked provisions of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/proclamation-order-in-cheating-case/articleshow/82417619.cms||---

The hospital has used 8 stretchers for providing treatment to serious patients. The hospital caters to both Covid and non-Covid patients. Earlier, the hospital was treating only non-Covid patients.

He had booked a slot between 3-5pm to get his mother vaccinated at urban primary health centre (UPHC), Ward 78, Bariwa Basti on May 4.The message reads, “Dear Dhan Kanwar, you have successfully been vaccinated with your first dose of Covaxin on May 4 at 1.34 pm. You may download your vaccination certificate from https://cowin.gov.in.”Singh said, the certificate, issued by the ministry of health and family welfare, mentioned all the details like the recipient’s name, her age, verified ID and beneficiary reference ID.He said, “It’s a sheer lapse in the system that genuine people are sitting at home and their vaccine is being administered to any other person. In future, definitely problem will arise as my mother is vaccinated in government records.”Apart from this, many people who booked a slot for vaccination after several attempts on Co-Win portal are returning without getting the jab as the health staff is claiming shortage of vaccines.Shambu Singh, who received a slot of between 3-5pm on May 5 at Jaju, UPHC, Topkhanna, alleged, “I reached five minutes before at the centre for my first jab. Still I was denied as heath staff claimed there is no vaccine. If there was a shortage of vaccines, why slot was provided to me. I am sure vaccines must have been allotted for the confirmed slots.”Many people alleged that the medical staff was misusing powers and administering vaccines to their acquaintances out of turn while returning the genuine candidates empty-handed.A woman said, “Without registration, I got my first jab as my husband had friends in medical staff. However, now I am worried, how will I get my certificate or receive second doze.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/many-fail-to-take-jabs-despite-registration/articleshow/82417624.cms||---

The lawyers’ body made this request on Tuesday following an online meeting of its council members. In a letter addressed to all lawyers, the bar association has stated that those involved in black marketing of the life-saving drug have shamed the humanity and those involved in manufacturing of fake injections are playing with the lives of Covid patients. Police in different cities and districts including Surat have nabbed several people involved in the illegal sale of remdesivir and manufacturing of fake injection vials. The racketeers started the illicit business after the demand for the injection suddenly increased during the second wave of the virus. In some cases, doctors and medical staff too have been found to be involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/lawyers-urged-not-take-up-cases-of-remdesivir-scam-accused/articleshow/82415693.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Steep rise in new cases, 357 succumb to virus||LUCKNOW: A steep rise of over 5,000 cases was recorded in UP in the past 24 hours. A total 31,165 new cases were recorded on Wednesday against 25,858 new cases on Tuesday. The loss of lives due to Covid-19 continued to remain a cause of concern for health officials as 357 more persons succumbed to the virus in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of deaths in the state to 14,151. Health officials, however, said that number of recoveries is steadily rising. In fact, the number of recoveries in the past six days has been more than the number of new cases. On Wednesday, over 40,000 persons were declared recovered. Meanwhile, calling the steady rise in recoveries a positive sign, additional chief secretary, Navneet Sehgal told TOI that the pattern was noted in 52 districts of the state. “The strategy of aggressive testing and movement restrictions seem to be paying dividends. But sustained efforts at the level of every individual are essential to containment. Adherence to the prevention protocol at all levels is a must,” he said. The trend has reflected on the state’s overall recovery rate as well. While the recovery rate on April 15 was 83.7%, it dipped to 71.5% on April 25. However, the trend of more recoveries than new cases over the past six days has brought the recovery rate to 80.2%. The number of active cases has also declined on account of the surge in recoveries. As on date, 2,62,474 active cases are there in the state. Of these, 2.12 lakh are under home isolation. Experts attribute the trend to revised discharge policy which mandated discharge of patients upon resolution of the symptoms unlike before. In addition to this, they said that the 14-day cycle of the virus – which would have started in the mid of April — had completed over the weekend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/steep-rise-in-new-cases-357-succumb-to-virus/articleshow/82418737.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Varanasi||‘Adopting kids orphaned by Covidsans legal procedure to invite action’||Varanasi: The child protection department has appealed to people to report any case where Covid-19 has claimed lives of parents and any child has been orphaned. In order to ensure proper legal protection of the child, the department has also warned people against adopting such children without following the prescribed norms as it would be considered illegal. Though no case of children being orphaned amid pandemic has come to light in this region so far, there are appeals for help and requests for adoption of such children on social media. Women and child welfare deputy director Pravin Kumar Tripathi said that people should be aware about the procedure for seeking help of department and institutions working for protection of orphans. “If any case of orphaned child comes to light, people should inform Childline on toll-free number 1098, helpline 181, district child protection officer on 7518024048, child protection officer (CPO) 8840830673 or chairman of child welfare committee by dialling 9453048580,” Tripathi said. CPO Nirupama Singh said, “Some messages and posts mentioning children being orphaned and appeals for adopting them are being circulated on social media. Adopting any child without following prescribed norms is illegal, and so we decided to spread awareness among people.” Child Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) is the only body to facilitate adoption. Any one wishing to adopt a child can register on website cara.nic.in as adopting a child directly from any individual or hospital is illegal, a crime and violation of child rights, she said. People should refrain from making such appeals on social media or else punitive action can be initiated against them by the department, said Singh. “No adoption agency is operational in the district since 2018 and our department has linked its child care unit with CARA for adoption of children,” she added. “Since January 2020 till March end this year, 26 children, including 17 girls and nine boys, were adopted by families. Two children adopted by non-resident Indians have gone to US and Malta,” the CPO said. Singh said people can help children who are upset, depressed or disturbed after their parents and other family members have been infected and there is nobody to take care of them by contacting helplines and department officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/adopting-kids-orphaned-by-covidsans-legal-procedure-to-invite-action/articleshow/82416589.cms||---

Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma, municipal commissioner Gaurang Rathi and other senior officials took stock of the ongoing work at the 750-bed makeshift hospital on Wednesday. Later, the commissioner said that 90% work of the 250-bed ICU wing of the proposed Covid-19 facility is complete, while work in other two wings with 500 beds with oxygen supply is also being done on a war footing. He said that linking equipment with power and oxygen supply lines, installation of ventilators, high flow nasal cannula, oxygen concentrators and others are also in final stage. The DM said that DRDO is creating three wings of 250-bed each. Of these, one wing is ICU wing with advanced life saving equipment which is being completed on priority. Initially, the critical patients admitted at Covid facilities of different hospitals of the districts will be shifted to this wing in order to reduce patient load on them. With the completion of the work at other two wings of this hospital, the admission of patients will be done through Covid control room. This hospital will run under the supervision of the ADM City. The additional chief medical officer Dr NP Singh apprised the officials of the supplies of medical equipment being made to start the ICU wing at the earliest. Details on oxygen, medicine, power and water supplies, waste disposal, issuance of death certificate and other facilities were also given to the officials. Earlier, on Tuesday evening, the local unit of Bhartiya Janata Party had informed that two UP ministers along with the band of MLAs and MLCs of the district will take stock of the work at this make shift hospital. However, on Wednesday morning such visit of ministers and other public representatives was cancelled and the officials reached there to review the progress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/icu-wing-of-drdos-temp-covid-hosp-to-become-operational-soon/articleshow/82416624.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Developers caution govt against migration of labourers||Jaipur: Developers in the state have submitted a memorandum to the chief secretary requesting the administration to allow their supervision staff to reach construction sites after police restricted their movements during Covid curfew. The builders reasoned that work would halt if supervisors do not reach the sites. This will lead to mass migration of workers again and might cause another challenge for the state government. As per data, there are more than 75,000 labourers working in the construction industry. Gopal Das Gupta, chairman, CREDAI Rajasthan said, “Our delegation had apprised that CS and senior police officials that in recent times our supervision staff was facing challenge to reach the construction sites. If relaxation is not provided to our staff , there will be no option left other than to close the sites.”The delegation claimed that after a positive response is given by the police administration, the staff will be allowed to travel with the pass, which will be issued by developers. Meanwhile, developers in the state registered with Real Estate Regulatory Authority have sought an extension of another year to complete the projects.Many believe the recent spike in cases in the state has hampered the recovery in the real estate sector witnessed in the last six months. “The vicious cycle of recession may impact our economy adversely, including reduction in demand, production, employment, income, difficulty for allottee in making payment of EMI, reduction in buying capacity, reduction in prices of property and frequent cancellations. This shall lead to an impact of non-availability of all resources for 1-2 years post the situation settles,” said a developerThe developers demanded automatic extension of end date by one year without filling the extension form. “The deadline of projects whose completion falls on March 1 should automatically be extended by RERA by a year. Penalties should be waived as the authority has such power under rule 7 of the Rajasthan Real Estate (Regulation and development) Rules 2017,” said a CREDAI member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/developers-caution-govt-against-migration-of-labourers/articleshow/82417621.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala sets up war room to fight Covid||KOCHI: With Covid cases and its virulence going up day by day, the district administration has set up a war room for patient shifting, data collection and oxygen supply. The war room, set up at Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium Metro station complex, is the hub of all the planning and execution of urgent decisions for providing proper and timely treatment for Covid-19 patients. There are three wings which focus on the data collection, shifting of patients and providing uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen. “As of now, we are ready to cater to any needs — be it treatment, shifting of patients or ensuring adequate supply of medical oxygen,” district collector S Suhas said. “Still, we are taking extra care and vigil so as to ensure that we don’t run out of facilities, medicines and oxygen,” Suhas said. The war room, headed by assistant collector Harris R, functions from 9am to 11pm on a shift basis. “We have just started the war room. We are planning to got for round-the-clock operations soon,” an official with the war room said. “We collect data regarding the number of patients, availability of oxygen beds, ICUs, ventilators, etc. in all the hospitals in the district. This helps us in shifting patients in an effective manner. If a patient, for example, needs to be shifted to a treatment facility with ventilators, we are able to route them to the apt hospital,” the official said. Those who develop any Covid-like symptom should report it to the healthcare worker (HCW) or ward member of the respective local body. “The public health centre (PHC) or community health centre (CHC) where a patient is to seek medical advice initially should prepare a digital case sheet of the patient and keep it with the hospital. If the person tests positive and does not have much complication, the patient should be sent to home quarantine. If the patient has any breathing problem or palpitation, the HCW should seek the advice of doctors through telemedicine facility. There is a panel of 20 doctors who will provide consultation through WhatsApp call and advise on shifting the patient to the hospital with facilities required for that particular patient,” the official said. There are nodal officers for oxygen supply in each hospital and they will upload stock details every day on the online facility provided by the oxygen war room. “On the basis of the type of patients in a hospital, we prepare a rough chart of oxygen requirements for the hospital. If there is shortage, we address it,” officials said. According to the officials, measuring the oxygen demand and ensuring adequate supply is a tricky affair. “If a person is having a mild breathing problem, then his or her requirement will be 10 litre per minute. If the breathing problem is a bit more severe, the patient will require 15 litre per minute. If the patient is on ventilator support, the requirement will go up to 40-50 litres per minute. So, it is very difficult to calculate the exact requirement,” an official said. “The transmission loss of oxygen also makes it difficult to fill the supply demand for gas,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dist-admin-sets-up-war-room-to-fight-covid/articleshow/82415702.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat Technological University starts facility to verify authenticity of remdesivir||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Technological University (GTU) has developed a method to test if a remdesivir injection dose is real or fake. Two pharmacy students, Malay Pandya and Nisarg Patel, have under the supervision of Dr Kashyap Thummar developed this method and members of the general public can send samples for verification, GTU said in a media statement. “This high-pressure liquid chromatography method will detect adulteration if any and submit the report within five minutes,” the statement said. Police have busted several units making fake remdesivir across the country, including in Gujarat, in the second wave of Covid-19. In one of the cases in Gujarat, an accused made the counterfeit anti-viral drug using a compound of glucose and salt. Last week, the local crime branch of Morbi busted a racket to sell fake remdesivir injections and detained six persons from Morbi, Ahmedabad, and Surat. Due to the surge in Covid-19 cases in the country, there has been a huge demand for remdesivir. Over the past few weeks, several cases of hoarding and black marketing of remdesivir have also been reported. GTU vice-chancellor Navin Sheth, an expert in pharmacy research, has sent the details of the method to the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission (IPC) and the Food and Drugs Control Administration. “The university has provided all possible financial help to the students. The IPC has so far not come across such a method of testing,” according to the statement. “This is for the first time that GTU pharmacy department has developed a method for efficient testing of drugs.” The Centre recently announced that the production of remdesivir injections has increased to 1.05 crore monthly. Before the second wave of Covid-19, 20 plants were producing remdesivir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gtu-starts-facility-to-verify-authenticity-of-remdesivir/articleshow/82417625.cms||---

Thousands of labourers and workers have returned to Rajasthan from Gujarat, Maharashtra and other states. Some even say that they would look for a job here instead of returning to their previous workplace. They even say that they wouldn’t mind working in development works at their gram panchayats or work under MGNREGA. The inflow of labourers and workers in the state has also led to an increase in the demand for NREGA work from nearly 10 lakh workers per day a month ago, to over 23 lakh workers on May 5. Daluram, 42, who used to work in a canteen as a cook in Rajkot, returned to his home at Jharoli village in Gogunda tehsil in Udaipur district on April 10, after night curfew was imposed in 20 cities of Gujarat. “I used to earn around Rs 500 per day. There is no plan of returning to Rajkot. I’ll look for a job here and settle down here. While returning, the contractor gave us Rs 1,000, that’s it. We are just sitting idle and the savings are getting exhausted,” he said. “I wouldn’t mind working under NREGA, but, we have been told, there’s no work in our panchayat. I am the only earning member in the family,” added Daluram, who has four daughters and a son. They are all studying in school, he said. Daluram further said, “This is the second time I have returned from Rajkot. Last year too, I had to return home after I lost my job during the nationwide lockdown (May last year). I even registered a complaint against my previous employer for sacking me. But, nothing happened after that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/labourers-can-seek-help-from-depts-helpline-number/articleshow/82417639.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Youngsters dispel fears about vaccination, encourage elders to get vaccinated||Prayagraj: Youngsters in the Sangam city, who have been administered the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine are involved in dispelling fears regarding the vaccination. Young residents of the city are of the view that vaccination is the most important tool to fight the deadly virus, and are educating people about the dire urgency and need to get vaccinated. Between May 1 and 5, over 8,000 recipients between the age group of 18 and 44 years have been vaccinated at 10 sites of the d istrict. Youngsters also feel that the vaccination drive should be ramped up across the country, and more and more beneficiaries should be vaccinated in a stipulated time. Shruti (23), a graduate from Allahabad University, said, “After months of research and a series of clinical trials, the Covid-19 vaccine is all set to safeguard us from the deadly disease. There are no misconceptions regarding vaccination among youngsters, and they all want to get vaccinated at the earliest.” She, however, said, “In the current scenario, when many adults are hesitant to get themselves vaccinated, we see youths are giving pep talks to their parents and grandparents, encouraging them to do away with the fear and embrace the only tool that would protect us from coronavirus.” A 30-year-old city-based entrepreneur, Harsh Kesarwani, said, “We all know that vaccination is a safe way to build protection against a highly contagious and deadly disease. After my parents got their first dose of vaccine, my wife and I got ourselves registered on the CoWin portal.” Meanwhile,youngsters who have already received the first jab of the vaccine are not hesitating to share their experiences on social media. Be it sharing online articles on the vaccine or scheduling appointments with healthcare professionals, youngsters are leaving no stone unturned to be well-informed, and in turn, make more and more people aware of the need to get vaccinated. “As the pandemic has taken a toll on all of us, with so much uncertainty in the air, we find vaccination the one and only tool to win the battle against coronavirus,” said a youth, Rohit Shukla, adding, “Vaccinations have always helped us build immunity against contagious diseases.” Atul Pandey, who works in an MNC and has received the first dose, said “ I got myself registered on the portal on April 28 and got the first jab. A consultation with my family doctor made me more comfortable and confident about getting vaccinated.” Many young residents of Prayagraj have even made groups on various social media platforms to have conversations about the Covid vaccine. Currently, vaccination of beneficiaries aged between 18 and 44 years is taking place six days in a week—Monday to Saturday from 9 am to 5 pm. There are 10 vaccination centres for those in 18-44 age group. The four rural vaccination centres include community health centres in Jasra, Chaka, Kotwa Bani and Jhunsi. Besides, the six vaccination sites in urban areas include MLN Medical College, District Women Hospital, MD Eye Hospital, Railway Hospital, TB Sapru Hospital and Urban PHC (Daraganj). Only those persons in the age group of 18 and 44 years will be vaccinated who have got themselves registered at the cowin.gov.in portal and have been allotted a slot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/youngsters-dispel-fears-about-vaccination-encourage-elders-to-get-vaccinated/articleshow/82416726.cms||---

While the state requires 15,000 vials of Remdesivir injections per day, only 2,000-3,000 vials are being received per day.Among all the seven companies, Zydus Cadila is supposed to supply 43,000 vials, Mylan (32,000), Cipla (26,500) and Hetero (24,000) of Remdesivir vials up to May 9. Apart from these, Syngene/Sun is supposed to supply 1,600 vials, Jubilant (8,000) and Dr Reddy’s (6,500) up to May 9.On Tuesday evening, 5,590 vials were received from Cipla, 259 from Mylan, 1,064 from Dr Reddy’s and 624 from Jubilant. “These injections have been distributed across the state on Wednesday. Receiving around 7,500 vials per day from these companies (in this case 7,537 vials) is sufficient, but there are inconsistencies in the supply of Remdesivir. On an average, we receive 2000-3000 vials per day. However, the requirement for the state is 15,000 vials per day (for both government and private hospitals). We received such a big quantity of Remdesivir injections from Cipla after a long time,” said an official.“Around 5,000 to 7,000 vials are being distributed from the state government’s stock per day. Hence, taking both (supply from the companies and distribution from government’s stock) into consideration, the supply of 7,500 vials of Remdesivir injections in the state per day would have been sufficient,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/remdesivir-supply-less-despite-centre-allocating-vials/articleshow/82417642.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Pressure had been restored immediately and normal supply resumed. But around midnight, pressure dropped again drastically and within two hours 11 people had died.A 34-year-old patient in the ICU said he watched helplessly as a woman two beds away struggled for breath and passed away. “The fear that you could be the next is the worst thing that can happen to anyone,” he said. Hospital authorities said they had replaced a coil near the main valve of the oxygen pipelines last week and consumption had nearly doubled since, even when there was no increase in the number of patients.Witnesses said doctors and nurses rushed around trying to save children and adults using hand-held devices and portable oxygen cylinders. They also had to face frantic relatives of patients, who insisted their people be attended to first. Amid the chaos, pressure was restored by 2 am.The hospital had 447 patients on Tuesday and almost 70% (309) among them required oxygen support, according to official data.Chengalpet district collector A John Louis said oxygen consumption almost doubled on Tuesday compared to the usual levels and continuous efforts were taken to ensure that supply was not interrupted. He has ordered an investigation.Meanwhile, duty doctors at the hospital staged a protest within the premises on Wednesday morning. “Relatives of people, who choked to death, were furious with us and no one came to our aid between 12 midnight and 2 am,” said one of them.Protesting doctors said they were short-staffed and overburdened. The hospital has Covid patients on eight different floors in three buildings. Each floor is managed by one doctor and a maximum of two nurses.“So it becomes difficult to handle the situation even when two patients need immediate medical attention,” a duty doctor told TOI, requesting anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/eleven-die-as-oxygen-pressure-dips-in-chengalpet-govt-hosp/articleshow/82417662.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Delhi||Release seized oxygen concentrators to courts, police: Delhi court||NEW DELHI: A court on Wednesday ordered distribution of oxygen concentrators, seized by Delhi Police, among various courts and police personnel for utilisation. The court in its order highlighted the deaths of two judicial officers due to Covid-19. Metropolitan magistrate Anuj Bahal was hearing an application filed by police for the release of 12 oxygen concentrators seized on May 4. Two persons, Vinay Agarwal and Akash Vashist, were apprehended and the machines were deposited at Dwarka police station. It is also submitted in the application that many policemen were battling Covid-19 and, therefore, these oxygen concentrators could be used for saving the lives of police personnel. “It is pertinent to mention that judicial officers, due to their nature of work, are also exposed to deadly coronavirus. A large number of judicial officers and their families in Delhi are infected with Covid-19 virus and unfortunately two members of Delhi judiciary, namely family judge Kovai Venugopal and metropolitan magistrate, Dwarka Kamran Khan, have lost their lives due to the Covid infection,” the court pointed out. The order further stated, “In the best health interest of police officers, judicial officers and their family members, this court deems it fit to release and put to immediate use the 12 Oxygen concentrators, seized in present FIR, for medication of police officer, judicial officers and their family members.” Of the 12 oxygen concentrators, two machines will be released to the DCP, Dwarka for infected police officials. “Three oxygen concentrators be released to the office of principal district and sessions judge (HQ), Tiz Hazari. Two be released to the office of the principal district and sessions judge, Dwarka,” the order stated. Three oxygen concentrators will go to the office of the principal district and sessions judge, Saket, and two to Covid Health Centre at Delhi Judicial Academy, Dwarka, directed Bahal. On April 30, Delhi High Court had directed the release of 170 oxygen concentrators, observing it to be the “need of the hour”. “We had passed an order regarding Remdesivir and oxygen cylinders. Same would apply to oxygen concentrators and all other equipment necessary” for treatment of Covid-19, it had held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/release-seized-concentrators-to-courts-police-delhi-court/articleshow/82417666.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Jaipur||Transport dept likely to get oxygen tankers on rent from Dubai||JAIPUR: The state transport department is in talks with a supplier to get oxygen tankers from Dubai to add to the fleet of more than two dozen tankers which are already operational. Apart from this, two nitrogen tankers have been processed to transport oxygen in the state, and Rajasthan is one of the first to do so in the country. The state transport minister is also going to put up a request to the government to declare transport department staff as frontline workers. Mahendra Soni, transport commissioner, told TOI, “We have found someone who can possibly send us oxygen tankers from Dubai and we have asked for a proposal though details are yet to be finalised. We are looking at all options to get more tankers from all sources.” According to the officials there is a likelihood of getting half a dozen tankers from Dubai. The department had issued an order recently inviting applications for tankers on rent for transportation of liquid oxygen as the country is witnessing a shortage of the gas due to surge in Covid cases. According to the order, all organisations and individuals, including those from outside Rajasthan that can provide tankers on rent, can send their applications via email to transport@rajasthan.gov.in as well as on WhatsApp number 9829180005. In Rajasthan, at present there are 27 tankers and the department is attempting to procure more. There are four Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) tankers out of which at least two have undergone a process called purging (cleaning it with oxygen) so that they can be used as well for transportation of oxygen thereby increasing the number of these vehicles to 29 in the state. The cryogenic tankers used for transporting liquid oxygen are highly specialised and normal tankers cannot be used. “The central government had allowed use of nitrogen and argon tankers for oxygen transportation after conversion. Then the step of conversion was also dropped and now only purging is required to be done,” added the official. The state transport minister Pratap Singh Khacharyiawas also took a video conference meeting of the RTOs and DTOs on Wednesday and appreciated the efforts being made by the department during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/transport-dept-likely-to-get-oxygen-tankers-on-rent-from-dubai/articleshow/82417650.cms||---

Social science-II comprises geography and economics topics. The textbook currently in force was introduced around 2002 and is being replaced with a revised one after almost two decades. Board officials said the decision to implement the new textbook was taken at a meeting held in October 2020. The new textbook will include information related to Goa on topics including agriculture, mineral resources, crops, etc. “Last year, a new textbook in the subject was introduced for Class IX, and subsequently, the new textbook for Class X is being implemented,” a teacher said. One feature of the new textbook is that it compares the geographical features of Goa with that of India in each topic. “In Class IX, Goa’s physical features and natural regions have been compared with that of India, so that students can understand the topics in local context as well and get a better overview of the subject. Similarly, they will learn about the natural resources of India and then those found in Goa, agriculture in India and Goa, mineral resources found in India and mineral resources found in Goa. The new portion also covers information on crops of Goa, climate in Goa and food security,” a teacher said. In the case of economics, students will now learn some topics, which they would earlier learn only in Class XI. “Now, students will learn topics like capitalism, socialism, mixed economy, etc, in Class IX and X itself, before they complete high school,” a teacher said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/revised-social-science-ii-textbook-for-class-x-students-from-new-academic-year/articleshow/82417661.cms||---

A day later, she suffered labour pain and developed complications. Both the mother and the child could not be saved. Sita was not the only one to lose her life in the line of duty. According to UP Shikshak Sangh, over 700 primary teachers lost their lives either during training for election duty or at polling or counting centres. After the teachers’ associations demanded financial assistance for the families of those teachers who died during poll duty, the basic education department has asked Basic Shiksha Adhikaris (BSAs) of all districts to verify the list of such teachers. An official, who did not wish to be named, said school authorities have been asked to provide full details of teachers whose families are entitled to compensation. “The government has said it will provide financial assistance to the families of only those teachers who have died during poll duty. Many of them who got infected during training for elections will not be cosidered. In times of crisis, the government should be sensitive to the families of teachers,” said Sanjay Kanaujia, treasurer of UP Junior Shikshak Sangh. He said after the third phase of panchayat polls, death of 25 teachers was condoled in Rae Bareli and 20 in Lucknow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/edu-dept-asks-bsas-to-verify-list-of-teachers-who-died-on-poll-duty/articleshow/82418810.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||City inc offers helping hand to admn||Ludhiana: With coronavirus cases not slowing down and fatalities rising in the district, business associations have come forward to help the administration and the government. Several businessmen are already providing oxygen free of cost in huge quantities and during the past few days they have also deposited with the administration hundreds of cylinders lying in their factories. Besides, many vaccination camps have been organised by the industry in which not only workers and businessmen, but the public was also immunised.To overcome shortage of beds in hospitals, Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) has pledged to support the initiative of the administration to set up a 50-bed makeshift hospital at the Meritorious School in Civil Lines. Upkar Singh Ahuja, CICU president, said, “Recently, a meeting was held with DC Varinder Sharma, councillor Mamta Ashu, Dr Bishav Mohan and other senior officials of the district administration to help the community by setting up a temporary hospital for Covid-19 patients. Covid cases are increasing by the day and our hospitals are finding it hard to provide beds. It becomes our duty to come forward and help the government. CICU is providing support in setting up 50-bed hospital with oxygen pipeline and other equipment at the Meritorious School. As this school is close to big hospitals, it can prove to be of great help to the district administration.”Neeraj Satija, senior vice-president of Police Public Foundation, said, “We are facing a national tragedy and there is a huge pressure on our health system. Our organisation has decided to adopt a Covid ward at CMCH of 25 to 50 beds. Under the initiative, we will bear the expenses of installation of oxygen support system and all other requirements.”United Cycle and Parts’ Manufacturers’ Association (UCPMA) has appealed to the district administration and the government to convert the hall at its Gill Road office into a mega vaccination centre. According to DS Chawla, president of UCPMA, “Going by the ferocity of coronavirus spread, it seems vaccination is the only way to break the chain. UCPMA has a huge hall that can host thousands of persons and we are willing to organise vaccination camp at a big scale. If the government is ready, we can convert the hall into the biggest vaccination centre of Punjab for four months at least. I am certain that 2,000-3,000 people can be easily vaccinated here daily if proper resources, like doctors and adequate doses of vaccine, are provided.”Raj Kumar Singla, president of Fasteners’ Suppliers’ Association of Ludhiana, said, “There are lakhs of migrants in Ludhiana who work in factories, shops, offices and as drivers, maids, fruit and vegetable sellers. There is an urgent need to ensure that all of them are vaccinated. Our association is ready to organise mobile camps in the migrant areas of Dhandari, Mehrban and Focal Point. We are ready to give all kinds of logistics support, ranging from ferrying doctors, setting up camp and providing IT services.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/city-inc-offers-helping-hand-to-admn/articleshow/82414289.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Door-to-door surveillance launched||Thiruvananthapuram: The health team in Chirayinkeezhu taluk is making use of mini-lockdown to initiate home-based rapid surveillance to identify and isolate symptomatic persons in households. The drive has begun at Vakkom panchayat which has recorded the second highest test positivity rate (TPR) among local bodies in the district in the past seven days. A total of 94 cases have been detected in Vakkom panchayat in Chirayinkeezhu taluk out of 222 samples in a week. The TPR of 42.34% is second to Venganoor panchayat with a weekly TPR of 46.28%. “Vakkom panchayat already runs a scheme Arogya Bhavanam where we have a group of trained health workers and medical professionals who do door-to-door surveillance for various types of diseases. The plan is to employ the same team for Covid surveillance. Faster we identify, more we will be able to check the spread of infection,” said nodal officer of Chirayinkeezhu taluk Dr Ramakrishna Babu. A 24-hour control room has also been set up at Vakkom panchayat by which a trained Asha worker with local knowledge of households will be available for any emergency calls. She will act as the connection point between the patients and the hospitals. The presence of a local-level monitoring system is expected to boost the surveillance in the area. The process being implemented at Vakkom is planned to be launched in other parts of the taluk as well. A year ago, following widespread community transmission in the coastal panchayat of Anchuthengu a similar testing strategy was implemented by the health team. In August 2020, over 1,300 samples were collected at Anchuthengu in three days of relentless testing. It yielded more than 300 cases. This was made possible by the coordination of human resources, including members of Varkala IMA, block panchayat officials and staff of private hospitals. The panchayat president and heads of standing committees, who had tested negative, repeated tests after tracking of symptoms yielded positive results. The major outcome of increased testing was that the team could isolate a good number of persons under observation. Cross-village spread to areas like Varkala, Vakkom, Chirayinkeezhu and Kadakkavoor could be effectively checked using this strategy in 2020. Mudakkal panchayat in Chirayinkeezhu taluk is another area of concern. Since April, positive cases have been climbing in this panchayat and cases are more concentrated in three colonies. “We are closely following the pattern of infection and so far it has been confined to three densely-populated colonies in the area,” said Babu. A total of 104 samples tested positive out of over 500 samples at Mudakkal in one week. Lack of sufficient number of testing kits is a major hindrance to the project. The officials said that they plan to tide over the shortage soon with the help of local bodies and health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/door-to-door-surveillance-launched/articleshow/82415819.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Lack of adequate number of vaccine vials across various parts of the state has left vaccine slots getting filled faster and becoming unavailable to most. Particularly most shaken are those who have already taken their first shot of vaccine but have failed to find the next available slot. Sources confirmed that the lack of availability of vaccine stocks has compelled state authorities to slow down the vaccination process. On the other hand, a small controversy erupted on Thursday morning in Ahmedabad after officials of Khokhra Urban Health Centre (UHC) claimed that they were instructed to not give first dose of the vaccine to frontline workers. An audio in this regard had gone viral. Meanwhile, vaccination picked up in Ahmedabad with 34,400 doses being administered across 217 vaccination centres. On Tuesday, there was a little above 14,000 vaccination doses given after vaccines ran out. In Surat, on Wednesday, vaccination dropped drastically across 66 centres in the city. Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials claim that 6,521 doses were administered in the city across 66 centres . Susim Mohanty, an Ahmedabad-based communications professional, said, “I took my first shot and the second one is already due. The slot availability is a concern and I am clueless on what to do.” Similar is the scenario in other major cities of Gujarat too. The Surat Municipal Corporation had to suspended vaccination for two days on Tuesday and Wednesday due to the dearth of stock. However, fresh stock of the vaccines was provided by the state government on Wednesday, which is likely to last for the next two to three days. An official said that 49 sessions of vaccination have been planned for those above 45 years, healthcare and frontline workers, while those between 18 and 44 years will have to choose the slot by registering on CoWin application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/confusion-over-vaccination-continues/articleshow/82424174.cms||Niyati Parikh

But seeing the monster surge in Covid-19 casesa and miseries of people, Yusuf decided to do away with the practice for the first time in 30 years when he got a phone call requesting plasma. Yusuf, 52, got a call from his friend informing that a Covid-infected patient needed blood plasma and it was the same blood group as his. Since Yusuf contracted the virus in August last year, his family doctor asked him to take an antibody test. “After all these months too, my antibody count was high, so I did not hesitate in donating the blood plasma,” said Yusuf. Usually during Ramadan, Yusuf curtails his physical activities as his energy drains. “I get tired now, especially by evening and I do not feel like indulging any slightest physical activity. But that day, I decided to break my fast and donate the plasma,” he said. “Observing fast during Ramadan is pious but saving somebody’s life during the holy month is even more virtuous,” Yusuf told TOI. If he will be asked to donate after a fortnight, he will do it again, he said. “We volunteer if the blood bank in Valsad needs blood or plasma. We are a group of 20 people, so whenever we get a call for blood or blood plasma, we contact people whom we know and ask them too to check if anyone is willing to donate,” said Tarun Patel, who is a volunteer of Emergency Blood Donor group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/tailor-breaks-30-year-old-practice-to-donate-plasma/articleshow/82415791.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Postal votes were declared invalid due to technical reasons like not entering serial number of the postal ballot paper on the declaration form, mismatch between serial number on the ballot and declaration form, etc. Postal votes were collected by a five-member team of special postal officials who had gone to the houses of voters. In many constituencies, postal ballots declared invalid on such grounds is more than the victory margin of candidates like in Perinthalmanna where UDF candidate Najeeb Kanthapuram won by 38 votes while invalid postal votes stood at 347 following which defeated candidate KPM Musthafa is planning legal recourse. Same is the case in Tripunithura where Congress leader K Babu won by 992 votes against CPM’s M Swaraj while 1,071 postal votes were declared invalid. Speaking on condition of anonymity, many returning officers said that while special polling officers were provided training and tasked with briefing electors about the procedures to be followed for voting (including filling the declaration form and ensuring that it has the name and signature of the voter and is attested by the special polling officer), there were instances in which polling officers failed to affix his/her signature in declaration forms thereby making the vote invalid. Congress candidate who won at Peravoor in Kannur, Sunny Joseph said nearly 1,200 postal votes were declared invalid in his constituency. He said it was the duty of polling officials to brief and guide voters as most of them are aged and unfamiliar with the process. “As most voters were aged over 80, they cannot fill the declaration forms on their own. Polling officials would have helped them fill it. They should have ensured that serial numbers in the ballot paper and declaration form are the same, but failed to point that out to voters. What is worse is that many polling officers failed to affix their signature in the declaration form,” Joseph said. Ordinary voters without educational qualification cannot always verify the correctness of serial number in declaration form and ballot paper. In some cases, there is mismatch in serial numbers in declaration form and the one mentioned in ballot paper, he said in a complaint sent to the chief election officer on counting day. At Perambra in Kozhikode, there were 498 invalid postal votes followed by 429 in Koyilandy, 396 in Kunnamangalam and 355 in Thiruvambady. “Many polling officials haven’t properly briefed voters who were using postal votes for the first time. We had over 30 special polling teams in the constituency and all votes collected by a team were rejected as instead of the serial number in ballot paper, the electoral roll numbers of the voter were recorded in declaration form,” said a returning officer. ECI guidelines had specifically stated that polling official should tell the electors clearly about making the declaration in Form 13A and getting it attested by the poll officer, entering the serial number of postal ballot paper, both on Form 13A and on the smaller envelope (Form 13B).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/omissions-by-polling-officials-render-many-postal-votes-invalid/articleshow/82415845.cms||---

Negi was asked as to how many families have so far received the proposed compensation. To which, he replied that no such government order has ever come to his notice. Notably, Uttarakhand has recorded 3,142 Covid-related deaths since the outbreak of the pandemic last year. Former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had on June 4, 2020 announced an ex-gratia of Rs 1 lakh for the kin of those who succumb to Covid-related complications. He had announced the scheme in a virtual meeting to review the pandemic situation. Back then, the state had recorded 10 Covid-related deaths and 1,145 infections. Interestingly, Amit Negi was the state's secretary (health) even when Trivdendra Singh Rawat was the chief minister. “An ex-gratia of Rs 10 lakh has been announced for the kin of those Covid-19 warriors who succumb to the virus. Families of several such frontline workers have been given this compensation amount. However, I am not aware of any scheme promising Rs 1 lakh ex-gratia in all cases of Covid deaths,” he added. Additional chief secretary Manisha Pawar, who was also present in the media briefing, supported Negi's comments. A senior health department official told TOI that IAS official Radhika Jha, who was the secretary to the ex-CM, would know better about the promise in question. However, Jha, who is currently relieved from her post, also denied knowing about any official order related to the ex-CM's announcement. Meanwhile, Madan Kaushik, incumbent BJP state president and the spokesperson of the state government, told TOI that he will take up the issue with chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat. “We will discuss this with the CM and initiate necessary steps,” added Kaushik. TOI also tried to contact former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat but he could not be reached.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-idea-of-scheme-promising-rs-1-lakh-ex-gratia-in-cases-of-covid-deaths-say-ukhand-officials/articleshow/82414317.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Surat||L&T to assemble PSA oxygen units at Hazira plant||Surat: Engineering Major Larsen & Toubro Limited (L&T) has started assembling PSA oxygen generator units at its manufacturing facility at Hariza in Surat, to meet the demand of medical-grade oxygen at hospitals across India.These PSA units absorb air from the atmosphere before converting it into medical-grade oxygen and pumping it into pre-existing pipes in the hospitals. The units work on the plug-and-play principle. Once all the constituent parts are fabricated, the compressor allows the air to reach a particular pressure within a few minutes.L&T is sourcing the components from various parts of the world and assembling it at its Hazira manufacturing complex. After testing, the units will be dispatched to various hospitals where they will immediately start producing medical-grade oxygen as per the requirements. Each unit has a compressor, dryer, oxygen generator and two storage tanks that could cater to hospitals or medical facilities with over 1,750 beds.The company in a statement on Wednesday said that it will soon deliver 22 oxygen generators to various hospitals in India, where the scarcity is most acute.L&T CEO and MD, S N Subrahmanyan, said, “This is an unprecedented situation, and we are extremely pained by the consequences of the dire shortage of oxygen. Our teams in India and abroad have, with single-minded attention in the last few days, been able to procure the oxygen generators and other components to assemble PSA units. Together we shall all overcome the Covid-19 scourge.”Each unit has a capacity ranging from 1,000 litres per minute (LPM) to 500 LPM. “A 1,000 LPM machine could service 100-plus beds simultaneously. The 500 LPM machine can potentially service 50-plus beds at any point of time,” said the company's statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/lt-to-assemble-psa-oxygen-units-at-hazira-plant/articleshow/82415847.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Blame game erupts after 5 people die due to oxygen supply disruption at Roorkee hospital||Dehradun: A day after the death of 5 Covid-19 patients allegedly due to disrupted oxygen supply at Vinay Vishal Healthcare, the only private Covid-dedicated facility in Roorkee town, a blame game was evident as the hospital’s officials were summoned by Haridwar district magistrate, C Ravishankar on Wednesday. The Covid-19 patients — three elderly and two young — died after the hospital ran out of oxygen for around 20 minutes on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday. Hospital officials claimed that they had updated the oxygen unavailability status at 12 different portals of the district administration and had also informed a deputy commissioner-rank official deputed at the hospital to ensure supply of oxygen and medicines. District officials meanwhile claimed that they had not received any SOS alert from the hospital and only a Whatsapp message was sent to an official. Talking to TOI, a senior doctor from the hospital said that they had faced a similar situation last week as well and had even then raised concerns about the oxygen supply. “This incident has brought us bad publicity and has put a question mark on all the hard work that we have been doing in the pandemic despite several challenges. This is the reason why the hospital stopped its Covid OPD on Tuesday but it again started on Wednesday after the assurance of all possible help from the DM.” As reported by TOI earlier, a magisterial probe was ordered in the matter by the DM, which will submit its report within three days. Meanwhile, a senior member of the magisterial team that is inquiring the matter told TOI that hospital officials were queried on why they didn’t use B-type oxygen cylinders for emergency use to which they replied that the cylinders didn’t have proper pressure. “When they were asked why they didn’t check the pressure at the time of supply, they claimed to be having staff shortage,” he said, adding that the hospital hadn’t raised any SOS for oxygen apart from sending a Whatsapp message to the official concerned. “The official luckily saw the message immediately and rushed the help to the hospital. but is this the way to respond to emergencies?” he questioned. He added that the hospital’s officials couldn’t also satisfactorily explain why one patient who was on ventilator support died when supply of oxygen was disrupted whereas there were seven others also on ventilator who were very critical and on support of very high oxygen flow. Meanwhile, district magistrate C Ravishankar told TOI that the magisterial probe will look into all factors like CCTV footage of the hospital, its oxygen supply and usage audit and first-person accounts of staffers and kin. “I will wait to comment on the matter until I get the report of the probe,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/blame-game-erupts-after-5-people-die-due-to-oxygen-supply-disruption-at-roorkee-hospital/articleshow/82414381.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘No individual leader responsible for Cong defeat’||Thiruvananthapuram: Senior Congress leader K Sudhakaran said on Wednesday that no single leader in the party is responsible for the defeat Congress faced in assembly election. Sudhakaran said that Ramesh Chennithala did a good job as the opposition leader. There would be more discussions in party forums to analyse the reasons for the failure. “The most important factor is to identify reasons, which I think are many. Blind action against individuals won’t do any good for the party. All issues would be discussed in KPCC political affairs committee meeting. Further course of action would be collectively decided in consultation with Congress high command,” he said. Sudhakaran, who was considered for the post of KPCC president more than once in the past, said there was no reason to believe that any of the Congress leaders had indulged in anti-party activities. “There could have been shortcomings, But I don’t think it’s all deliberate,” he said. According to Sudhakaran, LDF used Covid as an opportunity. The outbreak of the disease affected ground-level activities of Congress. However, CPM was able to devise an alternative mechanism. The presence and support of CPM during the time of crisis were reasons that helped CPM to retain power, he said. Sudhakaran also ruled out a generational change in the organization. “There should be a mix. There should be young faces. But the party also needs the experience of the older generation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-individual-leader-responsible-for-cong-defeat/articleshow/82415927.cms||---
---||Goa||Heritage lovers raise flooding alert, call for expediting Basilica work on priority||Panaji: With a normal monsoon ominously looming ahead, the battered condition of the popular monument, Basilica of Bom Jesus at Old Goa, has prompted heritage lovers to raise some issues for its protection from more damage due to dampness and flooding. Heavy flooding last season due to massive water flow from the deforested buffer zone along the newly-built national highway had affected the iconic church. Water seeped into the walls and dampness persisted even during dry weather. The problems at the Basilica had started in April 2020, when two open sides of the roof on the Basilica’s southern side and Casa Professa’s easterm side soaked in rain water due to delay in completing roofing work. A public outcry prompted the government’s timely intervention to ensure its completion much before monsoon. “After the monsoon, the water resources department (WRD) has appreciably completed desilting of a heavily blocked drain from the hill to the Basilica compound,” rector of the Basilica and a Jesuit priest, Fr Patricio Fernandes, said. A committee headed by reputed former chief town planner, Edgar Ribeiro, which was also formed to oversee its maintenance post April 2020, mooted a few initiatives. “The solution is in opening the blocked channels and action is being taken to clean them,” Ribeiro said. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has done more work to close some gaps in the main roof after the monsoon. “The central agency will monitor the roof during this season,” a source said. But with rainy days forecast in May itself, church authorities say the work needs to be expedited. “The drainage from the Basilica onwards to the Mandovi and another channel to the Carambolim lake needs to be cleared soon,” Fr Fernandes said. Huge amounts of garbage and reclamation of a drain — moat dating to the Adil Shahi era — north of the Gandhi statue, are main obstructions to rain water flow. “The drainage channels are inadequate for increased rain water flow. Secondly, the original plinth of the Basilica is now one metre below the road level and the monument absorbs the stagnating water near it,” architect Fernando Velho said. Velho and four other architects, Oriana Fernandez, Vishvesh Kandolkar, Ajinkya Malkar and Aisha Kalangutkar analysed the flooding problem and made a few recommendations. The highway has been constructed in the buffer zone of nationally protected monuments. This would not have happened if the buffer zones were marked — till date not done — on Goa’s regional plan, the report stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/heritage-lovers-raise-flooding-alert-call-for-expediting-basilica-work-on-priority/articleshow/82417744.cms||Paul Fernandes

In 2019, only two or three students enrolled for the course, which had an intake of 15 in recent years. And, therefore, the programme has been discontinued from last year as there were no takers for it,” officials said. The three-year food technology programme was followed by an internship period of six months in the industry. Meanwhile, the diploma programme in medical electronics at Agnel Polytechnic at Verna has also been discontinued. This programme was also discontinued from last year after the enrollment was down to zero in 2019. “The course in medical electronics had been seeing a poor response over the last few years. The institute sought to close down the programme and the state government gave its nod,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/food-tech-course-discontinued/articleshow/82417769.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court: Rein in pvt hosps, cap test & treatment rates||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Wednesday directed the state government to rein in private hospitals and bring in a fresh order to fix the maximum permissible charge for each test and treatment. Amid allegations that some hospitals were demanding around Rs 8 lakh per vial of remdesivir, and insisting on deposits of Rs 3 lakh for allotting a bed, the bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy held an exclusive session during the ongoing summer vacation of the court and heard two PILs on the Covid-19 situation. The bench said that although the state’s order of last year dealt with some of these issues, there was a need for a new order to deal with the latest challenges. The judges observed that Telangana had not faced such a scarcity of vials of essential drugs and oxygen during the first wave last year. Even the rush for CT scans was not as heavy. “Bring in a new order by adding these things,” the bench said addressing both advocate general BS Prasad and the state public health department director Dr G Srinivas Rao. Answering queries on vaccination, Rao who was present before the virtual court, said he had no idea about the quantum of vaccine supply the 230 private hospitals had received. “Whether it is medicines like remdesivir or oxygen supply or even vaccines, Telangana must get 35% more than the allotted quota,” Srinivas told the bench. Thirty-five per cent of patients occupying private hospitals here are from neighbouring states like Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, AP, Odisha, and Karnataka, according to him. “We are not getting the required oxygen on account of faulty supply on one hand and unwilling neighbours like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka on the other,” Rao added. “Centre’s intervention had reined in Karnataka but not Tamil Nadu which is not allowing oxygen to go out of its borders.” The director informed the court that they have 16,000 beds in private hospitals and half of them are vacant as of now. But many advocates like Masood Khan, Naresh Reddy, and senior advocate L Ravi Chander said hospitals show vacant beds, but turn away people in dire need. According to the lawyers, the same beds are then given to those who shell out lakhs in advance. Chikkudu Prabhakar, the counsel for one of the petitioners, said that the state never controlled private hospitals and the only way forward was to tie them down with the provisions of the Disaster Management Act. Unwilling to accept the Telangana’s expert committee as a validly constituted panel, the bench directed the state to form a new committee within two days. “This committee should record the minutes of its meetings, unlike the current one which failed to do so, regardless of its mode of meeting, virtual or physical,” the bench said. The judges expressed dissatisfaction over the number of daily tests, currently hovering between 50,000 and 70,000, being conducted in the state and directed the government to ramp them up to at least one lakh. The bench also directed the state to issue fresh orders reducing the guests at marriages to 50% of the capacity of the venue. The number of participants in funeral processions should not cross 50, the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-hc-rein-in-pvt-hosps-cap-test-treatment-rates/articleshow/82418825.cms||---

The district administration officials said things will improve if people follow guidelines. The district administration officers said about a month ago, the demand for D-type oxygen cylinders in Ludhiana was around 300-350, but with the increase in cases, the demand has jumped to more than 6,500. They said of these cylinders, around 3,400 were being used by six major hospitals of the city (including DMCH, CMCH, Mohandai Oswal Hospital, SPS Hospital and Fortis Hospital) and the remaining by other facilities. An administration officer said, “As of now we get 2,000 cylinders from Vardhman Special Steels Limited and about 850 from Weltech Equipment and Infrastructure Limited and we meet the remaining demand from five bottling plants, of which two have oxygen as of now. We also ensure that the major hospitals get the cylinders as per demand, which at present is around 3,400 cylinders even as they have their own system of supply through tankers. At civil hospital, of the 300-325 cylinders demand, they get 125 cylinders from in-house plant and remaining is provided by us.”The officer, who is involved with oxygen cylinders’ management, said, “At present, we have 2,100 to 2,200 patients, including more than 1,800 Covid and 300 post-Covid patients, who need oxygen. More than 6,500 cylinders consumption is very high, but the reason is considerable rise in caseload. It has increased burden on medical facilities and staff too.” Officials said if people continue to be careless and do not follow Covid norms, like wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and respiratory hygiene, the system will be hit, though they are exploring ways to increase the oxygen supply.“As of now Ludhiana is in a comfortable position as far as oxygen availability is concerned and we have even supplied a minimum of 4,000 cylinders to other districts, including Amritsar, Jalandhar and Sangrur. It all depends on people’s behaviour towards the pandemic,” officials said. Deputy director, local government, Amit Bambi, who is the nodal officer for the oxygen cylinders’ arrangement, said no doubt demand has increased a lot, but with the support of the district administration and the state government and local generation, they have managed things. He said they were meeting more than 10 times demand. Residents also said it was better to follow rules than land up in hospitals. “If a person follows Covid rules, he may help in reducing load on hospitals and breaking the chain of infection,” said Amarjeet Kaur, a city resident.Beds statistics HospitalsBeds earmarked L 2Bed occupied L 2Beds earmarked L3Beds occupied L3Private hospitals1,5861,241570510Government hospitals3301461616L2 beds are for moderate patientsL 3 beds are for severe patients||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/o2-cylinders-demand-in-ludhiana-from-300-month-ago-to-6500-now/articleshow/82414401.cms||Shariq Majeed

The CM has also directed the principal chief engineer of PWD to investigate the complaints and submit a detailed report. “As directed by the chief minister, it is proposed to place Bicholi assistant engineer Vassudev Parab and junior engineer Siddesh Naik under suspension, and issue a show-cause notice to executive engineer Nitin Neurekar of the water division XXIV Bicholim,” the letter from CMO states. The CMO has said that action against the three is being initiated following three separate complaints from Bicholim residents. Sarvan-resident Pushpa Chari complained that she was asked to pay Rs 2,000 for release of water connection under the Jal Jeevan Mission scheme. But despite paying the amount, the connection was not provided to her. Subsequently, Naik allegedly demanded an additional amount of Rs 6,000 from her, on the pretext that extra pipes have to be laid. Chari filed the complaint with the CMO after learning that she is eligible to receive the connection free of cost. In another case, Pundalik Naik of Bordem alleged that Neurekar, Parab and all junior engineers demand huge sums of money to release water connections. “Parab demands Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 per flat from the builder,” the complaint stated. Another complainant Shripad Gawas said, “Officials demand Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 for release of each household connection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-asks-pwd-to-act-against-three-engineers-for-graft/articleshow/82417778.cms||---

President of Federation of Private Schools and Associations Dr Jagjit Singh, who is also chairman of a school situated on Pakhowal Road, has requested the chief secretary to amend the guidelines that states that all educational institutions remain closed. Talking to TOI, he said, “The schools have to send assessment of the students within a limited time frame. The complete process started from Wednesday (May 5) and the last day for the same is May 25.”“Future of students should not be affected due to any delay and for this purpose, the authorities should allow teaching and non-teaching staff to come to school.”Principal of GNPS School, Model Town (Extension), Mona Singh said, “The school has not opened and most of the material required to assess the students, including project files and assessment sheets, is in school. We are waiting for a response from the authorities or the CBSE should extend the result dates.”DP Guleria, president of Ludhiana Sahodya Schools and principal of BCM School, Chandigarh Road, said, “As schools are not opened, principals have formed a Whatsapp group and are communicating on the same. For finalising the results, every school will have to constitute a result committee comprising principal and seven teachers. Out of these, five teachers should be from mathematics, social science, science and two languages and the other two teachers should be from neighbouring schools, who will act as the external members of the committee. On Wednesday, we have formed a committee online with two teachers of DCM Presidency School and Springdale School.” Principals of city schools have scheduled a virtual meeting next week where they would decide on seeking permission from the district administration to approve schools to open for the teachers.Pramjit Kaur, CBSE City coordinator and principal of BCM Arya School, Model Town, said , “ Most of the assessment work can be coordinated from homes as it has to be done online. Also, we have already submitted internal assessment to CBSE, even shared the results of boards online. Therefore, we will pick up the same data. However, if the lockdown extends beyond May 15, then it won’t be possible for us to compile the assessment data and we will request the district administration to allow us to come to schools as we have to finish this work before May 25.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/allow-staff-to-come-to-prepare-class-x-assessment-schools/articleshow/82414479.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Banana-seller helps RPF peel off mystery behind railway tickets scam||MUMBAI: Investigators looking for an unauthorised seller of railway tickets were stumped when their probe led them to a banana vendor on the streets of Antop Hill. It was only questioning him that they learnt the perpetrator of the crime was someone else entirely. The proprietor of a money transfer agency had misused the banana vendor's mobilephone number to create a user ID on the IRCTC website and was using it to book e-tickets illegally for passengers. Abdul Fazl Khan, 33, was arrested by the Wadala Railway Protection Force (RPF) on Tuesday. The Railways' cyber cell is constantly looking for footprints left behind virtually by unauthorised e-ticket sellers. They directed the Wadala RPF team to a location at Sangam Nagar in Antop Hill. "We were puzzled when we reached Ramdhan Yadav's shanty. An illiterate banana vendor, he had no clue about e-tickets. We checked his belongings and found an old handset that couldn't be used for internet access," said senior inspector DH Patil. The RPF then quizzed Yadav about his daily routine, the people he met and who could have had access to his phone. He led the sleuths to a money transfer agency in Antop Hill run by Khan.  Apparently, Yadav used to send money regularly from Khan's shop for his wife who lived in their hometown. "On May 4, we raided Khan's shop and found that he had been engaged in illegal railway bookings for a year," said sub-inspector Puja Suryavanshi. It turned out Khan had used Yadav's mobile number to create a user ID on the IRCTC website. He had also created 24 other user IDs and booked e-tickets for people living in the neighbourhood. "He charged a commission of Rs 100 per ticket and Rs 200 if it was tatkal," added Suryavanshi. Khan had only studied up to class VII, but a friend who was a techie had taught him how to operate computers. He had also started a business of flight ticket bookings. Fifty tickets for future journeys, costing Rs 94000, were seized from Khan and blocked. A cellphone and a computer were also seized. The RPF may request court to make Yadav an approver in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-banana-seller-helps-rpf-peel-off-mystery-behind-rly-tickets-scam/articleshow/82418839.cms||Nitasha Natu

Talking to mediapersons here on Wednesday he said, “Groupism has destroyed the party. In the name of the group, incompetent and disloyal people become the office bearers.” He wanted MP K Sudhakaran to become the KPCC president and reorganize the party with loyal people, irrespective of group affiliations. In reply to a question, he said that organizational elections are not possible in the present situation in the party. Earlier, there were only two groups in the party — one led by late K Karunakaran and the other by A K Antony. “Karunakaran was strengthening the party at the official administrative level as chief minister and Antony as party organizational head. But now, new groups are emerging with new leaders. Earlier, people were recruited to the party but now only to the group. This situation has destroyed the party,” Gopinath said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/congress-is-dead-says-gopinath/articleshow/82415994.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||Natco files for patent waiver for arthritis drug to fight Covid-19 in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: In the first instance of a pharma company taking the compulsory licencing (CL) route to launch a Covid-19 drug in India, Hyderabad-based Natco Pharma has filed for a CL to manufacture rheumatoid arthritis drug Baricitinib, under Section 92 of the Patents Act, 1970. The patent is owned by Incyte Holdings, with a license to Eli Lilly, which markets the drug under the Olumiant brand name. In its application, Natco has cited the unmet medical needs due to the lack of supply and affordability in light of the grave and life-threatening national public health emergency, due to the Covid-19 second wave, as the main grounds for seeking the CL. "The CL, if granted, will help in improving the accessibility and affordability of the drug, bringing its price down substantially". Under the World Trade Organisation TRIPS Agreement, compulsory licences are legally-recognised means to overcome barriers in accessing affordable medicines. Under the rules, governments allow a company to manufacture a patented drug without the consent of the innovator firm. Analysts said Natco's move puts pressure on the US drug maker. It has only two choices – either give a voluntary licence or sue Natco for the patent, which could result in a public backlash given the soaring Covid-19 case load and death toll in India. Natco has applied for a CL at a time when India and South Africa have approached the WTO for a temporary suspension of intellectual property rights of pharma companies so that Covid-19 vaccines and other medicines can be accessible to poor countries. Natco has urged the controller of patents to grant it a CL to manufacture and market Baricitinib, both as bulk API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) and finished dosage only for Covid-19 treatment in India till the pandemic prevails. It is also willing to pay a 7% royalty on net profits from Baricitinib sales to the patent-holder. Making its case, Natco’s application said not only is Olumiant not manufactured in India, less than 9,000 tablets were imported in 2019 and 2020, at an average cost of Rs 3,230 per tablet. Citing the pricing as a significant barrier, it said a 14-day regimen (one tablet a day) works out to approximately Rs 45,220 per patient, which most Indians can ill-afford. Natco said it would structure its pricing at Rs 30 each for a 4mg tablet, which translates to Rs 420 for a 14-day course, Rs 20 for a 2mg tablet (Rs 280 for the regimen) and Rs 15 for each 1mg tablet, costing only Rs 210 for the entire 14-day therapy. It also pointed out that the drug’s limited imports, which dropped from 8,870 tablets in 2019 to 8,385 tablets in 2020, would not be enough to cater the nearly 34 lakh Covid-19 patients in India. “The tablets of Olumiant imported through 2020 by Lilly would serve at best to meet the needs of only approximately 600 patients,” Natco said in its application, a copy of which was reviewed by TOI. “It's time India set up an independent committee of experts to consider and advice on compulsory licensing and use of other safeguards for Covid-19 medical products including medicines and vaccines’’, lawyer and IP expert, Leena Menghaney told TOI. This is not Natco's first battle for CL with a global pharma biggie. In 2012-13 it took on Bayer for cancer drug Nexavar and won India's first ever successful compulsory license.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/natco-files-for-patent-waiver-for-arthritis-drug-to-fight-covid-19/articleshow/82418856.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Speaking at “Keraleeyam 2021” programme organized at the press club he said that he received votes of both BJP and the Left parties. “In a constituency like Karuangappally where BJP had very limited influence, they may have got more votes in the past due to various reasons. It is not wrong to reclaim the UDF votes which had gone to BJP or LDF,” said Mahesh. His emphasis would be to implement development activities, and his priority would be to address the drinking water crisis, sea erosion and other issues plaguing people, he said. “I don’t consider it a limitation to be an opposition MLA. I hope the government will support development activities,” he said. Detailing his plans under ‘Mission 2021-26’, Mahesh said he had chalked out a ten-point programme and priority would be given to ensuring drinking water availability for all. “Development of the taluk hospital, Oachira town, tsunami colony renovation, ‘theera samrudhi’, mini tourism circuit linking, Vattakkayal and Aayiram Thengu are my pet projects,” he said. There would be a scheme to ensure healthcare to the workers under employment guarantee scheme and autorickshaw workers, he added. Referring to UDF’s crisis, especially Congress, he said, “Instead of indulging in blame game, there should be a proper analysis of the reasons for the defeat and efforts to correct them.” RSP setback due to political deceit: Noushad M Noushad, the winning candidate from Eravipuram, said RSP was facing a setback for the political deceit it had done for protecting the interests of a single leader. He said that when RSP quit LDF and joined UDF fold to claim the Lok Sabha seat for NK Premachandran, it lost all its assembly, municipal corporation, grama panchayat and district panchayat posts. It could not win a single seat in the last two assembly elections. “When CPM took over the Lok Sabha seat, it had given a Rajya Sabha seat to RSP,” he said. Noushad alleged that BJP and UDF had tried to divide the people of Eravipuram on caste lines. “But the people here rejected such a move and that is reflected in my success,” he said. He said his priority would be to complete the on-going projects he had begun in his previous tenure as MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/mahesh-denies-udf-bjp-vote-trade/articleshow/82416025.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, demands of both the groups were turned down by Tomar. One of the groups is now planning to approach the state government through ministers and MLAs with the same requests. The restrictions to keep the commercial complexes closed have been extended by the government till May 12 to contain the spread of coronavirus.

SGCCI formed a Textile Task Force with representatives of FOGWA, SGTPA, SMA and others. In a meeting of the task force it was planned to make representation to the police and government to allow the markets to remain open for business-to-business transactions. It was also proposed that the markets can be allowed to remain open on odd-even formula. “The committee proposed that the market should be allowed to remain open for business-to-business transactions while keeping the restrictions on for the retail customers. But the city police commissioner has turned down our requests. Now, we are making the representation to the government through ministers and MLAs,” said Dinesh Navadiya, president, SGCCI. “We do not agree with the task force’s demands.

---||Kolkata||With no local train service, office-goers fear increase in travel time and expenses||Kolkata: With local train service being suspended, office commuters who travel to the city have found themselves in a spot of bother again. While travel expenses are likely to go up, many of these commuters are apprehensive of extended travel time in the coming days. Those using own vehicle to commute are however relatively unperturbed with the state government’s move to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The state government on Wednesday announced cancellation of the local trains from Thursday. It has also announced that metro rail and government-run transport services would run with 50% occupancy from Thursday. “This will be a huge trouble for us who travel to Kolkata daily from far-off places,” said Ishita Roychwdhury, a resident of Konnagar. “The distance looks short, but there is no direct bus service from here (in Konnagar) and we have to change buses at least thrice. That takes around two and a half hours and add 30 minutes more to reach the office. Last time it took three hours to reach my office at Minto Park,” said Roychowdhury, who works at a company dealing with iron & steel and information technology. “A ferry service from Konnagar to Fairlie Place was introduced last time. But that took more than three hours to travel one side,” she recounted. For Amiya Kar, a resident of Nimta and a gazetted officer with the state government, suspension of local trains is going to create trouble. “I get down at Dum Dum and take Metro trains to go to my office. With reduced number of Metro and no local trains, my travel time will increase. Moreover, it is going to get more crowded in buses,” Kar said. Those using two-wheeler to commute are relatively less hassled. Sourav Chattopadhyay, a resident of Khardaha, has however started using his two-wheeler to reach office since the second wave broke out in the state. “It normally takes a little more than an hour by train to reach my office at Park Street. But the travel time actually got reduced last time as the roads were empty. I reach office even in less than an hour on bike. It may not be a cost-effective option, but it saves time.” Chattopadhyay said. He works at the finance department of a cosmetics company headquartered in Kolkata. Nimai Biswas, who works with a financial technology company, attending office at Baguiati will be little more time consuming. “I travel from Panshila, Sodepur every day. Usually, I get down at the Bishannagar railway station and take an auto from there. I will use my two-wheeler again now,” Biswas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/with-no-local-train-service-office-goers-fear-increase-in-travel-time-and-expenses/articleshow/82416047.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

Some are even brought here on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, which is the last line of treatment. “We are airlifting patients from all over India to Hyderabad, which is currently the top destination,” said Dr Sanjay Mishra, founder, and director of Air Rescuers Private Limited. “We have flown around 60 patients to Hyderabad during the month of April alone from various places like Varanasi, Patna, Raipur and even Delhi,” added Dr Mishra. Currently, Hyderabad is seeing more medical flights coming in than any other city, say operators. The city boasts of top-class medical care in some 50 big and mid-sized hospitals. Patients spend, on an average, Rs 18 lakh to Rs 24 lakh for these quick transfers depending on the port of departure, but still must endure a waiting period of three days currently to get an air ambulance. Clearances from airport authorities and assurance of a bed from hospital notwithstanding, there is a huge surge in demand for medical flights. While most of the patients are brought in chartered flights, with oxygen support and some with ventilators too, the extreme critical ones are brought in ambulances with ECMO. “We have done more than 75 ECMO initiations and transfers in the past six months, one of the highest number in the world done in this short time,” said Dr Rahul Singh Sardar, co-founder director of ICATT Air Ambulance Service. “In April we have done 39 transfers, about 60 percent of them to Hyderabad,” added Dr Sardar. For now, 5-6 players operate air ambulances, mostly out of Delhi and Bangalore. “My cousin was extremely critical and after all the treatment options were tried out, the hospital in Jamshedpur said nothing more could be done. We started contacting air ambulance operators but every operator said that we will need two days at least and helped us connect with a hospital in Hyderabad. After all clearances and scheduling a time, it was held at the last minute and the flight took off only the next day,” said a patient’s relative undergoing treatment in Hyderabad. Most patients are being brought to Hyderabad from Mumbai, Rajkot, Bhilai, Raipur, Durgapur, Patna, Delhi, and cities like Jaipur, Ahmedabad and Nagpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/100-covid-patients-airlifted-to-hyd-in-april-may-from-across-india/articleshow/82418861.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Mumbai||SC quashes Maratha reservation||NEW DELHI: In a major setback for the Maharashtra government, the SC on Wednesday declared the state law to grant reservation to Marathas as unconstitutional and held that the community is not socially and educationally backward to be eligible to be brought within the ambit of affirmative action. A Constitution bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat was unanimous in its view on the unconstitutionality of the law and quashed it on various grounds, which include breaching of the 50% quota rule. It rued that even after 70 years of Independence, people and communities are vying to be declared as ‘backward’ to get the benefit of reservation. It noted that a majority of the state legislature belongs to the Maratha community—13 of 19 CMs were from the community. “The representation of Marathas in public services in Grade A, B, C and D comes to 33.23%, 29.03%, 37.06% and 36.53%, computed from out of the open category filled posts, and is adequate and satisfactory,” Justice Bhushan said. But it made it clear that people who have availed of the quota for jobs and educational admissions during pendency of the case will not be affected. MVA govt has to deal with political hot potatoThe decision declaring the state law on Maratha quota unconstitutional will cause disquiet in the politically influential community and put the Shiv Sena-led government in a spot even as it will most likely look for avenues to appeal. But the ruling is unlikely to be altered, and the law -- brought in by the previous BJP-Sena government -- is likely to remain a non-starter. Thelaw was backed by all major parties in Maharashtra, and the Sena-led government, which includes NCP and Congress, will have to deal with the political hot potato. The state had framed the law on November 30, 2018 granting 16% quota for Marathas in government jobs and admission in educational institutions. While upholding the law, Bombay High Court on June 27, 2019, directed the government to bring it down to 12% for education and 13% for jobs as recommended by a state-appointed backward class commission headed by ex-HC judge M B Gaikwad. But on examining all data pertaining to social, educational and political status of Marathas in the state, the apex court, in its judgement running into 569 pages, said both HC and the Commission erred in concluding they are a backward community. It said the community is dominant in the state and part of the national mainstream with adequate representation in government jobs and educational institutions. The SC, however, made it clear people who availed of Maratha quota in getting government jobs and admission in educational institutions during pendency of the case will not be affected and their jobs and admissions would be protected. Quashing the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, the bench noted that majority of the legislature belongs to the Maratha community—out of 19 CMs of Maharashtra, 13 were from the community. The court said, “The government committed an error in accepting the recommendation without scrutinising the report with regard to correct percentage of representation of Marathas in services.” The court said reports of national and state backward commis the claim of Marathas to be included in OBCs since 1955. “We have found that no extraordinary circumstances were made out in granting separate reservation of Maratha community by exceeding the 50 percent ceiling limit of reservation. The Act violates the principle of equality as enshrined in Article 16. The exceeding of ceiling limit without there being any exceptional circumstances clearly violates Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution,” Justice Bhushan said. The bench noted Marathas are competing successfully with general category and managed to grab around 30% seats in various categories of jobs. The community has succeeded in open competition and got admissions in all t streams, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mva-govt-has-to-deal-with-political-hot-potato/articleshow/82417862.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

With a Covid fatality that occurred in April coming to light six days later on Wedesday, opposition leader Digambar Kamat said that the government is trying to cover up deaths in the state. “Are we heading towards 200-300 daily deaths predicted by health minister Vishwajit Rane? Will chief minister Pramod Sawant act only after he happens to prove his health minister right?” said Kamat. Kamat said that the state continues to “goof-up” while releasing data on the number of Covid deaths. “This insensitive and irresponsible government both at Centre and state have developed a habit of digging a well only after feeling thirsty. There is complete mess in oxygen supply with patients and relatives sending SOS messages on social media,” said Kamat. The party also said that the only way to tackle the pandemic is by increasing testing facilities in the state. “Goa requires urgent measures to tackle Covid as the situation is getting out of control. There is a need to increase testing centres and they should reach every village by means of ‘mobile testing laboratories, said president of youth Congress Varad Mardolkar. Mardolkar said that the lackadaisical approach of the BJP government towards testing has put stress on the existing testing centres and has also led to a surge in cases. The Congress party has offered to conduct the Covid testing in a systematic manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-govt-has-lost-control-goa-heading-towards-disaster/articleshow/82417841.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

From a target of penalizing 25,000 persons per day, on May 4 only 4,314 persons were penalised and Rs 8.6 lakh penalty was collected. In April last year, a month after Covid-19 outbreak in Mumbai, BMC made wearing of masks compulsory in public. It was decided that a Rs 200 fine would be levied by clean-up marshals on persons not wearing masks. The numbers indicate a steep reduction in violators compared to the last two months. On March 6, 24,809 people were penalised and over Rs 49.6 lakh penalty was collected. In April, less than 20,000 offenders were penalised. —Richa Pinto||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-only-4k-fined-rs-8-6-lakh-for-mask-rule/articleshow/82417932.cms||---

A similar scene was witnessed at these stations last Wednesday as over a thousand passengers had boarded the Bihar-bound train. Following the government’s announcement of a four-day lockdown, Bihari migrants had rushed to Vasco and Margao railway stations to board the first available train to return to their native places. On Wednesday, railway police had a hard time in regulating the crowds and enforcing Covid-appropriate behaviour by the passengers. Though passengers with reserved tickets only are allowed to board the “special trains” that are currently in operation, several of the migrants who had queued up at the station didn’t have reserved tickets. “The tickets for this train are booked online and the train mostly runs full to capacity. Many migrants think that they can buy tickets from the platform and board the train, but things have changed now and they are probably not aware of it, (and hence this crowd),” a railway official said. Only passengers with reserved tickets were allowed to board the train at the Vasco railway station. Many more tried to board the train and those left back were seen outside the Vasco railway station. The migrants said that since the restrictions were declared they didn't have jobs and couldn’t afford to pay rent of their rented premises. They feared that staying longer would make them starve with their families. They urged the government to make some arrangements to send them back. “There is no work in Goa. How long can we stay here without work and money? We need money to pay for food and home rent,” one of the passengers said. Most of those who were returning home were engaged in various sectors – construction activities, hospitality industry, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/deja-vu-as-goa-sees-migrant-exodus-at-margao-vasco-railway-stations/articleshow/82417850.cms||---

---||Business||RBI allows recast of home, personal & small business loans||MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday extended relief to individuals and small businesses who have loans up to Rs 25 crore by allowing them to seek a loan restructuring if they are affected by the second wave of the Covid-19. Announcing a series of steps to ensure financial stability, the central bank also loosened its purse strings to fund the war against the pandemic by providing a Rs 50,000 crore liquidity window to ramp up healthcare infrastructure. This has been topped with incentives for lenders who build a Covid-19 loan book. "This is the first part of a calibrated and comprehensive strategy against the pandemic," RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said and made it clear that he was willing to take many more "small and big steps", including unconventional measures, and work with the Centre to "ameliorate the extreme travails" that citizens were facing "in this hour of distress". The loan recast will be available to individuals - including home and other personal loans - and small and medium enterprises that did not restructure their loans in 2020 which were classified as standard accounts till March 2021. The RBI also allowed lenders to provide relief to small and individual borrowers, who had availed of the restructuring option last year. Under the Rs 50,000 crore scheme, banks can lend to those involved in the war against Covid, including vaccine manufacturers, importers or suppliers of vaccines and priority medical devices, hospitals and dispensaries, pathology labs, manufacturers and suppliers of oxygen and ventilators, importers of vaccines and Covid related drugs, logistics firms and also patients for treatment. The banks, Das said, are being incentivised for quick delivery of credit under the scheme through the extension of priority sector classification to such lending up to March 31, 2022. These loans, he added, will continue to be classified under the priority sector till repayment or maturity, whichever is earlier. Bankers said, unlike last year, this year there is no blanket relief to borrowers on repayment and they will have to seek approval from lenders. Lenders can prevent small loans from going bad by doing a customised restructuring and giving them an additional two years to repay. This relief will cover 85-90% of all bank borrowers in India. The governor also kept on his efforts to contain interest rates by announcing Rs 35,000 crore of government bonds on May 20 under its government securities acquisition plan. The announcement brought down bond yields to below 6% and boosted bank stocks in early trade. According to SBI chairman Dinesh Khara the impact of the second wave was different from last year when there was a complete lockdown which disrupted cashflows. While acknowledging that the current quarter would be tough the impact on corporates balance sheets would be known only if the situation persisted and currently corporations could manage without relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-allows-recast-of-home-personal-small-business-loans/articleshow/82422087.cms||---

Most of them said that they had neither received full ex-gratia announced by the government, nor did the next of kin get a job. On July 23, 2018, Kakasaheb Shinde took take extreme step by plunging in Godavari river from Kaygaon Toka bridge on Aurangabad-Pune highway. High court lawyer Abhaysinh Bhosale said, “The then CM Devendra Fadnavis had assured of government jobs and monetary compensation to kin of those who ended their lives. The promise is yet to be fulfilled.” Maratha Kranti Morcha office-bearer Abhijit Deshmukh told TOI that 50 people from the community took extreme step while demanding reservation. Deshmukh said only Shinde’s brother has been given a permanent job in city based college by NCP MLC Satish Chavan. Anant Levde (24) had immolated himself on August 5, 2018 in Parbhani and succumbed to the burn injuries the same day. His brother Dnyaneshwar told TOI, “We have received only Rs 5 lakh of the Rs 10 lakh of assured compensation. I am still awaiting the assured government job.” Shivaji Kate from Pimpalner in Beed district committed suicide by hanging on August 3, 2018 and left behind a suicide note demanding reservation. His sons, Krushna and Anna, said they had neither been compensated nor given government job. “We feel ditched by the system and the successive governments that have failed to keep their promises,” said Krushna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/kin-of-those-who-ended-lives-await-govt-aid-job/articleshow/82417867.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Kochi||Augusthy goes bald after drubbing||Idukki: Congress candidate EM Augusthy from Udumbanchola in the district shaved his head after losing to M M Mani in the assembly elections. During election campaigning, Augusty had announced that he would shave his head if Mani won with a margin of over 20,000 votes. On Tuesday, he shaved his head and posted the picture on social media with the caption “Vakkukal Palikkanullathanu” (promises are to be kept). Meanwhile, after the verdict, Mani tried to dissuade his opponent from going bald. “Augusty should withdraw his decision. My rival had put up a good contest and the general feeling had reflected in the outcome,” said Mani. Over the years, Mani has emerged as a villain-turned-heartthrob in Udumbanchola constituency who won with flying colors. He had earned notoriety for his controversial statements. In 2016 assembly elections, he defeated Senapathi Venu of Congress with a margin of just 1,109 votes. But after five years he defeated Augusthy with a record margin of 38,305 votes. Mani’s speeches had sparked controversies but what lingers in public memory is the infamous “one..two..three” speech he made on May 21, 2012, that let loose many political cyclones over the last several years. Then followed the infamous Manakkad speech, that cost him his district secretary post. It went like this: “Party has always killed those who have come against it. In Santhanpara, we prepared a list of 13 people and shot one, beaten one and stabbed one to death. We also killed one in Peermade, too.” This speech took forward the Anchery Baby murder case, and Mani was arrested and remanded for 44 days in the case. After becoming the power minister, Mani proved his administrative mettle. The last five years saw the state move to a power cut-free situation. Even after becoming a minister he maintained personal contacts with the local residents of his constituency known for cardamom plantations. A large number of voters are estate workers where trade unions play a major role. In fact, he could be seen sipping tea from a local tea shop and discussing local issues, thus endearing himself to the residents there. CPM Idukki district secretary K K Jayachandran said, “Mani interacted with local residents when he was a trade union leader and he continues to do so even after becoming a minister. The ministerial post never changed Mani’s style. He was always with the people and remains that way.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/augusthy-goes-bald-after-drubbing/articleshow/82416193.cms||Sandeep Thomas

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat’s allocation to health dipping||GANDHINAGAR: Although the Centre has asked the states to increase budgetary spending to provide better health facilities, the Gujarat government has over the past few years reduced its healthcare allocation. The Union government’s advice was made under the new National Health Policy, which was announced in 2017. The Gujarat government’s reduction in the healthcare allocation could probably be one of the contributing reasons for the strain the public health infrastructure is facing in the pandemic. The National Health Policy, 2017, in its introduction itself categorically says that financing to the health sector needs to be increased to strengthen health systems. “Increase health expenditure by Government as a percentage of GDP from the existing 1.15% to 2.5% by 2025,” reads the introduction. “Increase State sector health spending to more than 8% of their budget by 2020.” Despite this mandate, the Gujarat government reduced the health sector budget allocation from 5.7% of the total budget in 2016-17 to 5% in 2021-22. The National Health Policy also proposed to increase budget spending of at least 2.5% of the total GSDP (gross state domestic product) for health services. But the Gujarat government has spent only about 0.6% so far. Mahendra Jethmalani, in charge of Pathey Budget Center, an NGO that analyzes budgets, said: “Despite having faced major challenges in the health sector because of the pandemic, the state government chose not to increase budget for the health and family welfare department.” Jethmalani added: “Despite making tall claims of economic progress, the state spends very little on the health sector, when the size of the GSDP is taken into account.” Jethmalani said it is unfortunate that the Gujarat government has ignored the recommendations of the National Health Policy and has done little to increase the budgetary allocation to the health sector. “The target of 8% budget allocation for health was supposed to be met by 2020,” he said. “A drastic increase is required in spending on the health infrastructure.” Compared to the national average, Gujarat fares poorly in terms of the availability of primary health centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/states-allocation-to-health-dipping/articleshow/82416176.cms||Kapil Dave

Senior police officers said that the decision has been taken in accordance with the directives issued by the Aurangabad bench of Bombay High Court while hearing Covid-related PIL. Police expect people to wear masks inside the helmet while being on the move in the city. Commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta said, “There will be an all-out helmet drive starting from May 16.” The divisional bench of the high court comprising Justice Ravindra Ghuge and BU Debadwar ruled ‘Every person, barring a bicycle or those occupying three-wheelers and above should wear helmets while moving on the streets.’ HC warned that the violation of these directions would amount to an offence since ‘we are informed by the learned chief public prosecutor that the rule of wearing helmets by riders as well as pillion riders is now compulsory. This would help in protecting the eyes of such people from the coronavirus infection, as well’ HC ruled. The HC has also ruled that ‘any person stepping out of his house and coming onto the streets or walking on roads or those riding motorcycle, vehicles, three-wheelers, four-wheelers, etc. should be wearing masks covering their nose and mouth. Wearing a mask below the chin or exposing the nose or both the nose and the mouth shall also be an offence as such people turn out to be super spreaders of the virus while making a farcical use of the mask. By doing so, they cheat themselves as well as the law enforcers and risk the health of others. Violation of this condition would result in registering of an offence as may be provided for in law.’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-city-to-launch-full-fledge-helmet-drive/articleshow/82417872.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Similarly, other beneficiaries, including those awaiting their second dose are also crowding these centres,” he said, adding that such unwanted gatherings may cause surge in fresh Covid infections. Chavan, in his public message, said citizens should not worry about the supply of vaccine doses. “Aurangabad district is by and large getting smooth supply of vaccine since the launch of the immunization programme. Although certain mismatch is observed between demand and supply on certain occasions, every target beneficiary would get the vaccine dose,” he added.With arrival of new doses, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) resumed the vaccination drive against Covid-19 with more vigour on Wednesday with those waiting for the second dose given priority. The immunization drive also saw vaccination for the age-group of 18 to 44 at only three centres. The municipal limits of Aurangabad saw a total 7,705 inoculations on Wednesday, including a total of 2,721 and 2,589 1 citizens above 60 and between the age group of 45 and 59, respectively. A total of 379 citizens aged between 18 and 44 years took their first dose on Wednesday, taking the progressive count of such beneficiaries to 1,354.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/avoid-crowding-at-vaccination-centres-aurangabad-collector/articleshow/82412827.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Resident doctors of 4 civic hospitals demand Rs 1.2L stipend arrears||MUMBAI: Resident doctors from four BMC hospitals who have shouldered the burden of Covid work in the city for more than a year are up in arms against the administration, saying they are being denied stipend arrears of Rs 1.2 lakh each. The doctors were told their hiked stipend was already paid in “advance” last year. The doctors were paid Rs 10,000 per month for Covid work since May 2020, which was discontinued in January when cases fell. In the meantime, the government hiked the stipend of resident doctors by Rs 10,000 in September. For the 3,000 doctors in BMC hospitals—Sion, KEM, Cooper and Nair—the circular was released six months later in March. Now, when the doctors are expecting accumulated arrears for their hiked stipend, they are told the money paid, Rs 10,000 a month, for Covid duty will be adjusted against arrears. The doctors say they were “shortchanged”. The BMC-MARD (Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors) unit has asked the administration to sort the issue in seven days, failing which they would go on strike. A resident doctor said a circular released in June mentioned Rs 300 would be given as daily incentive to all healthcare workers. “Additionally, the circular stated Rs 10,000 would be given to all doctors for Covid duty. These incentives were extended at the time the government and the BMC were giving Rs 80,000 to MBBS doctors and Rs 1.5 lakh for specialists from outside. It did not mention stipends.” The stipend was around Rs 55,000 and hiked by Rs 10,000 in September, said the doctor.  BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said resident doctors were not given the impression Rs 10,000 was an incentive. “We wanted to bring their stipend on par with the rest and hence the hike of Rs 10,000 was decided upon. But since we didn’t have an approval from the general body then, we gave it as an advance. We got the approval two weeks ago and accordingly adjustments would happen.” BMC-MARD have moved DMER. Director Dr T P Lahane said he will write to BMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-resident-docs-of-4-civic-hosps-demand-rs-1-2l-stipend-arrears/articleshow/82416189.cms||Yogita Rao

---||Kolkata||RWA helping hand for service providers||Kolkata: Even as suburban train services were suspended from Thursday, housing societies hastily began making arrangements for accommodation of security personnel, housekeeping staff, maids, cooks, babysitters and care-givers for the elderly on the premises. Last year, unaware of what would entail a lockdown, service sector personnel had returned to their homes in the suburbs and got stranded there. Local trains are the backbone of commuting from suburbs to the city and used by thousands of service sector personnel employed in homes across the city. The impending withdrawal of train services has now left them worried. From Kartik Dam, a security guard at Salt Lake’s Sector V who commutes from Kalyani to Parul Saha, to a caregiver who travels from Baruipur to Ballygunge, these people are now worried about how they would retain their job. Last year, local train services had remained suspended for nearly eight months and resumed only after the state gave its nod. Bengal is the second state after Maharashtra to suspend local train services to stop the spread of Covid. In recent weeks, around 200 trains have had to be cancelled as 1,300-odd railway staff have been down with infection. Passenger count had also declined by 20 per cent. After the cancelation of service was announced on Wednesday, the associations at various housing societies got busy making arrangements for food and accommodation for the security, electricians, plumbers and housekeeping staff. “Some staff are absolutely essential to the functioning of our complex. We are ensuring their accommodation in community halls and spare rooms. On Wednesday night, 20 will stay over. When those in the next shift comes on Thursday, they will also be asked to stay back,” said Manoj Gupta, president of South City complex. The management committees at scores of housing societies in Kolkata and New Town like Upohar, Urbana and Silver Spring spent the day making similar arrangements. In many homes also, spaces were cleared out so that maids, cooks, baby sitters and care givers for the elderly could be accommodated.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Women fear 2nd lockdown due to domestic violence||When the cake stopped coming home, a son began to beat his mother. That’s the unsavoury recent reality of a Cuffe Parade slum resident in her 40s, who used to work in a nearby household that would send her back daily with leftovers that her impoverished family of four would devour. By earning more than her husband and bringing home dinner, the mother of two had enjoyed temporary respite from his beating, which resumed soon after Covid kept her home for five months without pay last year. Things came to a head when her 17-year-old son hit her as she no longer got him cake. “Please don’t tell the cops,” she told volunteers who came to her doorstep recently to ask if she was in favour of a second lockdown. The warning was supplied by many of 68 women in four slums in Cuffe Parade who cited “domestic and intimate partner violence” as the primary reason for opposition to a second lockdown in a recent study. “Our previous study on acceptability of Covid vaccines in slums, between October 2020-February 2021, demonstrated that fewer women in slums supported a lockdown if Covid cases increased,” said Dr Nishant Kumar of Eyebetes Foundation NGO, recalling that of 189 women surveyed, 53 had opposed a lockdown and 136 responded with a “I don’t know” to the question: “If Covid cases rise, authorities should lock down the city.” To understand why, researchers approached the women a second time. Only 68 agreed to talk. Over 90% of them revealed that the main reason for opposition to lockdown was domestic violence, while others cited loss of wages. “An underlying thread of helplessness and pathos has come into them,” said Dr Shibal Bhartiya, senior consultant at Gurugram’s Fortis Memorial Research Institute, who oversaw survey interviews, recalling not only women for whom the Covid threat made it impossible to escape domestic violence, but also single mothers who were called names when they turned to prostitution after losing their livelihood during the pandemic. “Authorities in charge of health policy must remember that health merely is not the absence of disease,” concluded the survey that has been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal by International Journal of Community Medicine and Public Health. “The consequences of domestic violence on physical and emotional health of women, and consequently their children, must be kept in mind when planning the next lockdown,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-women-fear-2nd-lockdown-due-to-domestic-violence/articleshow/82418897.cms||---

Forest officials said the population of the big cats has also increased by 34 per cent in the last four years. Neighbouring Telangana too recorded an increasse in the tiger population. The last time a tiger was spotted in Seshachalam was in 1985. Prior to that it was back in the 1950s. Experts explain that tigers used to be in abundance in both Seshachalam and Nallamalla forests at the turn of last century, but due to poaching, especially during British Raj, the big cats became endangered species. The latest tiger census reveals a 34% increase in population compared to the last census conducted about four years in AP. Principal chief conservator of forests N Pradeep Kumar told TOI that the forest census teams captured the images of all 63 distinct tigers using camera traps across Nagarjunasagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve (NSTR). It is also evident that Telangana also saw an increase in tigers in the last four years. Telangana’s last tiger census shows an increase of tigers from 26 to 30 and state forest officials predict that the number could increase to 35 by the next census scheduled for 2022. “Concerted efforts from the department helped protecting the tiger space,” Kumarv told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/35-years-on-big-cat-spotted-in-seshachalam-tiger-nos-up-in-t/articleshow/82418904.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

History Congress leaders said that CU’s act was no in accordance with actions of a democratic society where constitutional values are to be protected. They asked CU to withdraw the notice at the earliest. “Kerala History Congress condemns Calicut University’s act of serving a show cause notice to history teachers and dalit studies experts KS Madhavan for writing an article against the attempts made to sabotage the reservation system in the universities across India. Serving notice to an academician who urged to protect constitutional value did not suit the democratic society of Kerala,” said Sebastian Joseph, general secretary of Kerala History Congress. The article titled ‘Sarvakalashalakalil Niranjadunna Samvarana Virudha Mafia’ was co-written by Madhavan and Professor PK Poker. The notice said that he must give an explanation if he did not wish to face actions as per Kerala Service Rules as his action had maligned the varsity. Joseph said that Madhavan is known for his interventions in social issues and expertise in academics and dalit studies. Sending a memo to such a person, who has made commendable activities, without seeing the larger purpose of his article, cannot be accepted, he said. “Beyond criticizing a particular person or varsity, his article was the invitation to urge people to suggest their ideas and protect the constitutional rights in educational sector. CU should have looked at it with due importance as the article pointed out anti-dalit and anti-reservation aspects prevailing in higher education sector. At a time when India’s higher education sector witnesses dictatorial tendencies, a varsity from Kerala should not have taken such an anti-academic and anti-social stand. We extend our support to Madhavan and demand CU to withdraw the memo,” Joseph said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/history-congress-flays-cus-notice-to-madhavan/articleshow/82416262.cms||---

The health officials have also been asked to give the second dose first to the beneficiaries above the age of 60 years. So far, around 54,000 beneficiaries, above the age of 45 years are yet to take their second dose. The number continues to increase as the health administration has so far given the first dose to over 7.5 lakh beneficiaries above the age of 45 years. Of the 7.5 lakh beneficiaries, only 85,000 beneficiaries have received their second dose. Farukh Desai, the district vaccination officer said, “Henceforth, the vaccination will be done for beneficiaries above the age of 45 years, who are yet to take their second dose and the first dose for this age group will slow down.” “The first dose vaccination for those above the age of 18 to 44 years will be done as per the daily registrations, however, we have kept the centres for vaccinating the citizens of this age group limited,” he said. Of the 3.65 lakh beneficiaries above the age of 60 years, who had taken the first dose, around 60,000 have taken the second jab. The health staff have been asked to consider the elderly first for the second dose as it is more inconvenient for them to stand in long queues outside the centres in the scorching heat Around 25,000 beneficiaries from the age group of 45 to 59 have been vaccinated. “We are advising beneficiaries between the age group of 45 and 59 years to wait for some time as it will not affect their immunity levels achieved after the first dose much. They can wait for a week or two as per revised guidelines of the government,” said Desai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-gets-32400-doses-to-be-used-for-second-dose/articleshow/82412856.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Poll loss: Congress focus on new state unit chief||Hyderabad: After having tasted defeat in every election in Telangana in recent times, Congress’ focus is back on who will succeed N Uttam Kumar Reddy as the new TPCC president. The party high command is firm on having a leader who will not only breathe fresh life into the party but also gear up the cadre in the run-up to 2023 assembly and subsequent Lok Sabha elections in the state. The party took up the exercise to appoint a new TPCC chief some time ago but had to stall it after veteran leader K Jana Reddy urged the high command to wait till the Nagarjuna Sagar bypolls were over. While key aspirants have become active again, they are, however, wary of going to Delhi to lobby for the coveted post due to the prevailing pandemic. AICC incharge of Telangana affairs Manickam Tagore told TOI that no name has been finalised for the top TPCC post. “The high command will decide after a panel of names is placed before it,” he said. Despite losing the Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll and elections to seven urban local bodies, the party is not downcast as the results have brought some cheer among the leaders and cadres as the party had fared better than the BJP, which was riding high on its successes in Dubbak and GHMC polls. Congress got 37% vote share when compared to BJP’s 8% in Nagarjuna Sagar. The TRS walked away with 47% vote share. Congress is also in a happy space having won 29 wards, as against 15 by the BJP, in the just concluded municipal polls. What’s more, the Congress camp is upbeat after wresting the BJP seat in Lingojiguda ward in Greater Hyderabad. Speculations were doing the rounds earlier that Sonia Gandhi had approved senior leader and MLC T Jeevan Reddy for the TPCC chief post, while A Revanth Reddy would be asked to lead the campaign committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/poll-loss-congress-focus-on-new-state-unit-chief/articleshow/82417935.cms||Roushan Ali

Bhausaheb Galande, the resident district collector of Kolhapur said, “The technicians told us that there was no leakage or any damage to the tanker Due to change in pressure, the oxygen started exuding through the vent.

---||Kolkata||Traders make room for labourers to stay back||Kolkata: While welcoming the state government’s decision to revise the business hours, traders in community markets and wholesalers have also been forced to make arrangements for their employees and labourers to stay back in the city in the wake of suspension of suburban railway operations. The labour workforce forms the backbone of the wholesale markets in Posta and Burrabazar which are main hubs for supply of cereals, rice, sugar, spice, oil and other edibles. Last year retailers had to procure edibles using their own vehicles as most labourers left for their native places during lockdown. “Employees and labourers come from various places in Howrah, Hooghly, North and South 24 Parganas. They will not be able to make it if local trains do not run. The operations in the markets are bound to get affected if they do not come to work. We are trying to make arrangements to keep some of them back for some days at least so that supplies of essential items do not get disrupted,” said Biswanath Agarwal, secretary of the Posta Bazaar Merchant’s Association. Some traders made space for their employees and workers to stay in their godowns. Many labourers will be sleeping in the lorries parked in Posta overnight. “Around six people will stay in my godown from tonight because they travel from Pandua in Hooghly. Local trains won’t run from Thursday but if my employees and labourers do not come to work I will have to keep my gaddi shut. So, I have requested them to stay back in Kolkata. I will be bearing all the expenses for their food,” said Bikash Sikaria, a wholesaler of oil in Posta. Traders, however, are happy that the business hours have been revised in the second half with the new timing being now between 5 and 7 in the evening instead of 3 pm to 5 pm. To curb the spread of the coronavirus, the state had earlier curtailed business hours in markets with shops selling non-essential items allowed to open between 7 am and 10 am and between 3 pm and 5 pm. Several traders had requested the government for a review of the afternoon timings as buyers were not turning up due to heat and odd timings. “Most people are either at work or working from home during that time. It would be so hot in the afternoon that we would hardly get any customers,” said Debabrata Basak, member of the College Street Market Shop Owners’ Association. However, many fear that supply of vegetables might be hit with the suspension of suburban train services. “If the local train service is suspended, the supply of vegetables will suffer and the prices may rise,” said Kamal Dey, president, West Bengal Vendors Association. During last year’s lockdown, when trains services were suspended, vegetable supply depended on road transport. “Because of spiralling diesel price, the costlier transportation will discourage many vendors to supply vegetables to the city market,” said Arun Patra, a wholesaler at Khidderpore market.

---||Kolhapur||Accommodate Maratha students in edu institutes||CLEARED SKHER Kolhapur/Aurangabad/Pune: Rajya Sabha member Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati as well as different Maratha activists have appealed to the state government to add more seats in educational institutes to accommodate Maratha students by adopting supernumerary mode. “I appeal to the state and the Centre that their experts should form a way out of this. The state government must seek permission from the Centre to increase seats for medical education to accommodate Maratha students. Adding supernumerary seats is totally in hands of state government and there is no need to take permission from the apex court,” he told media persons at Kolhapur. Notably, Sambhajiraje had made the same suggestion last year too. Terming the court verdict as “unfortunate”, Sambhajiraje said he was taking efforts to bring Maratha community into the fold of ‘Bahujan’ by giving it reservation in line with the vision of legendary king and social reformer Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj from Kolhapur. Vinod Patil, one of the petitioners in the case, said the ruling parties and Opposition should jointly decide the future course of action for the benefit of the Maratha community. “We are ready to wage further legal battle to press for the quota. The government should offer something concrete, failing which, the outburst in the community is inevitable even in the pandemic situation,” he said. “Maratha youth should not take any extreme step that will affect them or their family during the current outbreak of Covid-19. Also, we demand the Centre to act swiftly to give some relief to Maratha community,” state coordinator of the outfit, Ravindra Kale said. Small protest in parts of state Maratha outfits held protests at Miraj in Sangli district and Pandharpur in Solapur district. At Pandharpur, around eight to 10 Maratha community members shaved their heads as a mark of protest and have warned they would not allow state and central ministers to travel in the state. At Miraj, Maratha workers urged community members to form a political party to get the reservation. At Aurangabad, city police took prohibitory action against a small group of Maratha activists, who tried to hold a protest at Kranti chowk. In Pune, the members of Shivsangram organisation staged an agitation at the Navi Peth. Along with the Pune city areas, agitations were also held at rural parts of the district like Indapur, Chakan. QUOTES “The battle for Maratha reservation is not over yet. As per the SC, the Right to award SEBC quota lies with the Centre after it introduced 102nd amendment. Therefore, the state government is ready to forward a proposal for reservation to Maratha community to the Union Government after studying judgement of the court” Ashok Chavan, PWD Minister “The court verdict highlights failure of the state government. The Maratha community will not forgive the ruling Mahavikas Aghadi government for this. The state government should convene a special session of the Legislature to discuss the way out” - Chandrakant Patil, Maharashtra BJP president “The state government is responsible for this. The struggle of over 35 years for the reservation seems to have yielded no results” Tushar Kakade, spokesperson, Shiv Sangram||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/accommodate-maratha-students-in-edu-institutes/articleshow/82417934.cms||Abhijeet Patil
---||Ahmedabad||‘Rational use of steroids for Covid must to rein in mucormycosis’||Ahmedabad: While the state grapples with the unprecedented spike in Covid-19 complications, experts have warned that rampant use of steroids to treat hyper-inflammation triggered by the viral infection is fuelling the spread of the mucormycosis fungal infection which is exhorbitant to treat, has a high mortality rate and results in immense pain and suffering for patients.“The need of the hour is rational use of steroids as it has been seen that Covid impairs pancreatic function leading to an increase in blood sugar as body does not produce enough insulin. “When steroids are given, they require more insulin to metabolize, and this results in ketoacidosis which leaves tissues vulnerable to rapid spread of mucormycosis,” said ENT specialist Dr Naveen Patel. He says he is anguished at seeing the suffering of patients have recovered from Covid but are now struggling to survive MM.“We cannot save patients from Covid and make them vulnerable to dying of mucormycosis,” said Dr Patel.Dr Manish Goyal, an ENT surgeon said there is a scarcity of Amphotericin B, the antifungal used in MM treatment. Overpricing of anti-fungals is being done following the unprecedented spike in demand.“Patients have to take the antifungal three to six times a week. For some, the course is as long as three months. Daily cost of therapy comes to Rs 25,000- Rs 30,000 which is a huge financial burden on patients who have already spent money on Covid treatment,” said Dr Goyal. In Vadodara, infectious disease specialist Dr Hiten Kareliya confirmed a significant increase in mucormycosis cases. “We are seeing cases not only from Vadodara but even peripheral areas like Dahod, Godhra, Anand and Nadiad,” said Kareliya, adding that long-term diabetics and cancer survivors are falling prey to mucormycosis.“Earlier, we used to see mucormycosis one or two months after Covid-19. Now, we are seeing its rapid onset one or two weeks after discharge,” he said, adding that prolonged and irrational use of steroids is one of the reasons behind it.There are some some patients who have not taken steroids, neither is there a sugar spike. “In such patients, Covid itself seems to be an individual risk factor for mucormycosis,” he said.He added that in patients who are hospitalized, special care should be taken so that the oxygen circuit is sterile and clean.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rational-use-of-steroids-for-covid-must-to-rein-in-mucormycosis/articleshow/82416318.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||0 Covid cases in 10 of 81 wards of Kolhapur city since May 1||Kolhapur: Of the 81 wards in Kolhapur city, 10 have gone without reporting even a single Covid-19 case since May 1. At present, most of the new cases are being reported from the suburbs. The wards that have reported zero cases since May 1 are Bindu Chowk, Mahalaxmi mandir, Yadavnagar, Dudhali Pavillion, Baliram Colony, Raigad Colony, Jawahar Nagar, Buddh Garden, Ruikar Colony and Shivaji University. The wards in the city usually have a population of around 7,000-10,000 each. Currently, the city has around 2,300 active Covid patients. According to the data obtained from the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC), there are 90 hotspots in 26 wards of the city. The KMC has enforced strict containment measures in these hotspots to stop the infection’s spread. Samir Nadaf, a resident of the Bindu Chowk area, said: “At the start of the current wave of the pandemic, we had 4-8 Covid cases being reported every day in our ward. However, there has been a change in the past week or so. Our locality is very congested and witnesses a large number of tourists on normal days. Now, since there are statewide Covid restrictions, the numbers have dropped. Residents here have been strictly following the rules for the past 20 days and will continue to stay at home till the government’s order is in place.” Other residents from these localities claim that the vaccination drive in their neighbourhoods helped to flatten the curve. For instance, most citizens above the age of 45 years in the Buddh Garden and Shivaji University wards have already been vaccinated. Ashok Pol, the KMC chief health officer, said, “We have activated local ward committees, which are ensuring that containment measures are strictly followed by the residents. In the past couple of weeks, the awareness of vaccination has increased and demand for the jabs has been high. Some of these localities also have had the elderly population vaccinated. That might be one of the reasons for the dip in the number of cases there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/0-covid-cases-in-10-of-81-wards-of-kolhapur-city-since-may-1/articleshow/82417941.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur wrestlers pinned down by Covid restrictions||KOLHAPUR: The lockdown-like situation due to the second wave of Covid-19 has led to the closure of ‘talims’ and village fairs in western Maharashtra, leaving wrestlers struggling to maintain their fitness or make ends meet, let alone have proper ‘khuraq’ or diet . Talims are places where the grapplers practise and exercise while village fairs are a source of income in the form of cash prizes for winners and also runners-up. “There are 25 talims in Kolhapur district and five to six in Kolhapur city alone. Each talim has 100 to 150 wrestlers. These talims were shut in April, once again forcing the wrestlers to return to their hometowns, resulting in lack of physical fitness,” said Prakash Khot, secretary of Talim Sangh in Kolhapur. “Just think how much these wrestlers are suffering in terms of skills and physical fitness. The fitness and trial rounds for the ‘Maharashtra Kesari’ tournament have already been conducted, but the selected wrestlers will have to start from scratch when the talims reopen in June, hopefully,” he said. ‘Hind Kesari’ wrestler Vinod Chougule of Motibaug Talim in the city said the wrestlers have gone back home and are unable to maintain fitness. “One wrestler needs around Rs 15,000 per month for khuraq, which has become unaffordable.” Sachin Jamdar, a wrestler from Shahu Vijayi Gangawesh Talim in Kolhapur, said village-level ‘Jatra Kusti’ or ‘Dangal Kusti’ organised durng annual fairs or festivals carry cash prizes. “However, no such wrestling tournaments are being organised in Maharashtra for one-and-a-half years. If the trend continues, people will stop looking at wrestling as a career option,” he said. Aniket Badhe from Bhor taluka in Pune district said he was in Kolhapur for three months before the Covid restrictions this year for wrestling practice, but his dream was left unfulfilled as the akhada was shut. “Soon after the talim was shut due to the lockdown, I returned to my village where I am trying my best to maintain my physique by working in the farm. Government should allow us to at least practise in batches,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-wrestlers-pinned-down-by-covid-restrictions/articleshow/82417940.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

An official linked to the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation said the state is considering providing relie. “Various options will be discussed and steps finalised in 3-4 days or a week,” said the official. In September 2020, the state had announced scholarships, concessions in hostel accommodation, a fund for ‘Sarthi,’ a non-profit government company for Marathas, withdrawal of 26 cases registered against Maratha youths during the quota agitation and government jobs for the next of kin of those who had died during the protests. The state had sanctioned Rs 600 crore for the Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Tuition Fee scholarship scheme for SEBC students and said additional funds would be provided in keeping with requirements. The Dr Punjabrao Deshmukh hostel subsistence allowance scheme would also be applicable to Maratha students, and a provision of Rs 80 crore had been made for that, the government had said. A significant amount of funds and workforce, the state had said, would be provided for ‘Sarthi’ (Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research, Training and Human Development Institute), Pune, which demanded Rs 130 crore for the year. In addition, the state had said Rs 400 crore would be given to the Annasaheb Patil Economic Backward Development Corporation which provides financial assistance to unemployed youth for entrepreneurship. But the community is yet to receive benefits of these schemes, alleged the Maratha Kranti Morcha. Virendra Pawar, convenor, said no assurance has been fulfilled. “No hostel facility has been provided, no fee reimbursement done, the management of Annasaheb Patil Corporation has been non-functional for long, and no sufficient funds have been provided to ‘Sarthi’.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-govt-looking-at-concessions-other-sops-to-pacify-community/articleshow/82417951.cms||---

Vaidya said he was booked on a Vistara flight from Pune to Delhi and then on Air Canada to Toronto on April 19-20. “I have a job in Toronto and my wife and our child (3) were travelling with me. I had spent almost Rs5.75 lakh (around 9,500 Canadian dollars) on tickets and the stay at a hotel in Toronto for a month. Our flight from Pune was at 1:10pm on April 19 and we were to reach Delhi by 3:35pm. In Delhi, there was an eight-hour layover before the flight for Toronto at 12:05am.” Vaidya said though his wife and he had had valid RT-PCR reports for the trip to Delhi, the documents would have lapsed by a few hours for the travel from Delhi to Canada. “Tr1ouble started when Vistara representatives said the report would lapse for our trip to Canada. I told them that we would get tested at the Delhi airport. But I was told that such a facility was not available in Delhi,” Vaidya said. “The representatives suggested that we get tested in the departure area of the Pune airport. They, however, said it would take 24 hours for the report. We were not allowed to board the flight from Pune. I had to cancel my tickets for Canada. After returning home, I called the Delhi airport and was told that they have a testing unit and would provide an RT-PCR report within six-seven hours” he said. When contacted, a Vistara spokesperson said Vaidya himself refused to board the flight for Delhi. “Given the difficult times we are all facing, Vistara is committed to helping all our customers with factual and verified information while strictly adhering to all the guidelines and SOPs laid down by the authorities. In this case too, our teams had extended all the assistance and relevant information to the customers to ensure they are aware of the regulations that helped them take a well-informed decision,” the airline spokesperson told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/test-hurdle-forces-flyer-to-cancel-canada-trip/articleshow/82416375.cms||Joy Sengupta

The directive was issued by Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas after considering a petition by 92-year-old Kuriyedan Kuriyan of Aluva and his 86-year-old wife Saramma Kuriyan through advocate Terry V James. They had questioned the delay on the part of Ernakulam revenue divisional officer (RDO) in acting upon their application filed on June 25 for cancelling the transfer of property to their son Sabu Kuriyan. Through a settlement deed executed on June 21, 2018, Kuriyedan Kuriyan had transferred 4.99 cents of land and a portion of the house in favour of his son. However, the son has started treating the parents with contempt and has gone to the extent of even assaulting them, the petition said. Following this, the petitioners filed the application to the RDO to cancel the transfer of property as per Section 23 of Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007. The RDO has not taken any steps yet, the petition said. In the judgment, the court said, “Having regard to the objects and purpose of the Senior Citizens Act, it is essential that applications preferred by the senior citizens are disposed of in a time bound manner. Under no circumstances there can be any delay in disposing of such an application, as the same would destroy the very purpose of the statute. The summary procedure, contemplated under the statute is also included with a salutary purpose for an expeditious disposal of the application.” The court ordered Ernakulam RDO to consider the application expeditiously, at any rate within three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/senior-citizens-applications-must-be-heard-fast-rules-hc/articleshow/82416376.cms||---

The civic body in Kolhapur city, in order to effectively implement the janata curfew, has decided to create a mechanism to help citizens get essential goods at their doorsteps. Kadambari Balkawade, the civic administrator said: “We will release the contact numbers of all essential shops in the city through an app. Citizens can search for the shops in their localities and place orders. The shop operators can then home deliver the goods.”The janata curfew rules do not allow the vegetable mandis to operate. The KMC is planning to allow the vegetable vendors to sell their produce on mobile carts. “Most vendors have agreed to sell vegetables by going door-to-door using carts. They, however, have to ensure that social distancing is strictly followed,” said Balkawade.The district administration has decided not to let anyone out of their homes except for medical reasons. On Wednesday, the police were seen enforcing the restrictions.

The fight was to protect the right of equality of opportunities in education and government employment,” SMSN president Anil Lad had said. SMSN general secretary Devendra Jain said the apex court has clearly underlined that neither Gaikwad Commission nor the Bombay HC judgment has made out an extraordinary situation in the case of Marathas so as to exceed the ceiling of 50% reservation. “The backwardness among a section of Maratha community is economic. The Centre has already introduced quota for Economically Weaker Section (EWS) to take care of such elements and the same has been ratified by Maharashtra government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/good-for-meritorious-candidates-smsn/articleshow/82417953.cms||---

ACP Ajay Pal Lamba said since media reports prominently highlighted the issue, police did not find any person loitering in the city. “The message had reached all that if your unnecessary step out, you are endangering your life and those of others,” said Lamba. So far, 123 persons have been detained by police and sent to the quarantine facility in a housing complex taken care of by the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA). City police continue to barricade the city and reported limited movement of people. Those who were questioned by police had reasons which were on the exempted list. Total figures from the state were not known till last reports came. In Ajmer, insitutional quarantine turned out to be useful as 18 were detected Covid positive. The administration declared Khari Koi and Old Bakara Mandi outside Delhi Gate as a mini containment zone as the number of Covid patients increased in the area. Sources said those roaming on roads without work were turning out as Covid positive in quarantine centres. “Such situation is dangerous as this will not break the chain in the district,” said a doctor on duty. He said that positive asymptomatic patients were dangerous for spreading the infection in the city. Police in Jaisalmer district caught 44 people and sent them to a quarantine centre. Police have made a quarantine centre at the police lines for its personnel who test positive. Jaisalmer SP Ajay Singh said those roaming without work should be sent to quarantine centres and will be kept till the Covid report comes negative.

---||Nashik||O2 & ICU beds available in Dhule & Nandurbar||Nashik: Two more districts of north Maharashtra — Dhule and Nandurbar — now have vacant oxygen and ICU beds, indicating a dip in the Covid-19 curve in the two districts. Jalgaon district was the first district in the region to have vacant beds with oxygen two weeks ago. Around 300 patients from Madhya Pradesh are currently undergoing treatment at Jalgaon hospitals. Dhule and Nandurbar have 3,165 and 6,738 active cases, respectively. Vishal Patil, the Dhule district’s Covid coordinator, said of the 7,870 Covid beds, over 6,824 beds, including 1,008 oxygen beds and 30 ICU beds, are vacant at present. About a month ago the scenario of Covid bed availability, was grim in the district. “The flow of symptomatic patients in various Covid facilities within our district has reduced. The recovery rate has crossed over 91% and the positivity rate is around 9%. The pandemic curve has dipped in Dhule,” he said, adding that the health authorities will continue to keep their vigil in the district. Speaking on beds available, he said 70 patients from Nashik, Malegaon etc are currently admitted in Covid hospitals. Nandurbar civil surgeon Raghunath Bhoye said the district civil hospital, which is one of the major Covid facilities in the district, has around 15 beds with oxygen vacant. “There has been a constant drop in daily cases in the district over a fortnight. The caseload in the district has dropped by over 15%,” said Bhoye. “Since beds are available in Nandurbar, we can accommodate Covid patients from other districts. At present, 550 patients from other districts are undergoing treatment in various Covid facilities in the district,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/o2-icu-beds-available-in-dhule-nandurbar/articleshow/82413107.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The complaint number launched on April 1 has seen around 955 complaints from all across the city till May 4. The complaint is then forwarded to the office group where engineers from that area can act on it. Majority of the complaints are coming from Sanganer and Jhotwara areas. PHED additional chief engineer Manish Beniwal said, “This has been really helpful as people would call up the department landline number where the operator would sometimes take the call. Now, the WhatsApp message is saved along with the location so that an officer can take it up. We have made sure that the complaints are resolved in a day.” Officials said people are also sending their entire complaint application on WhatsApp. Majority of these complaints are for low water pressure, leakage, pollution and irregular supply. With rising population in the city, lines laid down decades ago are not able to sustain it any longer. Water pressure in the pipelines have gone down due to which complaints are rising.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/over-900-water-complaints-received-through-whatsapp/articleshow/82417965.cms||---

Sudhir Gangurde, an agriculture officer from the state prisons department, registered an FIR with the Yerawada police on Tuesday. In the FIR, Gangurde said he was informed about the theft by the garden supervisor, Sarika Daundkar, on April 25 morning. The trees had grown on their own in a 17-acre field behind the Jail Officers Training Institute (JOTI) on Ahmednagar Road. Jail staffers were aware of the value of these trees aged between 15-20 years. “Guards maintain vigil when inmates are working in the fields between 8am and 4pm. Once the inmates return to the women’s jail, there is no security. Secondly, there is no movement of JOTI staffers, as the institute is closed due to the Covid-19,” Gangurde told TOI. He said, “We suspect that the thieves took an advantage of the situation and entered the field by either scaling the compound wall behind JOTI or from the commerce zone side. They must’ve used the same route to escape after chopping the trees with sharp cutters.” Inspector Yunus Shaikh from the Yerawada police on Wednesday said the police were checking criminals on record involved in sandalwood theft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-sandalwood-trees-stolen-from-open-jail-in-yerawada/articleshow/82416409.cms||Asseem Shaikh

These units will cater to the recovered patients, who were critical. NMC doctors will check the health of the recovered patients and guide them as per the health conditions. “This facility will be to keep an eye on the health of the patients, who were in serious condition and now have recovered. Our doctors at the centres will check whether the patients have any side effects post-Covid. Doctors will guide them about the measures and precautions they have to take,” said Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav “The side effects on the liver, kidney and even on eyes of the patients post-Covid cannot be ruled out due to use of heavy doses during the treatment on patients in serious condition. Hence, our objective is to ensure patients are fine after recovering from Covid,” he said. The post-Covid health check-up centres will be set up at the NMC’s at its urban primary health centres (UPHCs) after the fresh cases drop below 500 cases daily or when the active cases reduce below 5,000, he said. Last year also, the NMC had opened a post-Covid care centre at the NMC managed Zakir Hussain hospital and it had received a good response. The centre was closed in January after the drop in new cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-plans-to-start-post-covid-care-centres/articleshow/82413123.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: SC verdict gives parents ammo to seek fee waiver the current yr||JAIPUR: The Supreme Court’s Monday order observing that educational institutions must reduce the fees as their running cost had come down has given the much-needed ammo to parents’ association batting for a waiver in fees in the current session. The observation was part of the judgment by the apex court directing the private unaided schools to charge 85% of the annual school fees of 2019-20 for 2020-21. The court said, “Insisting for payments for facilities not provided to students would amount to profiteering, which must be avoided by the schools.” The court has also observed that the state doesn’t have any say in the fees fixation since the fee regulation act 2016 is in place in Rajasthan. Reacting to the judgment, Abhishek Jain Bittu, spokesperson, Sanyukta Abhibhavak Sangh Rajasthan, said that since the Supreme Court has cleared that fees should be fixed as per the Rajasthan Fees Act 2016, every school must first form the fee committee of 10 members. “They should fix the fees first for the online classes considering that their variable cost — power, water and maintenance cost must be low. Thereafter they should fix the fees for offline classes if at all, which happens in the present session. Else it would be contempt of the Supreme Court order,” said Bittu. The act directs every school to form a 10-member committee including five parents, three teachers, a principal and one member from the school management committee. The committee is empowered to fix the fees considering the revenue, expenses and other indicators into account. Ironically, in the majority of the 33,500 private unaided schools the fees committee exists only on paper. Society for Unaided Private Schools in Rajasthan president Damodar Goyal called that interpretation of the apex court observation ‘casual’. “The honourable Supreme Court has presumed that schools must have not incurred some expenses on account of physical closure of schools and therefore to put an end to the controversy it has ordered for a 15% rebate as a one-time measure. But at the same time, it has approved education imparted through digital mode,” said Goyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sc-verdict-gives-parents-ammo-to-seek-fee-waiver-the-current-yr/articleshow/82417982.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Stop ‘roving probe’ on Waze reinstatement, Maharashtra tells HC||Mumbai: Maharashtra government has filed a petition before the Bombay HC against the CBI to bar any probe or ‘roving inquiry’ into Sachin Waze’s reinstatement and the cases entrusted to him. The state wants the HC to quash two paragraphs from the FIR against former home minister Anil Deshmukh that refer to Waze’s reinstatement as assistant police inspector last year, him being assigned most of the ‘sensational cases’, and alleged ‘exercise of undue influence’ over transfers and postings and hence, over performance of police officers’ duties. The FIR is “clearly intended to carry out a fishing-and- roving inquiry into the administration of the state in order to find out some material enabling political grounds that are presently not in power in the state to try and destabilise’’ the state government led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the state added in the petition. The HC will hear the plea on Thursday. The FIR had invoked Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act) and Section 120B of Indian Penal Code for criminal conspiracy. The CBI had registered the case after the HC, on April 5, directed it to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the allegations of corrupt malpractices made by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh against Deshmukh, as annexed in a complaint filed on March 21 by advocate Jaishri Patil with Malabar Hill police. Singh had, in an eight-page letter to Thackeray on March 20, alleged that Deshmukh met with subordinate police officers, including Waze, in February and asked them to mobilise Rs 100 crore per month from bars, restaurants, hotels and other establishments. Deshmukh had denied the allegations. The state claimed that the FIR exceeded the “limits permitted’’ by the HC in its direction, and was “mala fide’’. It added that “two unnumbered” paragraphs were “wholly illegal and unauthorised’’ and the probe must be halted on them. The paragraphs stated: “Enquiry has revealed that Sachin Waze API, Mumbai police had been reinstated …after being off the police service for more than 15 years. Enquiry further revealed that Waze was entrusted with most of the sensational and important cases of Mumbai city police and that the then home minister was in knowledge of the fact.’’ “Deshmukh and others exercised undue influence over transfer and postings of officials and thereby exercising undue influence over the performance of duties by the officials.’’ The state said it is “most strange and shocking that the person who is responsible or who has himself done various acts…” mentioned in these paragraphs relating to Waze “is not made an accused though a person who is allegedly in knowledge of the said fact is made an accused’’. “This aspect speaks volumes of the independence and fairness’’ that the HC expected from the CBI. The state said the “CBI has no authority’’ to register an FIR regarding ‘transfer and postings” as alleged. The HC had permitted the CBI inquiry into Singh’s letter and not into his petition and the letter makes no allegations regarding transfer and postings of officials, Waze’s reinstatement or the cases entrusted to him, said the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/stop-roving-probe-on-waze-reinstatement-maharashtra-tells-hc/articleshow/82419245.cms||---

From barricading all entry and exit points to digging the main road connecting the villages and from suspending all community events indefinitely to imposing penalties for moving out without any reason are measures taken by the villagers in districts like Nagaur, Sikar, Pali, Dungarpur and Banswara. Three villages in Dungarpur such as Aobri, Chitri and Badi have introduced self-imposed 10-day lockdown to control the cases from May 4-14. They have approached the SDM office and informed them of their decision to ensure cooperation from them if required. “The lockdown means zero mobility and those found to be loitering without any reason will be fined as per the gram panchayat rules. Shops like medical stores will be opened during the day,” said village development officer Manoj Swarankar. Dungarpur collector Suresh Ola said that the trend is picking up in the villages after many of them have had experienced several cases. “The effort being made by these villages is a step towards fighting the common enemy of Covid-19. The administration is supporting them in the cause,” said Joshi. The fear of spread is so high that some villages are ending up blurring the line between legal and illegal. Arniya village in Talwara Gram Panchayat, Banswara, the villagers have spread the dry grass on the village road connecting the main road. “Our village has a famous temple of Moti Mataji which attracts people who are physically disabled from far-flung areas. The Covid appropriate behaviour becomes impossible to follow is a major reason to block the road. We had informed the police of the crowd assembling the village but they failed to prevent them has left with no option to take this extreme step,” said Jaiteng Bhai, Sarpanch, Arniya Village. Similarly, villages in others districts have resorted to self-restrictions as in the second wave villagers have recorded positive cases.

In the next few days, 44 more such patients are likely to be shifted to other hospitals as AIIMS-R officials look to ramp up the hospital’s oxygen supply infrastructure. “We could process 6,500 litres of usable medical oxygen from our concentrators on Wednesday as against usual capacity of 4,000 litres. We are making attempts to increase our medical oxygen output and to ensure a smooth process, we are reducing our caseload by shifting some patients to other facilities,” a senior doctor at AIIMS told TOI. At present, AIIMS-R is catering to around 650 Covid-19 patients, out of which 580 have been provided with oxygen support. Given the high count of patients in the facility, AIIMS-R officials have sought three days from the local administration to ensure that the oxygen supply in the hospital is ramped upfrom 4,000 litres to 10,000 litres. Dr Ravikant, AIIMS-R director, told TOI, “On Wednesday, we processed 2,500 more litres of medical oxygen than our usual capacity. However, if we go on like this, our supply chain will collapse. Therefore, we have urged the district administration to move some patients to other hospitals temporarily so that we can ramp up our oxygen production to 10,000 litres per day.” The hospital authorities are in contact with a Pune-based firm that will increase oxygen supply points. “After we are done with this upgrade, we will take back the patients shifted temporarily. Besides, we will be in a position to admit 100 more patients on oxygen support,” added Dr Ravikant. Not just AIIMS-R but several other big Covid-19 healthcare facilities in the state are facing a similar oxygen supply crisis. Dr Mahesh Kuriyal from Dehradun’s CMI Hospital told TOI that the hospital is currently stretched to its maximum capacity. “We have 60 beds with oxygen support. Due to the high caseload, we are filling our concentrators twice daily. This is three times the demand we usually cater to. Our oxygen supply and distribution will be hit if we get a couple of more cases,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/to-ramp-up-its-medical-oxygen-output-aiims-r-shifts-six-covid-patients-to-other-hosps/articleshow/82414830.cms||Ishita Mishra

Simarpreet Kaur Dhillon was caught red-handed by a flying squad of vigilance bureau while allegedly accepting Rs 25,000 from an Anandpur Sahib-based stone crusher owner. She, Pala Singh, a mining guard, and Amanpreet Singh, a clerk, were arrested from the mining office in Industrial Area, Phase VII. She is in police remand. Dhillon was holding additional charge of mining officer of Ropar. She allegedly used to take money monthly to allow illegal crushers. A vigilance officer said, “We have learnt that she used to collect Rs 15,000 to Rs 50,000 on monthly basis through two of her helpers. She has made property worth crores out of the illegal gratifications.” A vigilance officer said she has accused some high-ranked mining department officers of being hand in glove with her in taking bribes from stone crusher owners. In 2018, Simarpreet Dhillon had made news after lodging a police complaint against then general manager of the industries department, Tehal Singh Sekhon, for allegedly misbehaving with her. The complaint later turned out to be false. Dhillon had allegedly exposed many officers of the mining department for being involved in corrupt practices, from taking bribes to forcing lower ranked employees to pay for not taking action against them. However, all her claims later turned false. On the other hand after her arrest, Ropar MLA Amarjeet Singh Sandoa claimed that in the past three years, he wrote at least 10 letters to the authorities concerned, including the chief minister, complaining about the rampant corruption by the officer, but no action was taken against her. She was booked under Sections 13 and 7, 7(a) of Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 on the complaint Baljinder Singh at the Vigilance Bureau Police Station in Mohali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/whistleblower-once-bribe-accused-now/articleshow/82414812.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Kolkata||Scamsters cash in on oxygen crisis to cheat those in need||Kolkata: Taking advantage of the oxygen crisis in the city, scammers are posing as oxygen suppliers and duping Covid patients and their kin by asking them to make advance payments to get it delivered at their houses. Officers of Kolkata Police’s bank fraud department said they have been receiving multiple complaints daily over the last one week and they are on the job to track the fraudsters. Sharing her ordeal with TOI, Pradiptaa Paul, a management professional with an Irish multinational, said that on May 3, she was desperately searching for an oxygen cylinder after the family doctor asked her to put her father (69), a Covid patient, on oxygen support at home. Paul and her mother are also suffering from the virus and isolated at their home in Kasba. “My father’s oxygen saturation level had been dipping sharply and I was desperately searching for oxygen when one of my friends sent me a number, saying it was a “verified” oxygen dealer. So, I called him. The man said he could deliver a 25-litre oxygen jar that would cost Rs 7,500 and asked for advance payment. I sent him the money over UPI,” said Paul. Shortly after the man called her to say that the 25-litre cylinder was not available and that he had a 50-litre cylinder, for which she would have to pay another 7,500. “I was too desperate to doubt the man’s intention. I didn’t even check the photo ID proof that he had sent to me. Later, I found it to be photoshopped and it had a Madhya Pradesh address. I paid the money but the cylinder never came. I called the man after some time when he demanded Rs 15,000 more and I realised I was being duped,” said Paul. Later some calls were made but the man was unavailable on phone. After some time, some of Paul’s friends called the man, posing as oxygen seekers and he quoted different amounts and different locations to them. Paul lodged a complaint with Kasba police. “The officer-in-charge of Kasba police station offered to help me and sent a cylinder of oxygen to my home for free,” said Paul. Similar complaints of fraud were also reported from Ultadanga, said an officer of Kolkata Police’s bank fraud department said. A Covid patient in home isolation was allegedly duped of Rs 10,500 as he made an advance payment for an oxygen cylinder but never received it. Cops hinted at an inter-state gang of scammers who have been floating their numbers over social media with verified hashtags, posing as genuine oxygen suppliers and then duping people. Some Covid patients alleged that the scamming is not only limited to oxygen supply but also it is happening for swab collection for RT-PCR tests at home. “My aunt and her entire family have been down with Covid symptoms for more than a week now. Around six days ago, I had contacted a person for home swab collection. The man came and collected Rs 5,600 to collect the swabs of three persons but he didn’t give any receipt. Six days have past but we still haven’t received the test reports. The man has kept his phone switched off,” said Subhasree Basu, a resident of Jadavpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/scamsters-cash-in-on-oxygen-crisis-to-cheat-those-in-need/articleshow/82416472.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Nagpur||O2 tankers fly to Odisha, to return by rail||Nagpur: A co-ordinated move between state and central agencies on Wednesday saw an Indian Air Force (IAF) military transport carrier IL-76MD ‘Gajraj’ taking off with four empty tankers to bring at least 60 metric tonnes of oxygen from a steel plan in Angul (Odisha). The tankers will return by rail — 2nd Oxygen Express — to Nagpur within two days. On Thursday, another four tankers are being sent. The IAF plane will land in Bhubaneshwar and the tankers will drive down another 100 kms to Angul. The 60 MT oxygen would be enough to cater to the current needs of at least Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Bhandara, Gondia and Wardha. A couple of days ago, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court had asked the Nagpur district collector Ravindra Thakre to explore possibilities of airlifting tankers. In another move, a committee with 28 teams has been formed under Thakare. Its been tasked to inspect the oxygen supply lines and distribution channels at 148 Covid hospitals and other facilities in the district following the court order for an ‘oxygen audit’. Thakare said it was a historic moment made possible by seamless co-ordination of district, state and Centre’s officers. “We had to seek a second source of oxygen other than Bhilai and the option of Angul was being explored for some time now,” he said. Sources informed that former Nagpur district collector Ashwin Mudgal, who is now the nodal officer for oxygen movement in the state, Food and Drugs Administrative commissioner Parimal Singh, transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne, commissioner of skill development Shrikant Singh and others helped Nagpur division get the aircraft. These officers sought the defence ministry’s help as tankers would have taken 50-60 hours to drive down from Angul. Nagpur was forced to look for alternatives to Bhilai steel plant for oxygen as the demand in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh too had gone up. “Two days back, nine tankers from Nagpur were in the queue at Bhilai when filling up stopped due to maintenance work at the plant. Only four could be filled up. This was the trigger to look for other sources,” said a senior district official. The situation was somewhat salvaged as Rourkela’s steel plant sent 40 MT oxygen to Nagpur division on Wednesday. Nagpur division, with its six districts, has a demand of around 240-250 MT of oxygen. Nagpur district’s requirement is around 180-200 MT which is catered by Inox and other air-separation units with a generation of 190MT. Official sources said the oxygen requirement is being managed at present with cases going down and options of sourcing increasing especially with the contributions of leading transporter Pyare Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/o2-tankers-fly-to-odisha-to-return-by-rail/articleshow/82418157.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Goa||Goa: After Bondla Zoo, wildlife sanctuaries shut for public||PONDA: After the closure of the state’s lone Bondla Zoo from Saturday, the state government has issued an order to close all six wildlife sanctuaries and national parks in Goa for public visits from Friday to curb the potential spread of coronavirus among wild animals. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, who is also holding the forest portfolio, has approved the forest department’s decision on late Wednesday. The decision follows the central government advisory that has been issued on Friday. Through the advisory, the Union ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has ordered closure of all sanctuaries, national parks and other protected areas across the nation with immediate effect till further orders. Central government’s report confirming death of an Asiatic lion by Covid-19 has prompted the advisory, state forest officials. Santosh Kumar, the additional principal chief conservator of forest (APCCF) and chief wildlife warden told TOI that the government has approved the decision to close all six wildlife sanctuaries and national parks in Goa for public visits from Friday as an immediate preventive measure. Goa State Executive Committee on Pandemic on Monday had suggested the wildlife forest department to seek government approval regarding closure of wildlife sanctuaries/national parks in Goa to shut them with immediate effect. The six sanctuaries spread across 755.31 sq kms, includes Bhagwan Mahavir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary in Mollem-Dharbandora, Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary in Sanguem, Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary in Canacona, Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary in Ponda, Dr Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary in Chorao-Tiswadi and Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in Sattari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-bondla-zoo-wildlife-sanctuaries-shut-for-public/articleshow/82418100.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

---||Mumbai||Verdict on 50% limit may impact EWS quota||New Delhi: The SC on Wednesday refused to re-examine its 1992 verdict which put a cap of 50 percent on quota, turning down the plea made by various states that the ceiling fixed by court be scrapped. The verdict may have implications on reservation to economically weaker sections (EWS), which also breaches the 50% rule and the matter is pending before SC. Almost all the state governments put up a united front before the apex court to press for removal of the cap. The bench, however, stood firm, holding that that the 50% cap can be breached only in extraordinary and exceptional cases. “What was held by the Constitution Bench in Indra Sawhney case on the relevance and significance of the principle of stare decisis clearly binds us. The judgment of Indra Sawhney has stood the test of the time and has never been doubted by any judgment of this court. The Constitution Bench judgment of this court in Indra Sawhney neither needs to be revisited nor referred to a larger Bench for consideration,” the bench said while rejecting the plea of state governments, including that of Maharashtra, for referring the issue to a 11-judge bench. “There can be no quarrel that society changes, law changes, people change but that does not mean that something which is good and proven to be beneficial in maintaining equality in the society should also be changed in the name of change alone,” the court said as it rejected the plea that the changed dynamics of society warranted that the 50% quota was scrapped. Reminding governments that the reservation route is not the only way to bring marginalised sections in national mainstream, the court said, “Providing reservation for advancement of any socially and educationally backward class in public services is not the only means and method for improving the welfare of backward class. The state ought to bring other measures including providing educational facilities to the members of backward class free of cost, giving concession in fee, providing opportunities for skill development to enable the candidates from the backward class to be self-reliant.” The Supreme Court also held that the President should, after due consultation with the Commission set up under Article 338B expeditiously, publish a comprehensive list under 342A(1). Article 338B deals with the structure, duties and powers of the National Commission for Backward Classes and 342A with power of the President to notify a particular caste as SEBC and power of Parliament to change the list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/verdict-on-50-limit-may-impact-ews-quota/articleshow/82418116.cms||---

---||Nashik||150 more Covid beds to be added in Nashik civil hosp||Nashik: The Nashik Civil Hospital will add 150 more Covid beds for the people from rural areas of the district, said Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare on Wednesday. “The civil hospital currently has 200 covid beds and the number will increase to 350 so that the people coming from the rural areas, which have very few dedicated Covid hospitals, will be able to get treatment on priority,” said Mandhare. He said the supply of the oxygen required for the additional beds has been arranged and this will make the process of treating patients smooth. The collector had a meeting with the officials over the issue and has directed them to use oxygen judiciously to ensure minimal wastage of the same. He asked the authorities to ensure ventilators, oxygen concentrators and planned oxygen generation projects at Government Covid Hospital in the district were installed and made operational at the earliest. “We have asked the Public Works Department (PWD) officials to make the necessary changes for the 150 beds wards and have asked the civil surgeon to follow up on the measures related to the emergency exit and shifting in case of a fire breaks out. A fire mock drill is likely to be conducted in the next couple of days to ensure everybody understands their role,” he said. After inspecting the district general hospital, Mandhare visited Deola and Satana talukas and took stock of the Covid situation. He said the oxygen supply to all the dedicated Covid health centres (DCHCs) and dispensaries should be audited and the supply of oxygen to the patients should be maintained as prescribed. Similarly, all medical officers and doctors should ensure Remdesivir injections are used with proper care. He has also instructed the sub-divisional officers and tehsildars to control the use of oxygen and remedial injections properly. Traffic restrictions in city Police commissioner Deepak Pandey has imposed traffic restrictions in old city areas from Wednesday. The restrictions are applicable from 7 am to 11 am will be in place till May 15.

---||Hyderabad||Dewan committee mooted disputed land’s regularisation||Hyderabad: Much before the four-member IAS officers’ committee which has been asked to look into alleged encroachment of endowments land worth thousands of crores, the TK Dewan Committee had suggested regularisation of controversial lands by collecting penal amounts from farmers. The Dewan committee said though it had suggested regularisation, it was not feasible if the lands were treated as endowments lands as the high court had imposed a ban on regularisation of endowment lands. The committee of then chief commissioner of land administration TK Dewan, was constituted by the former Congress government in 2006. The one-man committee said, “Farmers have been cultivating these lands from a long time with revenue entries in their favour from as early as 1954 in some cases and 1944 in some other cases. To mitigate their difficulties, a compromise solution on the lines of regularisation is the only option. At the same time, it will provide benefit to the endowments institution by way of a substantial corpus fund.” The officers at that time had said that a policy decision needed to be taken by the government by fixing the amount for one-time settlement and revoke the prohibition on transactions on the land under section 22A of Registrations Act. After Dewan’s transfer, another IAS officer who was CCLA A Raghotham Rao took over and concluded the inquiry a year later. The enquiry officer held several meetings with rythu samakhya members, collector and joint collector of Rangareddy district. The issue remained unresolved due to elections and subsequent demise of then CM YS Rajasekhara Reddy. “In view of the long-standing revenue record entries since 1944 and 1954-55, a compromise settlement which takes care of both the parties i.e, private persons and the endowments institution may perhaps be attempted. The proposals may be submitted to the high court for prior permission in case the government takes a decision to resolve this long-pending issue which has been causing hardship to many farmers,” the report said. “The problem is both revenue and endowments departments have conflicting entries in the revenue records at different points of time and it is not easy to resolve the issue easily,” a senior revenue official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dewan-committee-mooted-disputed-lands-regularisation/articleshow/82418118.cms||Koride Mahesh

This number, though higher than 23 of this age group who died in August-September last year, which was peak of the first wave, is substantially lower in percentage terms. As per data from Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), 3.46% of total 1,098 deceased were below 30 years in March and April (second wave). The comparable figure forthis age group in peak of first wave was 5.21% of total 441 who died then. However, it was just one (1.22%) of 82 deaths in January and February that can be considered typical months of first wave. Of total fatalities, 59.26% deaths were recorded in last two months alone. Rise in deaths is high in 31-50 years age group in second wave. 324 or 29.51% deceased were from this age group in March and April whereas it was 16 (19.51%) in January and February and 104 (23.58%) in August and September last year. There is decline in mortality in among above 51 years group in second wave. 736 (67.03%) deceased were from this age group in March and April whereas it was 65 (79.27%) in January and February and 314 (71.2%) in August and September last year. 520 (47.36%) patients have passed away within 48 hours of hospitalization in March and April. The number was 25 (30.49%) in January and February. 593 (54%) deceased had no comorbidities (292) or not diagnosed for comorbidities (301) during hospitalization in last two months. Remaining 505 (46%) deceased were comorbid. The number of non-comorbid or undiagnosed deceased was 37 (45.12%) in January and February. Intensivist Dr Nikhil Balankhe told TOI, “Decline in deaths in above 51 years age group might be due to vaccination which can be thoroughly claimed after next couple of months. Large number of people above 60 years and 45-plus with comorbidities have taken the jab since March 1. Every eligible person should take vaccine not fearing fever or some bodyache that are common after any immunization.” Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, “The disease was virulent due to mutation in second wave. Many non-comorbid and young people died due to misconception that the disease was not deadly for them as they witnessed in first wave. They tolerated symptoms for longer time, tested late, tried treatment in home and came to hospital at critical stages. A few couldn’t get treatment as there was severe shortage of medicines.” Dr Shinde added second wave was an eye opener. “Testing should be done as soon as symptoms are noticed irrespective of any age. Consult doctor immediately after testing positive,” he said. Nagpur rural registered 1,853 deaths between March 2020 and April this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/many-more-under-30s-died-in-rural-areas-but-age-less-than-1st-wave-peak/articleshow/82416492.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The Faraskhana police identified the deceased as Sameer Sayyed (48). Senior inspector Rajendra Landge of the Faraskhana police said, “We have arrested externed criminal Pravin Mahajan (36) in the case. He stabbed Sayyed in the stomach and also assaulted him on his neck, shoulders, chest and head before fleeing.” Police said Mahajan was externed from Pune district limits for two years in 2020. “He, however, breached the externment order and came to Pune city from Satara,” Landge said. The police said the assault and murder occurred near Shri Krishna Talkies off Laxmi Road. “Sayyed used to chat with local residents at the spot regularly to get information,” the police said. “It was during this time that Mahajan walked up to him and argued with him. Sayyad asked Mahajan to move away and this enraged the latter,” Landge said, adding, “Mahajan pulled out a long sharp weapon and assaulted Sayyed. Sayyed collapsed on the road and local residents raised an alarm. He was rushed to a hospital in Rashta Peth where he breathed his last.” The beat marshals of the Faraskhana police searched the area and nabbed Mahajan within an hour. Sayyed is survived by his wife, two children and mother. “Mahajan was previously arrested in cases of attempted murder, assault and robberies. He has been named accused in a total of nine cases,” Landge said.

Going by the current allocations, the shortage may continue in May and June, the CS said. Vaccine supply is now under the domain of the Centre, which allocates to the states. Though one of the vaccine manufacturer is in Hyderabad, the allocation has to be done by the Centre. “The chief minister also wrote to the Centre for more allocation and even we tried to speak to vaccine manufacturers in other countries,” he said. The government planned to vaccinate people aged between 18 and 44 years from May 1. “For 1.70 crore population of that age group, we need 3.40 crore doses (two doses). Due to non-availability of the stocks, the government is continuing vaccination programmes only for those aged above 45,” Somesh Kumar said. He said the government has stopped walk-in vaccination due to short supplies. “This is because shortage of vaccines and heavy rush at the government hospitals and PHCs where there are chances of further spread of the coronavirus cases.

The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) decided to replace the tar road with that of concrete after an inspection last year.An MSRDC official said, “The underpass was opened for traffic recently following an inspection by MSRDC and Pune Municipal Corporation officials.” Regular commuters said it was good that the work had been completed before the monsoon. Sanjay Mehta, who uses the grade separator often, said, “We can now hope for a bump-free ride. The facility never had a good road inside. There was also constant water leakage, which was posing a huge risk to motorists. The officials must ensure regular maintenance of the road.” Vaishali Shirke, another commuter, said the officials concerned must ensure proper lighting inside the grade separator and clean the water channels often. The MSRDC has not incurred any additional expenses as the work has been done within the defect liability period.

The status, approved at a virtual cabinet meeting chaired by the CM, will apply to oxygen production units with a minimum capacity of 700 cylinders per day equivalent to 5 MT, oxygen cylinder manufacturers, oxygen concentrator manufacturing units. Oxygen refilling units will not be covered by the special status.With this decision, the units (both old and new) will become eligible for 100% exemption from change of land use (CLU), external development charges (EDC), property tax, electricity duty, stamp duty and investment subsidy, by way of reimbursement of GST up to 125% of fixed capital investment made in the land and machinery. The status of the thrust sector to oxygen production units has been conferred under clause 10.6 of Chapter-10 of Industrial & Business Development Policy, 2017 and subsequently as per clause 2.22 of Detailed Schemes and Operational Guidelines, 2018. For the week ending May 4, the state had an average positivity rate of 11.6%, with CFR of 2.1%, from a sample size of 74 lakh. Oxygen allocation at 195 MT At present, the daily oxygen allocation to Punjab stands at 195 MT from outside the state. This includes Inox plant at Baddi (60 MT), Air Liquide plant at Panipat (20 MT), Air Liquide plant at Roorkee (15 MT), Linde plant at Dehradun (10 MT) and Inox plant at Bokaro (90 MT). However, only 140 MT is actually being supplied from these plants on a daily basis, with shortage of tankers hampering lifting of oxygen, especially from Bokaro. Two additional tankers made available by IOC have been unutilised due to technical issues. Further, despite repeated requests, Linde & Air Liquide are not releasing their committed quota. The cabinet was informed that other states had also created problems in supplies from the plants in their jurisdiction. The plants have also had issues of tripping and power outages leading to supply disruptions and delays.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-crisis-punjab-nod-to-thrust-sector-status-for-oxygen-units/articleshow/82420792.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Only Prez can identify SEBCs, states can’t: SC||New Delhi: In a decision which could have wider ramifications, the SC by a majority declared that only the President (read the Centre) can take decisions for declaring socially and educationally backward communities for granting reservation and upheld the 102nd constitutional amendment denuding the power of states in this regard. The five-judge Constitution bench was unanimous on the validity of the 102nd constitutional amendment but the judges differed on the implication of the amendment for recognising socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs). The majority concluded the amendment has taken away the power of states to decide on designating SEBCs and now only the President can take a decision. However, Justices Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer held that states can also identify SEBCs for granting reservation in their respective territories and there would be two lists--Central and State lists--of backward communities as has been the practice for the last 68 years. State governments of all stripes have been expanding the list of SEBCs, the official jargon for OBC status which entitles the recipient community to quota benefits, and the verdict means they will now be without an important tool and will be restricted to make recommendations to the Centre. The response of the Centre could be interesting. It had maintained before court that the amendment had not altered any arrangement and states will continue to have the power to decide SEBCs. It had said the power to identify SEBCs lies with Parliament only with reference to the Central list and states can have a separate lists of SEBCs for reservation. But the majority of the bench felt otherwise. With the verdict holding states will have no power, there will be only a Central list of backward communities and states can grant reservation only to communities mentioned in it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/only-prez-can-identify-sebcs-states-cant-sc/articleshow/82418193.cms||---

---||Patna||Seven held, 448 vehicles seized on first day of lockdown in Bihar||PATNA: Seven persons were arrested while police seized 448 vehicles and imposed Rs7.97 lakh fine for violation of the guidelines on the first day of the 11-day lockdown enforced in the state from Wednesday to break the chain in the second wave of Covid-19. Five FIRs were also lodged against the violators, ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said. Polie personnel were seen on the roads to ensure that people don’t roam around without purpose and shops dealing in essential items down their shutters at 11am sharp. The district magistrates and superintendents of police of almost all the districts were on the road with their subordinates to ensure strict enforcement of the lockdown. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh and SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma personally stopped several motorists to ask their purpose of moving around. Those who did not have any convincing answers had to pay fine. They inspected several checkpoints across the main city to ensure that lockdown was enforced properly. Amid the presence of these officers, police didn’t hesitate from swinging the baton on those who had come on the road just to see the impact of lockdown. Stern checking was conducted on all the roundabouts and turning points across the state capital. Only those who had a valid reason or were going to visit a doctor, hospital, clinic or any diagnostic centre for patients were allowed to move on. It was the same situation in all the district headquarters across the state where the senior most officers were spotted inspecting the checkpoints on the roads. DMs, SSPs and SPs also had inter-district level virtual meetings with their civil and police administration subordinates on Wednesday. Prior to this, chief secretary Tripurari Sharan, in a virtual meeting on Tuesday, had ordered all the DMs and SPs to ensure that lockdown gets enforced sternly. Meanwhile, the state police headquarters has also mobilised a large number of forces, including companies of Bihar Special Armed Police (erstwhile known as BMP), with directions that lockdown must be enforced in rural areas as well with equal intensity. ADG Jitendra said Patna alone has been provided with four companies of armed police forces for enforcing regulations and lockdown. “Several other districts have also been provided with additional forces for the purpose. Directions have been issued to cancel all leave and call the police personnel on duty amid the present scenario,” he said. He said leave would be granted only in special cases. He said all the SPs and SSPs have been directed to withdraw police personnel engaged in desk job and deploy them in the fields. “They have been asked to make teams for ensuring social distancing and cracking down on violators, especially between 7am and 11am when shops have been allowed to remain open,” the ADG said. Altogether Rs1.63 lakh fine was realised separately from 3,274 people for not wearing masks in the last 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/7-held-448-vehicles-seized-on-first-day-of-lockdown-in-state/articleshow/82416540.cms||Debashish Karmakar

As per the model, the state will start seeing a flattening of the curve from around June 21 while the peak will continue from around May 12 to May 20. “Telangana is more or less moving as per the projected trajectory,” said IIT Kanpur’s Professor Manidra Agarwal who shared the computational model. The model predicts that case load in Telangana will start coming down from May 20. The fall of cases, as per the model, will not be drastic and will take almost a month before the curve starts flattening, from around June 21. The team of professors from IIT Kanpur and Hyderabad have made these predictions as per the revised estimated for states in the past few days. Interestingly, Telangana has already touched the 10,000 daily cases mark — 10,122 last Monday which was the highest single-day surge since the pandemic outbreak. The number was higher than the predicted peak for Telangana. However, after touching the 10,000 mark, the daily case numbers in the state have been around the 6,500 to 8,000 cases-mark. The daily case load in the first week of this month is corresponding with the number given by the state health department. As per the numbers given by the health department, Mulugu has the distinction of reporting the lowest number of Covid-19 cases in the entire state during the second wave. The district only reported 21 cases on May 2. Apart from Mulugu, 17 other districts have reported below 100 Covid-19 cases per day this week. These include Narayanpet, Medak, Nirmal, Jangaon, Jayashankar Bhupalpally, Kumaram Bheem Asifabad and Jogulamba Gadwal, giving an indication that the caseload is dipping in some parts of the state.Mulugu has not only reported the lowest number of daily cases in a single day, but has consistently had a daily case count of below 50.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ts-covid-curve-to-flatten-from-june-21-iit-model/articleshow/82417881.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Nashik||Healthcare experts tell medical students to have positive attitude||Nashik: Two towering personalities in healthcare — senior social worker, psychiatrist and Ramon Magsaysay awardee Dr Bharat Vatwani and cardiologist Dr Vijay Surase — on Wednesday advised medical students to maintain a life-long attitude of positivity to ensure that they are not only successful but are socially acknowledged for their work. The two doctors addressed the medical students at a workshop on Covid-19 organised by the Maharashtra University Health Sciences (MUHS) on Wednesday. Vice-Chancellor in-charge Nitin Karmalkar, registrar Kalidas Chavan and others were present during the session. Addressing the students on the topic of “Social Consciousness of Medical Students”, Dr Vatwani, recognised for treating mentally-ill people on the streets through his organisation Shraddha, underlined the need for each one to develop empathy — not only to treat the patients, but to also spread positivity.“It is an opportunity for those in the medical and social work fields to reach out to the last man. Students, medicos and everyone should work towards the wellbeing of humans,” Dr Vatwani said. He added that after the current Covid crisis is over, the society would be facing a huge problem — of socially, mentally and economically disturbed people. “It will be a long-drawn battle that can be won only by spreading positivity,” he said.Dr Surase, speaking on the topic of ‘Crisis Time – With Restraint to Future’, said the effects of Covid-19 would diminish in the near future and urged the students not to pay heed to baseless information flooding social media. “In crisis times, intellectual strategies have to be drawn and implemented,” Dr Surase said. He reminded the students that they need to feel indebted to the patients. “They are the ones who test your knowledge, skills and allow you to improvise. Because patients come to you, you will gain name and fame. Practice good bedside manner and ensure you treat every human being humanely.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/healthcare-experts-tell-medical-students-to-have-positive-attitude/articleshow/82413296.cms||Abhilash Botekar

While 393 and 641 teams conducted the fever survey on Monday and Tuesday respectively, the number of teams was increased to 707 on Wednesday. Further, as many as 19,090 Covid-19 tests were conducted across all basthi dawakhanas, urban healthcare centres, and other hospitals in the city. Each survey team consists of an ANM (auxiliary nurse midwife), an ASHA worker, and an entomology worker from the civic body. As part of the survey, temperature of people is checked and recorded using a thermal scanner. The fever survey is being conducted by the municipal corporation as part of an exercise to find out details of people having fever or other symptoms similar to those of Covid-19 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/41k-houses-surveyed-for-fever-in-city/articleshow/82417844.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Telangana to trace symptomatic contacts of positive cases||HYDERABAD: After focusing efforts on prioritising testing for symptomatic person, the state health department has come up with a plan to identify possible symptomatic cases. As per the new directive, contacts of positive cases who are showing symptoms will be identified. Earlier, with containment zones barring people into such areas, contact tracing was focused on the source of infection to break the chain. “In the current scenario, the spread is rapid so we are now focusing on symptomatic contacts of infected persons to give them required treatment and advice,” said an official from health department. In line with this, GHMC and other health department have started conducting fever surveys to identify those with symptoms. “Every symptomatic person is asked to take precaution, take basic treatment if required and if symptoms grow, they can go to a hospital,” said an official. Health department director Dr Srinivas Rao said that by focusing on symptomatic persons, prompt action can be taken and that in due course, by identifying all symptomatic persons, the spread of the virus can be contained. Officials said they were following guidelineslaid down by the ICMR. However, sources on the field informed TOI that in during the fever survey in some areas, people were reluctant to share details. “If we look at the positivity rate at PHC-level, the number of people showing symptoms is not corresponding with the positivity rate. This means there is some hesitancy among people in sharing details,” a GHMC deputy health official told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-to-trace-symptomatic-contacts-of-positive-cases/articleshow/82417801.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Donors hesitant as patients scramble for plasma||HYDERABAD: With the active Covid-19 case load in the state increasing at a rapid pace, a large number of patients who have been prescribed convalescent plasma therapy are having to run from pillar to post to be treated. Adding to this problem is a shortage of donors as a result of fears of reinfection while ineligibility to donate after being given the vaccine has further reduced the pool of donors. There are several donors who have expressed their wish to donate in light of the current situation, but many of them are being discouraged by their families as they might get reinfected and carry the infection back home. “We had only one donor who agreed out of almost a dozen we contacted but he too dropped out at the last moment saying that his family was apprehensive,” said a patient’s relative who is still waiting for a donor. Another relative of a 25-year-old patient said they had contacted several donor groups and even managed to convince a few donors but even after getting 10 donors they were unable to get a plasma replacement. “The ones who came forward were ineligible for some reason or the other. Finally, we convinced the hospital that we will pay for the replacement,” said the patient’s relative, adding that in six cases, the patients didn’t have antibodies. Meanwhile, plasma donor groups which are getting several distress calls on a daily basis said that only around 25 to 30 per cent possible donors actually end up as donors owing to age, co-morbidities and other factors. “While it was easier to get donors during the first wave, it has become very difficult to convince donors this time due to high infectivity. Families are hesitant to send donors to hospitals. Even if they don’t fall sick, they may become a carrier and transmit to others in the family. Due to this, we had to tie up with blood banks to keep the live donor plasma and supply it to patients but most hospitals do not allow this,” said Telangana Plasma Donors’ Association president, Gudur Narayana Reddy. Vaccinations and delays in second doses has further added to the problem. “Plasma is precious and very difficult to get these day after vaccination. As per the criteria, plasma cannot be taken for four weeks post vaccination. Taking in count the two doses of vaccines, it would mean that a donor is ineligible for at least two months if the vaccine is taken,” said an official from a corporate hospital in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/donors-hesitant-as-patients-scramble-for-plasma/articleshow/82417917.cms||Amrita Didyala

SwasthVayu has been developed in collaboration with CSIR-National Aerospace Laboratories and has been certified for safety and performance by NABL accredited Labs, after undergoing biomedical tests and beta clinical trials at NAL Health Centre, Manipal Hospitals, Bengaluru and many hospitals in Hyderabad and across India. SwasthVayu is also certified by the Director General of Health Services, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The initial 1,200 units of Swasthvayu ventilators have been supplied to nine Delhi government hospitals for treating Covid-19 patients. The company has a capacity to manufacture over 6,000 units of SwasthVayu ventilators per month and is planning to set up a pan-India dealer network to expand its reach. The ventilator can be utilised in medical wards, makeshift hospitals, dispensaries and homes for treating Covid-19 as well as non-Covid ailments like lung disease and sleep apnoea, among others. The company said SwasthVayu delivers oxygen through a non-vented mask tightly fitted to the face and does not require any tube to be inserted through the mouth into the windpipe. This provides absolute safety to critical patients from any contamination, including viruses, the company said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-based-defence-solutions-firm-launches-non-invasive-ventilator/articleshow/82417945.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: With wards overwhelmed, cancer cases turning fatal due to delay in treatment||HYDERABAD: Delay in routine treatment and check-ups for cancer patients due to a surge in Covid-19 cases is turning fatal for many patients, experts said. While many are said to postponing sessions over fears of contracting Covid-19, city doctors said that overwhelmed patient wards and intensive care units are also said to be one of the reasons why prevention, early detection, and intervention efforts have been delayed. Telangana has around 20,000 new cancer cases, including 5,000 head and neck cancer patients who need regular care. Telangana’s cancer caseload is around 1 lakh, according to modest estimates. “Almost all surgeries of cancer patients have been postponed from the second week of April. They don’t want to risk coming to hospitals amid the pandemic,” said Dr K Sreekanth, senior surgical oncologist, Yashoda Hospitals adding the case is similar with patients taking chemotherapy, radiation, among others as they too are cancelling sessions. Oncologists said that even during the first wave many cancer patients had postponed their sessions, some even for months together, and when they came back for the treatment they presented with more advanced disease, which is more difficult to treat. “For cancer patients, the window for cure is narrow. They shouldn’t be postponing their treatment. Unfortunately, about 70-80% are not turning up for their sessions,” said Dr Ajay Chanakya Vallabaneni, Consultant Surgical Oncology & Robotic Surgeon, KIMS Hospital. He pointed that the cancer death mortality rate across the globe is 30% which is far more than Covid 19 infection mortality rate of about 3.5%. Giving an example of how the delay in treatment can affect cancer patients, Vallabaneni said that a 29-year-old, who was noted to have abreast lump and diagnosed to have early breast cancer, avoided hospital visits and delayed treatment, which resulted in advanced disease with ulceration and lymph nodal involvement making it impossible to conserve her breast and lymph nodes. Doctors said in many cases, it is attendants or caregivers who are hesitant to continue the patient’s treatment during, and added that even if patients contract the virus, treatment will only be halted for two weeks. They pointed out it is unlikely for cancer patients to come in contact with Covid-19 patients at a hospital as they have separate facilities for patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-wards-overwhelmed-cancer-cases-turning-fatal-due-to-delay-in-treatment/articleshow/82417960.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Hyderabad||Lockdown hurts livelihood, Telangana not to impose it: CS||Hyderabad: Allaying fears of a complete lockdown, chief secretary Somesh Kumar on Wednesday said the government was not in favour of a shutdown as lockdowns have not helped stop the Covid-19 surge across India, but has only hurt livelihood. “There is a downward trend in Covid-19 cases and positivity rate in the state in the past 10 days. The government feels there is no need for a lockdown,” the chief secretary told reporters. Telangana government has extended night curfew from 9 pm to 5 am for the past 10 days, which ends on May 8. Earlier, the high court had suggested that the government should consider imposing weekend lockdown or extension of night curfew timings. “Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and the cabinet will take a call on this, if the situation arises. But as of now, there are no such conditions in the state,” the chief secretary said. Underscoring there was no dearth of hospital beds and medicines in the state, he said 62,000 beds are available and the government was trying to add more oxygen beds. “Hyderabad has become a medical treatment hub now. Covid-19 patients from neighbouring states such as Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and even Delhi are coming for treatment. Several people have been airlifted from other parts of the country to Hyderabad for treatment,” the chief secretary said. Telangana has also procured oxygen from other states like Orissa by airlifting tankers to meet the oxygen crisis. “Now the state has more than the required oxygen. While the requirement is 125 MTs, the Centre allocated 430 MTs. The state is not getting about 45 MTs from the states like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka,” he said. Kumar said OPD services for Covid-19 patients would be started in all government hospitals and primary health centres immediately. “People with mild symptoms can start using medicine kits provided by the health department. Remdesivir injections, according to doctors, would not help much in treatment,” he said. On allegations of mismatching the number of Covid-19 deaths in hospitals and what the government declares every day, Kumar said the government was following protocols that decide which death should be treated as ‘Covid deaths’. “Deaths are being declared based on those guidelines” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lockdown-hurts-livelihood-telangana-not-to-impose-it-cs/articleshow/82417721.cms||Koride Mahesh

The protest was led by BJP state president Satish Poonia in Jaipur, who questioned the silence of CM Ashok Gehlot over the attacks on Rajasthanis in WB. “It is strange Gehlot, who claims to represent Rajasthanis across the globe has maintained a silence on the series of violence since the assembly election results were declared. Reports suggested that people from the state were selectively targeted by TMC goons,” said Poonia. Taking on elected Mamata Banarjee, he said those leading the charge on people have diminished by themselves by giving examples of Ravan and Hitler. “Every oppressor has to pay the price for his/her deeds,” said Poonia, who called Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi’s silence on the killings a part of strategic political alliance. “It shows the connivance of the Congress with the TMC in Bengal. It is also strange why the violence is against BJP leaders and party workers and why not on Congress and Left parties,” said Poonia. In Ajmer, the protest was led by former education minister Vasudev Devnani, who argued that at a time the country was reeling under the second wave of Covid, the TMC was busy targeting the BJP. “We expected them to take care of the Covid situation in the state, but they are busy settling political scores,” said Devnani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-stages-protest-over-bengal-violence-in-state/articleshow/82418219.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Schoolkid raises funds, donates medicines & O2 concentrator||Nagpur: You don’t need to have a full-fledged NGO or a massive base of donors to contribute during the Covid-19 pandemic, and that’s exactly what 17-year-old Vansh Patodia proved this week. Right from raising funds for medicines, oxygen concentrators to smartphone for online classes, Vansh has shown that help is just a phone call away. When Good Samaritan Khushroo Poacha was desperately looking for an oxygen concentrator for the needy, he was surprised to receive a call from young Vansh who said he would be happy to help. On Tuesday, Poacha received a brand new good quality oxygen concentrator, courtesy Vansh, and that will now go a long way in saving lives. Poacha, a TOI Nagpur Heroes awardee and known for his philanthropy, said, “It’s really amazing that young people like Vansh are so sensitive to social causes. It’s the passion to help others in this generation which gives me hope for a better world in the future.” Vansh, a student of Centre Point School, said he was ‘simply happy to help’. “My mother volunteers with an NGO that’s been doing a lot of groundwork during Covid-19, and I felt even I should do something,” said Vansh. “The NGO told me that many children are not able to attend online classes due to lack of smartphones/tablets. So I started a fundraiser,” he said. What followed was a series of calls to friends, acquaintances and relatives. “The biggest challenge is convincing people that their money will be used properly. People want to donate, but have a genuine concern about how it will be utilized,” said Vansh. His convincing skills seemed top notch because Vansh ended up with Rs1.56 lakh, way more than needed for the original purpose. “I donated some of it to Rotary Club and some part was used to send medicines to orphanages and old age homes. But even after that, I had money left and was looking for another good cause to donate to,” said Vansh. That’s when an acquaintance got him in touch with Poacha, who had been looking for oxygen concentrators that are in short supply. Vansh said, “I spoke to Poacha about two weeks ago and then placed order for the concentrator which cost almost Rs60,000. As soon as the product reached my place, I forwarded it to Poacha uncle.” With the entire corpus now being used up, Vansh has no immediate plans to restart. “Actually, my Std XII classes have started (online) so my academic schedule is very busy, considering it’s a crucial year for me. But if time permits, I shall try to do my best,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/schoolkid-raises-funds-donates-medicines-o2-concentrator/articleshow/82416593.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Mumbai||RBI allows recast of home, personal & small business loans||MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday extended relief to individuals and small businesses who have loans up to Rs 25 crore by allowing them to seek a loan restructuring if they are affected by the second wave of the coronavirus that is sweeping the country. Announcing a series of measures to ensure financial stability, the central bank also loosened its purse strings to fund the war against the pandemic by providing a Rs 50,000 crore liquidity window to ramp up healthcare infrastructure. This has been topped with incentives for lenders who build a Covid-19 loan book. “This is the first part of a calibrated and comprehensive strategy against the pandemic,” RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said. He further stated that the central bank was willing to take many more “small and big steps”, including unconventional measures, and work with the central government to “ameliorate the extreme travails” that citizens were facing “in this hour of distress”. The loan recast will be available to individuals -- including home and other personal loans -- and small and medium enterprises that did not restructure their loans in 2020 which were classified as standard accounts till March 2021. RBI also allowed lenders to provide relief to small and individual borrowers, who had availed of the restructuring option last year. Under the Rs 50,000 crore scheme, banks can lend to those involved in the war against Covid, including vaccine manufacturers, importers or suppliers of vaccines and priority medical devices, hospitals and dispensaries, pathology labs, manufacturers and suppliers of oxygen and ventilators, importers of vaccines and Covid related drugs, logistics firms and also patients for treatment. The banks, Das said, are being incentivised for quick delivery of credit under the scheme through the extension of priority sector classification to such lending up to March 31, 2022. These loans, he added, will continue to be classified under the priority sector till repayment or maturity, whichever is earlier. Bankers said, unlike last year, this year there is no blanket relief to borrowers on repayment and they will have to seek approval from lenders. Lenders can prevent small loans from going bad by doing a customised restructuring and giving them an additional two years to repay. This relief will cover 85-90% of all bank borrowers in India. The governor also kept on his efforts to contain interest rates by announcing Rs 35,000 crore of government bonds on May 20 under its government securities acquisition plan. The announcement brought down bond yields to below 6% and boosted bank stocks in early trade. According to SBI chairman Dinesh Khara the impact of the second wave was different from last year when there was a complete lockdown which disrupted cashflows. While acknowledging that the current quarter would be tough the impact on corporates balance sheets would be known only if the situation persisted and currently corporations could manage without relief. “The RBI has continued to calibrate its policy throughout the COVID pandemic, and the series of measures announced today reflects a novel approach,” said Khara. CH. S.S Mallikarjuna Rao, MD and CEO of Punjab National Bank said that the measures help address the uncertainties faced by the most vulnerable sections. "At this crucial juncture, what is comforting is the fact that RBI remains optimistic of India’s resilience and post-pandemic future, along with its commitment to deploy all resources in its command in a battle readiness mode.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rbi-allows-recast-of-home-personal-small-biz-loans/articleshow/82419288.cms||---

Temples will impose the rule, though very few people are already coming. Gurdwaras have started sending out instructions on WhatsApp groups and websites. All 65 Roman Catholic churches have shut down while the 35 churches under the Church of North India have stopped physical Sunday services, though they have kept their doors open and will not allow more than 50 parishioners at a time. The Imam of Nakhoda Masjid, Maulana Shafiq, said that he has already made arrangements to impose the restrictions. The Kalighat temple authorities decided that the “rule of 50” will be followed. However, the garbha griha or the sanctum sanctorum will remain open but not more than five or six persons will be allowed at a time because of space constraints. “We are hardly getting devotees these days. We will allow people to enter through from one gate while they will leave through another gate,” said Kalyan Haldar, treasurer of the temple. Since the campus of Dakshineshwar temple is sprawling, there will be no restriction on the number of people entering the premises. But not more than 10 people will be allowed in front of the garbha griha, said trustee Kushal Chowdhury. All gurdwaras are sending out instructions to devotees that only 50 people will be allowed inside at a time. “The sevaks of the gurdwaras are also being instructed about the matter. At Behala gurdwara, we are starting virtual day long kirtans so that people don’t feel distanced,” said spokesperson Satnam Singh Ahluwalia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/not-more-than-50-people-at-city-shrines/articleshow/82416568.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

It clearly gave the primacy to the NCBC. But social justice minister Thaawarchand Gehlot said our fears were misplaced. Now, the SC judgement should be appealed against and the 102nd amendment should be amended again,” said BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab, who raised the matter during the debate in the LS.Then Congress MP and OBC leader B K Hari Prasad said the Centre did not listen to the objections raised in the RS. “The Centre has to amend the 102nd amendment and return the power to identify the OBCs back to the state commissions. The act should be amended as per the demands that opposition MPs had made in the Parliament. which, unfortunately, were rubbished by the social justice minister,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/obc-leaders-for-law-tweak-to-let-states-identify-backwards/articleshow/82418271.cms||---

This implied that police stations registered two theft cases per day. If that was not enough, 43 snatchings rocked the city in the same period. Most of the cases were yet to be solved. One of them was that of the Rs 20 lakh theft from the house of a tax consultant in Sector 49. Thieves had allegedly stolen four gold bangles, two gold ‘karas’, two gold chains, two manglasutras with gold earrings, one gold ring, four gold earrings, four silver coins, three silver glasses, four mobile phones, one Sony camera, four wrist watches and Rs 7,000.

Earlier, on Tuesday, the Calangute panchayat in association with the Candolim PHC had held an online training session for the volunteers on following up on home isolation patients and data entry. Last week, during a meeting with minister for ports and local MLA Michael Lobo and panchayat members from Calangute constituency, Nazareth had said that as the number of active cases have shot up in village, it has become very difficult for the doctors and nurses to call each patient to check on their status. The Candolim and Arpora-Nagoa panchayats have also started similar initiatives. Ward members will coordinate with the volunteers in their respective areas. The panchayats have also appealed to all villagers who have recovered from Covid-19 to voluntarily return their oximeters and thermometers to the Candolim PHC as there is a shortage and the instruments could save the lives of other villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panchayat-sends-covid-kits-to-patients-in-calangute/articleshow/82418279.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Daughters help elderly man win battle against Covid-19 in Jodhpur||JODHPUR: Determination of two daughters scripted an incredible story of their father’s recovery from the deadly virus despite severe comorbidities. Having touched a fatal low in his Covid infection, he won the battle with the help of his daughters, who never left him alone for a moment and kept infusing hope and positivity in him. Finally, he returned home on Tuesday after a 7-day stay in the hospital. His recovery even sprang a surprise to the doctors at the hospital, according to whom, he was a case with no hope given his age, the comorbidities and infection level during admission in the hospital on the night of April 27. They shifted with their father in the same hospital cottage against doctors’ advice and took complete charge of activities right from his food to healing therapies and motivation. Dharam Narayan Rajpurohit (67) was admitted at a private hospital after knocking doors of six hospitals with trouble in breathing. “All of us were in a state of panic during his admission in the hospital as he had oxygen saturation falling below 90 and a CT Score of 17. Seeing similar patients around and intermittent casualties added to the panic,” said his elder daughter Richa. “After talking to doctors and the relatives of other patients, I came to the conclusion that the treatment was same for them but depression and anxiety were the major culprits, triggering fatalities,” she said. From the very next day, they came up with their own routine for their father, which included breathing exercises, proning, steam and nutritious food. They arranged everything needed for this in the room. Shruti said that they had decided not to leave their father alone and unattended for a single moment and kept him engaged in a conversation so that he does not drift into negativity. Twice a day, they gave him tapping on his back and chest, and played music of his interest, which led to the music-lover father humming along. Within four days, he started showing signs of recovery and finally regained a saturation level of 93. After remaining stable for next three days and with no need of oxygen, he was finally discharged on Tuesday, seven days after his admission amid a grand celebration. With practice of naturopathy at home since years, the sisters also did their bit in motivating other patients as well, instilling spirit of hope in them to fight the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/daughters-help-elderly-man-win-battle-against-covid-19/articleshow/82418277.cms||---

Despite the government repeatedly claiming to implement various stringent measures, Sakhali and other areas in the vicinity continue to witness a surge in infections. On Tuesday, 100 new cases were recorded, that include 22 in Honda and 12 in Keri. On Sunday, Sattari's Covid tally recorded 675 active cases, out of which 142 were reported in Honda and 97 in Keri. As most of the people from Sakhali and other areas proceed for tests and vaccinations at Sakhali Primary Health Centre (PHC), the health and security personnel here are unable to cope with rise in footfalls. Patients experiencing symptoms like cough, cold and fever have to wait for more than 5-6 days to get their test results.

There is an urgent need to make the test results available at the earliest.” Vitthal Shelke, who is assisting families infected with Covid, said, “Since last week, whenever I went to the PHC to obtain home isolation kits, medicines and other related material, I have to wait for more than a hour in queues.

Jaisalmer district collector Ashish Modi is working on opening many isolation centres in rural areas and buildings are being identified for the same. Modi has directed health workers to monitor and supervise the oxygen levels of Covid patients on hourly basis so that patients can get better care. In Barmer, the district collector has directed to distribute 1,800 medical kits in rural areas every day and conduct door-to-door surveys. Collector Modi said new isolation centres will come up in rural areas and work has already begun on this front. Apart from this, he is continuously monitoring the situation at district hospital. He visited the Jaisalmer district hospital and made a plan to monitor oxygen levels of Covid patients. The collector took feedback from patients over the treatment facilities at the dedicated Covid ward. He said there is shortage of oxygen cylinders everywhere, so senior and junior doctors in mutual consultation must use oxygen judiciously. Modi also inspected the oxygen plant and directed the principal medical officer to deploy personnel for 24 hours at the oxygen cylinder warehouse of the hospital. On the other hand Barmer collector Lokbandhu Yadav said a door-to-door survey is in progress by the core group at gram panchayat level in rural areas and Covid kits are being distributed to patients through ANM.

Police have registered a case of dowry against her in-laws on the complaint of her brother. Police had to rush them to Jodhpur for post-mortem due to unavailability of doctors in Osian. But here again, they had to wait as all the three were subjected to corona test. “The reports were received on Wednesday, after which a medical board conducted post-mortem,” said SHO (Matora) Nemaram. Though, police suspect that Sangeeta might have first given some poison to her two sons then hanged them before hanging herself. “But exact details would be ascertained only after receipt of the post-mortem report,” he said. According to him, Sangeeta and her sons Prakash, 5, and Ravi, 3, were found hanging in a room at an agriculture farm in Nausar on Tuesday. Her husband Saburam, who returned home to find her wife and sons hanging, raised an alarm, after which neighbours came to the spot and informed police. The officer said the brother of the victim has filed a complaint against her in-laws accusing them of demanding dowry and harassing her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mom-ends-life-after-killing-2-kids-in-jodhpur/articleshow/82418288.cms||---

Similar scenes were seen in other centres after BMC announced on Tuesday that one lakh doses had arrived. Incidentally, the city on Wednesday crossed 10,000 vaccinations for the 18-44 group since the drive was expanded on May 1. Civic officials said people didn’t heed to the instructions that only 20% can walk in while the rest must have appointments on CoWin. Many centres also saw a rush of people aged 18-44 who only had registrations, but no appointments. BMC now plans to add more centres for 18-44 that will administer Covaxin. Till 2pm on Wednesday, 33,807 doses were administered, taking the city’s total vaccinations to over 25 lakh. The crisis in vaccination centres and the chaotic scenes outside are likely to remain on Thursday as well. BMC’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said the 1 lakh doses received on Tuesday could run out by Thursday in which case vaccination could suffer in some centres. She said the state has assured that Mumbai will be given more doses on Thursday, but there is no clarity on volumes. The vaccination momentum has been hit in the state too, where daily vaccinations have dropped under a lakh from an average of 2.5 lakh to 3lakh vaccinations. On Wednesday, merely 98,150 were vaccinated across Maharashtra. Kandivli resident Chintan Mukherjee (59) said he reached the BKC centre along with his 52-year-old wife around 9am only to find a sea of people waiting outside the main entrance. “The gates were shut since the vaccine doses had not reached. After the vaccine vials came only around 9.30am, hundreds tried to enter the premises,” he said, adding the barricades gave away and many senior citizens fell on each other. A doctor said his 79-year-old father went to BKC in desperation since he has not managed to get the second shot after completing nearly two and half months of the first dose. Dr Rajesh Dere, dean of BKC, said the majority of people above 45-plus continue to come without registration and stand in queue since morning. Dr Gomare said that youngsters in families should help the elderly to register on the application. Dere said on Wednesday they managed to vaccinate 6,800 people after receiving the doses arrived at 9.20am. Gomare also added that to tackle overcrowding, BMC was willing to tie up with private hospitals provided the latter was willing to vaccinate for free using their own manpower. “It will be a big service to the city,” she said. Another vaccination centre head said that the BMC should shut down vaccination for a fortnight till there are adequate doses. “It’s a nightmare for us since we have 1,000-2,000 doses, but there are double or triple the number of people waiting,” the incharge said. Dr Dilip Patil, head of state immunisation, said the 9 lakh doses received from Centre have been distributed among all districts and the state was expecting another 4 lakh doses. Dr Raj Gehlot, district health officer of Chandrapur, said vaccination has slowed down due to staggered supply and low allocation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vax-arrives-late-causes-chaos-at-mumbai-public-centres/articleshow/82419365.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Water shortage may worsen, warns DJB||New Delhi: At a time when Delhi is battling the Covid-19 surge, it is also facing shortage of raw water supply from neighbouring states, Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has claimed. The DJB counsel told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that due to an acute shortage of raw water from Haryana and Punjab, it might have to ration even the supply to hospitals. DJB has issued four supply advisories in the past couple of weeks due to low water levels in the Wazirabad pond. However, officials say they are trying to ensure equitable distribution and hospitals won’t be affected immediately. A senior official said the water level at Wazirabad barrage on Wednesday was at 667.2 feet as against the normal level of 674.5ft, impacting the Wazirabad, Chandrawal and Okhla water treatment plants (WTPs). DJB has been facing a production shortage of around 56MGD at these plants. According to the reports issued by Wazirabad Water Works, 94MGD raw water is available as against the normal supply of 135MGD. Similarly, the Okhla WTP is getting 15MGD as against the usual 21MGD. A senior official said the three key WTPs were producing 194MGD as against the usual 250MGD. Cautioning that the condition may worsen in the coming days, DJB said on Wednesday that due to the depletion in the Wazirabad pond level and persistent reduction in the release of raw water by Haryana into the Yamuna, the production has been affected and supply would be hit on Thursday and Friday, and probably for a few more days till the pond level improved to normal. The areas likely to be affected are Civil lines, Hindu Rao Hospital and adjoining areas, Kamla Nagar, Shakti Nagar and adjoining areas, Karol Bagh, Paharganj and NDMC areas. Other regions include New Rajendra Nagar, Patel Nagar, Prem Nagar, Inderpuri and adjoining areas in west Delhi, and Kalkaji, Govindpuri, Tughlaqabad, Sangam Vihar, Ambedkar Nagar and adjoining areas in the southern part. Model Town, Gulabi Bagh, Punjabi Bagh, Jahangirpuri, Moolchand, Greater Kailash, Burari and adjoining areas may also be affected. Advising judicious use of water and storage, an official said tankers would be available through helpline 1916. To supply 930-940MGD water daily, DJB sources 612MGD raw water from Haryana and 254MGD from Uttar Pradesh while the rest comes from subsurface sources like tubewells and ranney wells. DJB gets around 375MGD water through the Yamuna and the two canals supplying water via Haryana. Additionally, 220MGD is sourced through the Bhakra Nangal storage. There is still a supply-demand gap of 250-260MGD, which worsens further during the summer. Senior officials say the pandemic has led to additional water demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/water-shortage-may-worsen-warns-djb/articleshow/82416813.cms||Paras Singh
---||Hyderabad||TRS eyes Peddi Reddy to take on Eatala in Huzurabad||HYDERABAD: With clear indications that former minister Eatala Rajender may quit TRS after he was sacked from the cabinet, the ruling TRS is reportedly scouting for a leader to replace him in the Huzurabad assembly constituency. Sources said the TRS leadership has pressed Karimnagar district ministers and important leaders to ensure no senior leader in the constituency leaves the party and supports Rajender. The TRS leadership even spoke to some leaders in the constituency and is closely watching the situation. Rajender and TRS leaders are holding meetings with NRI groups on Eatala’s issue and NRIs were giving statements both in favour and against him. Telangana NRI forum members and some student unions in Osmania University have extended their support to Rajender. There is a buzz in party and political circles that TRS might induct former minister E Peddi Reddy into the party once Rajender’s exit becomes official. Peddi Reddy, a two-time MLA, was a minister in the N Chandrababu Naidu government in the united AP between 1999 and 2004. He did not contest 2014 and 2018 assembly elections from the constituency due to alliances with other parties. In 2018, he tried to contest from Kukatpally assembly constituency, but in the last minute, Nandamuri Suhasini was fielded as TDP candidate. He joined BJP in 2019. The TRS leadership could not contact him as Peddi Reddy tested positive for Covid-19 and is currently undergoing treatment at a private hospital. “I am undergoing treatment for Covid 19. None of the TRS leaders contacted me,” Peddi Reddy told TOI on Wednesday evening. Meanwhile, Rajender, who is in the constituency for the past three days interacting with his supporters in Huzurabad, said thousands of people and party workers met him and expressed their solidarity. Some leaders even suggested to him to wait for some more time as there has been a surge in Covid 19 cases. “I will announce my decision at an appropriate time after considering opinions and suggestions from my supporters and well-wishers,’ Rajender said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-eyes-peddi-reddy-to-take-on-eatala-in-huzurabad/articleshow/82418291.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Goa||Goa: Panic-buying in Varca on eve of total lockdown||COLVA: Panic spread among Varca villagers on the eve of the four-day total lockdown starting May 6 announced by the local panchayat, that overrides the government decision of allowing grocery items and livestock stores to remain open for a limited period. From Thursday, all business activities in the village will come to a grinding halt. Since early Wednesday morning, villagers jostled to purchase provisions, vegetables, meat and fish, throwing Covid protocols to the wind. Colva police had to intervene and disperse crowds that had gathered to purchase fish brought in by a politically connected trawler owner. One villager said that it was illogical on the part of the panchayat to announce a complete lockdown as it was bound to cause chaos. Sarpanch Charlton Lourenco denied there was panic buying, pointing out there is always a rush at one of the vegetable vendors in the village as people believe the store sells quality stuff. He said one of the wards in the village has reported 50 cases over the past few days, and hence to break the chain of infection, the panchayat unanimously decided for a complete lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panic-buying-in-varca-on-eve-of-total-lockdown/articleshow/82418289.cms||---

Ravi Nishad who contested district panchayat member seat from ward number 60 and Kodai Nishad, the candidate from ward number 64, claimed they had won their elections with more than 2,000 votes but the administration didn’t give certificates to them on Tuesday night, and on Wednesday morning the certificate of victory was given to Gopal Yadav for ward number 60 and Gabbar Yadav for ward number 64. On Wednesday afternoon, Ravi Nishad and Kodai Nishad reached Brahammpur block with their supporters and accused officials of cheating. The supporters started protest and raised slogans against police and administration. The mob pelted stones and torched Nai bazaar police post and harmed police vehicles. The police personnel somehow escaped and saved their lives. SSP Dinesh P Kumar rushed to the spot with other police officials and force and dispersed the mob with the help of PAC and force from nearby police stations. “Strict action would be taken against those involved in arson.

In one case, an eight-year-old girl was abducted and raped by an accused who took the child forcibly when she was on her way to the fields to meet her parents.

While CM Uddhav Thackeray described the verdict as “unfortunate” and said he would write to PM Modi and if necessary meet him to ask him to step in and provide quota to Marathas, public works minister Ashok Chavan, who is chairman of the cabinet sub-committee on reservation, blamed former CM Devendra Fadnavis for enacting the SEBC Act without taking note of the 102nd constitutional amendment. “As per the amendment, all powers of the state to grant reservation have been taken away and granted to the President. According to official records, while the Constitution was amended on August 14, 2018, the state’s new legislation came into force on November 30 that year. During the litigation, the argument revolved around the 102nd constitutional amendment. Fadnavis misled the people,” he alleged. Fadnavis described the charge as “baseless.” “We have not brought in a new legislation after the 102nd constitutional amendment, but it was a mere amendment to the earlier legislation enacted on July 9, 2014.” Expressing disappointment over the SC verdict, Fadnavis blamed the MVA for lack of coordination. “A look at the SC proceedings suggests our lawyers were not adequately briefed. The state government failed to convince SC that observations of the (M C) Gaikwad Commission were very important and there was a need to provide reservation to Marathas.,” Fadnavis said. He added the state should set up a committee of legal experts to examine the SC order and give an opinion on the future course of action.  Thackeray said the state’s legal battle will continue and noted, “SC has said it is not in the purview of the state to provide reservation to a community and that it was for the President to take a decision. I will write to the PM to step in immediately and ensure Marathas get reservation. If there is a need, I will meet the PM,” he said. He added, “In the Shah Bano case and cases under Prevention of Atrocities Act, the Centre had taken steps to nullify the verdicts. The same speed should be shown.” He said RS MP Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje had been seeking an appointment with the PM to discuss quota but there had been no response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cm-says-will-write-to-pm-even-as-mva-bjp-engage-in-blame-game/articleshow/82418301.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||SC verdict on Maratha reservation, 50% quota cap derails T govt’s plans||Hyderabad: The Supreme Court’s judgment on Maratha reservations and 50% cap on reservation came as a blow to the Telangana government, which has been planning to enhance reservations for STs and Muslims in the state. The TRS government in April 2017 passed resolutions in the state legislative assembly increasing reservations to Muslims from 4% (given under BC-E quota) to 12% and STs from present 6.5% to 9.8%. The resolutions were sent to the Centre for approval. While the file on Muslim reservation bill was sent back to the state by the Centre raising questions, the ST reservation enhancement bill file is still pending with the Centre in view of 50% cap on reservations by the Supreme Court. “Now, the ball is in the court of the Centre to come up with a constitutional amendment on increasing the cap coupled with a uniform Act giving powers to the state governments to have reservations based on local population. The Centre should look at reservations as need-based and works out separate for each state,” former MP and Telangana State Planning Board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar told TOI. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao wrote a letter to the Chief Justice of India a couple of months ago on the reservations issue with a plea for a fresh relook at the quota cap. The CM expressed the opinion that a larger bench of the apex court should review the Indra Sawhney judgment on the upper limit for reservations.  “There are special circumstances in various states. Some north-eastern states have more than 50% tribals or there are more OBCs in some states. The social fabric also changes over a period of time because of varied population growth rates among different communities,” he said in the letter. The CM also opined that states should have powers on fixing reservations and the cap on 50% limit should go. He even argued that states such as Tamil Nadu have been providing 69% reservations and the same should be extended to other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sc-verdict-on-maratha-reservation-50-quota-cap-derails-t-govts-plans/articleshow/82418304.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The relaxations include various incentives for the housing sector, including three-month extension in permission period of construction of plots and projects for allotments, whether private or allotted, by state urban development authorities. Amid spiralling Covid-19 cases, Punjab has ordered limiting of the number of teachers in government schools to 50%, with the rest taking online classes from home. The CM also directed the food department to prepare five lakh additional food packets for distribution among Covid patients, to ensure that every patient individually gets a packet even where there is more than one patient in a family. The state government has also announced additional 10 kg atta for 1.41 crore smart ration card beneficiaries. The food aid is in addition to the 1 lakh food kits, containing 10kg atta, 2kg chana and 2kg sugar already sanctioned for all poor people testing positive with Covid. It is also additional to the food aid announced by the Government of India. Virtually chairing a cabinet meeting, the CM compared the Punjab restrictions with the curbs in place in states like Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala, among others, and pointed out that it was not necessary to impose a total lockdown. He said to meet immediate and urgent needs of the people at the local level, it had been decided by the government to authorise sarpanches to spend up to Rs 5,000 per day, subject to a maximum of Rs 50,000, out of panchayat funds for providing emergency relief by way of food and medicines to the poor and needy in the villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-again-rules-out-lockdown-says-stringent-curbs-in-place/articleshow/82420924.cms||---

Many demanded the community be given reservation under the OBC quota now and sought the creation of supernumerary posts for Maratha candidates in educational institutions. There were Maratha protests in Lalbaug, Pandharpur, Indapur, Sangli-Miraj, Pune, Solapur and Jalna. A convenor of the Maratha Kranti (MKM) Morcha, Abasaheb Patil, said during a protest in Pune that the government understands only the language of the stick and it would be used. BJP MP Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje called the SC verdict unfortunate but appealed to the community not to protest amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Young Marathas said the government should file a review petition. “Reservation is desired for the poorest among the Maratha community, not for the creamy layer. The government must ensure the 10% reservation for the Economically Weaker Section is scrupulously implemented for the Maratha community. Also, there must be reforms in reservations for the Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes and VJNTs. The creamy layer of these communities must not be given reservations. Only when this happens people from other communities will realise that it is truly for the deprived,” said advocate Manisha Jagtap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-maratha-outfits-on-warpath-say-govts-to-blame-for-ruling/articleshow/82418335.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

The proportion of kids in need of hospitalisation and critical care, too, increased at tertiary care hospitals compared with the previous year. At B Y L Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central, a referral centre for Covid-positive mothers and babies, there have been four deaths till April 30 out of 43 admissions. The hospital had seen four fatalities in all of 2020. Three of the four deaths were in infants while the fourth was an 11-year-old.

SRCC Children’s Hospital in Mahalaxmi registered its first infant Covid death this year, after seeing no casualties in the first wave. Both state and civic officials maintained there has been no rise in overall mortality rates in paediatric population.

Two of them had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome,” she said. Unlike adults where delay in seeking care often contributes to severity, it was not a factor in children, she said. Hospitalisations in SRCC rose to 30 from the end of March to April following 11 admissions between January to mid-March. About 10 needed oxygen with some support and six ventilation.

Dr Tanu Singhal, an infectious disease expert at Kokilaben Hospital, said outside of tertiary care referral hospitals, deaths and severity among kids is lower than adults. The Andheri hospital saw two admissions in older children and no deaths. Over 350 children were treated on OPD basis at Powai’s Hiranandani Hospital but only two needed admission, said paediatrician Dr Bijal Srivastava. “In the second wave, many children were the first to get infected in a family,” she added. A doctor from a BMC hospital said this year children were outside playing in larger numbers. Doctors are worried about a rise in PIMS, a potentially fatal condition that can develop among children about a month after suffering mild or asymptomatic Covid. “As the second Covid wave has slackened, we expect PIMS cases,” said Dr Paramanand Andankar, chief paediatric and intensivist, at Jupiter Hospital, Thane. In the first five days of May, he got six PIMS admissions.

Such specialists would also be engaged on an hourly basis on payment of Rs 1,200 per hour. However, the state would engage some epidemiologists at much higher wages to control the current situation. These engagements or empanelment would be done under the National Health Mission (NHM). A decision in this regard has been taken recently in view of the unprecedented surge of Covid-19 cases in Haryana and the state government has sanctioned manpower of 852 through NHM. This empanelment of specialists would be apart from the state’s decision to engage retired medical officers of Haryana Civil Medical Services (HCMS) cadre. Such HCMS doctors, who have retired from the service and are not 70 yet, would be engaged for one year to control the pandemic. A detailed reply regarding augmentation of manpower in the state’s health and family welfare department was submitted by the chief secretary Vijai Vardhan in a status report to the high court on Tuesday, regarding a case related to arrangements by Punjab, Haryana, and UT Chandigarh to tackle the current pandemic situation. “With the induction of more doctors, Haryana has been able to trace contacts, take more samples, conduct more tests and undertake adequate activities to ensure that the case positivity rate and the case fatality rate is less than the national average,” Vardhan wrote in his report. The department of health and family welfare, Haryana, has already put dental surgeons in the state on Covid duties. The state’s Ayush department has also deputed regular ayurvedic medical officers for Covid duties and placed them at the disposal of civil surgeons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-to-empanel-specialist-doctors-on-rs-10000-daily-payment/articleshow/82418333.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Agra||Shocked police fraternity mourns Etah addl SP's death to Covid-19||Agra: Additional SP (crime) of Etah police Rahul Kumar died on Wednesday morning after testing positive for Covid-19 two weeks ago. The 45-year-old was in home isolation and had only mild symptoms. However, his condition suddenly worsened in the morning and was rushed to the district hospital where he was pronounced dead of "cardiac failure". The officer was popular for his work among the disabled people and had even mooted the initiative to designate mothers of intellectually disabled kids as special police officers. According to the police officers, Kumar’s elder brother had succumbed to Covid-19 on April 14 in Prayagraj. After returning from his hometown on April 16, the officer started having fever. His RT-PCR report was negative, but a CT scan later showed Covid-19 infection. He was in home isolation and his health had significantly improved in the past one week. Beant Kishor, the gunner of SP crime, said, “Sir was doing his routine exercise in the morning. He suddenly started feeling uneasy and fell unconscious. Blood came out of his nose. We took him to the district hospital. He was declared brought dead by the doctors.” Chief medical officer of Etah district Dr Umesh Tripathi said, “The officer died due to cardiac failure. An antigen test was conducted on the body. The officer was Covid-19 positive. The cremation was conducted as per the Covid-19 protocol." The officer is survived by his mother, wife and two minor daughters. Additional director general of police (Agra Zone) Rajeev Krishna said, “The untimely demise of the officer has left us in shock. Besides being a highly dedicated, honest police officer, Rahul Kumar was an excellent human being. We stand in complete support with the family of the officer in this difficult time.” In a move that seeks to empower mothers of minors and adults with intellectual disability and prevent bias and crime against such people, last year Etah police started designating their mothers as "special police officers". The plan, initiated by Kumar, relied on social signalling to battle stigma and crimes against the mentally challenged. The initiative was appreciated by the government. All the districts were directed to work on similar lines. B.Tech in mechanical engineering, Kumar was an expert in surveillance operations and cyber investigation. Senior officials of other districts relied on him in cracking complicated cases. In a recent case of “fake encounter” and arrest of 10 people following a dispute over payment at a 'dhaba' on March 4, Kumar was assigned to investigate by ADG. His findings led to the arrest of three cops and notorious liquor mafia Bantu Yadav. Constable Beant Kishor said, “It is rare to find a police officer like Rahul Kumar. Recently, he made an advance payment of Rs 20,000 from his own pocket to print books for children with intellectual disability." Kumar was working on development of a social website for intellectually disabled people and had invested Rs 50,000 to design the user interface, a senior police officer said. "His initiative to designate mothers of intellectually disabled people as special police officers was applauded by foreign universities as well," the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/shocked-police-fraternity-mourns-etah-addl-sps-death-to-covid-19/articleshow/82415313.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Kolkata||KP Hosp to ramp up infra for cops’ Cov treatment||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee visited the Kolkata Police Hospital on Wednesday afternoon shortly after being sworn in for the third term. The century-old hospital in Bhowanipore will soon be upgraded into a 300-bed Covid hospital for the treatment of cops. The decision came after it was found that admitting cops to private hospitals became a challenge. At present, the Kolkata Police has reported 318 active Covid cases — the number is more than doubling in the past three weeks alone. “Admitting cops to hospitals is an uphill task. Though there are tie-ups with hospitals, getting a bed is throwing up a huge challenge during a crisis like this. We have had to rush cops to nursing homes outside Kolkata. The Kolkata Police Hospital will be equipped with modern HDU facilities. A 50-bed safe home is already operating here,” said an officer. Any cop, whose condition turns serious at the safe home, will be treated at the hospital. “We are ramping up the infrastructure. There was no ICU here till now. Readying the HDU to fight Covid will be a major infrastructure upgrade,” said an officer from the welfare cell, which is primarily arranging treatment facilities for Kolkata Police. Till now, the hospital offers OPD services, though it has medicine, surgery, chest, physical medicine, ophthalmology, dentistry and a dietetics department. A separate quarantine centre has also come up for cops at the Kolkata Police Training Academy in Howrah’s Dumurjala. Cops, along with KMC officials, are mapping Covid-prone areas for micro containment zones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kp-hosp-to-ramp-up-infra-for-cops-cov-treatment/articleshow/82416815.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Goa||Goa: As kits run out, home-isolated patients left with no oximeters||PANAJI: Even as those hospitalised with Covid battle issues of oxygen supplies running low, those infected by the virus and in home isolation too have to contend with shortage of isolation kits, specifically the all-important pulse oximeter. On Wednesday itself, over 2,500 persons opted for home isolation, but doctors say that the medical attention received by this group leaves a lot to be desired. A few days ago, a doctor from the South Goa district hospital made a passionate appeal for oximeters, as the hospital itself had run out of the simple device that tracks oxygen saturation levels in Covid-19 patients. With the state witnessing a shortage, volunteer groups have stepped in and started collection drives to collect oximeters from families and donors to hand out to those currently infected by the novel coronavirus. “It has been three days since I got my test result, and I have not got my kit. Nobody has called to check on me either,” said a Porvorim resident. “I think I have been left to fend for myself.” In September, health minister Vishwajit Rane said that asymptomatic patients in home isolation would be given Covid care kits. Apart from vitamin tablets and antibiotics, the kit is also supposed to contain a digital thermometer, an oximeter, a spirometer, disposable gloves, one N95 mask, three triple-layered masks, a sanitiser bottle and other items required for care of Covid patients. With the state’s cases accelerating sharply, the supply of home isolation kits hasn’t been able to keep up with demand, leaving a considerable number of patients deprived of kits for the past one week. Because of the shortage of kits, primary health centres have started rationing out kits by handing out just one kit per family, instead of one for each person battling the virus. A few days, ago, Covid-19 patient personally travelled from Valpoi to Panaji in search of home isolation kits for him and his family. In the state capital, some corporators are running from pillar to post trying to purchase medicines and oximeters to hand out to families in their wards. With the daily caseload rising and hospitals unable to handle cases, most patients prefer to opt for home isolation even if their symptoms are more than mild. Several medical officials with primary health centres said that they are understaffed, and that they are unable to keep track of patients due to the surge in Covid-19 infections. Many PHCs have also run out of home isolation kits. “As and when the supplier sends stock, we distribute the kits to the health centres. The supply may come once a day, sometimes every alternate day. As far as we understand, the kits may not be enough sometimes,” said a senior DHS doctor. At some PHCs, kits are available but they lack oximeters. Taking an initiative to address the gap, a few youth in their mid-twenties stepped in and started a collection drive to collect unused oximeters. Saloni Pai Raikar (23), Devansh Cholera (25), Heramb Naik (26) and Isha Kher (23) have started collecting oximeters and are delivering them to patients who are in home isolation using a network of volunteers and sometimes even Kadamba buses. “Some home isolation kits have not provided oximeters and it is an extremely essential device for home isolation monitoring,” said Raikar. “This is a request to please return oximeters which are not being used in your house.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-kits-run-out-home-isolated-patients-left-with-no-oximeters/articleshow/82418326.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Mumbai||Remdesivir row: HC asks police to probe plaint against MP in Maharashtra||Mumbai: The Bombay high court bench at Aurangabad on Wednesday passed no directions to register an FIR against Ahmednagar MP Dr Sujay Vikhe Patil for alleged illegal procurement of remdesivir vials but directed police to “act in accordance with law” if any complaint is filed. Vikhe Patil, 40, had filed an intervention application and his lawyer had said that he had purchased only 1,200 Remdesivir vials, not 10,000. The HC was hearing a petition filed by agriculturist Arun Kadu, 70, and others alleging “illegal” procurement and distribution of 10,000 remdesivir vials from Pharma companies of Vikhe Patil. On Wednesday, after a hearing in the HC, the MP withdrew his application. The HC bench of Justices R V Ghuge and B U Debadwar considered an amendment application filed by the petitioners seeking investigation into other similar instances of illegal procurement and distribution of remedisivir injections in Nandurbar, Beed and Ahmednagar and recorded that since specific complaint was not yet filed with police station in this regard, it is not necessary to consider demand of an independent investigation. The HC heard the petition by Kadu and others and permitted them to file a detailed statement with all necessary documents and affidavits which were presented before the Court in an effort to make out their case for investigation. The HC said in its investigation the police machinery would be bound by the law. In case the petitioners are aggrieved by the mode and manner of investigation they are at liberty to knock the doors of the Court again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/remdesivir-row-hc-asks-police-to-probe-plaint-against-mp-in-maharashtra/articleshow/82418337.cms||---
---||Dehradun||HC clubs two dozen PILs concerned with stone crushers||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) clubbed around two dozen public interest litigations (PILs) concerned with the functioning of stone crushers in the state. These petitions were filed separately over the last few years and while many of these have challenged the permission given to individual crushing machines, several others deal with the state’s policy regarding stone crushing. The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma heard the cases on Wednesday and directed the counsel appearing for Pollution Control Board (PCB) and the state government to categorise the petitions while also directing them to file their responses within a week. The court has also asked the government to put its ‘stone crushing’ policy on record. The HC said that it will now hear these cases together since the issues involved in most of them are the same. The court has also said it wants to find out a way to balance the environmental concerns and the sustainable development of the state,” said a counsel present in the hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-clubs-two-dozen-pils-concerned-with-stone-crushers/articleshow/82415295.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Dehradun||HC directs MDDA, DMC to check construction in Himalayan foothills between Doon and Mussoorie||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) has directed the vice-chairman of the Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA) and Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) to personally visit the Himalayan foothills between Doon and Mussoorie and seal all the structures that have been built on the hills in violation of Uttarakhand Building Construction and Development Bylaws. The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma has also issued notices to the two officials along with state government and state biodiversity board, giving them time till May 26 to respond. The directions came after a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in the court by Doon-based social activist Reenu Paul, alleging that even though the state’s bylaws prohibit any construction at places where the natural slope is higher than 30 degrees, these are blatantly flouted. The petition said that hill after hill is being cut yet the authorities have turned a blind eye to the degradation caused to the sensitive ecology of Doon valley. “The said policy, also known as the foothills policy, mandates that the small hillocks that define the early features of the Shivalik range, are to be preserved. Moreover, the SC has held that foothills are a natural resource that need protection. Therefore, we informed the court that all throughout the Rajpur region between Dehradun and Mussoorie, the foothills have been systematically destroyed, in as much as hillocks after hillocks have completely been removed. We also furnished photographs before the court, showing the kind of disaster that had been caused to the local ecology,” said Abhijay Negi, counsel appearing for Paul. The petition also said that Doon Valley is part of the “youngest and loftiest mountain belt of Himalayan origin” and falls in the high seismic zone. It goes on to say that over the past few years, incidences of landslides have gone up in the area and according to a report prepared by the Disaster Mitigation and Management Centre, these areas need to be kept free of anthropogenic intervention. The MDDA vice-chairman and municipal commissioner meanwhile have also been directed to file their inspection reports, including details on the extent of illegal construction in the area and action taken by their departments against the contractors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-directs-mdda-dmc-to-check-construction-in-himalayan-foothills-between-doon-and-mussoorie/articleshow/82415342.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh seeks security for oxygen tankers||CHANDIGARH: The health department of the UT administration has asked the director general of police (DGP) to provide police escort facility to tankers carrying liquid medical oxygen from INOX Barotiwala (Baddi) plant to the city. A letter by health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said Yashpal Garg, the nodal officer for oxygen supplies, has highlighted the need for security to reduce the travel time and avoid untoward incident. The administration has already deployed two of its officials at the plant for better coordination. Three vendors for refilling cylinders to be used by health institutions have already been roped in. Garg said, “The ministry of health and family welfare has fixed the daily quota of 20 metric tonne of medical oxygen for UT from Inox, Barotiwala. This medical oxygen is being utilised for Government Multi-specialty Hospital, Sector 16, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, and the Covid hospital in Sector 48. Recently, three oxygen generation plants were commissioned at these hospitals.” After meeting the daily requirements of the three hospitals, the remaining oxygen will be provided to the private refilling vendors to cater to the needs of other government hospitals and private healthcare institutions in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/city-seeks-security-for-02-tankers/articleshow/82416840.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Covid-19 task force urges state to follow CT scan guidelines||Pune: The state Covid-19 task force head Sanjay Oak has said their guidelines for CT scans in April had advised doctors treating patients to exercise discretion while telling them to undergo scans. “The task force issued a detailed advisory on April 18, which the state received on April 20. The government should act on it,” Oak told TOI. Another task force member Rahul Pandit told TOI that the recommendations largely suggests that only a clinician should recommend a CT scan, and citizens should not carry them out on their own. Central task force member and AIIMS director R Guleria had advised against CT scans and biomarker tests in case of mild symptoms. Underlining other risks of CT scans, Guleria had stated that one CT scan is equal to getting 300-400 chest X-rays done, and studies have shown that conducting them multiple times increases the risk of cancer later, especially in the younger age group. Nagpur-based pulmonologist Rajesh Swarnakar said specific guidelines given by the Centre for Disease Control have to be followed. “Some patients come with three CT scans done in 10 days which is unnecessary. Moreover, they do not show films which is actually required to see the type of lesion. CT should be done on the fifth or sixth day when inflammation really begins to show and not earlier which many patients are doing and discussing their CT score. Single most factor is oxygen desaturation which patients need to focus on and not the CT score,” he added. State health minister Rajesh Tope said the issue will be taken up and depending on more studies, such scans will be monitored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-covid-19-task-force-urges-state-to-follow-ct-scan-guidelines/articleshow/82418390.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Residents fume over tetrapods stacked on Bandra Bandstand||Mumbai: Bandra residents have come out against the large number of tetrapods relocated from Haji Ali where the Mumbai coastal road works are in progress to Bandstand. Residents say the tetrapods are stacked up along the seafront since the past few months and they fear could cause harm to anyone who climbs on them during the monsoon season. Local resident Nadeem Nusrath said if any person comes and stands on the tetrapods, they could lose their balance, which could even prove fatal. “There is no information on what they are plan to do with them.” A Maritime Board official said after relocation works were completed, a contractor was appointed to spread out and place all the tetrapods brought from Haji Ali. “Protection of the promenade is of utmost importance and so the tetrapods will also be spread in a manner that the large trees in a garden along the seafront remain protected. We wanted to start the relocation works earlier. However, there was a delay in getting permissions due to the partial lockdown. The works may go on through June as well,” he said. There are also plans to shift a few of the tetrapods to the Carter Road promenade, said officials. Local corporator Asif Zakeria said, “Earlier big stones were placed which are still visible for protection of the promenade.” Architect Samarth Das pointed out the bedrock at the Bandstand is a natural barrier against any erosion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-residents-fume-over-tetrapods-stacked-on-bandra-bandstand/articleshow/82415358.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Dehradun||Water level in Rishiganga, Alaknanda rises, alert issued for those living on river banks||Dehradun: Due to incessant rainfall, the water level of Rishiganga and Alaknanda rivers increased by over 2 feet on Tuesday evening. Following this, an alert was issued for people living on the banks of both rivers. “It is natural for water level in rivers to rise post rainfall and later subside,” said disaster management officer Nand Kishor Joshi.  This was a day after flash floods triggered by rains caused widespread damage in Ghat block of Chamoli on Tuesday. Joshi said no casualties were reported. According to sources, local villagers of Niti valley and Raini village said that after the water level surged, they fled their homes and took shelted in caves in the jungle, carrying solar lanterns and whatever supplies they could carry. A Raini villager who did not wish to be named told TOI, “The February 7 flash floods are still fresh in our minds. We cannot take risks.” Three months ago, a sudden increase in Rishiganga water level had led to flash floods in Chamoli’s Raini village. Meanwhile, rivers were in spate in Almora due to heavy rains on Wednesday. Crops were ruined and water entered houses. There was a disruption in power supply, but no injuries. Light to moderate rainfall, accompanied by thunderstorms, occurred at many places in both the hills and plains of Uttarakhand. Isolated places, including Mussoorie, were also lashed by hailstorms. The regional meteorological centre informed that select pockets in Uttarkashi, Chamoli and Pithoragarh districts received heavy rainfall while Dehradun, Haridwar, Tehri, Pauri, Almora, Nainital, Champawat and Bageshwar had thunderstorms. “The rain and thunderstorm activity will continue in both hills and plains of Uttarakhand for next 48 hours. The weather will start improving from May 8 evening onwards. The high-altitude places located at a height of 3000 meters or above will receive snowfall as well,” said Rohit Thapliyal, senior scientist, Met office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/water-level-in-rishiganga-alaknanda-rises-alert-issued-for-those-living-on-river-banks/articleshow/82415337.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Nagpur||Now, donate blood after 14 days of your Covid-19 jab||Nagpur: People who will receive any of the two Covid-19 vaccines available in the country can now donate blood after 14 days of their two jabs. The blood donation deferral period for the vaccine was revised by the National Blood Transfusion Council (NTBC) on Wednesday. TOI had raised this issue on the same day. Blood donation deferral criteria for the vaccine is from 7 to 14 days in most countries. But in India, the authorities had set the deferral period of 28 days after one dose of vaccine. This would have created a major crisis in blood banks as majority of voluntary donors are in the 18 to 44 age group. Now, the NTBC has revised the deferral period to 14 days. “It’s a welcome move to reduce the deferral period. Blood banks across the country were asking for it,” said Dr Harish Warbhe, medical director of Lifeline Blood Bank. He still insisted that youths should go for blood donation before jab. “Though you can donate blood after 14 days now, I appeal to all eligible donors to make it a practice of donating blood before their first jab. Otherwise also, you cannot donate blood for 3 months after one donation,” he said. New guidelines Deferral period for blood donation after Covid-19 vaccine reduced to 14 days Eligible donors can donate blood 14 days after each or any of the two jabs If Covaxin jab taken on May 7, one can donate blood after May 21 and get second dose on June 5 In case of Covishield, donor can donate on May 21 and go for the second jab after 8-10 weeks In both cases, donors must wait for 14 days post vaccination for blood donation||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/now-donate-blood-after-14-days-of-your-covid-19-jab/articleshow/82416848.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Goa||A day of highs for Goa: Positivity rate 52%, deaths 71, new infections 3,496||PANAJI: Days after Goa’s resident doctors highlighted the oxygen, bed and manpower shortage at the Covid hospitals, the state recorded several grim new highs — 71 deaths, 3,496 infections, and positivity rate of 52%, by far the highest in India. A doctor said that some of these deaths may have been due to oxygen shortages, and others due to not receiving the correct treatment as the system remains overwhelmed. Almost a third of Wednesday’s deaths were below 60. A 28-year-old with leukemia was the day’s youngest mortality. Two of those who died, aged 56 and 63, had been fully vaccinated, while six others received the first dose of the vaccine. May have seen 246 deaths so far, an average of almost 50 a day. On Wednesday, 16 persons died within 24 hours of admission, and two persons were brought dead to hospital. Goa currently has 27,964 Covid cases. Over 2,500 went into home isolation on Wednesday, while 266 more were hospitalised. Doctors have appealed to people to double-mask when heading outside, but as far as possible not to leave the house. They also said that people must get tested as soon as they experience the slightest of Covid symptoms, isolate and begin treatment without any delay. “Covid-19 is preventable. Why end up in hospital with an oxygen mask when one can wear a face mask and stay safe?” a doctor asked. AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said on Tuesday that if one’s oxygen saturation is 94 or more, it means there is sufficient oxygen in the body and there is no need to panic. “Misuse of medical oxygen by a person with normal saturation levels deprives someone else whose saturation level is less than 90,” he stated. The health ministry has asked people to seek medical attention in case of difficulty in breathing, dip in oxygen saturation (SpO2 <94% in room air), persistent pain-pressure in the chest, mental confusion or inability to arouse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/a-day-of-highs-for-goa-positivity-rate-52-deaths-71-new-infections-3496/articleshow/82418339.cms||---
---||Agra||Fashion designer, Sharda Whabi, dies a lonely death in Agra||AGRA: City-based fashion designer, Sharda Whabi, met a tragic end as she died alone in her house, most likely due to Covid-19. A designer of international repute, she is survived by her husband and two sons who are settled in Dubai but couldn’t come to India for her last rites and authorised the local police to cremate her on Wednesday. Whabi was found dead in her house in Jaipuria Sunrise Colony on Monday. An acclaimed designer who founded Krsadha fashion house and an NGO, Whabi had participated in various fashion shows. But for the past few years she had been spending more time doing social work, and lived alone in Agra. In a 2002 article about her in the Gulf News, a Dubai daily, she was introduced as designer of repute both in India and in the Gulf. “In a matter of a year-and-a-half, she has developed a production unit of 100 workers, participated in various fashion shows, and has been featured in Indian magazines and television. She is rubbing shoulders with...Tarun Tahiliani and Krishna Mehta...Sharda has been residing in Dubai for over 15 years, since she married Mahesh Whabi of Astoria and Ambassador Hotels." Talking to TOI, Ekta chowki in-charge Shailendra Chauhan, said that they cremated her body as per Hindu rituals and followed all Covid protocols after an authority letter was sent to them by her son Arjun. He added that her help, Bacho Bari, was also present at the cremation as per the wishes of the family who were connected on a zoom call at the time of the cremation. Her sons requested the police to hand over her ashes to the help. Superintendent Police, city, Botre Rohan Pramod, said, as she was suspected of suffering from Covid-19, no neighbour went inside her house or was willing to touch her body.  The mortal remains were taken to the mortuary by the police and were kept there for her family. However, they cremated her after the family informed them about their inability to reach Agra. Talking to TOI, Whabi’s son Arjun said, “We could not travel to Agra because of the flight restrictions and also the mandatory requirement for a negative RTPCR report for international travel.” Their relatives in Mumbai also couldn’t come as many of them were also sick. Remembering his mother, Arjun told TOI that she used to be a designer in her younger days but of late had been focussed more on social work. “Feeding animals and helping the needy was her main job and she sometimes designed gowns for brides and dresses for lord Krishna as part of her social work,” he said and added that his father Mahesh Whabi is also in Dubai but is not keeping good health. He said that his mother used to frequently travel to Mumbai and Dubai to meet them. Arjun, added that he and his brother, Niranjan, spoke to her at least thrice in a day.  “I called her on Sunday night too. She hadn’t been well for the past 2-3 days but things were under control. However, on Sunday her health took a turn for the worse. We tried arranging a doctor and also decided to fly to India the next day. But she died before that,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/fashion-designer-sharda-whabi-dies-a-lonely-death-in-agra/articleshow/82415335.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||Delhi: Wary of gas running out, some hospitals reduce beds||NEW DELHI: Battling the shortage of oxygen almost every day for the past week, Institute of Brain and Spine in Lajpat Nagar has reduced the number of its Covid beds by five to 34. On Wednesday at 9.30am, the hospital was left with oxygen enough for only an hour and half more. The hospital authorities claimed that when they contacted the oxygen helpline set up by Delhi government, they were referred to four other numbers, which didn’t prove helpful. The hospital itself managed to arrange some cylinders before receiving some replenishment at 3.30pm. “Our supply of the gas hasn’t been consistent, so we are unable to take in more patients after reduced the beds,” said an administrative official at IBS. “The supply is often delayed and creates panic and we are left banking on cylinders, which are difficult to refill.” Many hospitals are calculating their oxygen stocks by the hour. Shanti Mukund Hospital in Karkardooma has been having difficulties getting cylinder refilled though the quid oxygen supply has improved.  “The problems keep recurring — either the refilling station run out of oxygen or the machine breaks down,” said S K Saggar, CEO. “The workload has increased because 90 staffers, including doctors, have tested positive. We currently have 135 Covid patients, of whom 39 are in the ICU. But even at 8pm on Wednesday, our team members are in the queue to fill the empty oxygen cylinders.” The hospital requires 4.2 metric tonnes, but has been allotted 2.9MT. Devine Hospital in Wazirabad requires 80-90 cylinders every day, but its quota has been fixed at 42, endangering the lives of critical patients in the ICU who consume 25-30 litres at a time. The hospital privately managed the shortfall with supplies from Himachal Pradesh and Hardwar. The owner of a 30-beeded hospital in outer Delhi talked of another big problem. “Vendors are not fully filling the cylinders, which therefore finish faster,” said the owner. “First, we have an erratic supply. Then, we have cylinders that are not filled to full capacity. These need to be highlighted.” He also said that though no one complained about it loudly, government hospitals got preferential treatment at refill stations over small hospitals. “Whether a person dies in a nursing home or in a big government hospital, every life is important,” he argued. Hospital owners TOI spoke to felt that things might improve in the coming days because oxygen plants are being set up in some Delhi hospitals and the being consumed by these facilities can then be diverted to other institutions. Batra Hospital in south Delhi, which had stopped admissions on Wednesday, saw the crisis passing and began admitting new patients on Thursday, though in a controlled manner. Dr Narin Sehgal of Sehgal Neo Nursing Home also reported a better situation on Wednesday, though they weren’t out of the hot water yet. “The unpredictability about oxygen supply continues to plague us,” Sehgal said. “We are taking in new patients but only after some patients were discharged on Wednesday and some were shifted from oxygen-enabled beds. We could thus accommodate 7-8 new patients.” Sehgal Neo requires around 2 MT of oxygen but gets only 0.6 MT. The Indian Spinal Injuries Centre in Vasant Kunj was also in a happier state than the two earlier days after received replenishments. “The tankers have been coming, so we have supplies till Thursday morning. We have requested the supplier to send us replenishments every 12 hours to avoid any pressure situation,” said Dr K Preetham, medical superintendent of the hospital. Care New Born and Child Hospital in Vivek Vihar, though a non-Covid facility, found its oxygen stocks running out around 5pm on Wednesday with enough left only for another two hours. The hospital had three babies on ventilators. There was panic, but the procurement of some cylinders helped weather the crisis till Thursday afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wary-of-gas-running-out-some-hosps-reduce-beds/articleshow/82416909.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Goa||Goa: Will carry out oxygen audit on PM’s orders, says CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday that an oxygen audit would be carried out, based on instructions from PM Narendra Modi. Sawant said that Modi called him on Tuesday night to discuss Covid management in the state, and he was directed to carry out an audit of oxygen requirement and availability. “As directed by the PM, I have asked the oxygen audit to be carried out on how much oxygen is produced here, how much is being brought from outside, and how much will be our requirement now,” Sawant said. “To assess this, carrying out an audit is important. If our requirement for oxygen continues for around a year, it is important to have a record.” He said the audit would also cover how any leakages can be plugged, and whether any shut down oxygen production units can be made operational again in Goa. “The audit will cover our production capacity, how much is the requirement per patient, how we can plug any leakages. We will also explore if we can procure oxygen from any sources other than those already available. We will see if there are any oxygen plants which can be made operational again,” said Sawant. He said the requirement of oxygen is shooting up at present in Goa. “As per the details I received last night, we require oxygen cylinders in ten wards. Rest of the Covid wards get oxygen supply from the central oxygen pipeline. The requirement is different in each of the ten wards. Until three-four days ago, we were able to manage with 400-500 cylinders, but the requirement has now touched almost 1,000 cylinders. We have the capacity to provide up to 1,200 cylinders,” said Sawant. He, however, said that Goa has a good ratio of oxygen availability to patients. “Compared to the rest of India, I am not sure if we made a mistake with our ratio. I enquired, and when we state our count of oxygenated beds, we are only taking into account those with direct oxygen connection from the pipeline. I have instructed officials that other beds for which we have supply of oxygen should also be declared as oxygenated beds,” said Sawant. Meanwhile, he said that four step-up hospitals at Shyama Prasad Mukherjee stadium at Bambolim, in Bicholim, in Cansualim and Chicalim were made functional from Wednesday. “We have instructed the director of health services to get PHCs to start step-up hospitals. Those with co-morbid conditions should get themselves admitted in step-up hospitals in their taluka at the earliest, so that patients do not end up in a position where they have to be put on oxygen,” Sawant said. He said that the supply of oxygen through tanks to the South Goa district hospital has begun, with a capacity of 6,000 litres. Sawant said that at Goa Medical College (GMC), Bambolim, the capacity of the central tank is 20,000 litres. “We have an entire team to monitor the oxygen requirement,” Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-carry-out-o2-audit-on-pms-orders-sawant/articleshow/82418365.cms||---
---||Agra||Delay in Covid report keeps patients out of hospital||Agra: Delay in getting an RT-PCR report for Covid-19 is proving to be a challenge to patients in home isolation here. A RT-PCR report is mandatory for admission to hospital. On an average, RT-PCR reports are being issued in four days. But doctors say a delay in getting the report, delays admission. By the time, people are admitted, they are in a critical condition, making it difficult to provide them suitable treatment. At present, three RT-PCR machines are operating at the microbiology department of the SN Medical College, the only state government testing centre in the district. On an average, 4,500 tests are being conducted every day. Around 2,500 samples remain in waiting. Sultanpura locality resident Sunita Agarwal, who had come with her 64-year-old father for Covid-19 testing, said, “My father has been keeping unwell since the past five days. He is suffering from fever and has difficulty breathing. As advised by the family doctor, we went for an RT-PCR test at the district hospital on Saturday. So far, we haven't received the test report. Hospitals are demanding a Covid report to get patients admitted.” Sikandra locality resident Madan Mohan Sharma said, “I have been waiting for Covid-19 report since the last seven days. I am symptomatic and have quarantined myself at home. In case my health deteriorates further, I will not be able to get adequate treatment.” Not just a delay in issuing test reports, in several cases, the report neither mentions the person is tested positive or negative for Covid-19. “I had given my sample for Covid-19 testing at the district hospital on April 28. I received my report on Tuesday. Lab report status is equivocal. It means, I am neither Covid-19 positive nor negative. This is highly unreasonable,” said Pratapura resident Anil Goyal. Chief medical officer of Agra district Dr RC Pandey said, “We are working at 100% capacity. On a daily basis, at least 4,500 samples are being tested. We are trying to reduce the time of reporting results. We are making arrangements for additional RT-PCR machines and lab technicians. The problem will be sorted out in the next few days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/delay-in-covid-report-keeps-patients-out-of-hospital/articleshow/82415352.cms||Deepak Lavania

This has prompted sharp reaction from the teachers in the university who have questioned the move. In a letter to DU vice-chancellor PC Joshi, several members of the academic and executive council said, “While the whole country is fighting against the pandemic, the principal of Vivekananda College is fighting against its own ad hoc teachers.” The letter alleged that this was a violation of the December 5 letter of the ministry of education, “which mandates the continuation of all ad hoc teachers.” One of the 12 ad hoc teachers told TOI, “We were told that we will not be reinstated and our duties were taken away. We called the professor-in-charge and the principal, who said that we will be reinstated only after an interview. But that is clearly not possible due to the pandemic. Even the DU Teachers’ Association has said that no one should be left out just because of the interview.” Despite repeated attempts, college principal Hina Nandrajog did not respond.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-college-discontinues-the-services-of-12-ad-hoc-teachers/articleshow/82416878.cms||---
---||India||'Unconstitutional' Maratha quota quashed by court||In a setback to the Maharashtra government, the Supreme Court on Wednesday declared the state law to grant reservation to Maratha community as unconstitutional and held that the community is not socially and educationally backward to be eligible to be brought within the ambit of affirmative action. A five-judge Constitution bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat was unanimous in its view on the unconstitutionality of the law and quashed it on various grounds, including breaching of the 50% quota rule. The SC rued that even after 70 years of Independence, more and more people and communities are vying to be declared as "backward" to get reservation benefits. The decision will cause disquiet in the politically influential community and put the Shiv Sena-led government in a spot even as it will most likely look for avenues to appeal. However, the ruling is unlikely to be altered, and the law — brought in by the previous BJP-Sena government — is likely to remain a non-starter. Ironically, it is Sena, which will have to deal with the political hot potato. The state had framed the law on November 30, 2018 granting 16% quota for Marathas in government jobs and admission in educational institutions in response to a sustained agitation. While upholding the law, the Bombay high court on June 27, 2019, directed the government to bring it down to 12% for education and 13% for jobs as recommended by a state-appointed backward class commission. But on examining all data pertaining to social, educational and political status of Marathas in the state, the SC, in its judgment, said both the HC and the Commission erred in concluding that they are a backward community. The SC also noted that majority of the legislature belongs to the Marathas —out of 19 CMs, 13 were from the community. “The representation of Marathas in public services in Grade A, B, C and D comes to 33.23%, 29.03%, 37.06% and 36.53%, computed from out of the open category filled posts, and is adequate representation of the community. One community bagging such number of posts in public services is a matter of pride for the community and its representation in no manner can be said to be not adequate in public services,” Justice Bhushan said in his order. The SC, however, made it clear people who availed of Maratha quota in government jobs and admission in educational institutions during pendency of the case will not be affected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/unconstitutional-maratha-quota-quashed-by-court/articleshow/82422514.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The hospital administration refused to hand over the body to the teenager, insisting that he is a minor. The boy had no one else in his family other than his father. He told this to the doctors and pleaded with them, but all in vain. The boy made several rounds but was fobbed off each time. It was only after police intervened that he was able to secure his father’s body. The chief medical superintendent (CMS) of the hospital has been divested of his charge for failing to alert police on time. A probe has also been ordered. Recounting his ordeal, the boy said his father was taken to the hospital on April 21 with fever and cough. He died two days later on April 23. He said, “When I requested the hospital staff to hand over my father’s body for the last rites, they asked me to come with a guardian or someone older. They just wouldn't listen.” With no adult to call upon, the boy turned to his landlord for help. Instead of assisting him, the landlord misled him and said his father's body had already been cremated. Then he allegedly threw the kid out of the house knowing no rent would come in future from the jobless teen. Now homeless, the boy wandered about the streets wondering what to do next. He was spotted by a local resident, Mahesh Misra, who owns a small workshop near Khirni gate in the city. He knew the boy’s father, a labourer, and had often seen the duo together. Misra then contacted the Sasnigate police, who in turn helped them get the body released on May 3. The body was cremated by an NGO, Manav Upkar, as the boy was unable to pay for the last rites. Aligarh’s chief medical officer BP Kalyani admitted negligence on the part of the hospital. They had kept the body in the mortuary for 10 days. He said, "At least they should have informed police." Kalyani said, “An inquiry is being conducted by the SDM and action will be taken on the basis of the report.” The CMS of Deendayal Hospital, Dr AB Singh, has been suspended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/16-yr-old-waits-10-days-to-get-fathers-body/articleshow/82415360.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Harmony Sherly CHS in a letter to the H west ward said that the compound consists of two buildings Harmony and Rocky Hill with 56 flats and 60% of occupants are senior citizens. “In March, Harmony building was declared as a micro containment zone...,” says the letter written to BMC. Harmony Society secretary Imityaz Vilatra said they fear that with crowds in the building, residents would be at risk. “Many schools and colleges in the ward are vacant where the drive can be held.” The BMC has urged citizens to co-operate and said that vaccination drives will be held by following all protocol. Local corporator Swapna Mhatre from the BJP said while it is BMC premises and they are free to use the same, it should have been kept as the last option. “This is a residential area and instead school basements would be an ideal option,” she said. —Richa Pinto||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-socy-tells-bmc-to-shift-venue-of-vax-drive/articleshow/82418408.cms||Richa Pinto

He said around 40 lakh voters have voted for AAP. In a press conference, Singh said people of UP have accepted the Kejriwal model of governance — quality education, healthcare, free water and free electricity — and voted for the party. “The result is a clear indicator that there is a feeling of utter disappointment among people for the Yogi government and they completely rejected BJP in the panchayat elections,” said Singh, adding that the results are also a reflection of poor Covid management by the UP government. “The outcome of the panchayat elections has also proved that during the pandemic, the UP government did not arrange for oxygen beds, did not make arrangements for testing and even to cremate bodies,” Singh said. He claimed that people have clarified that they don’t want politics of hate, they need hospitals, schools and free electricity in UP. AAP has expressed gratitude towards the people of UP. Singh announced that soon AAP will start auto-ambulance services in Lucknow and other districts to help people during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-bags-83-seats-in-up-zila-panchayat-polls-says-people-for-kejriwal-model/articleshow/82416997.cms||---
---||Nagpur||First in Maharashtra, Covid portal ensures hospital beds for needy||CHANDRAPUR: Covid patients and their relatives running from one hospital to another in search of beds breathed a sigh of relief, thanks to the introduction of Chandrapur Covid-19 patient management portal, first of its kind of centralised facility in the state. With exponential rise in the number of Covid patients during the second wave, there was quite a chaos among patients over securing hospital beds. Hoping for discharge of those who recover, patients on oxygen support were seen waiting in ambulances at hospitals to land a bed. Sensing seriousness of the situation, collector Ajay Gulhane took control of hospital bed allocation in Chandrapur city and started patient management portal on Monday. There are total 1,316 beds in 28 government and private hospitals under the portal. A patient needs to be taken to designated Covid Care Centre (CCC) or Covid Hospital for registration. “Medics at the CCC or Covid Hospital would register the patient on portal after testing their oxygen level and other vital parameters. The registered patients will be held in three separate waiting lists — oxygen, ICU and ventilator. Depending upon health condition of the patients, beds would be allocated through the centralised allocation process,” said Gulhane. The collector explained that Aadhaar number, mobile number, oxygen level of the patient and RT-PCR test report are mandatory for registration on the portal. “We frantically looked for a bed for my sister while her oxygen level deteriorated with every passing hour. Every hospital we went denied admission claiming no bed vacancy and we had to keep her at home on oxygen support for two days with the help of an NGO. However, my sister got ICU bed within hours of launching of the portal,” said TM Shedmake, one of the beneficiaries. Hospitals are required to immediately inform about bed vacancy to all CCCs and control room. The control room would in turn intimate the allotment of bed to patients so that they could directly go to the hospital. “We have directed all hospitals to admit patients as per the bed allocation made through the waiting list on the portal. The hospitals are forbidden to admit any patient directly without registering them on the portal. Those violating the process will lose their license to treat Covid patient,” warned Gulhane. Nodal officer Dr Kishor Bhattacharya said total 298 patients have been registered on the portal till Wednesday evening. Of these, 142 were provided with oxygen, ICU or ventilator beds. “There were 50 patients who declined to avail the beds despite allocation citing reasons like hospitalization in other cities or recovery during the waiting period. There are still 104 patients on the waiting list, but it is possible that some of them might have succumbed or have secured beds in Nagpur or Mancherial in neighbouring Telangana or other cities,” he said. In Nagpur, following directives of Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, district collectorate and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) too have decided to start centralised control room which will monitor and allocate beds at all Covid Care Centres (CCCs) and Dedicated Covid Health Care Centres (DCHCs) in the district. From Tuesday itself, hospitals in Nagpur district have been asked to refrain from admitting patients directly. Those seeking admission will have to contact CCR landline number 0712-2567021 or on WhatsApp (7770011537, 7770011472) with health details of the patient. Within half an hour, the CCR will take a call on whether the patient can undergo treatment at home or is to be allotted a hospital bed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/1st-in-maha-covid-portal-ensures-hosp-beds-for-needy/articleshow/82416940.cms||Mazhar Ali

He said patients having recommendation from private hospitals must get that endorsed by the civil surgeon to avail the facility. Dayalan claimed Mohali has sufficient supply of oxygen as of now. “Our consumption is 25 to 27 metric tonne daily on an average. We are getting it from five sources. No one will be given oxygen at home if not signed by the civil surgeon.” The DC said Mohali is getting liquid oxygen tankers from Bokaro, Roorkee, Panipat, Oxigen Linday India in Uttarakhand and Inox, Barotiwala. He also added that two companies in Mohali, HiTech and Hindair are supplying oxygen cylinders to Mohali hospitals whereas some companies in Mandi Gobindgarh have also volunteered to give oxygen. The supply from Bokaro is coming regularly. “The tankers are airlifted from here and after being filled, they come by road. The supply and distribution is being controlled by the state government and regulated by the district administration,” he said. The oxygen management committee (OMC) after a survey had concluded that Mohali requires 26 MT of oxygen daily to meet with its requirements. 40 fake doc prescriptions Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said he had detected 40 to 50 fake prescriptions brought by people for procuring oxygen under home isolation. He said, “We left them with a warning and refrained from getting an FIR registered.” He said people were getting doctors’ prescription from as far as Delhi, Ghaziabad and other places to get oxygen at their doorsteps. “That is the reason which forced us to issue directions to get prescription by the civil surgeon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/get-civil-surgeon-nod-for-o2-at-home-dc/articleshow/82416877.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Haryana health minister Anil Vij on Wednesday afternoon inspected installation of the plant and asked it to be made operational by the night. Vij said that the state government was working to make the government hospitals ‘atma nirbhar’ (self-reliant) so that “we do not need to procure oxygen from anywhere”. “Initially, six oxygen plants were approved for Haryana, of which, ones at Karnal and Panipat have become operational. The one at civil hospital, Ambala City would also start supplying oxygen from today. The plants at Panchkula, Faridabad and Hisar would also be made operational in two-three days,” claimed Vij. “The central government has approved 60 more oxygen plants for Haryana, which would be installed at 30-, 50-, 100- and 200-bedded government hospitals in the state. For the same, the responsibility of completing the civil work within seven days has been given to NHAI. DRDO has been given the task of oxygen plant installation. All the concerned agencies have been instructed to start the work without any delay. Every government hospital in Haryana would be made ‘atamnirbhar’ with regards to oxygen,” the minister said. About the private hospitals, Vij said, “After making changes in the rules, the private hospitals have been asked to install oxygen production plants according to their requirements. This work should be done at the earliest. Some hospitals are large, they will work to set up plants as per their scheduled time so that people do not have to face lack of oxygen in any area. If a private hospital will not set up an oxygen plant, strict action will be taken.” “Although we are airlifting the oxygen, but there is a problem in getting the tankers to bring the oxygen from Odisha. Due to shortage of tankers, we are facing a problem in lifting the entire quota. We have held meetings with concerned officials and it has been decided that oxygen tankers should be imported from wherever possible so that a chain can be made to lift the oxygen quota from Odisha,” he explained. Meanwhile, Ambala civil surgeon Dr Kuldeep Singh said, “For storing liquid oxygen, two tankers of 1,000-litre capacity would be installed at civil hospitals of Ambala City and Ambala Cantonment and the work for the same is on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/nhai-drdo-installing-plants-in-hry-hospitals/articleshow/82421086.cms||JK Singh

For the last three days, the city has been witnessing a fall in positivity rate – from 30% on Monday to 27% and 26% on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. 🏥Delhi Health Bulletin - 5th May 2021🏥 #DelhiFightsCorona https://t.co/I2dhSNqUtX— CMO Delhi (@CMODelhi) 1620208254000In April third week, Delhi’s positivity rate had touched 36%, which was among the highest in the country. Data shared by the Delhi government suggests that fatalities caused by the viral infection are also reducing. On Monday, the city had recorded a maximum of 448 deaths in a day. In the last two days, the number of daily deaths has reduced to 338 and 311, respectively. According to a health bulletin issued by the Delhi government, the capital recorded 20,960 new cases on Wednesday from 79,491 tests conducted in 24 hours. On Tuesday, 19,953 new cases were recorded. “Till about last week, we used to get 200 to 250 requests daily for admissions. Now, we are getting around 150-150 such requests daily,” Dr Suresh Kumar, director of Lok Nayak Hospital, said. He added that the recovery rate has gone up. In the last one week, officials said, more than one lakh people have recovered from the infection. “The lockdown has really helped reduce the spread of the disease. It should continue for a few more days,” the official said. Many epidemiologists also stress on the need to increase testing. Now, the total number of tests being conducted in the city is around 70,000 to 80,000. It is low, they say. “Home collection of samples is not happening. Most labs refused to do so, citing unavailability of staff or too many samples to process. I know many people who have recovered at home without getting any test done at all,” Pradeep Yadav, a resident of Sadiq Nagar said. The number of active cases in Delhi is 91,859. There are a total of 21,805 Covid beds of which 20,233 are occupied. The total number of ICU beds is 5,348 of which 5,303 are occupied. “The Delhi Corona app often shows vacant beds at some hospitals. But when we call on the numbers mentioned, the hospital either does not receive calls or refuses to entertain citing unavailability of beds,” said Shikha Sharma, who lives in Malviya Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ray-of-hope-positivity-rate-down-to-26/articleshow/82417017.cms||---

Mayor Amarjit Singh alias Jeeti Sidhu had organised the camp in which 700 people were vaccinated. Social distancing was given a toss, as people shook hands and chatted with each other while they waited for their turn in queues. Kirandeep Kaur, a resident of Phase VII, said, “Though the move is appreciable, no one here is adhering to the Covid protocol. Neither any of the health officials nor the police staff are checking people standing close to each other.” People also complained they were made to wait for over three hours. Kushdeep Singh, another resident, said, “We came here at 10.30 am. After getting walk-in registration, we had to wait for three hours before to get vaccinated. Doctors had no reason to make us wait and give vaccination to those who came with recommendations.” A total of 7000 vaccinations were administered on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/at-vax-centres-people-flirt-with-virus-danger/articleshow/82416985.cms||---

The state registered 57,640 cases and 920 deaths, while Mumbai registered 3,882 cases and 77 deaths -- a 35% and 20% rise, respectively, within a 24-hour period. The total Covid caseload of the state surged to 48.8 lakh while the total fatalities touched 72,662. The daily case fatality rate of the state was 1.6% on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the pandemic’s tally in the city has climbed to 6.6 lakh and toll to 13,511 from March 2020. Of the 77 deaths in Mumbai on Wednesday, 31 were in the 40 to 60 age group while 40 were in the 60-plus age group. Concerns were raised regarding high deaths in certain districts of the state. An official said that with the cases in the state plateauing, it will take over two weeks for deaths to stabilise. The bed situation in many districts still remains crunched and only once the demand for critical care beds reduces will the fatalities start to decline. Districts like Nashik reported 101 deaths, Pune 93, Solapur 75 and Nagpur 57. On the positive side, the number of active cases in Mumbai continued to dip (56,153), the recovery rate climbed to 90%, and the doubling rate soared to 123 days (from 40 days a month back). The number of vacant ICU beds in the city increased from 100 to 120 in a 24-hour span. A quarter of the 11,000-plus oxygen-support beds are vacant. Experts said stringent public health efforts and measures need to continue in the city. “Mumbai needs to do more testing. Identify high-risk contacts and test them so that new cases can be detected quickly and patients isolated,” said Dr Rahul Pandit who heads the ICU department of Fortis Hospital, Mulund, and is a member of the state government's task force on Covid-19. While the second wave in Mumbai is ebbing, he said the “thick tail” associated with the city's Covid graph is a spot of worry. “We saw the last time as well that the daily caseload doesn’t decline sharply in Mumbai and stays high, though steady, for a long time,” he said. Regarding Maharashtra, Dr Pandit said the rate of growth in seven to eight districts had dropped. “Around four districts are still witnessing a rise. It will be May-end before a decline will be apparent across the state.” Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said some districts have reported a dip in cases, while cases in certain districts were slowly rising. “There is also a dip in active cases, but we should not let our guard down. We are at a very important point right now and any carelessness will undo all that we have achieved so far,” said Thackeray. He also said that the Supreme Court has appreciated the steps taken by Maharashtra and the BMC in handling the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/cases-deaths-rise-in-maharashtra-after-3-day-dips/articleshow/82422580.cms||Malathy Iyer

Reddy is a co-accused in RFO Deepali Chavan’s suicide case. Reddy was remanded to 14-magisterial custody by a Dharni court on Saturday last and was sent to Central Jail here. The court had earlier refused an anticipatory bail to him last month. Reddy was arrested last Wednesday from Nagpur and produced before the Dharni court the next day. He was sent to two-day police custody after which he was remanded to magisterial custody. District government pleader Parikshit Ganorkar argued that the Chavan suicide case was a serious matter where the deceased was mentally tortured for more than a year as per her suicide note. “Hence, the accused should not be granted bail until the ongoing probe is completed or charge sheet filed,” he said. Ganorkar, who is assisted by Bhola Chavan, DA Navale and Govind Vichore, further pleaded that the statements of witnesses are being recorded and the investigation started just 40 days ago. “If bail is granted, there is every possibility of probe getting hampered and witnesses being pressurised to turn hostile,” he said. Reddy's counsel pleaded for bail saying that he is a senior government officer who is not going to go anywhere. “The police know his residence and he has co-operated with the cops. The investigation may last long and charge sheet will then follow. What is the need to keep him in jail until then,” he argued. The police have been asked to submit their affidavit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/court-rejects-forester-reddys-bail-plea/articleshow/82417006.cms||---

He also said that the Supreme Court has appreciated the steps taken by Maharashtra and the BMC in handling the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/cases-deaths-rise-in-maharashtra-after-3-day-dips/articleshow/82422581.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Standup comedian booked for defamatory video on doctors||MUMBAI: Comedian and Bollywood actor Sunil Pal has been booked for allegedly posting a video on social media a fortnight back claiming that 90% of doctors dressed in “demon suits” scare Covid patients from morning till evening, and by end of the day the person dies of fear. Pal claimed these doctors are thieves who do not care for the poor. Andheri police registered an FIR against Pal on May 4 based on a complaint by Dr Sushmita Bhatnagar (55), president of Association of Medical Consultants (Mumbai), after watching the video, first noticed by chairman Dr Sudhir Naik on April 20. Pal told TOI, “I have uploaded another video apologising if anyone felt hurt. But I stand by my comments as doctors were considered as God. During these tough times, poor people are made to suffer and I have mentioned in the video 90% of doctors are dressed in demons and the rest are doing their duty to serve people. There is no need for doctors to feel hurt if they are doing their duty sincerely. I have not get any police notice so far.” Dr Bhatnagar, who was in her Andheri office on April 20 when she came across the defamatory video, said he also alleged in it that doctors were involved in a human organ scam. Andheri senior inspector Vijay Belge said Pal was booked under Indian Penal Code sections 500 (defamation) and 505 (2) (public mischief). No arrest has been made. “Action will be initiated after collection of evidence,” said another officer. An Andheri officer said according to the complainant, Pal made a controversial statement against the doctors treating coronavirus and made a video in which he called most of the doctors as ‘thieves’ and said that the treatment of coronavirus was being massively rigged and that under the pretext of treatment unscrupulous doctors were robbing poor patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-comedian-booked-for-defamatory-video-on-docs/articleshow/82418437.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Nagpur||Govt reluctant to take virus by horns: HC||Nagpur: After the repeated failure of Maharashtra government to comply with its directives, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday, slammed it for not being serious on fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. “Unfortunately, many of our directives have remained on paper and have not seen their being translated into reality. We’re of the opinion that there is, for some unknown reason, reluctance or apprehension of the state to take the virus by its horns and overcome it by all means. If it were not so, many of the directions issued from time to time would have been followed long back,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said. The bench said while the government doesn’t provide any effective solution, it also doesn’t accept the HC’s solution. Shreerang Bhandarkar is the amicus curiae in this suo motu plea. He is assisted by Nidhi Dayani. Pointing out that it had noticed patients’ cries for help for beds and lifesaving drugs like Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Ivermectin, low molecular weight Heparin and others, along with oxygen and Covid essentials supply, the judges said all those were falling on deaf ears. “That was the time when there was a steep surge in Covid cases and also an alarming rise in deaths. It was being heard that many deaths were accelerated due to unavailability of oxygenated or ventilator equipped beds or non-availability of medical oxygen or essential drugs, especially Remdesivir injections,” they said. The judges said they had urged the government several times to inform about the plan and strategy devised by it for combating the pandemic on war-footing and specific arrangements about availability of beds, oxygen and lifesaving drugs. “There were also ground level difficulties experienced by the local authorities and no help was forthcoming from the government.” With growing complaints about private hospitals charging excessively from the Covid-19 patients, the HC constituted a ‘grievance committee’. It would be headed by justice MN Gilani and justice MG Giratkar would be its member along with civil surgeon Dr Paturkar and sub-divisional officer Shekhar Gadge. The judges clarified that no criminal action would be taken without the committee’s approval. “If any complaints regarding payment/non-payment of the charges of any hospital are received, those be referred to the committee. The members shall examine those complaints. If necessary, shall call upon the concerned hospital to place before it all the details of the treatment given and accordingly, take its decision,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govt-reluctant-to-take-virus-by-horns-hc/articleshow/82417047.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Chandigarh||Many patients under home isolation are avoiding calls from health dept: DC||Mohali: With the rising number of Covid-19 positive cases, the Mohali administration has started contacting patients under home isolation through automated IVR calls wherein patients are asked to update their health status. “However, 20% patients do not respond or attend to the calls either due to ignorance or due to doubts about the credibility of the call,” said deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan. Making it clear to the public that the IVR calls on behalf of the administration are being made to Covid-19 patients from telephone number 01726132106, the deputy commissioner asked people to not mark the number as spam because that may lead others to doubt the authenticity of the calls. He said, “Besides, it is an outbound calling facility i.e. one-way call only and there is no facility to call back on the number. Patients can call to the Covid-19 control room if there is a need.” The deputy commissioner also clarified that the IVR calls are made to patients around 5 pm, but if a patient fails to attend to it, he/she is called again at 6 pm. In case, there is no response to the second call, a third attempt is made at 7 pm. The calls are made daily for 14 days of home isolation period. If patient updates his/her status which required medical help, then the system flags it ‘red’ and a team of doctors respond to the patient. The software technological support for the IVR system is being provided by NGO StepOne. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/many-patients-under-home-isolation-are-avoiding-calls-from-health-dept-dc/articleshow/82417105.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Just under a lakh get jabs in Maharashtra||Mumbai: The crisis at the vaccination centres and the chaotic scenes outside are likely to persist on Thursday. BMC’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said the 1 lakh doses received on Tuesday could run out by Thursday, in which case vaccination could suffer in some centres. She said the state has assured that Mumbai will be given more doses on Thursday, but there is no clarity on the volumes. The vaccination momentum has been hit in the state too, where daily vaccinations have dropped under a lakh from an average of 2.5 lakh to 3 lakh vaccinations. On Wednesday, merely 98,150 were vaccinated across Maharashtra. Kandivli resident Chintan Mukherjee (59) said he reached the BKC centre along with his 52-year-old wife around 9am only to find a sea of people waiting outside the main entrance. “The gates were shut since the vaccine doses had not reached. After the vaccine vials came only around 9.30am, hundreds tried to enter the premises,” he said, adding the barricades gave away and many senior citizens fell on each other. A doctor said his 79-year-old father went to BKC in desperation since he has not managed to get the second shot after completing nearly two and half months of the first dose. Dr Rajesh Dere, dean of BKC, said the majority of people above 45-plus continue to come without registration and stand in queue since morning. Dr Gomare said that youngsters in families should help the elderly to register on the application. Dere said on Wednesday they managed to vaccinate 6,800 people after receiving the doses arrived at 9.20am. Gomare added that to tackle overcrowding, BMC was willing to tie up with private hospitals, provided the latter was willing to vaccinate for free using their own manpower. “It will be a big service to the city,” she said. Another vaccination centre head said the BMC should shut down vaccination for a fortnight till there are adequate doses. “It’s a nightmare for us since we have 1,000-2,000 doses, but there are double or triple the number of people waiting,” the incharge said. Dr Dilip Patil, head of state immunisation, said the 9 lakh doses received from the Centre have been distributed among all districts and the state was expecting another 4 lakh doses. Dr Raj Gehlot, district health officer of Chandrapur, said vaccination has slowed down due to staggered supply and low allocation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/just-under-a-lakh-get-jabs-in-maharashtra/articleshow/82418496.cms||---
---||Nagpur||City youths develop ‘vaccine tracker’ software code||Nagpur: Three youths have written a software code to track available vaccine slots and sends details on Telegram mobile app. Launched on Monday, this service is currently available only for Nagpur, Mumbai and Pune, with plans to expand soon. Suchdeep Singh Juneja, Likhit Agrawal and Alisha Nathani are co-founders of this free-to-use service, which aims to save time for end users. Juneja said, “Currently, those who wish to get vaccinated keep searching for available slots on Co-Win site or app. So you may have to sit in front of your screen for hours at end and constantly refresh the window while searching for a clinic.” It’s this tedious process that these three electronic engineers have found a way around. Nathani said they have used the application programming interface (API) put in public domain by the central government as a tool to communicate with the server, where information about vaccine is available. “So now, instead of a human being constantly sitting on a computer and searching for vaccine slots, we have the software code doing the same thing for us. And it’s doing it constantly 24/7,” said Nathani. Agrawal said, “Our code communicates with the server and gets information about available slots. It then puts that data in a readable text format and publishes it in our Telegram app channel called ‘Nagpur Vaccine Tracker’. Similarly, people can go to Mumbai and Pune vaccine tracker channels and subscribe to get updates in real time.” The message which flashes on the Telegram channel informs about the centre’s name, pin code, date of availability, name of vaccine, eligibility age group and whether it’s free or paid. Juneja said, “The end user then simply has to enter the pin code in Co-Win site and choose the specific centre, as we have already provided the name. So this is clearly a much faster process for everyone.” Though the trio wants to expand their service, there are technical issues. Agrawal said, “Currently we are running the entire thing from our home laptop. To expand, we need a bigger server, more power to ensure 24/7 operations. And this is a free service, so if someone is willing to collaborate and pitch-in, we can expand to other cities as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-youths-develop-vaccine-tracker-software-code/articleshow/82417096.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Congress floor leader in the assembly Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka said people were dying in large numbers in the state due to non-availability of oxygen, beds with ventilators, shortage of medicines and vaccination. Scores of other patients are suffering for want of medicines, beds with ventilators and oxygen. “I am seeking the appointment of KCR.

---||Nagpur||More deaths but fewer sales at shops selling ‘maiyat ka samaan’||Nagpur: Even if Covid is taking away lives, it has not set the cash registers ringing for shops selling ‘maiyat ka samaan’ or items used in last rites. Rather, the lockdown has made bidding a final goodbye costlier for all faiths alike. Rates of a number of items, ranging from cloth to make shrouds to wood for coffin to even camphor used in cremations and burials alike, have gone up, said the traders. The shops selling such stuff are at places like Gokulpeth market, close to Hindu crematoria or opposite Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). Relatives of the Covid victims hardly buy anything, says Vijay Chavan, who has a shop close to GMCH. “There is no need for the wooden stretcher, shroud or other items. The body wrapped in plastic is only handled by NMC workers. Some do stop to buy some flowers or may be raal powder, which is used flare up the pyre.” There are not many non-Covid bodies these days, he says. Raal is Rs100 per kg these days, up from Rs70 earlier, said another seller. Sanjay Shende has his shop right opposite GMCH gate. “Normally, we used to sell an entire package for Rs1,200 or so. This included shroud, stretcher and other sundry items. Flowers were free. Now, as materials are not easily available, the cost has gone up. A reel of cloth that used to come for Rs1,200 is now Rs1,800. I have increased the rates to Rs1,700,” he says. Kin of the Covid deceased don’t buy items worth more than Rs200 to 300, he said. Among the items on display at the shops were a few drums. Some communities traditionally engage 1-2 person bands during funeral processions. The practice has been nearly stopped due to the curbs. It has left those like Prabhakar Wankhede struggling. “I am from the Matang community, we play music during funerals. I got 5 to 6 orders in the entire last year. There was none in the previous month. Now I am doing odd jobs at the last rites shop to survive,” he says. Certain items like shrouds are being used for even Covid bodies, says Jamil Faroqh, a seller at Mominpura. Cloth that was available for Rs90 a meter is now at Rs110. The biggest increase is in price of camphor, which is used during last rites. Of course, the sales have easily doubled on account of deaths due to Covid, he says. At Christian cemeteries, the Covid bodies are kept in a coffin before being lowered into the grave. “The plastic sheet is not opened and the body is directly put into the coffin,” said Nelson Francis, a social worker. Vijay Michael, who makes coffins, says prices of wood and even nails have gone up. “It’s most difficult to get nails for coffins due to the lockdown. Earlier, I used to earn Rs1,200 on each coffin. The margin is down to Rs700 odd,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/more-deaths-but-fewer-sales-at-shops-selling-maiyat-ka-samaan/articleshow/82417131.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Pune||No stop on first doses for 45+ in Pune, 30% of vaccine stock set aside for category||PUNE: District health authorities on Wednesday said first doses of the Covid vaccines are being administered to citizens aged 45 and above in Pune, along with second doses. They made the clarification after reports emerged that officials have prioritised second shots for beneficiaries in the region. Officials from the PMC also said that CoWIN appointments are now mandatory for people in the 45-plus category. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “As per state government guidelines, nearly 30% of the existing stock of vaccines in Pune district can be used to give people their first shot. So the rest of the 70% stock has to be used for second doses. Many hospitals are giving priority to second doses as those due for the follow-up have been regularly visiting these sites.” According to state guidelines for the 45-plus vaccination drive, districts are to utilise the central supply of vaccines by keeping a 70:30 ratio of second and first doses. The guidelines added that further distribution of vaccines to districts will depend on previous allocation of the second dose and its performance. Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner in the PMC, said, “Priority is being given to those who are due for their second dose because Pune city has nearly 55,000 people in the 45-plus category who have completed the 45-day period between two Covishield doses. All of these beneficiaries had received their first shots before March 20. But at the same time, we are also giving first-time beneficiaries their dose of the vaccine.” She added, “What is now mandatory for people seeking their first shots (including those in the 45-plus age group) is that they have to come to the vaccination site with confirmed appointments. Walk-ins for first dose beneficiaries in any age group are no longer allowed. This is being done to streamline the process and stop crowding outside vaccination sites.” In Mumbai too, those seeking a first dose in the two age categories (18 to 44 and 45-plus) can now only get it after a CoWIN appointment. Data provided by Pune district officials has shown that nearly 12 lakh targeted beneficiaries, who are aged 45 and above, are yet to get their first dose of the Covid vaccines. An official from the Sasoon General Hospital said, “Many times, those who want their first dose simply walk in and get the shot, while those due for the second dose lose out, even though it is important to give the shot to the latter before the deadline ends. That’s why we now have the 70:30 ratio.” Deshmukh said that there is a possibility of a higher quota of vaccine doses coming to Pune district during the second week of May, as per communication between the state, the Centre and vaccine manufacturers. “We have received very erratic supply over the last 15 days. To compensate for that, we expect to get higher supplies soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-stop-on-first-doses-for-45-30-of-vax-stock-set-aside-for-category/articleshow/82417117.cms||Neha Madaan

The ‘packers’ claimed they had no idea about the product given by the contractor Manish Keshwani. Late in the night, police filed an FIR against Keshwani under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act. Keshwani had taken most of the packed testing kits the previous night, said additional municipal commissioner Varuna Juikar. During the raid, the officials found a few packets with the name ‘Bio Swab’ written on them. “No company named Bio Swab is registered with the FDA. The seized packets did not have any batch number or manufacturing or expiry date,” an FDA official told TOI. “Only after police nab Keshwani will we be able find out which company was manufacturing the kits and where they were to be supplied.” Dr Rupinder Murjani, who runs a private lab in Kalyan, said FDA should take strict action against those who gave such crucial testing products for packaging to people without instructions on the protocol as it could compromise test-takers’ Covid results. Dr Yuvraj Bhadane, PRO of UMC, said, “Our health department has appealed to private labs, doctors and medical associations not to use testing ki-ts manufactured by Bio Swab.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-fda-raids-ulhas-huts-seizes-test-kits-packed-sans-protocol/articleshow/82418541.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Kolkata||Decoding the verdict: Trinamool widens gap with BJP in Kolkata municipal corporation wards; leads in 132, trails in 12||KOLKATA: The City of Joy voted overwhelmingly in favour of Trinamool Congress in the just-concluded assembly polls.  A ward-wise analysis of all 144 Kolkata wards reveals that the TMC has won in 132 of them, leaving just 12 to the opposition. This is in sharp contrast to the Lok Sabha elections just two years ago, when opposition was ahead of the party in 53 wards. A detailed analysis carried out by TMC leaders show that of the 84 wards in south Kolkata and and added areas, the party has lost just 3 wards. And in north, the opposition is ahead in 9 of the total 60 wards.  TMC has lost 2 wards in Bhowanipore, 1 in Rashbehari, 5 in Jorasanko, 2 at Shyampukur and 1 each in Maniktala and Chowringhee. The BJP leads in 11 of these wards and Congress in Ward 45 that is represented by influential leader Santosh Kumar Pathak. In 2019, BJP led in 51 wards. The dominance, perhaps, is most complete in the added areas. Across the constituencies of Behala, Kasba, Jadavpur and Tollygunge, TMC has not lost a single ward. The same holds true for Ballygunge constituency in the south and the Cossipore-Belgachhia in the north, where former deputy mayor Atin Ghosh came out with flying colours. The two wards where Bhowanipore candidate Sovandeb Chatterjee trailed his BJP rival Rudranil Ghosh were wards 70 and 74, consisting old Bhowanipore (Jadubabu’s Bazaar) and Alipore. Chatterjee eventually won with a margin of 28,719 votes.  The recovery in Rashbehari has been stunning too. Barring Ward 87 — consisting Mudiali and a cosmopolitan area without a slum — the TMC has won in other areas. In Ward 73, the home turf of CM Mamata Banerjee, the TMC nominees trailed both in 2014 and 2019 LS polls.  But this time, Trinamool insiders said, the party had a “healthy lead” here. The party has managed to secure a lead in the wards of five MMiCs — Debasish Kumar (Ward 85), Ratan De (Ward 93), Tarak Singh (Ward 118), Swapan Samaddar (Ward 58) and Ram Pyare Ram (Ward 79) — where it was trailing in 2019. In Jorasanko, however, the TMC is behind the BJP in 5 wards — 22, 23, 25, 27 and 42 — consisting areas like Posta, Jorasanko, Girish Park and Rambagan, despite Vivek Gupta securing a win from here for TMC.  The two wards at Shyampukur where TMC failed to secure leads were 21 and 24. The lone exception in Maniktala, where Sadhan Pande won, was Ward 31 comprising Kankurgachhi. “We will concentrate on winning all those wards where we are trailing. Mamata Banerjee has brought development to the masses through welfare schemes and it has paid rich dividends,” said Rashbehari MLA Debasish Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trinamool-widens-gap-with-bjp-in-kmc-wards-leads-in-132-trails-in-12/articleshow/82417166.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

In the last few days, many posts have gone viral on social media offering children, whose parents died of coronavirus, for adoption. Police have urged people, who are interested in adoption, to follow the due procedure as per law and alert them about any such offers being made by unscrupulous elements. Delhi Police has also continued its crackdown against people indulging in blackmarketing of Covid-related stuff. In New Friends Colony, a taxi driver and a nursing student were held for selling oxygen cylinders in black. Ambulance drivers were held in Jaitpur and Bharat Nagar for overcharging customers. They were demanding Rs 5,000-10,000 for a distance of around ten kilometres. In South West district, a man selling Remdesivir injections for Rs 45,000 each was arrested. In Shahdara, three people were arrested for selling fire extinguisher cylinders as oxygen cylinders.

---||Hyderabad||Millers, officials force T govt to foot rice bill||Hyderabad: Telangana has failed to deliver one lakh metric tonnes of rice to Food Corporation of India (FCI) for the 2019-20 crop year. The Centre, which gave extension up to six months for delivery of rice, has now turned down the request of the state government to give further extension. The Union food and public distribution ministry has shot off a letter to the Civil Supplies Corporation stating that now it was the responsibility of the state government to dispose of one lakh metric tonnes of rice on its own. The rice is worth about Rs 350 crore. Now, the state government has to bear this financial burden. The FCI would have made the payment to the Civil Supplies Corporation if the rice was delivered to it. It is upon payment by FCI that the Civil Supplies Corporation in turn pays banks, from which it obtained loans to procure paddy from farmers and towards payments to rice millers. Enquiries revealed that the delay on the part of the rice millers to give back custom-milled rice to the state government was the reason for Telangana failing to contribute 70,000 metric tonnes of rice to the central pool of FCI. There were also allegations that a number of rice millers, who enjoy a tacit understanding with some corporation officials, had not returned the custom-milled rice. In several instances, millers have sold the rice in the open market. The state government gives paddy, procured from farmers, to the rice millers to mill it and give it back to the Corporation. “Civil Supplies Corporation needs a regular and an efficient officer. Earlier, IPS officers CV Anand and Akun Sabharwal had headed the corporation and had broken the nexus between millers and officials. It needs to be done again,” a source said. Telangana Rice Millers’ Association leader Mohan Reddy said they were being made scapegoats. “The government does not have enough warehousing capacity to take back rice from us. Why would we hold back government rice when we want space in our mills to store fine rice purchased by us to be sold in the market,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/millers-officials-force-t-govt-to-foot-rice-bill/articleshow/82418494.cms||Roushan Ali

She said, “10 such people have received certificates. The data entry operator mistakenly clicked the wrong tick. We have rectified the glitch. We have told all the 10 persons to come and get vaccinated. We have shifted the data entry operator to another place.” The problem was detected after a Chandigarh resident complained regarding vaccinated certificate being issued after he registered his mother for the first dose.

---||Lucknow||It’s duty before self for docs in pandemic||Lucknow: Despite being diagnosed with Covid-19 and admitted to the hospital along with her husband and son, Dr Jalees Fatima would often don the PPE suit, take the rounds of Covid wards and discuss treatment protocol with peers and juniors. Putting duty before self, doctors like her continue to help patients whose numbers are getting disproportionately higher with each passing day than the hands available in hospitals. “While the three of us had to be hospitalised because of our serious conditions, the other two children of mine who were also Covid-19 positive, remained in home isolation. My daughter prepared for her examination while looking after her younger brother. I was in an unimaginable traumatic condition, but after seeing deaths and suffering of patients, I could not stop myself from offering whatever help I could in that situation,” said Dr Fatima, head of medicine department at Era’s Lucknow Medical College. She has been discharged from the hospital and is currently in home-isolation with her family. Covid control room incharge at RMLIMS, Dr Gaurav Gupta, has been handling the set-up alone for the last 12 days now as the remaining three members have contracted Covid-19. “From admission of patients to their transfer from one ward/facility to another and overseeing oxygen requirements, I have not gone home since the second wave began in April as it would put my family to risk,” said Dr Gupta, currently living out of his office space. While workload has increased manifold, what keeps doctors going is that their effort is saving lives. “A patient came in with 90% oxygen, which suddenly dropped to 60%, and he had to put on BiPAP machine. He recovered after seven days. The smile on his face while leaving was oxygen for me,” Dr Gupta said. Head of medicine department and Covid incharge, KGMU, Prof Virendra Atam has not met his 12-year old son and mother for the past 45 days, though they live in the same house. He and his family were infected two months ago but he is back in the ward again after recovery. “On reaching home, I isolate myself to keep the family safe as they can acquire infection from me,” he said. Besides being physically demanding, seeing people suffer from close quarters is mentally challenging too. “Every patient ultimately needs an ICU which requires specialised manpower, but staff is also getting infected in the line of duty. It’s mentally traumatic but it slips away when we see patients suffering,” said Dr Atam. Another doctor at KGMU’s medicine department has been consulting Covid patients on call. He recently lost his mother and brother-in-law to the disease but continues to help patients keeping all personal tragedies aside. “It’s my duty to serve patients at this hour of crisis,” he said. A senior surgeon at RMLIMS has been treating his elderly father, who has acute appendicitis, at home because taking him to hospital is not safe at the moment. Besides, his 32 relatives contracted Covid-19 in the last few days and all approached him for medication. “I am on Covid duty. It is satisfying to serve patients and family, but tremendously exhausting as human beings,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/its-duty-before-self-for-docs-in-pandemic/articleshow/82418548.cms||---

Daryapur-based associate professor Dr Atul Bodkhe has recorded a male ‘ant spider’ (Tropizodium viridurbium) in Melghat for the first time. The first record of a female ant spider (Araneae: Zodariidae) in 2016 was in Aranya Park near Palaj in Gandhinagar (Gujarat) by Prajapati Murthappa, and two others. However, Dr Bodkhe and his co-investigators recorded both male and female ant spiders from the Tapi river basin near Rangubeli, Dharkhora Buralghat, and Nawab Nala, Ghatang. Melghat is home to over 204 species of spiders. “Though the species was recorded in 2019 summer, it took two years for further research about morphology, confirmation, and review from global scientists,” Dr Bodkhe told TOI. Bodkhe said the male is 3.6-mm-long and the female 4.1-mm-long. It feeds on small ants and termites in the litter. “According to our observation, more species of ant spiders will be recorded from the same area of Melghat forest,” he adds. All the morphological study was done at Spider Research Laboratory at the JD Patil Sangludkar Mahavidyalaya, Daryapur. The lab has till now discovered 17 new species of spiders. Bodkhe, who heads the spider lab, said the research was part of MoEFCC project ‘Microhabitat utilization pattern of spiders from Satpura Landscape’, and conducted in Satpura and Melghat tiger reserves. The other investigators included scientists Dr VP Uniyal and Dr Shazia Quasin of Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Subhash Kamble, Dr Gajanan Santape, Dr Mahesh Chikhale, and Dr Sawan Deshmukh. The research paper was published in Serket, an arachnological bulletin of Middle East and North Africa. Bodkhe said the species is also called ant spider because it looks like an ant, and is member of the family Zodariidae. This spider species is ground-dwelling and found under leaf litter. It is fully nocturnal and hence very difficult to record. “Total 12 species from genus Tropizodium have been recorded in the world. Out of this, five species exist in India. The present distribution of the spider genus is found in Hawaii, French Polynesia, Bali, China, Pakistan, Thailand, and the northern territory of Australia,” he stated. Wildlife conservationist Kishor Rithe hailed the research saying, “Arachnids and insects rarely draw the interest of naturalists, forget about the common people. However, their contribution to the ecosystem goes unnoticed. They keep the soil healthy and maintain the balance of the insect population. More people should come forward to do research on this topic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/melghat-reports-1st-male-ant-spider-in-country/articleshow/82417264.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The SHO along with other police personnel was out on the roads when he kicked the vend, apparently without any provocation. Kapurthala SSP Kanwardeep Kaur said as soon as the video reached her, she placed him under suspension and a departmental inquiry was ordered against him. “Such behaviour with people is simply not acceptable,” she said, adding that police officers contributed form their pockets to compensate the loss of the vendor. Reacting to the incident, Punjab DGP tweeted on Wednesday evening, “Absolutely shameful; and unacceptable. I have suspended the SHO Phagwara. Such misbehaviour will not be tolerated at any cost and those who indulge in it will have to face serious consequences.” The video embarrassed the police brass. Last year also when lockdown was ordered in March videos of police personnel brutally thrashing people came out and chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had to issue a warning against such incidents. The suspended SHO said for the last two days they had been asking vendors to fan out to localities to avoid a crowd. He said on Tuesday eight vendors had tested positive in rapid tests and whenever police would go there, they would simply run awaym leaving their rehris or vends there as police would not seize anything. “Today, we came with an MC team and again they ran away,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/phagwara-sho-misbehaves-with-vendor-suspended-he-says-they-had-been-running-away/articleshow/82421191.cms||---

The Pune city police have 774 police officers and 7,900 police constables. Additional commissioner of police (administration) Jalindar Supekar said, “We have to expedite the process of allotment of the second dose of vaccine to the police personnel.” As many as 2,195 personnel contracted the virus in the last one year while 17 succumbed to the infection. At present, 352 police personnel are admitted to different hospitals. “Only pregnant women police constables and few other policemen, suffering from other ailments, have not taken the first dose of the vaccine,” Supekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-7k-pune-cops-receive-first-vaccine/articleshow/82417201.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: For many, it’s a 100-km trip to villages as bookings overwhelm urban centres||PUNE: Several citizens in the 18-44 vaccination group are now looking at sites in rural areas as urban centres continue to record high vaccination bookings. Officials from the district health office said beneficiaries from Pune city and Pimpri Chinchwad seem to be willing to drive to sites in Baramati and Junnar — at least a 100 km away. State immunization officer, DN Patil, confirmed the trend. “In fact, I recently received a call from a person who had travelled to a vaccination site in Palghar district from Thane. There are several such examples. Vaccination slots in urban centres are getting booked quickly,” he said, adding that as per guidelines, a vaccine beneficiary can get his/her shot in any part of the country. Bhagwan Pawar, district health officer with the Pune zilla parishad, said many sites in rural areas are now receiving beneficiaries from urban areas. In some rural areas, residents said their sites should serve locals first. However, those traveling from the cities said prioritising local residents would be unfair. “We have no choice. If we can’t find a slot in the city, it’s our right to look for alternatives,” said a resident of Kothrud in Pune city. Pune district collector, Rajesh Deshmukh, said, “We are in this situation because of vaccine shortages in the region. But people should not oppose these trips being made by people from urban areas. We urge citizens not to indulge such arguments.” Pimpri resident Avinash Nikam said, “Recently, our group was stopped by locals in Rajgurunanagar who said we were taking away their quota of vaccine doses. I found their argument to be baseless. Once we complete the registration process, there shouldn’t be any problems. I request authorities here to intervene.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/for-many-its-a-100-km-trip-to-villages-as-bookings-overwhelm-urban-centres/articleshow/82417184.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The 100-bed BRD hospital in Mahanagar has got Rs 96 lakh for installation of a ‘pressure swing adsorption’ (PSA) oxygen plant. The hospital has also been given Rs 19 lakh for laying a pipeline for oxygen to be provided to patients on the bedside. Besides, Rs 17.4 lakh has been given for other services such as X-ray machines and CR system. The PSA plant will manufacture oxygen and help the hospital become self-sufficient in their requirement for medical oxygen and its dependency on supply from other hospitals and other medical gas suppliers will be over. On the other hand, Rs 18.6 lakh has been allocated to the microbiology department of RMLIMS for a machine that can conduct Covid-19 test through RT-PCR method.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tandon-gives-rs-1-5-crore-for-health-infra/articleshow/82418535.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bidhannagar seat in bag, TMC takes a 350-vote lead in Salt Lake area||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress’s Sujit Bose has defeated BJP’s Sabyasachi Dutta by 7,997 votes in the Bidhannagar assembly segment but the party is treading cautiously as far as the forthcoming Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections are concerned. The party has managed to wipe out a 19,000-vote deficit it had suffered in Salt Lake wards in the Lok Sabha polls in 2019 and taken a slender lead of 350 votes. As per the 2021 assembly election results, Trinamool is trailing BJP in eight of the 14 Salt Lake wards. In the other six, however, the party has taken handsome leads. Trinamool got maximum leads from wards 35 to 37. A lead of 1,450 votes was secured in Ward 36 and close to 2,000 votes in Ward 37. It has also managed a slender lead in ward 40. But losses in wards 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 38, 39 and 41 will keep the party a bit worried. Just before the elections, a number of former heavyweight Trinamool councillors of BMC and South Dum Dum Municipality, like Debashis Jana and Mriganka Bhattacharya, had left Trinamool and shifted to BJP. BJP has secured lead from Jana's ward. The likes of Sabyasachi Dutta, Anupam Dutta and Asesh Mukherjee had joined BJP much earlier. The local BJP leadership would be trying to cash on their experience in the forthcoming BMC elections. Bidhannagar MLA Sujit Bose said a fitting reply was given to BJP and the results would be better in upcoming elections. “I was saying from the beginning that I would get people’s blessings,” he said. “The outcome of the assembly election results in Bidhannagar constituency was unexpected. We had expected more leads from Salt Lake and its adjacent places. The party leadership would be assessing the causes of this result,” said a local BJP leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bidhannagar-seat-in-bag-tmc-takes-a-350-vote-lead-in-salt-lake-area/articleshow/82417251.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Pune||Task force stands firm on minimal CT scans for patients with mild symptoms||Pune: The state Covid-19 task force head Sanjay Oak has said their guidelines for CT scans in April had advised discretion of treating doctors while telling patients to undergo scans.Another task force member Rahul Pandit told TOI that the recommendations largely suggests that only a clinician should recommend a CT scan and citizens should not carry them out on their own.Central task force member and AIIMS director R Guleria had advised against CT scans and biomarker tests in case of mild symptoms. Nagpur-based pulmonologist Rajesh Swarnakar said specific guidelines given by the Centre for Disease Control have to be followed. “Some patients come with three CT scans done in 10 days which is unnecessary and not devoid of radiation exposure risk. Moreover, they come with reports on their cellphones and do not show films which actually is required to see the type of lesion. CT should be done on the fifth or sixth day when inflammation really begins to show,” he added.State health minister Rajesh Tope said the scans will be monitored. Rajlaxmi Devkar, member of Indian Radiology Association, told TOI that occasional radiation exposure for diagnostics is minimal and does not increase the risk of cancer. “When the RTPCR is negative and there is deterioration clincially, only an HRCT scan will show the evidence of disease. HRCT in the second week for patients with moderate to severe symptoms has helped,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/task-force-stands-firm-on-minimal-ct-scans-for-patients-with-mild-symptoms/articleshow/82417253.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Pune rural has 25 sites for this age group, the PMC has five and officials in Pimpri Chinchwad have reserved eight centres. The increase comes after many citizens reported that slots are being booked within seconds. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said slot availability will improve once the region gets more vaccine doses. Ashish Bharati, the PMC's health department chief, said considering the large turnouts in the 18-44 category, the civic body has decided to open bookings at 8pm for the next day's sessions at designated hospitals. In Pimpri Chinchwad, officials urged citizens to book appointments for the next day at 7.30 pm the previous day. Bhagwan Pawar, district health officer with the Pune zilla parishad said they will open online slots for the 18-44 group between 3pm and 4pm every day. Baner resident Sneha Bokil said she's been trying to book a slot for a while now. “The slots vanish in seconds. And this has been the experience for many of my friends as well,” she said. On Wednesday, nearly 61,426 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the district, thanks to fresh vaccine stock that arrived late on Tuesday night. Pune rural topped the list with a total of 33,512 vaccinations, followed by PMC (14,179) and PCMC (13,735).

It also directed district magistrates to supervise the process strictly. As per the order, which comes into force from today, all persons/individuals requiring oxygen for home isolation patients will need to apply on delhi.gov.in with a valid photo ID, Aadhar Card details, Covid positive report and other documents indicating the actual need for the oxygen. District magistrates will ensure that the applications are scrutinised properly and the applicants issued e-passes quickly. “Based on stock availability at a dealer, the DM will issue a pass containing the date, time and address of the dealer from where oxygen can be issued/exchanged. However, DMs will also need to ensure that committed supplies of the refilling plants for the hospitals are not diverted to lump-sum allocation at all,” stated the order. “There were reports of overcrowding at refilling plants, which is why the directions have been issued,” said the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govts-order-seeks-to-streamline-o2-distribution/articleshow/82417279.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Resilience & resurgence: These startups are redefining auto sector||For 23 year old Gourav, startup isn’t a buzzword. The idea for the venture, which now defines his life, however, did come naturally to him. Gourav was asked by his father to get their car serviced. At the service station, the advisor promised to get the work done in two hours. However, this turned out to be a full-day task, but without any outcome. This BBA student of a government college in Gurgaon identified the problem, and penned a solution in his diary. He then later heard that the department of higher education was organising a startup completion course. He had never thought that his idea could be converted into a PowerPoint presentation. When he showcased the concept to his college faculty, they were surprised and impressed with the problem he had addressed. He then locked himself up in a room and practiced his pitch every day. He won the competition and the "Mechanic Guru" was born. Mechanic Guru is an Indian automobile car service aggregator. It is the largest chain of automobile workshops in Gurgaon. It provides information, prices and user reviews of various partner garages as well as service delivery from them. "Car servicing is a time consuming process leaving customers with no option but to skip or delay getting their car serviced. Lack of transparency makes it difficult to trust workshops. A variety of options are given to customers, making it difficult for them to make a swift decision,” Gourav explains. Facing a similar experience, another young student of BCom at Government College, Faridabad, Rishabh Tyagi, came up with Repairiko, when his motorcycle broke down in Faridabad. He had gone to get his bike serviced and ended up spending half a day at the service centre. He was aghast to observe the time taken by the garage to repair his motorcycle. He ended up creating a startup so that no one else would face the same problem. Rishabh says, “Repairiko provides services to two-wheelers at the customer's desired time and place. Nowadays, servicing two-wheelers can be a tricky task. One may never know when his or her daily mode of transportation requires an immediate service.” Like every new venture, Mechanic Guru and Repairiko founders too had to face a lot of challenges.Gourav recalls, “I realised independent garages were not operating in a professional manner. Trust factor was largely absent. Majority of the population was uncomfortable going to a local market or visiting an independent garage. It was a struggle to create the structure for an unorganised market and win the trust. But, we sailed through it with our hard work and patience.” Repairiko encountered similar challenges. Rishabh says, “Initially, Repairiko faced challenges in connecting with people and convincing them to trust a startup like ours. Once Repairiko earned popularity and trust, it worked day and night to fulfil customers’ expectations. Initially, the major issue faced by them was connecting with mechanics, who were ready to provide home services. Another hurdle was to make people aware of Repairiko's online portal where customers could put in a service request." Mechanic Guru and Repairiko are incubated by the centres in Gurgaon and Faridabad and are being run by the department of higher education, Haryana, and the Start-up Accelerator Chamber of Commerce (SACC). Gourav remembers that in the initial days, the incubation team kept telling him ‘you can, you can’. “And soon, I accepted that ‘yes I can’,” he adds. During the Covid-19 lockdown, Rishab claims to have survived the business crisis only because every day the incubation team kept his spirits high by consistently guiding him. The team at the incubator has been connecting the startups with mentors, who guide them and ensure that the isolated journey of a founder becomes easy. Sitting in his office, Gourav opens his diary - the one in which he had penned down his startup idea and reads out his future plans. Going forward, he plans to establish the footprints in multiple cities. Mechanic Guru has partnered with many independent garages and added a touch of modern technology to the whole set-up. Now, people can book services for their vehicles in three simple steps - check, compare and book from their app. “We are currently working on streamlining our work and gaining more traction. Currently, we are operational in the Delhi-NCR and will soon launch in the Chandigarh-Tricity region,” he said. Repairiko provides an online portal for customers and garage owners to book a service request and register themselves. It connects low-level local garages to customers, keeping the work hassle-free for both the parties. They are working on going completely online. Commenting on the role of incubators in the success of these startups, Haryana's department of higher education director general Vijay Singh Dahiya said, “Such entrepreneurs need to come up with their business ideas and these incubators offer them free office space, business mentoring and funding to support their journey.” SACC president Manipal Dhariwal said, “Our intent at the SACC is to identify young innovators at the grassroots level and support them to move in the right direction. Our sector agnostic global pool of mentors is actively involved in guiding startups for doing better every day. We are proud of the progress made by our incubated startups.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/resilience-resurgence-these-startups-are-redefining-auto-sector/articleshow/82417256.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

But when the road level is higher, water flows into houses,” he said. “As per rules, before starting such work, contractors should erect a board with details like distance to be relaid, cost of the work, name of the contractor and corporation department which issued it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/chinnammal-street-residents-stage-protest/articleshow/82417276.cms||---

Though the state government had made payment of Rs 10.37 crore to Serum Institute of India (SII) for procurement of around 30 lakh doses on April 26, no schedule for supply had so far been received, state health secretary Hussan Lal told the state cabinet during a virtual meeting chaired by the chief minister. Only some private hospitals, which had placed direct orders for vaccination, had commenced the process of vaccinating the 18-44 population, the meeting was informed. For the state government, SII has only indicated that the availability of Covishield will be known in about four weeks’ time, he added. The meeting was informed that in the circumstances, vaccination in 18-44 age group could not be launched in government hospitals, nor was there any clarity on when the process could begin. Meanwhile, the cabinet approved one-time relaxation in Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Rules, 1964, for transfer of five acres of panchayat land in Mohali to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for the establishment of National Institute of Virology for north zone. The institute has been sanctioned by the central government on a proposal by the Punjab government. The cabinet authorised the Mohali DC to complete all formalities for the transfer of land at Mullanpur Garibdas village of Kharar block in SAS Nagar (Mohali) district. Chief secretary Vini Mahajan said the construction of the institute will start by the end of this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-clarity-on-when-inoculation-of-18-will-start-punjab-cabinet-told/articleshow/82419777.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Pandemic pangs, negative news taking toll on mental peace||Lucknow: Every night, Abhik Chaturvedi (31) turns off his mobile phone before sleeping and has deleted all his social media accounts. A financial advisor by profession, Chaturvedi says due to rapid rise in daily cases of Covid-19 and distressing posts on social media, he doesn’t want to stay in touch with anyone or even touch his phone. “It has been a year almost since I came back home in Lucknow from the United States. My work involves being on the phone throughout the day. I always loved sharing things on social media. However, for the past one month, the only thing I see is people asking for oxygen cylinders and beds, others volunteering, videos of people crying and dying. Even calls from distant relatives are usually about the death of any acquaintance due to laxity of the administration,” adds Chaturvedi. Like Chaturvedi, many people are staying at home amid the chaos of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic and trying to cope with the situation. Changes in sleep pattern, anxiety or panic attacks, losing interest in things, feeling anxious, loss of appetite, are some of the changes people are noticing with the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases. Ayush Singh (24), a student, checks the blood oxygen level and pulse rate of his parents every two hours as both are diabetic. He says he has developed this habit with the sudden surge in Covid-19 cases. “I have seen my close friends losing their parents within a span of a few hours. I can’t lose mine,” he says. Sudeepa Pandey (59) has been facing sleepless nights and constant headaches. She lives in an inexplicable fear of her or her husband contracting the virus. “We have only taken the first dose of vaccine, hence we are still susceptible to infection. We have locked ourselves in home and mostly order things on phone, but even delivery of items makes me anxious since the person himself might be a carrier,” she says. Shreya Singh is facing a similar situation. “I feel so anxious that I don’t even step out on my verandah. The gloom around is so haunting that it has left me apprehensive about the future,” she says. Psychologists and mental health experts say the second wave has triggered mental health issues. “When things got a bit better in January-February, people started believing that life will slowly become normal. But as the cases are rising, anxiety and panic is increasing. The only way out is to involve ourselves into healthy activities and give more time to family and avoid heartbreaking news surrounding us,” says psychologist Neha Anand. Clinical psychologist Swati Bhagchandani says, “Many people are feeling guilty of not being able to come out and help others. With a lot of information coming in via social media and news, one needs to minimise the time spent on the phone. Take breaks in between. Divide days for routine activities like work or assignments, do meditation and deep breathing exercises.” “Dissociate yourself from negative thoughts. Engage in more mindful activities with your loved ones. Read a book or listen to good music. Talk to your friends and family members, engage in conversations and try not to focus on the virus. We survived 2020, we will be able to sail through again,” she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pandemic-pangs-negative-news-taking-toll-on-mental-peace/articleshow/82418554.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Pune||Covid-19: Efforts start to upscale rapid antigen testing in Pune region||PUNE: The Covid testing strategy is set to undergo a change in favour of rapid antigen test (RAT) in PMR. This comes in the wake of the Centre’s latest guidelines advising upscaling the use of RAT kits to meet the overwhelming demand for Covid testing. The earlier guidelines had asked states to maintain the 70:30 ratio in terms of conducting RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests, respectively, in the overall testing strategy. “RAT is a good screening test for symptomatic and can potentially reduce the number of RT-PCRs needed to diagnose Covid-19. However, confirmatory RT-PCR is recommended in case of negative RAT. For community-based testing, RAT will be beneficial,” said infectious disease expert Sanjay Pujari, member of National Task Force on Covid-19. The focus on more RT-CPR tests had delayed results by two-three days in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). “It will be prudent to upscale testing using RAT,” the Indian Council of Medical Research stated in the guidelines issued on Tuesday. PMR tests around 34,000-41,000 Covid tests daily and 70% of the testing was done through RT-PCR. The district administration has recently decided to procure 1.9 lakh antigen kits to increase rapid testing. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “We will procure more RAT kits. We are expecting these 1.9 lakh kits in phases.” District civil surgeon Ashok Nandapurkar said, “We are expecting to get more antigen kits from Haffkine Institute in the next few days.” Pune Municipal Corporation nodal officer (Covid-19) Sanjeev Wavare said, “We can now scale up testing with RAT kits by 45% by introducing the test as a primary diagnostic in indicated and symptomatic cases.” Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation commissioner Rajesh Patil of the 12,000 average daily tests, the percentage of RT-PCR test was 60. “We will review the ICMR guidelines and take the testing strategy forward,” he said.

After a prayer service at Gurdwara Sadar, the initiative began on Wednesday morning. At present, two hearse vans are available which will cater to families across the city as and when required. The gurdwara has also generated various helpline numbers through which volunteers can be contacted. “The service is free of cost and the vans are equipped with essential protective equipment such as PPE kit, masks and sanitisers for the safety of the volunteers as well as families of the deceased. As soon as we get the information about a patient we reach the destination, carry the deceased and family members who are willing to join us and leave for the cremation ground where we help families in performing the last rites. In case of no family member, we have taken the mantle to perform the last rites. On the first day we received a few calls from South City and adjoining areas," said Harpal Singh Jaggi, president, Gurdwara Sadar (Gurdwara Sri Guru Nanak Satsang Sabha). The services will be available from 10am to 5pm. “Volunteers of different faiths have joined us to serve the public in the pandemic,” LGPC president Rajendra Singh Bagga.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-gurdwaras-start-free-hearse-service-for-patients-final-journey/articleshow/82418567.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Covid tests drop in city as door-to-door checks stop||The volume of daily Covid-19 tests in Mumbai has dropped by almost 40% in three weeks. Tests not only detect cases, but also help health authorities map high incidence zones and plan intervention. One of the reasons for low testing is a discontinuation of aggressive door-to-door surveillance. Fewer antigen tests: On March 23, BMC said it would conduct 40,000+ random antigen tests (RAT) daily at crowded places, but the partial lockdown announced thereafter resulted in malls & tourist places closing down. There are no crowds to be tested, said a civic official. As vegetable markets (where the BMC regularly uses RAT) operate only in the mornings, testing among vendors too has dropped. Home treatment: Affluent patients start home treatment before getting tested, with their physicians sending them a detailed treatment protocol. As an RT-PCR test is a must for hospitalization, doctors recommend it only if the patient’s condition worsens. Reduced RT-PCR test rates: BMC officials believe that the reduced RT PCR test rate has demotivated labs from home collection. From Rs 4,500 in March 2020, the tests now cost Rs 600 to 800. Aggressive home-to-home surveillance has stopped: BMC’s 'My Family, My Responsibility' campaign in September 2020 resulted in community health workers surveying (and testing when needed) every house in each ward. Now, CHVs do contact-tracing of positive patients till 2pm daily. No fortnightly testing: In early April, an ‘RT-PCR test once a fortnight’ rule was made mandatory for delivery personnel, hotel/ restaurant staff and industrial workers. It was relaxed to ease the burden on laboratories. A subsequent rule (that essential workers who are not vaccinated need an RT-PCR negative report) was also relaxed. Fewer high-risk contacts: As daily detections drop, the number of high-risk contacts are correspondingly lower than before.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-tests-drop-in-city-as-door-to-door-checks-stop/articleshow/82418591.cms||---

The elephant’s trunk was cut in an incident in 2012 and since then the jumbo had found eating difficult.The tusker, aged around 35 years, has been wandering in Vazhaithottam and Mavanallah areas in the Masinagudi panchayat for the past six years. Slowly, the elephant become domesticated as people in these areas used to feed him. In February, forest officials tried to take the tusker to the Theppakadu elephant camp in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in the Nilgiris after the public raised concerns over deteriorating health of the jumbo. “We tried our best to make the elephant walk to Theppakadu elephant camp in February, but in vain. Since it trunk was cut, it cannot be tranquilized,” said L C S Srikanth, deputy director, MTR-buffer zone.Srikanth said Rivaldo was made to use the kraal without fear or compulsion for the past four days. Fruits and other eatables kept inside the kraal attracted him, he added. This was the first of its kind of attempt of taking an elephant into a kraal without tranquilizing or forcing it, Srikanth said. “As per the Madras HC direction, actions will be taken to treat the elephant. After a period of observation, a decision will be taken in consultation with a team of veterinarians and the findings will be submitted to the court.” he added. The court, in its order, said, “The only purpose to keep Rivaldo in captivity is to heal his chopped trunk, which impedes his food intake, and attend to the impaired vision in his one eye.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tusker-rivaldo-sent-into-kraal-for-treatment/articleshow/82417288.cms||---

These departments include health, building permission, water and road, which are involved in emergency work.“Many civic officials need to visit the office for essential and emergency work. The civic staff members have been taking measures for preventing Covid infection, but some of them are getting infected due to the entry of visitors, which can be controlled with increased vigilance,” said a senior PMC official.The civic administration has issued guidelines for restriction on movement of people in civic offices. The PMC restricted entry to citizens in PMC headquarters at Shivajinagar and 15 ward offices in the last week of March.As per the order, elected members and civic staff are exempted from restrictions. People, who have to visit these offices for meetings or other scheduled programmes, need to carry invitation for the same. The head of the departments or officials conducting these meetings should make sure that they issue such invitation letters to visitors.The order appealed to citizens to send emails to the departments concerned if they have any work. The zonal offices and ward offices were also told to send information on matters needing urgent attention to the PMC headquarters via email.“The order has been issued as a preventive measure aimed at reducing the crowd.

Since the diversion came into effect, the number of motorists using the road has increased but not the quality of the road.Following the rainfall on Tuesday, the mud road is filled with sludge and stagnant water.Krishnamanikandan Subramanian, a shopkeeper on the street, said, “The road belongs to the postal department. It is yet to be handed over to the city corporation. The 300m-long road was opened up for public use only three years ago.”He said dust pollution was high during the summer season on the road.Whenever it rains, water would stagnant on the road making it slushy. As a result, many motorists skid and fall on the road, he said. Stones were placed at the entrance so that motorists could take an alternative route, but it did not work out.V Anantha Subramanian, a resident, said, “We held talks with both the postal department and the city corporation several times. But the road is yet to be handed over to the corporation. The road laying work would commence only after the corporation takes over. The progress of the work has delayed further due to the Covid-19 pandemic.”A commuter S Janaki said it is scary to use the road especially on rainy days, but she has no other option because the main road was blocked due to the ongoing flyover work.“It would be better if the officials lay road at the earliest,” she added.

---||Delhi||‘Can Mumbai model be replicated here?’||NEW DELHI: With Delhi government revising its medical oxygen demand from 400 MT to 900 MT within a fortnight with the caseload steadily creeping to 95,000, the Centre cited the “beautiful Mumbai model for optimum utilisation of oxygen” and told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that Delhi's optimal need could be not more than 415 MT. Impressed with Mumbai’s performance, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said, “Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) has done a remarkable job. Without any disrespect to the Delhi government, can it take a leaf out of the MCGM experience in maintaining oxygen supply and its optimum utilisation?” The bench said the controversy over demand and supply of oxygen to Delhi and other states could be sorted out if the Centre displayed allocation of oxygen to states and the actual amount delivered on a daily basis. “It will save patients and their relatives tremendous anxiety of whether or not medical oxygen will be available. Publicise it so that citizens know which city has how much oxygen,” it added. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed the court that on April 10, Mumbai had a Covid caseload of 92,000, but the MCGM put in place a mechanism for optimum utilisation of oxygen and the demand was addressed with 275 MT without any patient feeling the pain of oxygen scarcity. Mehta and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati informed the bench that the Centre was doing its best to augment oxygen supply to Delhi, which increased from 431 MT on April 28 to 585 MT (555 MT as per Delhi government) on May 4. By noon on Wednesday, 355 MT of oxygen had reached Delhi, the SG said. “Mumbai managed with 275 MT on April 10 with a caseload identical to that of Delhi today. But the demand of the Delhi government is getting revised upwards from 400 MT a fortnight ago to 700 MT and then to 900 MT. Why can’t there be an audit of oxygen utilisation in Delhi, simultaneously with the Centre doing its best to meet the 700 MT supply benchmark fixed by the SC for the next four days?” the SG asked. The bench said it would review the requirement of 700 MT oxygen on Monday but asked the Centre to ensure supply of that quantity till then. It agreed with the SG for a broad-based committee of experts and officials from Delhi and Union governments to audit oxygen utilisation and sought names for such a committee by Thursday, when it will hear the issue again. The SC was impressed with Mumbai’s oxygen utilisation model and asked top officials of the Centre and the Delhi government to hold talks with MCGM officials and examine replication of the Mumbai model in Delhi for proper utilisation of oxygen rather than just increasing the supply. “Simply to keep increasing supply of oxygen to Delhi is no solution as it could result in reducing allocation of oxygen to other states which are also facing a surge in Covid cases. A team of officers from the Delhi government and the Centre will interact with officials of MCGM over the next three days to derive some learning from the experience of optimum utilisation of oxygen. Based on that, the committee of officials will try to replicate it in Delhi as far as practicable. In the meantime, the Centre should do its best to maintain 700 MT oxygen supply to Delhi,” it said. The bench also asked the Centre and the Delhi government to strive to set up oxygen plants and asked the Delhi government to learn from its Maharashtra counterpart which put up 13 oxygen plants in a short time despite Mumbai being a congested and thickly populated city. The court also took into account suggestions of amici curiae Jaideep Gupta and Meenakshi Arora for creating a buffer stock of oxygen by building storage tanks in Delhi to address emergency situations that could arise with a sudden spike in Covid patients requiring intensive care.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/can-mumbai-model-be-replicated-here/articleshow/82417355.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Caught between red tape & shortage, serious patients remain without bed, oxygen||LUCKNOW: There was no end to the woes of people looking for critical care beds in Covid hospitals and oxygen refills for serious patients at home on Wednesday. While long queues outside oxygen plants continued, SOS messages for oxygen supported (O2) or ICU beds in hospitals continued to pour in on social media and inboxes of district officers. The people’s problems were compounded by incomplete and inaccurate information about the beds availability in Covid hospitals on an online dashboard (https://beds.dgmhup-covid19.in/EN/covid19bedtrack) launched by the district administration. Even a week after launch, the dashboard had details of only 60 out of 74 Covid facilities till Wednesday night. People complained that some hospitals' status showed availability of beds, but on being contacted, they were told all beds are full. The new Covid care centres have also not been included in the list. In the absence of required information, patients like SK Saxena (57) with blood oxygen level 80 had to wait for six hours before getting an O2 supported bed in a private hospital. "We tried several hospitals, but beds were not available. Finally, an influential contact helped us to get one," said Saxena's daughter Ruchi. Saroj Devi's family made desperate calls to the helplines, but got no positive response. "Our 80-year-old grandmother is gasping for breath and requires a ventilator immediately,” said a family member. Similar was the desperation of people standing in scorching heat with no food or water outside oxygen plants since morning. “My uncle is critical and in a private hospital which has asked me to get the cylinder refilled,” said Prateek Mehra, a private executive. Ravi Mishra’s 58-year-old patient is critical and is at home as he could not get bed in any hospital. “Our only source of hope is oxygen refill,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/caught-between-red-tape-shortage-serious-patients-remain-without-bed-o2/articleshow/82418572.cms||---

In fact, most commercial streets such as DB Road, Gandhipuram and Puliakulam Road saw large crowds of people through the day.R Kavitha, a homemaker from Ponnaiarajapuram, said, “I don’t want to stand in a queue for an hour and give the shop staff outside my shopping list, which will include my body care products and personal use items. We had struggled last time. And we don’t know when all the small shops will also be forced to shut.” She was seen shopping at Race Course.People were seen stocking up frozen foods, ice creams, regular groceries and skin and hair products. “My husband and myself are planning not to visit stores or step out unnecessarily until May 20,” said Shamshad Asher, a mother of two children.On his part, corporation commissioner Kumaravel Pandian checked the availability of groceries to the residents of containment zones and if people were following Covid-19 prevention practices. He inspected containment zones of Father Roundy Street, Gokulam Nagar and other locations, and fever camps on Marudhamalai Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/daily-caseload-crosses-2000-mark/articleshow/82417285.cms||---

According to police, the incident occurred at around 11 pm when Zala, sarpanch of Surya Rampara, was returning home with an oxygen cylinder when the car he was travelling met with accident. Zala was seriously injured and was taken to a private hospital in Rajkot and then referred to Civil Hospital where he succumbed to the injuries on Tuesday after midnight. “Ashok Zala’s mother was infected with Covid-19 and was under home quarantine. Zala came to Kuvadava to attend a meeting of sarpanchs of nearby villages to discuss the plan to start Covid-19 isolation centre in Kuvadava. After the meeting got over, he was on his way back home when the accident occurred,” a police official informed. He is survived by wife, a daughter and two sons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/sarpanch-carrying-oxygen-cylinder-for-mother-dies-in-car-accident/articleshow/82415412.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra State govt: CBI’s FIR exceeds limits permitted, is mala fide||Mumbai: Observing that Mumbai Police’s approach to a tweet by Navi Numbai resident Sunaina Holey was “hypersensitive and overcautious”, the Bombay high court on Wednesday quashed a criminal case against her for her social media post last April on a gathering of migrant workers outside Bandra Terminus. She was charged with promoting communal disharmony during the nationwide lockdown. The HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and MS Karnik said the tweet does not disclose any guilty mind or intention of Holey (39) to commit the alleged offence under IPC Section 153A to promote enmity between different groups. The case against her was “too far-fetched”, said the court. “Assuming that the said tweet is an extreme view expressed in retaliation to the view expressed by one of the member of the crowd who was blaming the Prime Minister for the outbreak of the pandemic, the said tweet has still to be judged from the standpoint of what the reaction of a strongminded, reasonable or a prudent person would be,” said the bench, adding that neither has any community nor any religion had been named. The police produced “nothing substantial”, the HC said, and also if a ‘prudent person’ test was applied to the tweet, “by no stretch of imagination” can it be said that it created any hatred or enmity “between two communities”. The HC quashed the FIR filed by Azad Maidan police, but noted that the police had acted with “promptitude” in noticing the video and tweet. It said that “migrants were anxious to go back…police machinery had proceeded in the correct direction trying to control and pacify the crowd”. But there was no disturbance of peace reported in the society after Holey’s tweet or even during police investigation, said the HC. The state, through its special senior counsel Manoj Mohite, argued that while her tweet was not responsible for the crowd outside Bandra Terminus, it made it look like the gathering was of one community where one man was trying to blame the PM for the pandemic outbreak. After Holey’s counsel Abhinav Chandrachud counter-arg-ued that no case made out against his client as she was not the author of the video and police had not registered any case against the person allegedly blam-ing the PM, the HC said: “Merely a reference made to Bandra Masjid location in the tweet by the petitioner would not attract provisions of Section 153A.” Last July, Holey was also booked for her alleged offensive posts against CM Uddhav Thackeray and his minister son Aaditya. Her quashing petition against this case is pending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-govt-cbis-fir-exceeds-limits-permitted-is-mala-fide/articleshow/82418578.cms||---
---||Nagpur||HC: Don’t consider date of training for seniority||Nagpur: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court has read down the state government decision to grant date of joining training as date of appointment for the purpose of seniority and held that the date of appointment on successful completion of training will be considered for seniority for assistant conservators of forests (ACFs). In 2015, directly appointed ACFs had moved the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal (MAT), Mumbai, pleading date of joining training as date of appointment. This application was allowed by MAT. However, the state filed a review petition on the ground that Rule 3(B) of ACF Recruitment Rules provide that ACFs are appointed on successful completion of training, but this plea was rejected. The state’s law & judiciary department also rejected the proposal to challenge the MAT decision. Thereafter, referring to the MAT decision, the government on August 14, 2018, granted the date of joining training as date of appointment for seniority and published a provisional seniority list of ACFs list in January 2019, showing directly recruited ACFs, who were appointed in 2016, as seniors over promotee ACFs who were appointed in 2014-15. This affected the seniority of the promotee ACFs and they were placed below the directly appointed ACFs in spite of being appointed early. The promotees challenged the government decision through their lawyer Mahesh Bharaswadkar relying on the apex court judgements. The state opposed the petition of promotee ACFs stating that MAT has not considered Rule 3(B) and the law and judiciary department also did not approve it. Bharaswadkar submitted before the high court that selection for training is recruitment and after successfully completing the training the appointment order is issued and therefore the period of training cannot be considered as a service considering Rule 3(B). He further submitted that the service condition cannot be changed by issuing GR or government decision. “Considering the submissions by ACF promotees the high court read down the government decision and made it clear that the date of appointment shall be considered for the purpose of seniority and not the period of training,” said Bharaswadkar. “By this judgement more than 35 officers, who are on the verge of retirement, would now get a promotion. Though the state government deprived these officials the chance to become divisional forest officers (DFOs), they will at least become ACFs,” Bharaswadkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-dont-consider-date-of-training-for-seniority/articleshow/82417313.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Ram has been feeling the pinch since restrictions on grocery shops allowed business only from 7-11am and only home delivery till 6 pm. “I had an assistant who left for his village two months ago. I have been getting many calls from the neighbourhood but it is not possible for me to close the shop, deliver groceries, come back and open the shop. Hiring someone amidst the uncertain times is risky,” Ram told TOI. Many small grocers in different localities have been facing similar problems. They cannot hire more men to do home deliveries so many of them are facing heavy losses despite getting orders throughout the day. “I have an assistant but the number of orders coming in is huge. With more than 20-30 households calling us throughout the day, the assistant has no time to eat or rest. I cannot leave the shop as I have to prepare the orders and calculate the bills,” Hanup Singh Bagri, a grocer at a mall in Koregaon Park, said. Grocer Hanspal Jatav in the Hadapsar was also hassled. “I get around 20 orders for home deliveries each day but I am able to oblige not more than seven households,” Jatav said. “ My son has had to take a break from his studies and help me,” Dinkar Ram, a grocer in the Vimannagar, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/failing-to-deliver-to-homes-small-grocers-grapple-with-losses/articleshow/82298920.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh raises contact tracing teams to 27||CHANDIGARH: The surge in the Covid-19 positive cases has forced the UT municipal corporation to increase its contact tracing teams from 18 to 27 by hiring people on outsourcing basis. Since, cases in significant numbers are now being reported from all the areas, therefore, all the contact tracing teams have been divided so that each patient and his/her family can be attended in a proper manner. Besides MC employees, the corporation has hired people from outside and has taken services of around 40 policemen for peaceful and proper contact tracing. In some cases, it was felt that the police are also required and a request was sent to the SSP UT for the same, following which the MC received the police help. “We have increased teams from 18 to 27 and they have further been equally distributed. Cases are on the rise in almost all the areas and the teams have been deployed in all the parts accordingly. The MC teams are collaborating with the health department and after getting information on positive cases, they go ahead with contact tracing,” said Anil Garg, additional municipal commissioner. According to information, earlier when the cases were declined, the contact tracing teams were reduced from nine to three, but after spike in the number of cases, the teams were again increased from three to nine. “But as the cases started increasing rapidly, the teams were increased to 18 and now we have increased the same to 27. We have been keeping an eye on the situation and a decision will be taken accordingly in the future,” said sources. Significantly, unlike last year, when Co vid-19 pandemic had struck, all the departments of the civic body authority are fully operational. Currently, people from majority of the departments of the MC are engaged in contact tracing, of which, a significant number of employees have been taken from the fire department. Unlike last year, pasting of posters outside the house of positive patients has been stopped. Moreover, no mobile surveillance of patient is being tracked, but since the target is to trace maximum contacts, the workload has increased manifold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/city-raises-contact-tracing-teams-to-27/articleshow/82417306.cms||Deepak Yadav

The report will be submitted to the deputy director of public health at the earliest.”Sundar, a relative of a Covid patient who died in the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), said the body was taken to the crematorium along with that of four to five other bodies in a van. “I was shocked to see how the dead bodies were dumped in a small room near the mortuary. Isn’t it disrespectful to do so to the dead people?”Pointing out that the bodies of Covid victims and that of people who had died of other ailments were handed over to their relatives from the same mortuary, he said the chances of the facility becoming a virus transmission point was higher.According to the state media bulletin, the district had seen just 13 Covid-19 deaths in six days from April 26 to May 1. But the number of people cremated/buried in accordance with the Covid protocol during the period was more than 210, which was higher than the combined number of Covid-19 deaths reported in the western region during the period. According to sources, about 40% of the victims are outsiders, who had been undergoing treatment in the city hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mismatch-in-deaths-burial-health-department-seeks-report/articleshow/82417310.cms||Nivedha Selvam

In Meerut, a list of 320 inmates, including 250 undertrials and 70 convicted prisoners, is being sent to HPC for a final call. Meerut jail superintendent BD Pandey said, “Undertrials jailed for crime with a maximum sentence of seven years are eligible for parole. Similarly, convicted inmates serving time in crimes where the maximum sentence is up to seven years are eligible. All convicted inmates above the age of 65, irrespective of their crime and sentencing, are also eligible.” The committee comprising Acting Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court Sanjay Yadav, additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi and director general (prisons), UP, Anand Kumar had issued order and sought list of eligible prisoners in compliance to a Supreme Court directive. All women inmates above 50 years, pregnant women prisoners, all male or female inmates suffering from cancer or other serious, critical illnesses shall also be entitled to parole for a period of 60 days. A similar exercise was undertaken last year during the first wave and 11,000 prisoners were granted parole as cases surged with prison authorities struggling to control the spread in overcrowded prisons. Several inmates had jumped parole and did not report back after it expired after which efforts were made to trace them. Recently, the chairman of Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh, Rohitashwa Kumar Agarwal had written a letter to the Acting Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court, Sanjay Yadav, seeking interim bail, parole for undertrial prisoners, convicts in view of reports indicating doubling of Covid-19 cases during the last two weeks in jails across the state due to overcrowding. “Scores of inmates have tested positive for the novel coronavirus majorly due to flouting of social distancing norms on account of congestion in jails,” the chairman had said in his letter.

---||Kolkata||Focus on critical care units but gadgets, manpower a problem||Kolkata: Prodded by the state government, which has been asking hospitals across public and private sectors to stress on intensive care beds while augmenting infrastructure for Covid care, most private hospitals have earmarked 60% or more of their total beds for Covid patients and are willing to convert a majority of them into ICU beds, but issues like equipment and manpower are proving to be major challenges. “From eight ICU beds, we now have 41. Equipment like ventilators and HFNC take time to procure. We have ordered 10 more ventilators to increase the number of Covid ICU beds and we are waiting for those machines to arrive,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO of Peerless Hospital. According to private hospital sources, apart from ventilators and HFNC equipment like BiPap, bed monitors are crucial to keep tabs on patients in ICU. It takes between four to seven weeks from the time of placing an order to the equipment reaching hospitals. “Apart from equipment, we also need more manpower — doctors, nurses and paramedics — because patients in ICU need round the clock intensive monitoring. With a section of this workforce getting infected on and off, getting adequate manpower is another challenge,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO of Belle Vue Clinic. In the HDU set-up, a step down from ICU, many patients require oxygen support through devices like HFNC. In this second wave, a majority of the patients seeking hospital care need oxygen therapy. “While it makes sense augmenting critical care beds rather than increasing beds in the general ward, procuring equipment takes time and more so in today’s scenario where all hospitals are making an effort to get them. We should be able to scale up 20 more HDU beds once we get the equipment,” said Subhasish Datta, general manager (operations) at Ruby General Hospitals. At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), close to 50% of its 253 Covid beds are for tending to critical patients. “Along with Covid patients, we have a high number of admissions for critically ill non-Covid patients. There is also a rush of emergency non-Covid patients at RTIICS. This is one challenge we are facing in putting in more beds for Covid patients,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (East) of Narayana Health. The hospital chain has added 200 more Covid beds with 80 critical care beds collectively at its Narayana Hospital Howrah and Narayana Hospital Barasat. The major concern for smaller nursing homes that do not have LMO (liquid medical oxygen) plants is oxygen supply. “We depend on oxygen cylinders for our critical Covid patients. Though we have not faced shortage of supply till now, consumption has gone up by three folds. There is uncertainty due to the rising demand. For us, the availability of oxygen is an issue as far as increasing ICU beds is concerned,” said the head of a nursing home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/focus-on-critical-care-units-but-gadgets-manpower-a-problem/articleshow/82415452.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Since the matter involved people of different castes, senior police officers rushed to the spot. The trouble started on the night of April 26, when two youths in the dead of the night allegedly scaled the wall of a house at Barkatpur village and tried to abduct the teenaged daughter of a farmer. She raised an alarm, waking up her mother, who also started screaming. Their cries unnerved the youths and they fled but after threatening the mother-daughter duo of dire consequences if they did not remain quiet about the matter. “On Tuesday evening, a panchayat was called to settle the matter. But the youths from upper caste allegedly started abusing the girl's relatives and pelting stones at them, leading to a clash between the two sides. Six people were injured in the clashes,” said a witness. Police immediately reached the spot and brought the situation under control. The injured were admitted to hospital. According to inspector Ravi Singh, “We have received a police complaint and will file an FIR in the matter.

---||Coimbatore||O2 available, but patients gasp for breath||Coimbatore: Eighty-three-year-old Vethaa Arumugan was rushed to the PSG Hospitals immediately after his family members found him gasping for breath. It didn’t occur to them to call up the hospital to check for the availability of beds, as the only thing that mattered to them was to get him immediate medical help. The hospital staff could do little to find a bed for the patient, who was breathless and on oxygen support, as his RT-PCR results were yet to arrive. That was not the only reason why he had to wait outside. Oxygen beds in the ward for suspected Covid cases was also full.In fact, the hospital had received 160 admission requests just from 6am to 12.30pm, against hardly 50 discharges that it had planned for the day.While the district is yet to see people dying while waiting for oxygen or beds in front of hospitals or in ambulances, according to www.tnega.org website, there were just 118 beds with oxygen support and 22 ICU beds left for Covid-19 patients as on Wednesday afternoon.Among the 118 vacant oxygen beds, 34 were reportedly in private hospitals. However, when TOI called up four hospitals - Manu Hospital (6 beds), Abhinandan Hospital (2 beds), Karpagam Hospital (12 beds) and Coimbatore Diabetes Foundation (15) - that showed bed availability, the responses didn’t point to a rosy picture. While Abhinandan Hospital and Manu Hospital flatly refused any beds stating they only have enough oxygen and resources for existing patients, Coimbatore Diabetes Foundation Hospital said it preferred only patients below 60 years. The Karpagam Hospital, however, didn’t attend any calls.Larger multi-speciality hospitals are using liquid oxygen that is brought through their pipelines and they haven’t faced any shortage so far. On the other hand, smaller hospitals, which mainly use gaseous oxygen from cylinders, do face shortage on and off.“We have enough oxygen supply, but we don’t want to take risk by admitting too many patients who may require it for several days,” said a staffer with the Coimbatore Diabetes Foundation Hospital.Compared to the private sector, more government hospitals had vacant oxygen beds in the district. In addition to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital and the ESI Hospital, many small government hospitals at Mettupalayam, Periyanaickenpalayam, Annur, Sulur, Pollachi, Madukkarai and Sulur had one or two vacant oxygen beds each. Dr A Nirmala, dean, CMCH, said, “We have no oxygen shortage.”However, BJP MLA Vanathi Sreenivasan had tweeted that she had appealed Union steel minister Dharmendhra Pradhan to look into repurposing steel plants for oxygen to reduce the (oxygen) deficit faced by the district. On Monday, MP P R Natarajan had appealed the district collector to increase oxygen procurement as small private hospitals were beginning to face shortage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/o2-available-but-patients-gasp-for-breath/articleshow/82417332.cms||---

---||Delhi||Imported tankers to help supply oxygen to non-producing states||New Delhi: The fresh set of imported cryogenic tankers will be largely allocated to Delhi, Punjab and Bihar, which are among the non-producing states, with the daily entitlement of states also due to be reviewed in the wake of fresh Covid-19 cases plateauing in certain states while others show a sharp spike. Although Delhi has been complaining about its inability to lift the allocated quantity of oxygen due to non-availability of tankers, other non-producing states such as Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Goa have managed to procure tankers from the market to transport the gas. Central government sources said the new 20MT tankers were expected to ease some of the pressure in some states. Some 33 tankers are to be deployed for use by states even as production has been ramped up. While Goa has a small allocation of 11MT, MP has a daily limit of around 690MT and Punjab 250MT. In the initial days, MP had difficulty, prompting chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to take up the issue with other states. Sources said the oxygen allocation for states would be reviewed in the coming days as states such as Karnataka were seeing a sharp increase, while Maharashtra was showing early signs of a dip. Delhi government has repeatedly told the high court and the Supreme Court that it couldn’t arrange tankers and wanted the Centre to make arrangements. Suppliers such as Linde have written to the Delhi administration complaining about the problems being caused by the capital’s inability to lift the allocated quantities. INOX Air Supplies also told TOI that the Union territory’s inability to lift its allocation had resulted in shortages in hospitals. In the meantime, the Centre on Wednesday did away with the requirement for Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organisation (PESO) to undertake physical inspection of a global manufacturer’s production facility while allowing import of oxygen cylinders and cryogenic tankers or containers. Such approvals will be granted online “without any delay on submission of manufacturer’s particulars, ISO certificate of manufacturer, list of cylinders/tankers/containers, their specifications, drawings and batch number, hydro test certificate and third-party inspection certificate”, an official statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/imported-tankers-to-help-supply-oxygen-to-non-producing-states/articleshow/82417393.cms||---

The RAT will determine in half an hour whether the victim was infected or not. If the RAT test proves presence of the virus in the body, the deceased will be taken to a Covid-designated crematorium by a civic team following all necessary protocols. However, if the RAT fails to trace any virus, the body will be handed over to the family for cremation at any crematorium of their choice. Shortly after taking oath as chief minister for the third time in a row, Mamata Banerjee held a high-level Covid meeting at Nabanna, where this issue came up for discussion. Banerjee asked the KMC brass to take steps to prevent harassment of families that have lost their dear ones at home and are suffering difficulties with cremation due to the long wait for the Covid test results. According to T K Mukherjee, an advisor to the KMC health department and a practising physician, the civic paramedics will need to collect a nasal swab from the body of a victim and a subsequent rapid antigen test will determine — in half an hour — whether the person was infected with coronavirus. “We can take help of this test to determine the presence of the virus, alive or dead, and thus, give relief to a family who won’t have to wait longer for cremation,” Mukherjee said on Wednesday. The KMC board of administrators (BoA), which was revived on Tuesday, took a unanimous decision to empower ward coordinators to get in touch with families that are facing challenges in cremating their relatives who have died at home. “The BoA has asked the ward or borough coordinators to get in touch with families in need. They will arrange for a RAT to determine the presence of the virus,” said a KMC health department official. In case of an emergency, where a body may have been lying at home for over 24 hours, carrying the risk of decomposition, the KMC coordinator of the area concerned will need to take the initiative for preservation before the RAT is done. “This was proposed at a civic meeting on Tuesday. “Several such cases have been happening across the city in the past three weeks,” said a KMC official. Apart from taking this measure, the KMC health department will need to send ambulances equipped with oxygen cylinders to homes of Covid-positive patients who need immediate hospitalization because of a sharp drop in oxygen saturation. “Besides sending ambulances to homes of Covid-positive patients, we may need to send ambulances on request to hospitals for transfer of serious patients to a better- equipped healthcare facility,” said a KMC health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-to-conduct-rapid-tests-after-deaths-at-home/articleshow/82415455.cms||Saikat Ray

UT chief conservator of forests (CCF) Debendra Dalai said officials of the forest and wildlife department initiated the line transect method of counting. The survey will be completed in five days. Recently, the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) had consented for technical support to the UT forest and wildlife department for carrying out the census. Thereafter, the WII experts trained the staff of the department. Recently, the UT forest and wildlife department had sent a reminder to the WII to provide technical support. The department was to carry out the second census in April 2020, but the same was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Consequent to the outbreak, a lockdown was imposed and the ideal season to perform a census elapsed. The first wildlife census was carried out at the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary, spread over an area of 26 sq km in the catchment area of the Sukhna Lake, in 2010. Being a season specific, the second wildlife census could not be carried out in 2020 as the best period to spot the animals had passed due to lockdown, said Dalai, adding that it was difficult to locate animals in other seasons. A team of experts from the WII, environmentalists, representatives of NGOs and biology and zoology students from Panjab University took part in the first census held more than a decade ago. The team took three days to count nine species of mammals and 65 species of birds by using direct evidence, including animals and birds spotted in the area, and indirect evidence like foot-prints and animal faeces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/forest-dept-finally-starts-second-wildlife-census-first-held-in-2010/articleshow/82417350.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

These mills owe over Rs 11,700 crore to 40 lakh farmers in the state so much so that the farmers are unable to take care of the other crops they have sown after the cane harvest. Increasing diesel prices are also a big concern for these farmers who have to irrigate lands with the help of generators and tractors. To add to the existing issues, the cane SAP was not increased for the past three years. According to data available with the cane department, though the sugar mills have paid off Rs 24,606 crore to 40 lakh farmers, so far, they still owe Rs 11,754 crore to the growers, leaving them in the lurch. Rajendra Singh, national president of Azad Kisan Union, said, “The government has failed to get cane dues paid in time. Farmers don't have money to look after cane crops for the next crushing season. Prices of diesel and fertilizers have made life more difficult. In addition, power tariffs also skyrocketed. The SAP for cane was not increased in the last few years. Crushing season is going to end and payment is still pending. The government should take strict action against mill owners who are not paying dues on time." Singh added that if mill owners are facing financial issues, they can take loans. "The sugar market is down, but mills have made profit in sanitiser manufacturing and molasses sale." Nemi Singh, a farmer from Mandawali, said, "We are fully dependent on sugarcane crops. When the mill does not pay dues, our work suffers. We are unable to pay the school fees of our children. Apart from these, it is the peak time to look after the crop for the next crushing season. Labourers ask for their wages. We have to take care of all this. So, we are forced to take loans from banks by mortgaging our land. For which, we pay interest to banks. Mill owner is not paying dues on time, and never pays interest to us." When contacted, Paropkar Singh, general manager of Bilai sugar mill, said, "There is a slump in the sugar market. Prices of sugar have decreased in the last few days. Earlier, we were selling sugar at Rs 3,400 per quintal. Now, it has reached Rs 3,200. The second Covid wave has made matters worse. A large amount of sugar is used in the commercial sector [cold drink, chocolate, bakery, sweets, weddings] but its consumption has come to a standstill." A senior cane officer, on condition of anonymity, said, "The sugar production was increasing in the state. It was 120 lakh tonnes in the crushing season of 2017-18, 118 lakh tonnes in 2018-19 and 126 lakh tonnes in 2019-20. But this time around, 119 mills have produced 106 lakhs tonnes of sugar. And the crushing season is still on. It is believed that sugar production may come down as several mills have produced molasses in large quantities. It is made from cane juice directly. This may lead to fall in sugar production. Molasses is used in making ethanol and alcohol which is being used as sanitiser." The officer, however, added that mills failing in paying dues are being served notices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/crushing-season-over-95-of-ups-119-sugar-mills-closed-but-they-still-owe-rs-11700-cr-to-40l-farmers/articleshow/82415458.cms||Harveer Dabas

Deepu was one of the three persons who died in the blast at an oxygen refilling station in Chinhat on Wednesday afternoon. His parents might still be waiting for his return as cops were tracing his residence till reports last came in. However, those who were lucky enough to survive had to suffer mental agony as they had reached the station in search of oxygen but had to return empty-handed as their cylinders were locked inside the plant. Chaos and stampede-like situation prevailed after the blast and the impact was such that those standing in the queue outside the gas plant ran helter-skelter, some leaving their cylinders inside the plant while others running away with them. Tauqeer (40) of Kursi road, who was among those standing in the queue to get his cylinder refilled, told TOI: “The cylinder was very important to save the life of my wife, Shabia Fatima. How will I go back home without oxygen. I have two small children. How I will face them?” He said three hours after the incident he pleaded the cops and administrative officials go allow him to take his cylinder but they refused. He said his friend, Pawan Kumar, also got injured in the stampede. Ankit Sahu, 22, who had come from Telibagh to get the cylinder refilled, said: “Our neighbour Ram Sajag Mishra is on death bed and requires oxygen. There is no one to look after him and we are giving him all necessary help including oxygen.” “When I will return home today, I will not be able to face him. I could not manage oxygen and the cylinder is also locked in the oxygen refilling station,” he said, adding that his uncle, Ajay Sahu, who accompanied him sustained injuries and was in hospital. Additional district magistrate, east, KP Singh said the plant would be allowed to start operations only after the team constituted by the district magistrate to look into the incident submit its report. “Cylinders will be given to customers only after the plant reopens,” he added. Singh said the plant had been supplying oxygen to at least 15 hospitals in the city. “These hospitals will be provided oxygen through other gas plants,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/blast-rips-apart-hopes-chokesoxygen-supply-to-many-patients/articleshow/82418586.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

Hundreds of BKU activists staged a dharna at the office of the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) alleging inadequate supply of oxygen to district hospitals and private institutions. "Whatever the low number of deaths exhibited by the administration, the reality is evident from the number of burning pyres on the ghats of Ganga. People are dying for the want of oxygen and the administration is not able to supply adequate oxygen", said Digambar Singh, state chief of the youth wing of BKU. Singh further alleged, "There are half a dozen oxygen refilling units in the district. But only two are refilling oxygen cylinders. A health officer is getting his cut for it. When patients demand oxygen, doctors say there’s a shortage. Patients are dying and the administration is claiming there’s sufficient oxygen in the hospitals. We demand that proper facilities be given to the patients." According to officials, 11,015 patients have so far tested positive for Covid-19 in Bijnor. Out of them, 8,566 have been discharged after treatment. There are still 2,371 active cases and 78 patients died of the infection. There are 160 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients in the district hospital and the community health centres. Out of the 8,566 active cases, around 2,117 patients are in home isolation. Many of them gasping for breath due to lack of oxygen cylinders, and even medicine. However, nodal officer for Covid-19, P R Nayar said, "We need around 60 oxygen cylinders for Covid patients admitted in the district hospital, and community and primary health centres. In addition, we have some oxygen concentrators. We have enough oxygen. No patient is dying here due to lack of oxygen." In addition to people suffering from Covid, many of patients suffering from asthma and other respiratory diseases are also facing hardships as there isn’t enough supply of oxygen in the district||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/farmer-outfit-stages-protest-at-cmo-office-for-inadequate-supply-of-oxygen/articleshow/82415453.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Kolkata||5L vax doses arrive but demand-supply gap stays||Kolkata: With the arrival of two consignments of vaccines — 5 lakh doses — on Wednesday, health officials said that the vials would help them in continuing the inoculation drive for the next three to four days. But since the demand is high against the supply, they will continue to prioritise second-dose recipients. Altogether, 1 lakh Covaxin and 4 lakh Covishield doses arrived in the state during the day. This supply came after a gap of one week. The vials were first transported to the Central Family Welfare Store at Bagbazar from where it will be despatched to different districts. “The process for despatching the vials to cold chain points across the districts is on. By Thursday, stock will be replenished in most of the districts. But due to the meagre amount of doses, we had to work meticulously on the number to be allotted to each district,” said a source in the state health department. Owing to the vaccine crisis, the state government for the past few weeks has been telling its vaccination centres to give priority to second-dose recipients. But the problem is that a section of healthcare and frontline workers is continuing to come in for the first dose. “We are coming across even common people coming in for the first dose. But according to the guideline from the government, we have to say no to them. It is bad situation at vaccination centres. There is acute crisis at a time when we need to speed up the inoculation drive to counter this second wave,” said vaccination coordinator at a medical college in Kolkata. Sources in the health department said they were not expecting any more doses in about a week. “Some vaccination centres are already shut due to the shortage. We have to ration the supply to other centres so that the drive continues, albeit in a restricted way,” said the government source. The government, however, is hopeful of getting its own stock directly from the manufacturers – Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech. Meanwhile, most of the private vaccination centres continues to remain shut. Apart from Woodlands Hospitals, none other private hospitals in the city has been able to source their stock. But most said they has already started the process of purchasing their vials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/5l-vax-doses-arrive-but-demand-supply-gap-stays/articleshow/82415461.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

According to case details, a 45-year-old priest Kamlesh Labadiya who had poisoned his son Ankit (21) and daughter Krupali (22) on Sunday before attempting to take his own life was booked for murder on Tuesday after his 21-year-old son, Ankit, had died late on Monday night. While his wife narrowly escaped the ordeal, their daughter is battling for her life. Labadiya too died on Tuesday night. Labadiya, a resident of Shivam Park in Nana Mava area of Rajkot, was suffering from depression after being reportedly cheated by two persons — Dileep Korat and Rajesh Vora — whom he had sold his house for Rs 1.29 crore. Labadiya had also left behind a suicide note blaming the duo for forcing him take the extreme step. Labadiya fed his children poison-laced water claiming it to be a medicine that will protect them from Covid-19 infection, but his wife Jayshree who was busy with some other work did not consume it. She later filed a murder complaint against her husband. Labadiya’s elder brother Kanji Labadiya lodged a complaint against Korat and Vora (lawyer) under various sections of Indian Penal Code including 306 (abetment of suicide), 406 (criminal breach of trust), and 120B (criminal conspiracy) among others. “Dileep Korat and Rajesh Vora had given Rs 20.51 lakh to Kamlesh Labadiya and remaining amount was to be paid after signing of the sale deed. But the accused reportedly told that they have paid Rs 61 lakh which was to be given in cash. My brother was afraid that he wouldn’t get the amount and so, decided to kill his whole family and end his life by suicide,” his brother said in his police complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/two-including-lawyer-booked-in-priests-suicide/articleshow/82415470.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Govt sets in motion mobile camps to tide over blood, plasma shortage||Kolkata: In a move to tide over the blood crisis and provide convalescent plasma to Covid patients who require plasma therapy, the state health department has taken up an initiative of whole blood-derived Covid convalescent plasma (CCP) donation camps. Conducted in mobile buses of the health department, NGOs have been roped in for a better outreach. The mobile camps took off last Wednesday at two stops — Minto Park and Salt Lake Swimming Pool — where 31 people donated their whole blood, 19 of them eligible for the CCP as they had been infected with Covid-19 earlier. Unlike the plasma donation that is done via the aphersis method in which only the plasma is extracted from the donor, in whole blood CCP donation the plasma will be separated from the whole blood later. “This is like killing two birds with the same stone. We get the blood as well as the plasma. This drive will enrich our blood stock to shorten the gap between the demand and supply while Covid patients who need plasma therapy can get it,” said an official of the state blood safety unit. During the first wave, the government had set up 20 plasma banks across the state, the one at Medical College Hospital, Kolkata, being the biggest one. The whole blood collected from these camps will be screened for the antibody level at these banks and the ones that qualify will be marked for supplying to patients. A study on the benefits of convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) at ID Hospital during the first wave had found the younger patients benefiting from the therapy. “CPT should give greater effect in this wave as more younger people are getting severe disease this time,” said immunologist Dipyaman Ganguly. The likes of Project Life Force is helping in these camps. The organization is also approaching donors though various channels. “The distress calls for plasma continue but we are able to close most of these calls now after the first camp,” said Ajay Mittal of Project Life Force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-sets-in-motion-mobile-camps-to-tide-over-blood-plasma-shortage/articleshow/82415465.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Among those arrested were two persons who had 20 kg of rasgullas celebrating victory of a BDC candidate in Hapur dehat area, police said. Seven revelers were arrested in Simbhaoli and four in Bahadurgarh areas for violating Covid protocols despite a ban on post-poll celebrations by the state election commission (SEC). The SEC’s order it seems to have been thrown out of the window with candidates not only taking out grand processions but resorting to celebratory firing in many pockets of the state. In Baghpat's Rathoda village, winning candidate Mohd Sajid rode took out a victory march on a camel amid a cheering crowd. A purported video of the celebration has gone viral in which both the newly-elected pradhan and young men can be seen without any face masks. Later, an FIR was registered. Similarly, 25 people were booked at Jogirampuri village in Bijnor's Nagina area where a newly-elected pradhan took out a procession with the beating of drums.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/covid-norms-flouted-as-panchayat-poll-winners-go-on-victory-laps-several-held-in-hapur-baghpat-bijnor/articleshow/82415463.cms||---

---||Lucknow||‘Give quarantine facility to docs on Covid duty’||Lucknow: Doctors are leading the battle against coronavirus pandemic from the front but, unlike last year, they apprehend contracting infection and passing it on to their dear ones in the absence of arrangements for active quarantine facility despite clear instructions from the government. The fact came to light after UP Provincial Medical Services Association (PMSA) raised the issue in a letter to the state government and demanded urgent redressal of the problem. Under containment plan, doctors were appointed on 14-day duty in Covid-19 hospitals. To ensure that they do not take infection back home, they were provided accommodation during their duty period. An additional seven-day isolation was also granted to them in anticipation that any doctor who might have contracted infection would not take more than seven days to show symptoms. “Last year, the state government had made provisions for active quarantine of doctors in hotels and provided them food and laundry services. This year too, funds have been sanctioned for the purpose but the doctors are being deprived of the facility,” the letter said. Officials said the facility was not even available in Lucknow which has been the worst hit. However, medical institutions like KGMU and SGPGI have made arrangements on their own. “Due to lack of arrangements, which are to be coordinated by the district administration, doctors are forced to go back to their homes which puts their families under the risk of infection,” it said. “The problem is a hurdle in the state’s efforts to contain the pandemic. Doctors have an important role in patient management and they are not able to work with a free mind,” the office-bearers said. Calling this a serious laxity, the association urged the director general, health, to address the issue at the earliest. “What we are requesting is in no way an undue demand. In fact, it is crucial to Covid-19 containment strategy. We would like the decision-makers to think about the situation where they have beds but only a few doctors to handle the situation. The issue must be addressed soon especially with indications of an impending third wave,” a functionary said. Repeated attempts to contact health department top brass failed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/give-quarantine-facility-to-docs-on-covid-duty/articleshow/82418592.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Hyderabad||Patient load, overstressed ICUs and ACs leading to hospital fires in Telangana||HYDERABAD: With fires breaking out in several hospitals and claiming the lives of Covid-19 patients in various parts of the country, the Telangana fire services department has cautioned hospitals against excessive usage of electricity and putting patients’ lives at grave risk. Currently, the fire department is not taking any action against hospitals for not being in possession of no-objection certificates (NOCs) and new prosecutions are not being issued in view of the hospitals working under severe pressure to treat Covid-19 patients. Thanks to overstressed use of air-conditioners, ICU equipment, ventilators and testing equipment, power usage in the hospitals has increased manifold. Cumulatively, the risk of fire mishaps due to electric short-circuit has also gone up. As many as 24 hospital fires have taken place in the country since August 2020 and over 90 patients have died — a majority of them were Covid-19 patients. Experts pointed out that a high patient load and the pandemic have put a lot of pressure on the hospital healthcare system, making nursing homes, hospitals and clinics vulnerable to fires. It may be recalled 10 patients lost their lives when a fire ravaged the Swarna Palace Hotel which was converted into an isolation facility for Covid-19 patients in Vijayawada in August last year. State disaster response and fire services regional officer V Papaiah said there are around 900 hospitals in the state. “Due to increased patient load in various hospitals because of the pandemic, we are not insisting on the NOCs. We are monitoring the fire safety situation on a daily basis.” He further said, “Our teams are inspecting 10 hospitals every day. We have formed WhatsApp groups with housekeeping, security, fire officers and hospital managements and training them. We are also checking the condition of fire equipment and fire-fighting systems. Fire checks and electrical safety are priority now,” he said. He said prosecution in old cases is continuing but there are no new prosecutions. The GHMC fire wing takes care of hospitals which are under 15 metres height. “There are 112 hospitals functioning which tower above 15 metres in height. We had fire mishaps reported from ACs, but they were contained immediately by the hospitals themselves. There has been no big fire reported so far in a hospital in Telangana,” he said. Papaiah said a majority of the hospitals are treating Covid-19 patients. “We have not received any complaint so far against the hospitals for flouting the norms,” he said. Forensic experts who have investigated several fire mishaps said short-circuit is the most common reason. Taruvu Suresh. a forensic expert, said: “AC machines, printers and medical equipment are the source for an electrical fire to break out. If there is no MCB due to load, wires may burn. Old wiring, high load, lack of electrical equipment maintenance and lack of voltage stabilisers often lead to the fire mishaps. Hospitals should do an audit of their electric equipment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/patient-load-overstressed-icus-and-acs-leading-to-hospital-fires/articleshow/82417402.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

He claimed the FIR followed a “biased, dubious, legal non-existent Inquiry with ulterior motive at the behest of those having political or other vendetta” against him. Deshmukh’s petition will be heard by Bombay high court on Thursday, where he is likely to seek a stay on the investigation, any coercive steps and filing of chargesheet without HC’s prior permission. Deshmukh said prior sanction was necessary to register an FIR against him as he was a minister when the offence is alleged to have occurred. Besides, he said, the FIR makes “bald and vague allegations” and no case of allegations of ‘illegal gratification” under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act or criminal conspiracy under Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code. The FIR was filed with ulterior motive to have him arrested, he claimed. Deshmukh’s petition further said that the HC had directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary enquiry and to take further steps “in accordance with law”. He also said that since Maharashtra had last year withdrawn its general consent to the CBI for investigating offences occurring in the state, barring a direct order by the high court or Supreme Court, which is lacking in the case, the agency cannot lodge and probe an FIR. —Swati Deshpande||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fir-filed-sans-maharashtra-states-consent-deshmukh/articleshow/82418625.cms||---

Candidates backed by his party have won in more than 50 wards in the state. Chandrashekhar Azad, who is popularly known as the Bhim Army chief, told TOI, "Not just in Muzaffarnagar, people have given us mandate in more than 50 zila panchayat seats across the state. All the winners have been asked not to sit at home, but start preparing for the 2022 assembly polls with a single aim to stop BJP from coming back to power. Had the state administration been fair, our numbers in the panchayat polls could have been a lot better." In Muzaffarnagar district, Azad Samaj Party has won in seven out of 43 wards. "We have also won seats in Saharanpur, Bijnor, Kanpur, Etawah, Fatehpur, Kannauj, Gorakhpur, Balrampur, Basti, Azamgarh, Sultanpur, Unnao, Lucknow, Raebareli, Ambedkar Nagar, Aligarh, among other districts. This shows people are supporting our candidates," Azad said on Wednesday. The Bhim Army chief also claimed that "over 100 candidates contesting for the village pradhan post have won" in the panchayat polls. Notably, a few weeks ago, Azad was booked for violating the model code of conduct for "campaigning without permission" in Muzaffarnagar district. He had been slapped with several cases in the past as well. Talking about the latest incident, Azad said, "I am a man who receives gifts from the police all the time. I was even booked under the National Security Act. So, we are not afraid of police cases. The government will again slap a case on me or my party workers, but we will not step back."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bhim-army-chief-wants-cadres-to-gear-up-for-assembly-polls-after-party-claims-win-in-over-50-wards-across-up/articleshow/82415473.cms||Mohd Dilshad

But while the incidence of the UK variant seemed to be declining, the double mutant variant B.1.617 - found in Maharashtra - could be a cause of the current surge seen over the last one and half months, said Sujeet Singh, director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the key agency steering surveillance and matching sequencing of samples of SARS-CoV2 and clinical evidence. Read Also18 states issued warnings on UK variant of SARS-CoV-2The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in Pune has told 18 states to keep an eye out for cases with the UK variant of SARS-CoV-2 after nearly 187 Covid-positive samples from these regions revealed the presence of the mutated version.The double mutant Covid variant that was first detected in India, has spread to at least 17 countries, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said. "The B117 lineage of SARS-CoV2 (UK variant) because of which we saw increased number of cases in Maharashtra and Delhi, is declining...The B.1.617 lineage has been seen in Maharashtra and now being seen in many places.

But while the incidence of the UK variant seemed to be declining, the double mutant variant B.1.617 - found in Maharashtra - could be a cause of the current surge seen over the last one and half months, said Sujeet Singh, director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the key agency steering surveillance and matching sequencing of samples of SARS-CoV2 and clinical evidence.

Villagers knew what good practices will keep them healthy and has proven its worth time and again, including in this second wave of the killer pandemic. This village, surrounded by Arabian sea, has a population of ten thousand people and not a single case of Covid-19 till now. It’s not just luck that’s helping the fishermen and their families here stay safe at a time when the entire country is crumbling in the battle against pandemic, but their self preservation methods too. “The village is small and there is awareness among people. The panchayat is distributing kadha and Ayurveda medicines to boost immunity but the villagers themselves avoid meeting outsiders. This is why those who go out for fishing dont return with infection.” explained Bhanuben Shiyal, Sarpanch of the village. Shiyalbet falls in Jafrabad taluka of Armeli district and is totally dependent on Jafrabad and Rajula for all its needs. Almost 99 percent population of the village is engaged in fishing activity, while their exposure to the world outside is very minimal as ration and medicines comes in boats to the village. The fishermen only go for fishing in the deep seas and contact with mainland is almost a luxury. “We are also taking all the precautions since last year which have saved us till now,” Shiyal added. Of the villages total population, 4,000 people go out to fish, while the rest including women and old people remain in the village. District development officer (DDO) of Amreli, Tejas Parmar said, “The village recorded only two positive cases last year, while there has been not a single case in the second wave. We have completed 52 percent vaccination of the first dose for people above 45 years of age in the village.” Parmar further said that no outsiders come into the village and only those who go for fishing leave in their boats. All education institutes are also closed and students too don’t need to go outside. Again, there is scant population of Amreli people in Jafrabad and Rajula taluka and so chances of getting infected from people visiting from Surat too is almost nil. Female health workers from the sub primary health centre in the village are available to address any health related needs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/shiyalbet-island-keeps-ncov-virus-at-bay/articleshow/82415547.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Delhi||AAP: Distribute tankers to states based on O2 needs||New Delhi: Claiming that there is no shortage of cryogenic tankers in India, Aam Aadmi Party on Wednesday demanded that the Centre should take over control of all the 1,631 cryogenic tankers in the country and distribute them equitably among states as per the oxygen requirements. Delhi, which is facing shortage of these tankers, needs 187 cryogenic tankers to carry 976 metric tonnes of oxygen required in the city daily, it said. Liquid medical oxygen is carried in specialised tankers called cryogenic tankers. Being a non-industrial state, Delhi has been struggling to procure these specialised transportation units. The party’s national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said that the 1,631 tankers were transporting only 8,500 MT of oxygen in the country and the central government must designate 187 cryogenic tankers for the 976 MT of oxygen demand in Delhi. He asserted that the 1,631 tankers can cater to nearly 22-23,000 MT oxygen. “There is no shortage of cryogenic tankers in India, which has been stated in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court. The existing fleet of these specialised tankers can carry three times more than our current total medical oxygen production of 8,500 metric tonnes,” he claimed. Chadha said that the way the central government was controlling and distributing oxygen, it should also control and distribute cryogenic tankers. “How will oxygen be transported to states without cryogenic tankers? We demand from the Centre that the cryogenic tankers should be allocated in every state in the same manner as the allocation of oxygen has been done. After the high court’s rebuke, the central government gave 555 metric tonnes of oxygen to Delhi, while our requirement is 976 metric tonnes,” he added. “Considering the Covid-19 crisis, the cryogenic tankers are our national asset. These 1,631 tankers have been illegally captured and monopolised by all the other states. There has been no proper and equitable distribution of these tankers to states,” the AAP spokesperson alleged. Chadha further said, “If they manage the distribution of oxygen and not the tankers in which it is supplied, the oxygen management becomes trivial.” The spokesperson said that the city was not an industrial state, which had been accepted by the Delhi high court too. “Delhi does not have its own oxygen plants, coal furnaces, etc, and hence, it does not produce any oxygen by itself. It is the responsibility of the Centre to declare and designate the oxygen supply and cryogenic tankers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-distribute-tankers-to-states-based-on-o2-needs/articleshow/82417418.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

All government and private offices and establishments will remain closed during this period while essential services such as health, electricity, telecommunication, water supply, and sanitation will be exempted. Keeping in view the sharp surge of Covid cases in the state, the cabinet decided that work will continue at civil worksites and horticultural, agricultural, and other projects, while educational institutions will remain closed till May 31. It decided to cancel the Class X exams of the Himachal Pradesh Board of School Education and promote all students to Class XI as per the norms suggested by the CBSE for its students of the same class. It also decided to suspend the Class XII board examination and annual exams of colleges till further orders. While briefing the media about the cabinet decisions, urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj said Section 144 of CrPC will be enforced during the ‘corona curfew’ to bar assembly of five or more persons at a place. He said Rs 7 crore has been approved for setting up two testing laboratories in Una and Kullu and Rs 2 crore each released for building makeshift hospitals in Kangra and Mandi districts. These hospitals with a bed capacity of over 100 and oxygen plants would be set up in a phased manner, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/10-day-corona-curfew-in-hp-from-tomorrow/articleshow/82417405.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Days between vaccination and blood donation cut from 28 to 14||MUMBAI: People can donate blood 14 days after taking a Covid-19 vaccine, according to an expert committee set up by National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) to review an earlier directive to donate blood only after 28 days. The decision came a week after Centre allowed vaccination for the 18-44 age group, who comprise the majority of blood donors in the country. Many had expressed concern about the 28-day period as it would have meant that recipients cannot donate blood for almost two months, severely affecting availability of blood. A letter by NBTC director Dr Sunil Gupta said that as “the government recently made Covid-19 vaccination available for general population above 18 years and the fact that so far no live attenuated vaccine has become available in the country, an expert group was constituted to review the advisory/guidelines.’’ The notification said the expert group had decided to reduce the deferral period for blood donors to 14 days “after receiving each/any dose of currently available Covid-19 vaccines in the country’’. Vinay Sheety of NGO Think Foundation said the new directive would help ensure there is no shortage of blood in any city. The Union health ministry increased the gap between two Covishield shots from 28 days to four-eight weeks, and up to 42 days between two Covaxin shots. India’s deferral period for blood donation is among the longest. American Red Cross has a period of 14 days for vaccines made from live attenuated virus and none for mRNA vaccines. UK has seven days for Oxford vaccine (Covishield).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-days-between-vax-and-blood-donation-cut-from-28-to-14/articleshow/82418617.cms||---

---||Delhi||48 more plants to be set up in city to address oxygen shortage: Kejriwal||New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday inspected the installation of the new oxygen plant at Satyawadi Raja Harishchandra Hospital. He said that 48 more such plants would be set up across Delhi in coming days. The plant can generate 330 litres of oxygen, which can fill 50-60 cylinders, and if used directly, 33 patients can be treated, the CM stated. Kejriwal extended his gratitude to the French government for its support to help install this oxygen plant. “Out of the 48 plants, we are importing 21 oxygen plants from France and the rest are from India,” he said. Kejriwal said Delhi saw an acute shortage of oxygen in the last few days. “While on the one hand, we are taking oxygen from the central government, on the other, we are also trying to produce as much oxygen as we can at our own level,” he stated. Over the plant being set up at Harishchandra Hospital, he said that the facility was expected to help the 200-bed hospital. “Though these are small plants, I feel they will provide a lot of support to the entire system that is under pressure due to shortage of oxygen.” Kejriwal said that he would like to thank the central government, the Supreme Court and the Delhi high court. “It is with their efforts that yesterday for the first time, Delhi received 700MT oxygen. You might have noticed that in the last 24 hours, there have been no messages regarding oxygen,” he asserted. The CM said Delhi’s oxygen requirement was 700MT, and if the city got this daily, additional beds could be set up in the city’s hospitals. “There are several hospitals that have reduced their beds due to oxygen shortage. If sufficient oxygen is available, all Delhi hospitals can work at full capacity. And many hospitals have told us that they can work beyond their capacity as well, and can set up 50-100 extra beds. In times of such a pandemic, we need to increase as many beds as possible.” Kejriwal appealed to the youth to get the shot and also get their parents and everyone in their homes vaccinated. “We don’t want anybody to fall sick,” the chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/48-more-plants-to-be-set-up-in-city-to-address-oxygen-shortage-kejriwal/articleshow/82444716.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||‘BJP is using muscle and money to defy verdict’||Lucknow: Baffled by the defeat in Panchayat polls, the BJP is now trying to use money, muscle and government machinery to defy the verdict of the people and grab power, said Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday. He said the BJP has thrown all democratic practices to wind and such acts will further antagonise the people and the anger of the masses will reflect in the 2022 assembly polls. “Such an approach proves that the BJP has scant regard for the democratic values that people of India nurture. People have voted against BJP and candidates supported by the party. Now the ruling BJP plans to reject people’s verdict and lure candidates supported by other political banners merely to ensure that the party stays in power in panchayats,” Akhilesh said. Attacking the government for what he described as a “poor show” in dealing with the pandemic, the former UP CM took a jibe at the BJP for its push to see “an opportunity in a crisis”. “They are playing with the lives of the people. All the more scary is the fear that the virus is now spreading fast in rural areas where the healthcare infrastructure is already in very bad shape,” Akhilesh said. He said medical facilities in rural areas do not have oxygen supply and beds in sufficient numbers and even the courts have said the government cannot shy away from being held responsible for the death of patients because of lack of oxygen. “The problem is that even after so many days of the second wave having hit the people, there is shortage of beds and oxygen at the hospitals, black marketing of medicines and oxygen cylinders is continuing unabated and the government has failed to address any of these issues,” Akhilesh said. He said the gross mismanagement is primarily because when the government was supposed to plan for such an emergency, the political leadership was busy addressing election rallies in other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-is-using-muscle-and-money-to-defy-verdict/articleshow/82418622.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The tender floated by UP Medical Supply Corporation Limited (UPMSCL) for 4 crore doses will be governed by the Government of India guidelines. The tender documents can be downloaded from the UPMSCL website on May 7 and licensed vaccine manufacturers can submit them online by May 21. UP government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh said CM Yogi Adityanath had on April 29 decided that a global tender will be floated for the required additional vaccine doses. Four licensed companies, including Moderna, Sputnik and AstraZeneca, have been given approval by the Government of India. “Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, the two companies manufacturing vaccines in India, have already been given orders for 50 lakh doses each of Covishield and Covaxiny. However, due to large population, the state is making arrangements for additional doses and has floated global e-tender,” said a government spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-govt-floats-global-tender-for-4crore-jabs/articleshow/82418626.cms||Neha Lalchandani

A few hospitals got in touch with vaccine providers and are waiting for the delivery of stock. Apart from the price charged by the companies, the hospitals will be collecting about Rs 150 to 200 extra for each jab. As of Wednesday night, according to the CoWin portal vaccination was available only in three private hospitals including Apollo centres. The slots were immediately booked for the next seven days. Sources said that many city hospitals approached city-based Bharat Biotech to procure vaccines. “There is a lot of demand from the hospitals. The waiting list for some is over 20 days,” a source said. Some private hospitals said that they were promised only a few thousand vials. There are 143 registered private vaccination centres in the state, of which 54 are in Hyderabad, 54 in Medchal-Malkajgiri and 40 in Ranga Reddy. A few hospitals told TOI on condition of anonymity that the state government should allow to vaccinate people between the age group of 18 and 45. “When they are allowing us to purchase directly from the companies, they should also let us inoculate people of all age groups,” said the manager of a private hospital. Meanwhile, Telangana Super Specialities Hospitals Association (TSHA) president B Bhaskar Rao said that they are in the process of procuring Covaxin. “We have put an indent for Covaxin,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vaccine-not-available-at-many-private-hospitals/articleshow/82417415.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Delhi||Chadha urges Centre on regular supply||New Delhi: Issuing the oxygen bulletin for Wednesday, AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said on Thursday that Delhi had received 730 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen from the Centre for the first time, out of which 250MT was a one-time temporary or ad hoc arrangement. He demanded that the Centre make this supply permanent. “They must clearly add the supply to regular sources of oxygen. Our demand is 976MT, which is not temporary, but permanent. Hence, the supply should also be regular,” he demanded. Chadha said 730MT was 75% of Delhi’s demand and around 35% of this supply had arrived from ad hoc sources and diversions from other states. “Since the oxygen supply increased, the SOS calls also decreased. While we used to get around 40-50 calls, we received only 16 SOS calls on Wednesday,” he said. Chadha claimed that all 16 calls were addressed and these hospitals had 2,777 oxygen-equipped beds. The total need of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) in Delhi, for private and government hospitals and small-scale nursing homes, comes to 976MT, said the AAP legislator. “In the past, we have been receiving less than 50% of this demanded number, varying between 300MT and 400MT. It has usually been less than 400 MT, but only on the few days when we were a bit lucky, we received around 400MT or more,” he said. After the high court and the Supreme Court condemned the Centre and ordered it to supply sufficient oxygen, “they have for the first time ever supplied 730MT of oxygen”, he added. Chadha claimed that approximately 250 MT had been supplied “through ad hoc and ‘jugaad’ sources or owing to some pressure from the authorities. Trucks that were supposed to go to some other states were diverted to Delhi. This is how they tried fulfilling the demanded oxygen intake of 976MT”. The spokesperson said SOS calls from hospitals had gone down rapidly due to the increase in supply. “We received only 16 such calls from hospitals on Wednesday in the oxygen war room. This was a massive decline. It was done and facilitated either through reserves, in the form of LMO, transferred through cryogenic tankers, or cylinders,” Chadha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chadha-urges-centre-on-regular-supply/articleshow/82444758.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||UAPA charges not before special court, 2 get bail||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday granted bail to Moga-based car dealer Pankaj Bansal and Chandigarh-based Vishal Gun House dealer Satish Kumar in connection with an illegal weapon case. Bansal is also an accused in Behbal Kalan police firing case. Both were accused in August last year by the Punjab police in relation to a 2014 inter-state illegal foreign made weapon smuggling case. They were arrested in connection with an FIR registered on October 18, 2014, under sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 472, 392 IPC and 25 of Arms Act. In 2020, the police added Sections 120-B of IPC, sections 16 and 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, and Section 25(6)(7)(8) of Arms Act, 1959, to the FIR registered at Faridkot City police station. Justice Rajesh Bhardwaj granted them bail while observing that the chargesheet/challan was presented by the police in the court of judicial magistrate first class (JMIC), Faridkot, which is not a competent court to try the case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967. According to the judge, the accused should have been tried by a special court constituted under the statute. HC also observed even though the Punjab police had filed challan against them before the JMIC court in Faridkot within the stipulated period of 90 days, it does not come to the rescue of the prosecution because that is not the appropriate court under the law to take cognizance of such offence. Both Satish and Pankaj had approached the HC after their plea for bail was rejected by the Faridkot court. Petitioners’ counsels Rajiv Malhotra and Nandan Jindal had contended that the chargesheet for the offence under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, had not been filed by the investigating agency in the special court within the prescribed statutory period of 90 days as per the mandate. They have contended that filing of the challan in the court of JMIC, Faridkot, amounted to non-filing of the challan in the eyes of law, as the court of JMIC, Faridkot, is not the special court under the act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/uapa-charges-not-before-special-court-2-get-bail/articleshow/82417412.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 50% passenger cap on public vehicles||KOLKATA: Public transport vehicles will allow up to 50% of their total passenger capacity on board from Thursday to minimize the spread of Covid-19. Fewer buses will be out on roads but Metro will run sufficient services. Metro Railway, which has already announced the plan to reduce north-south services from 238 to 216 from Thursday, has been registering a drop in footfall, recording a daily count of 1.2 lakh nowadays. From Thursday, the first trains will leave terminal stations at 7.30am instead of 7.20am and the last trains will leave Dakshineswar at 8.48pm instead of 8.58pm and Dum Dum and Kavi Subhas at 9pm instead of 9.10pm. “As announced earlier, there will be 216 services from Thursday. We will have to further reduce the number of trains in the absence of local trains. Our staff members will have to depend on Eastern Railway and South-Eastern Railway staff specials to come to work. We shall have to match operational hours with these staff specials,” said Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi.  From Friday, Metro is likely to start beyond 7.30am and terminate before 9pm. Joshi said, “The state government has told us to run at 50% of passenger capacity. In pre-Covid times, Metro had 2,000 passengers a train at a given point of time. Now, the count has come down to 500 passengers, which is around 25% of our capacity.” Officials, however, reassured that the number of services would continue to be enough to accommodate the current demand. “Fewer people are travelling these days. We want to run enough trains to maintain physical distancing,” an official said. The number of buses—both state transport undertakings (STUs) and private—will, however, be down to 50%. Currently, 1,000 STU and 2,000 private buses ply in Kolkata.  “We have asked the route committees to introduce an alternate-day-run system so that all bus operators can earn their living,” said a transport department official. The transport directorate is also facilitating sanitization of buses on every route. In the absence of suburban trains, bus operators fear a drop in passenger count.  “Buses and trains are dependent on each other. Most bus terminuses are located near railway stations. If local trains don’t operate, commute demand for buses will automatically go down,” said Tapan Bandyopadhyay, secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates. In the next few days, STUs and private bus operators will gauge the demand vis-a-vis routes and adjust frequency of services. Though there is no restriction on taxis and autos, operators said the number of vehicles would depend on demand as well. Last year, cabs played a crucial role in ferrying patients and maintaining supply line for medicines. This time, too, cabs may play similar role. Restrictions on the number of auto passengers may be reimposed. Currently, around 40,000 cabs operate in the city. If the demand is low, a large number of taxis will automatically go off the road. Similarly, autos on a route may run on alternate days, giving opportunity to all operators to earn a living.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/50-passenger-cap-on-public-vehicles/articleshow/82417426.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

On Wednesday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed officials concerned to start preparations on ground for setting up of these plants at the earliest. Yogi said that 743 tons of oxygen had been made available to hospitals on Tuesday. Efforts are on to take this up to 800 tons per day soon, he said. “We are working to improve availability of oxygen. Seven institutes like IIT-Kanpur, BHU, IIM-Lucknow, AKTU, MMTU Gorakhpur and Moti Lal Nehru Regional Engineering College Prayagraj, have been asked to carry out an oxygen audit in districts," he said. “They will look at the demand and supply in each district, number of beds available in all the hospitals, oxygen supplied etc. This will help us gauge the exact demand in the state and where we need to focus the resources,” the CM said. He added that the Indian Railways and Air Force were helping the state as empty tanks were being airlifted by the Air Force to filling centres from where special Oxygen Express trains were bringing them back. A government spokesperson said that 4,370 oxygen concentrators have been made available to all districts. Each community health centre is being equipped with 20 concentrators. Trains were being sent to Bareilly and Moradabad each day while Agra’s demand was being supplemented by the Air Force. Yogi added that there were some districts which do not have an anaesthetic. He said that anaesthetics and technicians should be made available there within 24 hours and asked the chief secretary to carry out a daily review of the oxygen plants that are being set up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/centres-nod-to-37-oxygen-plants-in-up/articleshow/82418627.cms||---
---||Delhi||O2 supply up, but still short by 43%: Delhi govt||NEW DELHI: The oxygen bulletin for Tuesday reported an improvement in the supply to the city. Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson and MLA Raghav Chadha said on Wednesday that 555 metric tonnes of oxygen had arrived in Delhi, but this was still only 57% of the demand placed by Delhi government. Chadha also pointed out that this supply came from temporary, non-regular sources in compliance with court orders and demanded guaranteed supplies from regular sources with a reliable supply chain. The oxygen bulletin also revealed that the state government received 48 SOS calls for oxygen on Tuesday from hospitals which together had 4,036 oxygen-equipped beds and supplied them with 36.4 MT of the gas from the emergency buffer stocks. Chadha said that after Delhi High Court's rebuke, the central government has allotted Delhi 555 MT of oxygen though the requirement in the capital was 976 MT. He said, “Delhi High Court even compared the Centre to an ostrich hiding its head in the sand and criticised it for being ignorant of the massive toll caused by the insufficiency in oxygen supply. The central government appears to living in an ivory tower, oblivious to the plight of people.” It was only due to this strongly worded criticism by the high court on Tuesday that Delhi was able to get the biggest volume of oxygen till now from the Centre, said the Rajendra Nagar MLA. “Yesterday we received 555 MT of liquid medical oxygen. When we compare this volume with what we got in the last 10-12 days, it is high, but it was only the result of the court’s condemnation,” said Chadha. The AAP spokesperson, however, said the supply was ad-hoc. “It was a result of jugaad by the Centre. It was not supplied to us via our identified sources, such as plants in Kalinga Nagar, Kashipur, Durgapur, etc. The gas was supplied through temporary measures, like by diverting oxygen trucks going to another state,” he said. “We really hope that we receive the oxygen with full certainty and the plants that are designated to supply to Delhi do so on a regular basis.” He hoped that the central government wouldn’t just supply the stipulated volume of oxygen only when the courts denounce the central government. “There should be a system that does not require the intervention of the judiciary, through the plants permanently designated to provide Delhi oxygen supplies,” Chadha declared. There were 48 distress calls regarding oxygen shortage in hospitals on Tuesday. “This included complaints like unavailability of oxygen and cylinders or depleting stocks or problems with refilling. “In response to these, we supplied 36.4 MT of oxygen and met the needs of all the distressed hospitals,” said the MLA. “We have formulated a number of response points, like at Raj Ghat and Mayapuri, from where the SOS stock reserves are mobilised.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/o2-supply-up-but-still-short-by-43-govt/articleshow/82417465.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||3 patients booked for leaving Covid facility in Beed district||Aurangabad: Three Covid-19 positive patients quarantined at a facility in Wadvani taluka of Beed district, about 165km from here, have been booked after they stepped out of a Covid care centre to bring water and food from the market. Officials said that a video of the trio returning to the Covid-19 facility with food articles and distilled water box went viral, following which a complaint was filed by community health officer Deepak Gavde. The three patients have been booked under sections of IPC 188 (disobeying orders duly promulgated by authorities), 269 (negligently does any act which is likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life,) and 270 (malignantly does any act which is likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life). In addition to this they have also been slapped with the sections of The Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act 2005. Gavde has stated in his complaint that the three patients, who were admitted to the Anand Mangal Karyalaya-based Covid facility on April 27, stepped out on May 2. “It was first noticed by a ward boy deployed at the centre. “On being asked, they admitted to have gone to the nearby market for getting fruits, water bottles and some snacks,” said Gavde. One of the patients claimed that he was not comfortable with drinking water at the facility as as it was of “poor quality”. Another patient said that he wanted to have some fruits and snacks and hence he decided to step out of the facility. When contacted, police said that appropriate preventive action will be taken once the suspects complete their quarantine period at the Covid facility. Beed district had come under sharp focus in the last week of April when two Covid-19 patients died after an oxygen supply valve was allegedly turned off by an unidentified person at the civil hospital. The incident had taken place in the hospital’s ward number 7, the parents of the deceased had said. While the hospital authorities claimed that only one of the patients was on oxygen support, the relatives alleged that both of them were on oxygen support. A probe was ordered into the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/3-patients-booked-for-leaving-covid-facility-in-beed-district/articleshow/82392839.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Pune||Remdesivir crisis to ease after May 10: Minister||Pune/Mumbai: Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration (FDA) minister Rajendra Shingane on Wednesday said supply of remdesivir to the state would improve after May 10. He said letters have been sent to all seven companies directed to supply the medicine as allotted by the Centre. Besides, Maharashtra is considering to procure 1.5 lakh vials of remdesivir from Uzbekistan as part of the global tender the state has floated. “Of the seven companies, only two were providing the medicine to the state. This is the reason for the current shortfall. The Centre had allocated 8.9 lakh vials of remdesivir to Maharashtra till May 9. But the state has received only 4. 74 lakh vials,” Shingane said. “Our daily requirement is around 60,000-70,000 vials of the drug. But we are able to provide only around 43,000 vials a day. We have sent a letter to each of the seven companies to streamline the supply,” he said, adding that the global tender floated was being assessed by the relief and rehabilitation department and should be finalized soon. The minister said the companies said they were facing shortage of raw material but pledged to streamline the supply. Officials in the department said if all the seven companies started supplying medicines as assured, the situation would be much different for Maharashtra. Shingane said Maharashtra was also banking on a state-based company to produce liquid remdesivir at its Palghar plant. “If that happens, the situation will definitely improve,” he said. Meanwhile, the state received 22,450 doses of remdesivir under USAID on Wednesday. Shingane said Maharashtra was also expecting an increased allocation of oxygen from Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. “The state currently needs 1,750 tonnes of oxygen and has sought 200 tonnes from the Centre. Maharshtra has started one train for oxygen supply. The rest of the supply is being done by road because of logistic issues,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/remdesivir-crisis-to-ease-after-may-10-minister/articleshow/82417428.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Chandigarh||Haryana BJP defies protocol to protest Bengal violence||Chandigarh: Defying the prohibitory orders barring all political events and assembly of more than four persons, Haryana BJP men on Wednesday staged sit-ins across the state to protest against post poll violence in West Bengal. There have been reports of BJP workers being attacked by activists of Mamta Banerjee-led AITMC there. While Mamta Banerjee was sworn in as the West Bengal chief minister for the third time, senior BJP functionaries in Haryana led the protests against the violence. Union minister for state (independent charge) Jal Shakti Mission Ratan Lal Kataria, Haryana ministers, MLAs and former ministers and ex-MLAs joined the agitations at various places, giving the opposition parties in the state a reason to rebuke them for not following. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar while replying to a question during a web conference also criticised the violence in West Bengal. While congratulating Banerjee and raising the issue of attack on BJP workers, he defended the agitation by his party men in the state. “Workers have strong resentment against the attacks, hence they staged protest. But, it was for a very short time,” he said. Questions on permission to hold protests, remained unanswered. Karnal BJP district president Yogendra Rana claimed that six party members were allegedly killed and the party’s offices were vandalised by the TMC workers in West Bengal. He said the President’s Rule should be imposed in West Bengal as its law and order had deteriorated . Haryana BJP President Om Parkash Dhankar termed the agitations in the state peaceful. “Pandemic is on and state is under lockdown with lot many restrictions. But, the BJP workers and leaders are throwing the law to the winds. Instead of staging agitation, they should have worked selflessly for the welfare of Covid patients or those who are really in need,” Haryana Congress chief Selja posted on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-bjp-defies-protocol-to-protest-bengal-violence/articleshow/82417423.cms||---

The Agarwal Samaj, largely comprising members associated with the textile trade, has a network of about 65 to 70 people spread across 50 locations in the city. With monetary support, pouring in from within the community and from outside, they have been able to procure about 55 oxygen concentrators so far and is in the process of procuring another 100 to fight the acute scarcity. “On an average, we receive close to 50-60 calls everyday from people who are in need,” said Govind Agarwal, president, Agarwal Samaj Telangana adding, “Apart from concentrators and cylinders we are also assisting patients with wheel chairs, beds, plasma donations, vaccine support, medicines etc.,” Initially, the concentrators are set up for a patient for three days but the period is extended, if required. No deposit or rent is collected by the community. Their services are available in areas such as Nacharam, Abids, Banjara Hills, Malakpet, Kondapur, Serilingampally among others. So far, they have helped close to 600 patients across the city with oxygen cylinders and concentrators. “I was admitted in the hospital for a paralytic attack. Subsequently, I faced breathlessness due to which I had to be on constant oxygen support. I reached out to the Agarwal Samaj that arranged an oxygen concentrator for me, which I utilised almost for a month,” said Dr Rajeshwar Kukatla, a doctor. Speaking about the initiative, former vice-president of Agarwal Samaj Telangana, Mahadeo Prasad Agarwal, said that the group decided to source and lease concentrators as the second wave started peaking. “As the situation turned grim, we decided to purchase oxygen concentrators and offer them to people who were running from pillar to post for oxygen,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/delivering-free-oxygen-cylinders-and-medicines-to-those-in-need/articleshow/82417427.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Mumbai||Cops ‘hypersensitive’: Bombay HC junks case against tweet||MUMBAI: Observing that Mumbai police’s approach to a tweet by Navi Numbai resident Sunaina Holey was “hypersensitive and overcautious”, the Bombay high court on Wednesday quashed a criminal case against her for her social media post last April on a gathering of migrant workers outside Bandra Terminus. She was charged with promoting communal disharmony during the nationwide lockdown, reports Swati Deshpande. The HC said the tweet does not disclose any guilty mind or intention of Holey (39) to commit the alleged offence under IPC Section 153A to promote enmity between different groups. The case against her was “too far-fetched”, said the court, adding that neither has any community nor any religion been named in the tweet. Tweet didn’t create hatred between 2 communities: HCQuashing a criminal complaint against Navi Numbai resident Sunaina Holey for her tweet posted last April on a gathering of migrant workers outside Bandra Terminus, a Bombay high court bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik said: “Assuming that the said tweet is an extreme view expressed in retaliation to the view expressed by one of the members of the crowd who was blaming the PM for the outbreak of the pandemic, the said tweet has still to be judged from the standpoint of what the reaction of a strong-minded, reasonable or a prudent person would be.” Observing that police had produced “nothing substantial”, the HC added that if a ‘prudent person’ test was applied to Holey’s tweet, “by no stretch of imagination” can it be said that it created any hatred or enmity “between two communities”. The HC quashed the FIR filed by Azad Maidan police, but noted that the police had acted with “promptitude” in noticing the video and tweet. It said that “migrants were anxious to go back… police machinery had proceeded in the correct direction trying to control and pacify the crowd”. But there was no disturbance of peace reported in society after Holey’s tweet or even during police investigation, it pointed out. The state, through its special senior counsel Manoj Mohite, argued that while her tweet was not responsible for the crowd outside Bandra Terminus, it made it look like the gathering was of one community where one man was trying to blame the PM for the pandemic. After Holey’s counsel Abhinav Chandrachud counter-argued that no case had been made out against his client as she was not the author of the video and police had not registered any case against the person allegedly blaming the PM, the HC said, “Merely a reference made to Bandra masjid location in the tweet by the petitioner would not attract provisions of IPC Section 153A.” Last July, Holey was also booked for her alleged offensive posts against CM Uddhav Thackeray and his minister son Aaditya. Her quashing petition against this case is pending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/tweet-didnt-create-hatred-between-2-communities-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/82418630.cms||---

On Monday, he got a call around 11 pm. A family from Andheri wanted to cremate the body of their relative who died due to Covid. Chiran drove an ambulance to the hospital in a PPE kit, took custody of the corpse and drove to to the crematorium in Oshiwara. It’s not his job, but Chiran is doing this as a social obligation he has taken upon himself.These stressed times amid the second phase of the lockdown have spawned a phalanx of silent footsoldiers silently doing their bit, reaching out to hapless patients or to their beleaguered relatives.“I get 2-3 calls every night... It was more difficult in the first lockdown. But even now, getting drivers for ambulances and priests to perform last rites is very difficult,” says Chiran who charges people a nominal amount. “It’s my way of helping people in crisis,” he says, adding that so far he has helped cremate nearly 100 bodies. In most cases, relatives are scared to perform the last rites “So, a couple of volunteers and I do it symbolically. as part of social work,” he says. BJP MLA Ameet Satam had given him an ambulance which he uses to transport Covid patients. In Byculla, Shoeb Hashmi (33) gets over 300 calls a day from patients and their relatives asking for an ICU bed, oxygen bed or life-saving drugs like remdesivir. Hashmi, a social worker for close to eight years says that his phone is on till 5 every morning. “Many people tag leaders on Twitter and send details on WhatsApp. We collate all that and contact the people. Besides Mumbai, we get hundreds of calls for beds from places Mumbra, Bhiwandi and elsewhere in the state. Once we get a call, we check with the hospital for beds and go to the hospital to check the status of beds. Once we confirm with the hospital, we confirm with the ward war room and tell them to complete the procedure,” says Hashmi. “Most calls still come for ICU beds and remdesivir. Many patients from outside Mumbai can’t afford treatment too. So we also source funds for them. We also reach out to those who are not on social media,” says Hashmi who has been working with Samajwadi Party MLA Rais Shaikh. Likewise, Chinu Kwatra has been distributing oxygen cylinders since last month as part of his ‘Oxygen Seva’ initiative. “We have reached out to around 4,000 critical patients and given them oxygen. We do this as part of our Ananta Khushiyan organisation. We take donations and source cylinders from vendors. We run an oxygen war room 24x7. So patients and relatives call up and we give them oxygen. We send cylinders to their homes if they are in isolation, concentrators and even to hospitals facing shortage,” Kwatra says. This initiative will now reach New Delhi too. “We are sending 100 cylinders to Delhi as the oxygen situation in Mumbai has improved. We are taking donations and giving cylinders free of cost,” says Kwatra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-unsung-footsoldiers-step-in-to-ease-the-woes-of-patients-kin/articleshow/82418649.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

This is for the first time that someone had dared to threaten to harm one of the five temporal seats of the Sikhs, Patna Sahib jathedar Giani Ranjit Singh told TOI on Wednesday. He said: “The entire community is perturbed by this idiotic act of some dumb and absurd person who has no respect for religion.” The jathedar is on a personal visit to Punjab. Written in Hindi, the letter is addressed to the general secretary of the Takht and reads: “Pay this ransom within a month.” The sender has even signed as Ranjan Kumar and provided two contact numbers and a residential address, while warning the Takh against going to police. The jathedar said: “As soon as I get back, we will send a delegation to the Bihar chief minister to seek a high-level investigation into this threat. General secretary Mohinderpal Singh Dhillon has written to the Bihar director general of police already.” Reacting to the threat, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) former president Manjit Singh GK appealed to the Bihar CM to check this attempt to distract the Sikhs from helping the Covid-19 patients. The sender has not mentioned what motivated him to threaten one of the holiest shrines of Sikhs. “In all probability, it is a cruel joke but whatever it is must be exposed,” said Ranjit Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rs-50-cr-extortion-letter-to-takht-patna-sahib/articleshow/82417444.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Some of their members stealthily enter the cargo bed of a moving truck when it slows down while passing a speed breaker. The members then pass the goods to another vehicle which tails the truck,” a police official said.The combing operations were carried out in Malvan, Gediya, Sedla, Kherva, Ingrola and Sokhda villages. The Gediya (also known as Tadpatri gang) members such as Hanif Khan, Hazrat Khan and Rimiz Manek are wanted in many crimes and have been arrested in the past for stealing goods from moving trucks on highways. They were also booked under The Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Crime (GujCTOC) Act in February this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/goods-worth-rs-14-lakh-stolen-by-tadpatri-gang-seized-from-a-farm/articleshow/82415579.cms||---

The state government is yet to take a decision on exempting inter-state travellers from getting RT-PCR negative reports, following an advisory by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Of around 300 passengers coming each day from Delhi, Gujarat, Kerala, Uttarakhand, Goa and Rajasthan, three to four passengers have been testing positive for the contagion each day, said Pune rail officials. “Eight to ten trains arrive in Pune from these states every day. Of the total, just 15 passengers carry the RT-PCR negative reports. While the guidelines, including thermal screening of all passengers, a rapid antigen test of those showing symptoms and not carrying RT-PCR negative report are being followed, the process is time-consuming. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) team is involved in conducting the tests,” said a rail official. “At present, the state government is only seeking RT-PCR negative reports from travellers coming to Maharashtra from states of sensitive origin. We will discuss the recommendations internally and a decision will be taken soon,” Aseem Gupta, principal secretary for relief and rehabilitation, told TOI. State transport minister Anil Parab said, “Inter-state travel is very little at present and, in most cases, we aren’t asking for an RT-PCR negative report. Once the restrictions end on May 15, a decision on the ICMR recommendation will be taken.” Apart from those traveling into the state in trains from the five states, those flying to any airport in Maharashtra from Delhi, Gujarat, Goa, Rajasthan and Kerala must have an RT-PCR negative report, which shouldn’t be older than 72 hours. Also, many states have enforced a similar rule for passengers flying from Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/less-than-5-passengers-carry-negative-reports/articleshow/82417437.cms||Joy Sengupta

Chairing a high-level meeting through videoconferencing to review the availability and supply of medical oxygen, Nitish asked the officials of industries and health departments to constitute a high-level committee to take fast action on any decision taken in a coordinated manner. “Take all necessary steps to make arrangement of sufficient number of refilling plants, bottling plants and tankers etc. The state government will arrange funds for all these works,” Nitish told the officials. He further asked the health department officials to increase the number of beds in government medical college hospitals. “All government doctors should be positively motivated and encouraged so that there should be no shortcomings in the treatment of Covid patients,” Nitish said. The CM asked the health officials to also keep an eye on the facilities being provided at the sub-divisional hospitals. “You must ensure availability of necessary medicines and oxygen at all sub-divisional hospitals so that patients admitted there should not face any difficulty,” he told the health officials. He asked all the DMs and the health officials to visit private hospitals on a regular basis and enquire from Covid patients about the medical facilities being provided there. “Also inquire about the process for admission of patients, discharge report, death report, status of supply of oxygen, availability of doctors, nurses and other paramedical staff in the private hospitals where Covid patients are being treated,” Nitish said. He further asked the DMs to find out all those shopowners who are selling oxygen cylinders and Remdesivir injection on blak market. “Keep a close vigil on such shopowners and take tough action against them,” Nitish told the DMs. The CM also sought action against those ambulance operators who are exorbitantly charging from Covid patients. He asked the health department to increase the number of ambulances to provide necessary support to the patients. Deputy CMs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi, health minister Mangal Pandey, industries minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain, chief secretary Tripurari Sharan, development commissioner Amir Subhani joined the meeting through videoconferencing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/increase-oxygen-generating-capacity-nitish-tells-officials/articleshow/82415417.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Delhi||Rates for private ambulances capped in Delhi||NEW DELHI: In the wake of reports that several private ambulance service providers were charging exorbitant rates for transporting patients, especially Covid patients, Delhi government on Thursday capped the rates of private ambulances. TOI had recently reported that private ambulance operators were charging many people exorbitant rates as high as Rs 10,000 for a 4-km trip and Rs 42,000 for a round trip from Model Town to Radha Soami Covid Centre. The government has capped the maximum rate at Rs 1,500 per call up to 10km for patient transport ambulance with Rs 100 per extra km above 10km, Rs 2,000 for basic life support ambulance per call up to 10 km and Rs 100 per extra km above 10 km, Rs 4,000 for advanced life support ambulance per call up to 10 km and Rs 100 per extra km above 10 km. For advanced life support ambulance, the Rs 4,000 cap also includes charges of doctor. “It has come to our notice that private ambulance services in Delhi are charging illegitimately. To avoid this practice, Delhi government has capped maximum prices that private ambulance services can charge. Strict actions will be taken against those who violate the order,” CM Arvind Kejriwal tweeted. An order issued by the health and family welfare department stated: “CATS is providing 24x7 free ambulance service in Delhi through a single toll-free number 102. However, it has come to notice that some private ambulance drivers or service providers are charging exorbitant rates in Delhi during the Covid-19 pandemic for transporting patients, which is a matter of serious concern. It has therefore been decided by the competent authority that maximum rates for private patient transport ambulance, basic life support ambulance and advanced life support ambulance shall be capped in Delhi.” Centralised Accident and Trauma Services (CATS) is an autonomous body under the Delhi government. “If any instance of private ambulance service providers charging rates higher than the capped ones comes to the notice, strict action as per applicable laws will be taken against them,” said an official. The action may include cancellation of the driving licence of ambulance driver, cancellation of the registration certificate of ambulance and impounding of the ambulance. The maximum rates of different categories of ambulances are all inclusive. The rates also include charges for oxygen, all ambulance equipment as per CRA guidelines, PPE Kit, gloves, mask, shield, sanitisation, driver, EMT, doctor, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rates-for-pvt-ambulances-capped-in-city/articleshow/82444804.cms||AlokKNMishra

Earlier, jewellery stores were clubbed with establishments selling non-essential goods and could stay open only between 7am and 10am and then, 3 pm to 5 pm. Jewellery stores, which had requested the government to review their timings, have been allowed to function from noon to 3pm. “Nobody goes to buy jewellery in the morning. So we had requested the government to review our hours even though we don’t expect very good business now. The government allowing us to operate for three hours in the afternoon will help,” said Jayanta Basak of Geetnajali Jewellers on BB Ganguly Street. Though curbs have been imposed on weddings, jewellery store owners have their fingers crossed hope to get some business. “We were hoping for the business to improve this time as last year was a complete washout. But the second wave has dashed our hopes. Let’s hope the situation improves before the festive season,”said the owner of a Burrabazar store.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/afternoon-timing-may-help-biz-feel-jewellery-stores/articleshow/82417462.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The calls are related to a wide range of issues including trafficking, child marriage, child labour, employment, domestic violence and Covid treatment. For instance, village sevikas in Palkot block of Gumla district recently called up the IRRC helpline number when they came learnt that a Class VII girl was being trafficked to Delhi on the pretext of providing employment. An SRC official said that the helpline numbers, which used to receive five to 10 calls each day, were now getting 15-20 calls. Several calls were from school students who complained about being compelled to remain indoors owing to the worsening Covid-19 situation. Similarly, many parents are calling the IRRC to help them bring back their children stuck in metropolitan cities. Notably, SRC Ranchi and IRRC New Delhi are managed by Bal Kalyan Sangh (BKS) with the support of the state department of women and child development. The secretary of BKS, Sanjay Mishra, said, “Counselling has become important as the stress level among people is high. Besides, chances of domestic violence and child trafficking are also likely to increase during the current phase. We also help the callers in meeting their Covid requirements, including oxygen and hospital beds.” The BKS is also running Samvedna, a tele-consultancy programme to help people affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The helpline number received 449 calls so far, out of which 14 were related to violence against women, 127 were about medical treatment for Covid patients and 233 calls were on stress resulting from closure of schools and colleges. Besides, nine calls were concerning information about oxygen, 15 about treatment of Covid patients in home isolation and 51 were test calls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/2nd-wave-propels-new-surge-in-distress-calls-trafficking-bids/articleshow/82415817.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Dhanbad deputy commissioner Uma Shankar Singh on Wednesday said that they have decided to pay an honorarium of Rs 5,000 per month to the nursing students either from the District Mineral Foundation Trust (DMFT) or from CSR fund. “The move will also motivate the students,” he added. The district administration so far has already deployed 50 nursing students at the Covid wards of Shahid Nirmal Mahto Medical College and Hospital (SNMMCH) and 26 others at Dhanbad sadar hospital. The district administration has also roped in the services of 15 doctors from private hospitals for different Covid hospitals and telemedicine centres to providing medical assistance and advice to Covid patients. This is over and above the 50 government doctors either from SNMMCH or sadar hospitals who have been deployed on Covid duty. The district administration has also appointed DMFT project manager Shubham Singhal as the nodal officer to ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply to different hospitals. The DC has also directed the executive engineer of the building division to get the civil work of the 50-bed ICU and 100-bed oxygen supported non-ICU wards at SNMMCH by May 11. Meanwhile, four resorts which were asked to keep 10 to 20 bed oxygen-supported beds ready for paid isolation by the district administration have expressed their inability to provide the facility, citing lack of trained manpower and oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/in-dhanbad-3rd-year-nursing-students-put-on-covid-19-duty/articleshow/82414689.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A division bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad was hearing a public interest litigation online on Wednesday when it ordered M/s Vijeta Constructions to come up with a concrete plan for completion of the project within the time frame. The bench during the course of hearing was informed that the contractor will require a minimum of 30 days for completing the project of commissioning 300 beds with oxygen in the sadar hospital. The court was peeved with such disclosure and queried why cannot a temporary arrangement of a storage tank of oxygen be made in the hospital campus. The court also issued notices to the Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Bokaro and the Union government to intervene in the matter. The court had earlier on May 3 ordered that the pending work at the sadar hospital be completed in two days which was not done. The case will now be heard in the next week. The court had taken up the matter after the government failed to keep its earlier commitment to adequately increase the number of beds at the sadar hospital. The high court had ordered the state to ensure that at least 500 beds be provided at the swanky sadar hospital in the city last year. The government had informed the court that it is on the way to commission 300 beds at the sadar hospital with oxygen facility for the treatment of Covid patients in the capital and neighbouring areas. The work, however, has not been completed till date after which it is being monitored by the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/sadar-hosp-must-get-300-o2-beds-in-10-days-says-hc/articleshow/82415949.cms||---

The hospital will have 110 oxygen-supported beds and six ventilators-supported beds, deputy commissioner Ramesh Gholap said after the virtual inauguration. Soren also inaugurated 20 oxygen pipeline-supported beds at the sadar hospital in the district. Gholap said, “The dedicated Covid hospital will cater to patients with utmost care under the guidance of a dedicated team of doctors. Labour room and OT facilities have been started and 24 rooms have been identified to house medical staff and doctors who will remain in the hospital as per the roster.” He added four ambulances will be deployed at the hospital round-the-clock. “A help desk has been formed to cater to the needs of the people and a nodal officer has also been appointed for the hospital to ensure no patient is deprived of bed and oxygen.” The district currently has 160 oxygen-supported beds. Gholap said the district has 202 jumbo oxygen cylinders and 175 small cylinders. Meanwhile, in Ramgarh district, the Central Coalfields Limited (CCL), a subsidiary of Coal India Limited (CIL), has begun work to set up an air trapping greenhouse oxygen plant in the premise of the Central Hospital of CCL in Ramgarh town, which is functioning as a special Covid hospital in the district. The hospital is also a part of the Ranchi Covid Circuit, launched over a week back to facilitate patients in nearby districts of Ranchi in case of non-availability of beds. Ramgarh deputy commissioner Sandeep Singh said, “Once ready, the plant will provide oxygen to 100 beds through a pipeline.” “Currently, oxygen to beds is supplied through a pipeline from jumbo cylinders but after the installation of the air trapping plant, there will be no need of cylinders,” said Dr N Pandit, chief medical officer (administration) of the CCL hospital. The plant will be spread over nearly 3,000 sq feet area and will collect oxygen from the environment with the help of modern air trapping machines. “It will be operational within a month,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cm-opens-250-bed-cov-hosp-new-o2-beds-in-koderma-dist/articleshow/82414619.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The jail administration on Wednesday claimed that they were prepared to vaccinate prisoners, having trained their para-medical staff for the purpose. However, the drive has been slow as many prisoners, particularly those serving sentences for a long time, do not have photo identity cards like Aadhaar. Speaking on the issue, inspector general (prison) Birendra Bhushan said, “We are making phone calls to the relatives of the prisoners to provide us with relevant ID cards. The jail administration is also seeking information from other sources to move ahead with the drive.” Bhushan said that the administration has the prisoner’s number but that could not be publicly used. He added that owing to the bottleneck, the vaccination drive has been affected and only 10% of the inmates have been inoculated so far. Notably, the People Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) had written to the Chief Justice and judges of the Jharkhand high court stressing on the need for vaccinating prisoners in the state. The PUCL said that there were 5,000 prisoners aged 40 and above and they were vulnerable to Covid-19. It added, “Urgent action is needed by the court to make it mandatory for the state government to initiate a vaccination drive for the prisoners who are above the age of 40. The prisoners above 18 years but under 40 should be covered during the second drive.” The PUCL had also raised the issues of over-crowding in jail campuses and the lack of sufficient number of doctors to treat prisoners. The jail administration conceded that overall the occupancy rate of jails in state was 127%. It stated that efforts were on to shift 1,200 prisoners from the over-crowded jails including those in Deoghar, Latehar, Garhwa and Chatra. A jail official said, “We have taken a host of other measures to prevent any Covid outbreak. The number of Covid-positive cases in jails has been fewer in the second wave.” Regarding the availability of doctors, the jail administration said that it has sought from the health secretary the deputation of 35 doctors for the prisons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jail-authorities-face-id-bottleneck-in-vax-drive/articleshow/82415851.cms||Sanjay Sahay

BGH, which is facing a severe manpower crisis after almost 70 doctors and nurses tested positive in the past couple of weeks, is conducting walk-in interviews between Monday and Saturday to hire staff on a month-long basis to work in its Covid ward. Bokaro Steel Plant’s (BSL) chief of communication Manikant Dhan said there is a requirement for 30 doctors and 30 nurses. Most of the candidates who appeared in the last few days, have been selected and they are mostly from Bokaro. The selected candidates may be deployed for both Covid and non-Covid duty. The doctors will be paid Rs 5,000 for eight hours of duty in a day and nurses Rs 1,000 a day, Dhan said. The BGH management has received a lot of applications and more number of doctors and nurses are expected to appear in the walk-in interview. BGH, which is a unit of BSL, has converted 10 of its wards (which is almost 250 beds) into a Covid ward in the aftermath of the second wave.

---||Business||Green tea push can lift India’s exports: Report||Kolkata: If India ramps up its green tea production, it will be able to boost its exports kitty and tap the US market at a cheaper cost, says a research report by Drip Capital which was exclusively shared with ToI. Only 2% of India’s tea exports comprise green tea and 91% of it is black tea, the remaining being other tea preparations. “India’s tea exports have declined at a CAGR of -1% in the last decade (2010-2019). While COVID-19 did add strain on the industry, one of the main reasons for this stagnation can be attributed to the rising demand for green tea that India failed to tap into,” said Pushkar Mukewar, co-founder and CEO, Drip Capital. Globally, in the last decade, the imports of black tea declined at a CAGR of 0.5% and green tea – the youths’ choice – rose at a CAGR of 4.1%. But, over the last decade, green tea exports from India have declined at a CAGR of 2.2%. Green tea dictates a 14% higher market price ($3150 per tonne) than black tea ($2760/tonne), says the report. Explaining the factors driving China’s tea exports better than India’s, Mukewar said: “In the last decade, tea production in China and India grew at a CAGR of 7% and 3% per annum, respectively. The neighbouring country harvested two times more tea than India in 2019 alone. While China’s total export quantity has only grown by just 2%, its export value grew at a 10% between 2010-2019. China today ships almost 60% of the global tea exports.” However, Anshuman Kanoria, chairman, Indian Tea Exporters’ Association (ITEA), didn’t quite agree with the report. “The unit price of Chinese tea is very low. There is a little scope to capture substantial market share from cheap origins as India’s cost of production is higher. Overall, it’s a fact that we need to expand our product mix and explore oolongs and white tea along with green tea.” “The industry should start looking beyond its low pricing advantage and build the brand image. The deeply growing trade wedge between the US and China means that the former is looking to replace some Chinese tea imports with more Indian tea imports,” adds Mukewar. China’s contribution to US tea imports has fallen from 22% in 2016 to 11% in 2020. The US is compensating for this supply shortage by importing more tea from Japan, whose contribution jumped from 9% in 2016 to 17% in 2020. When the demand for green tea rose, India along with Sri Lanka failed to realize this opportunity. India, at present, does not have enough manufacturing plants that can cater to green tea’s growing demand, says the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/green-tea-push-can-lift-indias-exports-report/articleshow/82417613.cms||Sovon Manna

Initially they have mild to moderate pneumonia but within a few days it worsens. This variant is extremely infective and virulent, so the infection progresses quickly,” a senior doctor said. “To add to this there was a lockdown and people were terrified of Covid-19 and more careful,” he said. Another doctor, treating Covid patients, said that things have got out of hand due to delayed test results. “Due to this delay in receiving reports, people are neither isolating nor beginning treatment. They give their samples for testing and return into the society, mingle at work and at home, and wait to get their reports. By the time they receive the results, the disease has already been transmitted to numerous others and the person’s own condition worsens,” the doctor said. Laboratories have suddenly been overloaded. “The rise was gradual during the last wave, but this time it was sudden and nobody was prepared for it,” he said. The health system is unable to cope with the steep rise in Covid-19 cases. “Everyday new beds are being added, but these are insufficient. It’s not the beds that are required, but manpower and oxygen. Without these two, beds are useless. There is a big mismatch between oxygen demand and supply. The peak is yet to come and this is worrying,” a health official said. A health services doctor said tight restrictions by the government are necessary for the next three weeks for the positivity rate to fall or at least plateau. “This will buy us time for everything. Without this, it will take additional three weeks for cases to plateau,” he said. Doctors have advised people with symptoms not to wait and watch, but get tested, isolate and begin treatment immediately. “Most cases are mild and need to be diagnosed early. Covid-19 is both preventable and treatable”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/strain-virulent-as-mild-pneumonia-worsens-in-couple-of-days-docs/articleshow/82417652.cms||Lisa Monteiro

All its 150 beds are equipped with oxygen supply, and more beds in the facility will be added if need be, chief minister Pramod Sawant said. “The facility has been equipped with an oxygen tank of 20,000 litres,” he said. “Initially, 150 oxygen beds covering two floors of the block will be utilized for Covid treatment, and the same shall be scaled up as per requirement. Already, a trial of the oxygen supply, etc, has been carried out for two days under the supervision of the dean,” Sawant said. Sawant said that the facilities and systems being put in place for Covid management in Goa will see the death rate dropping within the next ten days. “Doctors alone cannot reduce the deaths”,” he said. “Patients have to report to hospitals as soon as possible and those with comorbidities should immediately get themselves admitted. Everyday, there are at least ten deaths where the patient dies within 24 hours. Every day, two-three persons are brought dead. The manner in which we are putting systems in place from the PHC level to the apex hospital level, it is my estimate that the death rate will reduce considerably in the next ten days. We have started tracking up to the very last patient.” He said that commissioning of the superspecialty block will automatically reduce the oxygen cylinder requirement at GMC. “The oxygen supply in the new block will be met from the central tank of 20,000 liters capacity, so automatically the requirement of cylinders will come down. The other good news is that we are getting 30 oxygen concentrators for GMC. Another 150-200 oxygen concentrators are being provided to us by Vedanta and Fomento companies by privately sourcing them. More will be given by Siemens, which will also be setting up an oxygen generation plant,” said Sawant. He said that oxygen concentrators, when installed near the bed, can directly generate oxygen through the air and supplies it to the patient.  “Once it is fitted, there is no need for separate oxygen supply to be provided. Within two days, the issue of getting oxygen cylinders will be resolved, and our oxygen generation issues will be resolved,” said Sawant. Health minister Vishwajit Rane said that the CM has directed exploring the possibility of setting up of smaller oxygen generation plants at GMC. “CM has told us to consider setting up smaller oxygen generation plants, which can be installed in 20sq ft area. This will do away with need for at least 120 cylinders,” Rane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/150-bed-superspecialty-block-starts-for-covid-treatment/articleshow/82417671.cms||---

While the organisers claimed to have permissions from the Entertainment Society of Goa, Sardesai warned of forcibly stopping the shooting as it posed a threat to the lives of the people in the neighbourhood. “If Fatorda has become a hotspot it’s because of these shootings in Ravindra Bhavan,” he told reporters. GFP vice president Durgadas Kamat had on Tuesday, referring to the permission given by ESG to some film shooting at a private place in North Goa and had demanded for the chief minister resignation. “Cases are increasing day by day, there is shortage of oxygen, ventilators, oxygen beds, and your government is still issuing permission for shoots in the state? Do you have any shame left in you? Resign!” Kamat had said. Sardesai on Wednesday said that the government has turned the current situation into a “lockdown industry.” “Last year, coal and iron ore was being transported amidst lockdown. This time, permisssions are given to outsiders for shootings while asking Goans to stay indoors,” Sardesai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sardesai-stops-shooting-at-fatorda-ravindra-bhavan/articleshow/82417694.cms||---

When the government has rightly stopped asking its employees for their biometric thumb impression when they enter the office for work and at the end of the day, why is it asking for it at fair price shops before beneficiaries collect their monthly quota of ration, this despite knowing how dangerous it can be, Khola sarpanch Purna Nayak said. Apart from the danger, Nayak told TOI that the system is also often a waste of time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stop-using-biometrics-at-fair-price-shops/articleshow/82417781.cms||---

The DHS had informed SDH Chicalim that an agency from Margao will supply them 70 empty cylinders. “Presently we have 30 cylinders, 15 small and 15 big. The additional 70 will make that 100. This will suffice our requirements. At present we want at least 15 cylinders filled. We have already contacted the agency in Margao and are hoping to get them sooner,” health officer of SDH Chicalim, Dr Anil Umraskar said.

---||Goa||Goa: More citizens step forward to donate to hospitals||PANAJI: As Goa grapples with the second wave of the pandemic, more citizens and organisations have stepped forward to donate oxygen generators, plasma, refill oxygen and even raise funds for patients. Among these are Rotary clubs and citizen-led groups. The Rotary Club Margao Midtown is giving 100 flow meters to the South District Hospital to help get oxygenation to 100 beds. “We will also be donating 30 oxygen generators next week as supplies reach Goa. The funds for these projects have been generated through our CSR partners. The total project cost is Rs 25 lakhs,” the club’s president, Nita Noronha e Costa said. Their counterpart in this side of town, the Rotary Club of Panaji Riviera, said it has delivered equipment worth more than Rs 1.3 crore to the state, which include Covid testing machines and ventilators. “Yet, we have delivered 50 beds this week, 25 have been delivered to the Goa Medical College, and 25 more Fowler beds are on the way from Kolhapur. We can either be mute spectators, or be part of it,” a member said. Friends of Father Bismarque, which claims to be “a brotherhood of a few kind Goan souls”, has resolved to provide free oxygen to patients in Goa. They are offering free refilling of empty oxygen cylinders when brought to the Scoop Oxygen Plant, and are also conditionally providing free filled oxygen cylinders on empty cylinder return basis, depending upon availability. “Our capacity to serve totally depends upon prevailing circumstances and constraints faced by the manufacturer, who is sincerely cooperating with our mission. Still, while praying for something good to happen, we are trying our level best in the name of Father Bismarque,” said Sudeep Dalvi, one of the volunteers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/more-citizens-step-forward-to-donate-to-hosps/articleshow/82417815.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Lack of coordination led to MVA’s failure to defend Maratha reservation: Fadnavis||Nagpur: Launching a scathing attack on the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s failure to defend Maratha reservations in Supreme Court, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday said lack of coordination between departments and lawyers pleading the case, and non-serious approach, had led to the debacle.Speaking to media in the city, he accused chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his government of “deliberately not making efforts to defend the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018, granting 12% reservation in education and 13% in jobs to the Maratha community”.“In last 50 years, this government (Congress-NCP) has failed to grant reservation to the community. Now, when we enacted the law and successfully defended it in the Bombay high court as well as in the SC, they didn’t want it to continue just so the BJP couldn’t take credit.”Taking a dig at Thackeray, Fadnavis said he should make efforts to understand the SEBC Act with the advocate general’s help. “I think the CM wasn’t properly briefed by subordinates on the issue. He was kept uninformed about the developments. If we had been in government, we would have ensured total coordination with lawyers.”Denying charges levelled by PWD minister Ashok Chavan and minority development minister Nawab Malik, who accused him of misleading the legislature, the former CM said both were lying. Fadnavis said his government didn’t enact the law after the 102nd Constitution amendment, but made an amendment to the law. “They should do study it first, as we had successfully defended our amendment in HC and managed to avoid stay in the top court in front of the former chief justice of India’s (CJI) bench. This government failed to defend it properly, leading to SC striking down the Act.”Terming the verdict as “painful and disappointing”, the Southwest Nagpur MLA said MVA government also failed to defend the OBC reservation in local polls introduced by the BJP government and it too was stayed by the SC. “Their officials only sought adjournments in this case too. Their leaders only speak about granting social justice in speeches, but fail to implement it in reality. It’s high time the MVA government gets its act together and provides justice to Marathas by properly implementing various schemes started by our government like Rajashree Shahu, scholarships and sending their children abroad at government expense.”SMSN hails SC verdictNagpur: Save Merit and Save Nation (SMSN) has hailed the SC verdict, saying justice was finally done. SMSN through state president Anil Laddhad had challenged the Bombay high court verdict with the help of senior counsels Arvind Datar, Gopal Shankarnarayan, Shyam Dewan, Rajiv Dhavan, Siddharth Bhatnagar and others. Former administrative judge at HC’s Nagpur bench Ravi Deshpande assisted by Hrishikesh Chitaley and Ashwin Deshpande also pleaded the case.SMSN had moved the top court by filing three petitions, contending that the Maratha reservation was being provided for political gains. “We had always demanded that 50% reservation shouldn’t be breached. We had created awareness in urban and rural areas and received overwhelming response. It’s a tribute to thousands of our activists who were fighting against this injustice meted out by the government. The Act of 2018 violates the principles of equality and exceeding the ceiling limit of 50% clearly violates Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution,” a press note issued by SMSN said.Explaining the verdict, lawyer Ashwin Deshpande said the SC ruled that its 1992 verdict in Indira Sawhney case need not be referred to a larger bench and the 50% ceiling on reservations in that case was a good law. “The five-judge bench said there were no extraordinary circumstances to grant reservation to Maratha community over and above the 50%. They said the Sawhney judgment was repeatedly followed by this SC and has been approved by at least four Constitution benches,” he told TOI.Deshpande informed that the SC disbelieved Gaikwad commission’s report, stating that neither it nor the HC verdict had made out any extraordinary situation to grant the reservation to Marathas in jobs and education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lack-of-coordination-led-to-mvas-failure-to-defend-maratha-reservation-fadnavis/articleshow/82417830.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

According to volunteers of Wildlife Rescue Trust (WRT), the reptile may have ventured out a lake and got into the drain that passes through several residential colonies. With ponds and lakes drying up in summers, crocodiles often venture out of their abode and migrate to other water bodies. Volunteers took about 30 mins to track and rescue it. They later handed it over to the forest department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/five-feet-long-crocodile-rescued-from-drain/articleshow/82415229.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka BJP MP Tejasvi Surya's graft charge gets communal, hits Covid work||BENGALURU: The bed-for-bribe scam, highlighted by ruling BJP's lawmakers on Tuesday and amplified by social media posts, severely disrupted Bengaluru's Covid management system on Wednesday. Several volunteers and contract workers in BBMP zonal war rooms stayed away amid social media insinuations that "terrorists" were at work. While police detained seven people, including two contract doctors from BBMP, and nine others for questioning, workers, especially from the minority communities, did not report to duty for fear of being branded "terrorists". BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta confirmed that the civic body's war rooms ran short of staff at a time when the system too crashed due to overload and overwhelming calls and enquiries. Bengaluru has been consistently clocking over 20,000 cases over the past few days and has the highest active cases in the country at over 3 lakh. The developments also impacted volunteers on the ground as well as crematoriums. "We have deployed three volunteers each at 55 hospitals and more than 40 people did not turn up. When we called them, they said they didn't want to take a risk till there is clarity that no terrorists are involved," said Girish Mattennavar, director, BBMP Citizen Help Group for Covid Operations. Videos of Bengaluru South MP and BJP Yuva Morcha national president Tejasvi Surya reading out names of 17 Muslim contract employees when he visited the South Zone war room on Tuesday and alleging that touts and BBMP officials were involved in blocking beds went viral. He's heard asking senior officials on what basis those contractual employees had been appointed. The war room has 210 employees but he chose to highlight 17 Muslim ones. Surya's uncle and BJP MLA Ravi Subramanya, who accompanied him along with fellow MLAs Satish Reddy and Udaya Garudachar, is heard shouting at BBMP officials: "Have you appointed these people to a madrassa or corporation?" When contacted by TOI, Surya, however, insisted he never intended to give a communal colour to the scam. "Why would I be so stupid to turn this humongous fraud into a communal issue? Covid is a secular virus that it won't infect people based on religion. I'm not from that tribe of politicians who milk tragedies," he said, adding: "In fact, one of the arrested, Rohit, is not a Muslim." On people staying away from work, Surya said: "Don't worry. We have enough volunteers and we'll send them if BBMP wants." Abdul Razak, a volunteer with social organisation Mercy Angels, said 150 of 250 people involved in cremation and burial of Covid victims are Muslims and they're all upset. "Nobody stayed away from work on Wednesday; I don't know about Thursday as many of us are demoralised," he said. Surya's allegations have triggered charges and counter-charges between ruling BJP and opposition Congress. Former chief minister and leader of opposition Siddaramaiah tweeted; "Why do you tend to bring in the communal angle in all possible issues from food to human lives, Tejasvi Surya? The communal virus staying in your brain is more dangerous than the coronavirus. Take treatment for that."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bjp-mps-graft-charge-gets-communal-hits-covid-work/articleshow/82422559.cms||B V Shivashankar
---||Nagpur||Slum dwellers face starvation in curbs, Covid otherwise||Nagpur: The possibility of losing livelihood due to Covid-induced lockdown has left Vivek Sahu, a daily wage worker from Vandevi slums, deeply worried. The prospect of no work and no income is scary for him, as it will drive his five-member family to starvation. “No income is more serious than getting infected by coronavirus,” he says, shuddering at last year’s horrifying lockdown experience. “This time around we are not even receiving any help from non-government organisations or from the state or central government for ration,” says Sahu. Vandevi in north Nagpur is one of the biggest slums in the city. “Vandevi dwellers fear dying of starvation more than Covid,” says activist and founder director of Centre for Sustainable Development Leena Buddhe. Sahu and his neighbours say they are not worried about Covid-19 infection, as nobody has been infected in their locality so far. “We wear masks and wash our hands regularly. We also do salt-water gargles as much as we can, to stay protected from the deadly disease,” they say. Residents of over 400 slums are living under twin threat of no work due to pandemic induced restrictions and of contracting the virus, said some of the slum dwellers on Wednesday. At Dipty Signal and Vanadevi slums, people have no steady jobs. They lead a hand-to-mouth existence and with nobody distributing food, like last year, all of them are close to starving, most say. Only 10% of the population at Dipty Signal slums have work, but that too isn’t assured when they step out every day. The remaining have no work. At Siddeshwari slum, the dwellers are sure they will die of starvation. “None of us has any work. Whatever meagre supplies we have collected are depleting fast and we will starve to death if we don’t get ration and other help,” says Ramesh Jaibhai. No help has come from the government so far. Though the government announced free ration, nobody knows when it will arrive. Situation is turning from bad to worse, Buddhe points out. Some slums like Indora are severely impacted by Covid-19 with patients in every lane. “The houses are small and congested, so isolation or physical distancing is a far cry,” says Buddhe. Unlike last year, there are no facilities of Covid care centres this time. Now, Indora residents have decided to convert Shravasti Buddha Vihar into a 30-bed quarantine centre. “Slum dwellers here stay in small rooms, and a quarantine centre will help contain the spread of the coronavirus,” says Buddhe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/slum-dwellers-face-starvation-in-curbs-covid-otherwise/articleshow/82417845.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

As many as 41,953 cases and 58 fatalities were reported in the state on Wednesday. The test positivity rate has also reached 25.69%. Terming the situation as grave, the chief minister called for a heightened vigil. "The situation warrants more severe restrictions. However, there is no need to panic as we are in a position to manage the situation," he said. Vijayan said the ward-level Covid committees and rapid response teams would be strengthened by incorporating medical students. All officials who had participated in the assembly election process will also be included in these committees. Steps will be taken to convert lodges and hostels as Covid first-line treatment centres while political parties, NGOs, overseas Malayalee associations and private agencies will be allowed to function as relief agencies, he said. Earlier, the Union health ministry said19 states and Union Territories -- including Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, West Bengal and Rajasthan -- had a weekly positivity rate higher than the national average of 21.46%. It said nearly 71% of Covid cases registered in India in a day were also reported from these states. In his letter to the Prime Minister, Vijayan said the overall projected requirement of liquid oxygen in the state was rising and the buffer storage within the state needed to be augmented urgently in view of the depletion of storage due to heavy daily demand. In order to augment the storage, the state requires at least 1,000 tonnes of imported liquid medical oxygen (LMO), he said. The chief minister has requested that the ministry of external affairs may be advised to allot the required quantity partly from the current tranche of imports and balance from future imports. He also requested that the ministry be advised to allot 500 metric tonnes of LMO from the nearest steel plant to the state. On vaccination, Vijayan said the Centre should take into account the number of persons awaiting the second dose of vaccines and those who have registered for the first dose while determining the further allotment to states. He requested that 50 lakh doses of Covishield and 25 lakh doses of Covaxin be allotted to the state. The chief minister has also requested allotment of oxygen tankers, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants, oxygen concentrators and ventilators to the state on a priority basis considering that it has one of the highest active caseloads among the states.

Most were back at work by June 2020, but even by the end of 2020, about 15 million workers remained out of work. The number of individuals who lie below the national minimum wage threshold (Rs 375 per day as recommended by the Anoop Satpathy committee) increased by 230 million during the pandemic. Had the pandemic not occurred, poverty would have declined by 5 percentage points in rural areas and 1.5 percentage points in urban areas between 2019 and 2020, and 50 million would have been lifted above this line., according to the report. Incomes also remained depressed, says the report, which analysed the impact of the pandemic in 2020. For an average household of four members, the monthly per capita income in October 2020 (Rs 4,979) was still below its level in January 2020 (Rs 5,989). The authors’ calculations are based on the Consumer Pyramids Household Survey of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIECPHS). Incomes are based on January 2020 prices and adjusted for seasonality. About 61% of working men remained employed and 7% lost employment and did not return to work in the immediate aftermath of the lockdown. For women, only 19% remained employed and 47% suffered a permanent job loss during the lockdown. The impact was more on younger people with 33% of workers in the 15-24 years age group not finding a job by December. “Households coped by cutting back on food intake, selling assets, and borrowing informally from friends, relatives, and moneylenders. An alarming 90% of respondents reported that households had suffered a reduction in food intake as a result of the lockdown. Even more worryingly, 20% reported that food intake had not improved even six months after the lockdown,” the report said. Times ViewIn the past one year, the outbreak has pushed a huge section of the marginalized to the brink. The second wave has further hurt their efforts to keep their heads above water. Incomes have crashed again. The economic impact of a third wave could be catastrophic. The government must ensure that the effect of income levels plummeting are mitigated for these sections.The research concludes that as a result of employment and income losses, the labour share of GDP fell by over 5 percentage points from 32.5% in the second quarter of 2019-20 to 27% in the second quarter of 2020-21. Of the decline in aggregate income, 90% was due to reduction in earnings, while 10% was due to loss of employment. The report by the Azim Premji Unversity also draws from various field surveys. Most data pertain to the period between March 2020 and December 2020. Job losses were higher for states with a higher average Covid caseload. Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi contributed disproportionately to job losses. Mobility restrictions, such as those caused by lockdowns, predictably led to income losses due to decreased economic activity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/230m-pushed-below-minimum-wage-level-by-virus-study/articleshow/82422568.cms||---
---||Nagpur||NMC begins Covid tests of beggars, homeless to further contain spread||Nagpur: For the first time in 14-month-long pandemic, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has started Covid-19 tests of beggars and homeless people in the city. The move is to facilitate treatment to people who have contracted the disease, and further contain spread of the disease in the city. A team of NMC Dharampeth Zone led by zonal officer Dindayal Tembhekar collected swab samples of 47 beggars and homeless people at three locations — in front of Hanuman mandir at Ram Nagar, Chhota Neem Durgah, and Yeshwant stadium. “We started the drive from Yeshwant stadium at 7am as these people leave for different parts of the city from 9am onwards. Initially, these people resisted getting tested. Some fled away from the spots. We managed to bring back some people and convinced them. We had to felicitate one of them, who first agreed to give the sample and encouraged others,” Tembhekar said. NMC additional municipal commissioner Sanjay Nipane has directed all ten zones to conduct such drives. “Tests and cases are going down. It is the right time to check whether there is any spread among homeless or other such people, who come close to a large number of people in a day and had remained untested till now. It will help in further containing the transmission of the disease. We will admit and treat any of these homeless people who test positive,” Nipane said. These people come close to others at religious places, major squares and commercial areas, selling items or begging on daily basis. The drive will also help the civic body maintain high number of tests, which is important for drop in test positivity rate (TPR), considered one of the parameters for declaring end of peak, and also reduce case fatality rate (CFR). The district registered 4,399 positive cases of novel coronavirus on Wednesday, up from 4,182 cases a day ago. The steep decline in cases from April 30 has halted to some extent on Wednesday. There were 7,400 recoveries on Wednesday, which were more than new positive cases. Recoveries have been more than new cases for last six days. Active cases declined from 69,199 on Tuesday to 66,116 on Wednesday. Highest active cases had been 77,556 on April 25. With consistent downfall in active cases, number of vacant beds has increased to 881 vacant beds, of which 770 are with oxygen, and 111 in ICU in the city as per NMC data. On Wednesday, minority affairs minister Dr Nawab Malik approved development of Covid hospital for mild patients at Haj House. Guardian minister Nitin Raut and former minister Anees Ahmed had requested Malik to make this possible.

---||Nagpur||After a week, city gets vax doses for 45+, but to last for only 2 days||Nagpur: After being badly affected for a week, Covid-19 vaccination of 45+ age group will resume on Thursday, though it is likely to be hit again after two days. The city got only 20,000 doses of Covishield for this age group on Wednesday, and average coverage has been around 10,000 per day. None of the 141 Covid Vaccination Centres (CVC) of Covishield for 45+ age group could start on Wednesday due to lack of doses. One CVC was opened, but it was reportedly reserved for Indian Air Force (IAF) staff. The 45+ people in large numbers are waiting for first and second dose in the city for last one week. If there are over 10,000 vaccinations on Thursday, again inoculation will be affected from Friday if fresh stock does not arrive. The possibility of fresh stock coming is very less, said sources in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar have planned inoculation of 45+ at 96 centres on Thursday. Remaining 45 centres are in private hospitals, which are yet to procure doses directly from manufacturers and have been remained shut from May 1. The civic body continued vaccination of 45+ at three CVCs of Covaxin — two at GMCH and Mahal Diagnostic Centre — where 701 took the jab on Wednesday. Chandrapur district was most affected on Wednesday, as not a single person from 45+ could get the jab. All five districts of Amravati division were also hit. The central government is supplying doses for healthcare workers, frontline workers and 45+ people. On Wednesday, 11 districts of Vidarbha received 1,71,400 doses of Covishield for 45+ age group. Therefore, all affected districts will see resumption of inoculations on Thursday. The state government on Wednesday supplied 1,24,000 doses of Covaxin for 18-44 years age group for 11 districts of the region. Earlier, Covishield doses were supplied for this age group, and they had started to get the jab from May 1. All districts were running five centres each, which will increase to 10 each from Thursday. NMC also received 6,000 doses of Covaxin so it will open three more centres for 18-44 age group at Mahal Diagnostic Centre, Chapru Nagar hall, and Manewada UPHC. Three centres were operating since May 1 at Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya, Isolation Hospital and Pachpaoli Hospital. On Wednesday, 804 from this age group took the jab in the city. Guardian minister Nitin Raut has requested health minister Rajesh Tope to allow opening of one Drive-in Vaccination Centre each in six assembly constituencies in the city on the lines of Mumbai. He said senior citizens and persons with disabilities will benefit from this as they can take the jab sitting in their four-wheelers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-a-week-city-gets-vax-doses-for-45-but-to-last-for-only-2-days/articleshow/82418095.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Sans any work, he was idling around looking for a job when someone asked him if he would work at a crematorium. And since then, it has become Shirke’s full time occupation. An expert in painting interiors of houses, Shirke used to stay in the Akota area of the city but started spending more time near the crematorium in Akota after the lockdown. This was when he was asked if he would volunteer to work at a crematorium. Shirke said that a man from Khaswadi crematorium used to visit the Akota crematorium. “He asked if I would go to the Vasna crematorium and work there. I agreed and decided to go there. Initially I felt uncomfortable, but started liking it now,” said Shirke. Shirke’s family stayed in Mumbai and used to visit him from time to time. “They too have moved here in October last year ahead of my birthday on October 19 so that we could celebrate it together,” said Shirke. Now his family too helps him with crematorium work. As the couple spends most of their time at the crematorium, their children come there to meet and spend time together. “My mother is also staying with us. They go to her in the evening even as we stay back for work,”said Shirke. Shirke has not looked to resume painting work after the lockdown was lifted. “I am happy here. There is greenery, fresh air and chirping of birds. People give me some money to appreciate my work and also help me with grains, grocery as well as other things. I am happy and this is my home now,” he said. Shirke said that recently a man gifted him an insurance policy. “It was his birthday and he asked for my Aadhaar card. I asked why, but he insisted and later came back with the policy and a saree for my wife,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/jobless-painter-now-works-stays-at-crematorium/articleshow/82414239.cms||---
