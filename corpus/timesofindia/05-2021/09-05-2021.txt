The required material for last rites are not available due to the ongoing Corona curfew. Many are now left with no option but to skip a number of puja rituals during the last rites. Rajesh Dwivedi, who had lost his friend, had an horrowing time arranging the necessary items for the rituals. “Where do we find the items for rituals. Either shops are closed or are out of stock. Only those people can understand the pain of those who have lost their dear ones as how it is painful to cremate your family members without proper rituals,” said Rajesh. He added that the biggest challenge is that no one is allowed to perform any ritual as it is Covid-infected. “I must appreciate the crematoriums who are making their best efforts in arranging the cremation within the available resources,” said Dwivedi. Even the shopkeepers said that atleast such shops must be allowed to open. “I know the situation is not conducive as the pandemic is making life tough for everyone. However, it should be allowed for those who really wish to conduct the last rituals with all possible ways,” said Ankit, a shopkeeper in Kolar area. Shopkeepers also added that several people have been contacting them for providing them items required for last rituals. “At the end we have to say no to them as it is not possible to arrange all items. This is a time where everyone is scared. I do not know when this will end. This is really painful to see that people are not even able to perform last rites properly,” said Vishambhar Sharma, a shopkeeper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/shops-shut-kin-scramble-for-puja-items-for-last-rites/articleshow/82487365.cms||Ramendra Singh

The health minister said chief minister Captain Amrinder Singh-led Punjab government has constantly ensured supply, availability and distribution of injections in the government as well as private hospitals across the state. He said the CM has also urged the people not to panic for buying Remdesivir injection at higher prices as the health department has sufficient stock in its warehouses. Expressing concern over black marketing and hoarding of Covid-19 related drugs, Sidhu said he directed the food and drug administration (FDA) of Punjab to take stringent action against the wholesalers, distributors and retailers if anyone is found doing involved in illegal activities. The minister said that the Punjab government has made it mandatory to mention the name of patient and IPD number on the vial so that the FDA’s teams can easily verify empty vial before it is destroyed by the Covid-19 care centre. Sidhu said the Punjab government is committed to ensure supply of quality drugs in the state and to achieve this aim, 60 drug control officers have been deputed to keep an eye on the supply of medicines. He said he has instructed the FDA to monitor the prices and stocks of Covid-19 related drugs across the state and act promptly against sellers who violate the guidelines. The minister said instructions regarding supply as well sale of Remdesivir have been issued to all the authorities concerned. He said as per the intimation letter of the Centre, Punjab will receive 35,000 Remdesivir injections from May 9 to May 16.

The zoo officials said that as a preventive measure, diet of the animals has been altered. Special emphasis is being given to cleaning of the food given to wild animals. The meals are rinsed properly in hot water before the animals are fed. The wild animals' health monitoring is being done on a daily basis. If any animal has any problem, they are provided immediate treatment, the officials said. Assistant director Van Vihar Ashok Kumar Jain said that Van Vihar has been following strict Covid-19 protocols to avoid any infection from reaching the wild animals in enclosures. Vehicles enter the park only after their tyres are washed. The staff are screened at the entry gates. The staff have to change their clothes before entering the animal housing. Almost all the staff has been vaccinated. The enclosures of the animals are being cleaned twice a day. Housekeepers are instructed to wear their safety gear like mask, gum boots, apron and gloves. Entry for other staff is not allowed. Wildlife doctors visit the housing area only when there is an immediate need.

---||Kolkata||Doctor who fought for sex workers’ rights dies of Covid in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The man credited with organising the sex workers in Kolkata to bring them under the ambit of social security and his pioneering work in fighting HIV and AIDS, passed away on Saturday morning. He was 68. Smarajit Jana, the founder and chief advisor of Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC) which works for the uplifting of sex workers in the city, was admitted in a city hospital with Covid-19 infection. Several people from the development sector, including chief minister Mamata Banerjee, expressed anguish at Jana’s passing away. “Saddened at the passing away of Dr Smarajit Jana. He founded the unique co-operative of sex workers who went on to have bank accounts & identity cards which entitled them to social welfare benefits. Champion of marginalised and stigmatised women. Condolences to his family members,” tweeted the chief minister. Jana had as a researcher and teacher in the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health undertook an HIV sensitisation mission in the red-light area of Sonagachi in 1992 as a project of the government. Sex workers were recruited to be trained to sensitise their peers in the vocation. Members of DMSC who worked with Jana on the project said the use of contraceptives jumped from a mere 3 per cent to almost 90 per cent in seven years. “He not only guided us but encouraged us to unite ourselves to assert for our rights. Before that we did not have any union or co-operative and we did not receive any social benefits,” said Kajal Bose, secretary of DMSC, who worked with Jana for almost three decades. In 1995 Jana helped sex workers to convince the government to make changes in the procedure so that they could be brought under a co-operative. In 1999, the Union government replicated the Sonagachi model to combat HIV/AIDS where members of the community themselves carried out the sensitisation and implemented in other red-light areas of the country. Jana was also the HIV programme co-ordinator in Bangladesh between 1999 and 2002. He also worked as a member of the advisory board of the European Commissions’ programme on AIDS and STDs in India during the period from 1996 to 1998. “During lockdown last year he was helping the women in Sonagachi. So many girls in Sonagachi have been orphaned today,” said Bose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/doctor-who-fought-for-sex-workers-rights-dies-of-cov/articleshow/82487390.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Ranchi||Most private hospitals in Jharkhand asked to stop vaccine drive||RANCHI: At a time when the entire country is reporting a massive surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths, following which health experts are urging everyone to get inoculated as soon as possible, the state government has reportedly asked almost all private hospitals to stop the vaccination drive. While key government officials did not take calls for a comment over the development, sources said the move was taken up considering the depleting stock of the vaccines in the state and the high rate of “wastage” in private hospitals. According to a Union government report on Tuesday, Jharkhand has a vaccine wastage of 3.12% among the major states — Punjab, Delhi, UP, Bihar, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Haryana — which reported the highest wastage. According to Jogesh Gambhir, who owns the city-based Raj Hospital and is the president of the Association of Healthcare Providers in India, almost all private hospitals were asked to stop the inoculation drive earlier this week. “For the last two weeks, all private facilities were plagued with the scarcity of vaccines owing to a lack of supply from the state health department. On May 5, we were suddenly asked not to conduct any more vaccination. I am not sure why we were asked to do that,” Gambhir said, adding that the government has withdrawn all the vaccine stocks from them.  “I don’t know what the government is planning but it is high time that we pace up vaccination by increasing the number of session sites as much as possible. In any case, the state government’s stock of vaccines is going to be over by the month-end. I don’t know why the government authorities are trying to save the doses by asking the private hospitals to go slow or stop the drive. They should exhaust the entire stock as soon as possible,” Gambhir said. A staff member at the Samford hospital here, on condition of anonymity, said they are receiving 80-100 calls from beneficiaries on a daily basis, enquiring about taking the jab but the hospital had to turn those requests down. When contacted, National Health Mission’s state director Ravishankar Shukla did not wish to comment citing a busy schedule. L R Pathak, who is overseeing the vaccination drive in the state, and A Dodde, an IAS officer on deputation for handling the vaccination task force, also didn’t take TOI’s calls for a comment on the development. Needless to say, the discontinuation has left several beneficiaries, especially those awaiting their second dose, hassled. For example, 60-year-old Sumati Sinha, a housewife from Morabadi, tried all the private hospitals in the city for the past four days to get her second dose of Covishield but it was all in vain. “I have already crossed the eight week period between the first jab and the second and I urgently need the vaccine now.” In March, the Centre had extended the gap between Covishield doses to 6-8 weeks from the earlier rule of 4-6 weeks. Even though, experts and recent studies have claimed that longer gaps aren’t risky, many like Sumati are worried amid the ongoing second wave. Although the district administrations and the state-run health centres are conducting the inoculation drive, many are opting for private hospitals out of fear of mismanagement and overcrowding at the government-run facilities. “I don’t want to go to any government centre as my uncle recently tested positive for Covid after taking his second jab at such a centre. Moreover, we have been getting news of overcrowding at government centres, long waiting hours, etc., to get a jab. I’d rather go to a private facility and I don’t mind paying more for that,” a middle-aged banker said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/most-private-hosps-in-jharkhand-asked-to-stop-vax-drive/articleshow/82487394.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Hyderabad||Madhu’s wife tried to meet CM as police looked for him||Hyderabad: Peddapalli zilla parishad (ZP) chairman and TRS leader Putta Madhu went missing from the constituency on the day Eatala Rajender was dismissed as health minister from the state cabinet. There was no trace of Madhu till Saturday when Ramagundam cops said they picked him up in Bhimavaram in AP. Madhu’s nephew Bittu Seenu, who was arrested, is the mastermind behind the murder of advocate couple Gattu Vaman Rao and PV Nagamani and police will now probe Madhu about his role in the double murder case. Who is this Madhu? A close aide of Eatala, Madhu had joined the TRS in 2014 and was elected as an MLA in the general elections in the same year. Before joining the TRS, he was with Chiranjeevi’s Praja Rajyam Party and contested in 2009 assembly elections on PRP ticket. He also worked as a ZPTC member from Manthani. “He rose from a mandal praja parishad president to MLA to ZP chief in the past 15 years thanks to his connections and association with Eatala,” a party observer said. TRS party sources said that Madhu must have been taken into custody by police for questioning in the advocate couple murder case and other criminal cases pending against him. Ironically, though he was missing for the past one week, his wife Shailaja, who is the chairperson of Manthani municipality, did not file a missing complaint with police. But, police were already tracking his whereabouts after reports emerged that he had gone off to Chandrapur in Maharashtra. Shailaja tried to meet chief minister and TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao but in vain. She met minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy and is believed to have told the party leadership that Madhu is a follower of Eatala who was a district minister but denied that they have any personal contacts. On May 5, close aides of Madhu held a press conference in Manthani and said the party high command is supreme and that Madhu is committed to obeying the party decision. Interestingly, the state government transferred Huzurabad assistant commissioner of police and revenue divisional officer in the past two days. “A senior officer in the police department believed to be close to Madhu is also in the line of fire,” sources said. Eatala represents Huzurabad in the state assembly. Soon after removing Eatala from the cabinet, the TRS leadership has shifted its focus on his close associates. The former minister’s follower Sadhava Reddy, who is husband of Veenavanka (Karimnagar) ZPTC member Vanamala, was slapped with a notice from the local cooperative bank in a fund misappropriation case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/madhus-wife-tried-to-meet-cm-as-police-looked-for-him/articleshow/82487414.cms||Koride Mahesh

Despite being an off day for the court, a division bench of chief justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and justice Sujit Narayan Prasad was hearing a petition filed by the state government asking the court to pass an order for immediate release of oxygen cylinders seized by the police earlier. Advocate general Rajeev Ranjan pleaded before the court that the cylinders illegally obtained for black marketeering have been seized by the police across the state and are lying unutilized in strong rooms. The court was informed that 250 cylinders had been seized across different police stations. The bench applauded the efforts of the state government in trying to figure out ways and means to ease the pressure on shortage of supply of oxygen cylinders. The cylinders can be used for needy patients in this time of crisis, the judges observed during the online hearing. The court also appreciated government's move and commented that it appears that the state government is making preparations for future situations. The high court has been monitoring the steps taken by the government in dealing with the pandemic since it hit the state in March last year. With the second wave of the virus having hit the state hard, the court has been regularly holding hearings to know about the actions taken by the government to deal with the crisis. On Thursday, the HC had warned the officers entrusted with the responsibility of checking black marketing of medicines during the pandemic from protecting any influential person involved in such illegal activities. Noting that investigation in this regard is not being conducted in the direction, the bench observed, "We are not satised with the way by which the investigating agency is investigating the matter… It appears to us prima facie that already the process is on to save certain persons… We are taking very serious note of the situation. There should not be any effort to save inuential persons otherwise we will be compelled to take action against the erring persons."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/release-seized-cylinders-to-save-cov-patients-hc/articleshow/82487441.cms||---

All of them had received both doses of the coronavirus vaccine. Kolkata Port Trust has now started hiring more health staff to treat the Covid patients admitted in the KoPT Centenary Hospital near Majerhat bridge. At present, 87 patients are under treatment in the 120-bedded hospital. “All the doctors who have tested Covid positive are doing well. One of them had to be administered oxygen, but he too is recovering fast,” said KoPT spokesperson Sanjoy Kumar Mukherjee. The doctors TOI spoke to said there might be reason to doubt the vaccine’s efficacy only if a recipient develops severe Covid-19 complications after being vaccinated. Shambo Samrat Samajdar, pharmacologist, School of Tropical Medicines, Kolkata, said, “There are cases of people testing positive for Covid-19 despite taking the vaccine, but the intensity of the infection would be less.” He said the jab was very effective in preventing hospitalization as well as deaths. Since the infected doctors are in isolation, the KoPT Hospital has hired 10 general duty medical officers or doctors and 10 nurses to treat the patients. There is another section at Remount Road, a 63-bedded safe house where those patients whose conditions have improved, are treated. “At present, 12 more patients are recovering at the safe house,” said Mukherjee. He quoted KoPT doctors as saying that there is no need to panic over vaccinated people contracting Covid-19 and doubt the efficacy of the vaccine because of it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kopt-hosp-docs-with-2-jabs-test-ve/articleshow/82487478.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Hyderabad||Why this tearing hurry into temple land issue: HC to T||Hyderabad: The Telangana high court on Saturday directed the state government and the four-member IAS committee not to venture into private properties if owners of land plots raise an objection over such inspections. The court also asked the government to follow the due process of law, notify the owners, receive their objections and provide them an opportunity of being heard before proceeding against them. Hearing an urgent petition filed by land owner Sada Satyanarayana Reddy and four others, Justice T Vinod Kumar expressed doubts over the hurried probe launched into the alleged encroachment of Seetha Rama Swamy temple land at Devarayamjal in Medchal Malkajgiri district. The petitioners, who raised objections over the unauthorised entry of officials into their plots without issuing any notice to them, were apprehensive of forcible dispossession and sought protection from the court. “You (government) read a news report on May 2 and you constituted a four-member IAS committee on May 3. This committee starts its inspections immediately thereafter. Why this tearing hurry particularly at this stage of the pandemic where people are struggling even to find slots at the burial grounds,” the judge said recalling his own experience on Friday night when the family of his deceased neighbour could finally get a slot and entry into a crematorium at 9 pm following the intervention of a deputy commissioner of GHMC. “There seems to be more than what meets the eye behind the formation of the committee which will deviate three district collectors along with another IAS officer from their fight against Covid-19,” the judge said addressing advocate general BS Prasad. “The temple land has been a subject matter of litigation from 1996 onwards and this is not something that happened overnight,” the judge observed, while taking up the house motion moved by advocate K Pratik Reddy on behalf of the landowners. The AG said the intention of the government was only to protect the temple land. He also informed the court about a conflict between two rival parties over the temple land that led to the registration of an FIR in August 2020. The high court issued status quo orders in respect of some plots in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/why-this-tearing-hurry-into-temple-land-issue-hc-to-t/articleshow/82487482.cms||---

The JUT has formed an Industry-Institute Collaboration Cell, which will promote industry-academia collaboration in three industrial hubs of the state namely Ranchi, Kolhan and Bokaro regions. JUT will lead the activities in Ranchi, BA College of Engineering and Technology and Institute of Project and Engineering, Jamshedpur, would collaborate with JUT to promote the activities in Kolhan while BIT Sindri will carry out the activities in Bokaro region. Vice chancellor (VC) of JUT professor P K Mishra said, “The industry-academia collaboration will help the university train its students according to the requirement of the industries, particularly the local enterprises. It will increase employability of JUT students. Similarly, industries not having training facilities could send their personnel to JUT institutes for upgradation of skills and knowledge.” Citing an example, he said that the Kolhan hub will train students of JUT institutes in a manner that they cater to the needs of industries located in Adityapur industrial area. He added that the JUT human resources could also help resolve technical problems arising in small industries which do not have their own research and development wings to tackle such situations. JUT management is of the view that involvement of the academia can help create value not only for the industries in organized sector but also it can play a role of savior for the dwindling local industry and handcrafts. Notably, as many as 72 colleges rendering degrees and diplomas in fields of engineering and technology, management and pharmacy are affiliated to JUT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jut-industries-to-promote-training-of-state-students/articleshow/82487483.cms||---

Pilots who are also required to take the test have expressed similar concern. A Delhi High Court order has said the tests will now be random instead of everybody being subject to it and that ATCOs and airline crew have to give an undertaking that they have not consumed alcohol within the stipulated hour prior to reporting for duty. However, ATCOs say they are still wary. “Till the pandemic outbreak, we never had any problem taking BAT. It would have been good to suspend the tests for now. But with the court allowing random tests, we have to comply. But there is an uneasiness over it in the team,” a senior ATC official pointed out. With over 10% of the workforce down, the Guild has again written to Airports Authority of India (AAI), requesting it to suspend BAT. With one in every two persons in Kolkata testing positive for Covid, there is widespread fear of getting infected. In the rest of the state, the positivity rate is hovering around 30% for over a fortnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/breath-analyser-a-worry-for-atcos/articleshow/82487539.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Bhopal||Transfer of Damoh collector, SP after BJP’s defeat shocking: Nath||Bhopal: PCC chief Kamal Nath on Saturday questioned the Madhya Pradesh government’s decision to remove the district collector and SP of Damoh, five days after the BJP’s defeat in the bypoll there. In a statement, the former chief minister said that he found the transfer of administrative officers after the ruling party candidate’s defeat “sudden and shocking”. “The decision by the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government raises one question – did BJP give the district collector and SP the responsibility to win the bypoll there?” Nath asked. On Friday, while state BJP served a showcause notice to former finance minister Jayant Malaiya for ‘anti-party activities’, the government also removed Damoh collector Tarun Rathi and SP Hemant Chouhan. “Will the government punish the Damoh district collector and SP for fulfilling their duties and maintaining the dignity of their uniform by conducting a free and fair election?” Nath asked. “It is clear that BJP wanted to misuse the administrative machinery to win the Damoh bypoll. After its unsuccessful attempt, the saffron party is trying to terrorise administrative officials by transferring the collector and SP,” Nath said. Incidentally, Malaiya’s son Siddharth has been suspended from the primary membership of BJP. Nath said that BJP’s other victims are Jayant and Siddharth Malaiya. The senior Congress leader argued that for two months, the ruling party’s entire government, including 22 ministers, many MLAs, MPs and its money power were utilised in the Damoh bypoll. “Even after that, if the Malaiya family could give the Congress candidate a victory by 17,000 votes, then looking at his political acumen and influence, BJP should immediately make him the chief minister”, Nath said. “This defeat of BJP is the failure of that leader who was in Damoh for two months and yet could not secure victory. This defeat is because of the unethical politics of CM Chouhan, which has been defamed for purchasing power. This is the defeat of those who consider themselves above democracy and the Constitution,” Nath added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/transfer-of-damoh-collector-sp-after-bjps-defeat-shocking-nath/articleshow/82487543.cms||---

For the first time since April 8, new cases registered were lower — marginally though — than the figures of the previous day. On Saturday, 975 persons tested positive for Covid-19 in Vadodara as compared to Friday’s 989. Health officials, however, said that one could say that the city and district was on the downward slope of the second wave if this trend of dip in cases is sustained for a few more days. The officials also informed that the hospitalisation figures are under control in the city and district. According to the details released by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), 10,156 tests were conducted in the 24 hours ending on Saturday evening. The 975 new cases include 467 in areas of the district outside VMC limits. Total 51,479 Covid cases have been recorded in Vadodara so far. VMC also confirmed 11 deaths due to Covid-19 on Saturday, taking Vadodara’s total death toll to 458. These numbers do not include those who tested positive for Covid-19, but are said to have died due to comorbidities or other ailments. As many as 832 persons were discharged on Friday taking the total number of recovered patients to 41,476. Vadodara now has 9,545 active cases, including 361 persons on ventilators or BIPAP machines as well as 576 on oxygen support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-sees-marginal-dip-in-cases-for-first-time-in-a-month/articleshow/82487552.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Stop fooling students, review reservation policy nationally’||Earlier this week, a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court unanimously declared Maratha reservation in Maharashtra as ‘unconstitutional.’ The decision came as a saving grace for the Save Merit Save Nation (SMSN) movement, a nationwide forum initiated from the city in 2019 which stood for this cause doggedly. In an interview to TOI, SMSN president Dr Anil Laddhad, an ophthalmologist, says reservation politics should end and that the time has come to review the reservation policy nationally. Excerpts...  Q. Is the Supreme Court’s verdict a victory for the SMSN forum?  A. It is a victory of the law and the truth. It’s a victory of the Constitution. We have been pleading since a long time that such kind of reservation is unconstitutional. It was all a political gimmick. Political parties make fake promises and fool people for votes. Our lawyers presented a long list of such pre-election decisions in many states. There is no social angle in such types of reservations. It’s pure politics which was defeated. Merit and the Constitution have emerged victorious. Q. The same reservation was carried forward by the high court.  A. It’s a part of the legal battle. Victory or defeat in the high court cannot be considered as final because we have the Supreme Court to appeal to. As far as this case is concerned, the same team of lawyers, with an added force of more lawyers, pleaded for the state in the Supreme Court. As per their demand, the court constituted a five-judge bench. Responses from other states having similar reservations were also sought. All their demands were accepted. Still, the court rejected the SEBC quota, the Gaikwad commission and this additional reservation. Students of all communities, including Marathas, suffered. They must understand that they were made political scapegoats. Politicians should apologise to the students for the manner in which they suffered. Q. You mean the government should apologise for the reservation law? A. Shouldn’t it (the government) apologize for the inconvenience caused to students? I’m a doctor and not a legal expert. Right from day one, I knew that extending reservation above 50% is unconstitutional. Finally, our stand was vindicated. All legal experts and politicians know that such reservations cannot stand in court. Still they keep on fooling young students. This should stop now. Q. Politicians have termed the court’s decision as ‘unfortunate’. A. It’s unacceptable. During swearing in as a public representative, politicians pledge to protect the Constitution. Now, the same politicians are calling the Supreme Court’s decision as unfortunate. Making wrong laws for political gains and spoiling social harmony is not acceptable. Due to this practice, unrest spreads in the state and the public at large has to suffer. Q. The state has requested the Centre to bring the law. A. I consider it as a disrespect to the Supreme Court. Why should the Centre act against the Supreme Court order? A sensible government that has respect for the court will never do it. We (SMSN) want everyone to abide by the law. The directions given by Supreme Court are the laws. Nobody is above the Constitution of India. If the government twists this decision then we will oppose it. Q. The state government has promised some benefits in other forms to the Maratha community. A. We are not against extending social and financial benefits to the needy people of any community. There are genuinely needy people in all communities. But every benefit should be within the purview of the law. SMSN is not against reservation. We are on for 50% reservation which has been allowed by the Constitution. Even the Maratha community can get reservation under this limit. Q There are many states where reservation is above 50%. In what way will SMSN deal with this issue? A. The court had sought a reply from such states and finally set it aside as all those reservations were extended before the 102nd constitutional amendment. These reservations are still subjudice and hence, I won’t comment. Legally, we will continue to fight against any direct reservation above 50%. Q. What is SMSN’s next step as the main objective has already been achieved? A. We are going to be watchful. We will oppose any decision by any government to unconstitutionally crop the Supreme Court order. We will demand a review of the seven-decade-old reservation system. Q. Why does the reservation system need a review? A. The existing caste based reservation policy has failed. Out of the castes that have benefited, not a single caste has been declared developed so far. All are still backward. Therefore, the plan which has failed to meet the intended objective must be reviewed. Necessary amendments should also be made based on its conclusion. If a person does not declare progress even after availing reservation in education, specialization, job, promotion repeatedly for generations, then what is the benefit of such a reservation policy? Q. Are you hinting at reservation only for the economically weak sections? A. We think that it has become mandatory to include economic base in the Constitutional caste reservation so that the benefit of reservation becomes truly available only to needy persons eligible for reservation. Also, once those who have become prosperous by availing the benefits of reservation should be excluded from the purview of the reservation. Only then will social justice and socialism be truly practicable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stop-fooling-students-review-reservation-policy-nationally/articleshow/82487536.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Uluberia hospital probes deaths of two patients||HOWRAH: Relatives of two patients, who died at Uluberia Superspeciality Hospital in Howrah, ransacked the premises following allegations that lack of oxygen led to their deaths on Saturday. The hospital authorities have initiated a probe into the deaths and also allegations of oxygen scarcity. The two patients — Sheikh Nasir (32) and Kulshan Bibi (58) — were admitted at the general ward with severe respiratory distress, high blood pressure and high sugar count on Friday. There are separate wards for Covid patients at the hospital but since the two were yet to undergo Covid tests, they were kept at the general ward. While doctors said Kulshan Bibi had co-morbidities, they had advised the family of Nasir to shift him to a nursing home after her condition worsened. The family however refused to do so. Both Nasir and Kulshan died early on Saturday. Following the deaths, the families alleged the hospital did not provide them with oxygen support. The hospital doesn’t have piped oxygen facility but is run on oxygen cylinders provided to individual patients. “The hospital is a lifeline to the population in the area and it is facing an oxygen crisis. Many patients are alleging inadequate oxygen.” said Sabir Ali, a relative of Kushan Bibi. Nasir’s family also alleged that some hospital staff had even asked them for a bribe for additional oxygen. Hospital officials denied the allegations. Enraged by the deaths, relatives of the two patients ransacked the hospital reception area, shattering glasses and breaking furniture. A district health department team initiated an inquiry into the incident. “Both patients were admitted to the general ward. Although they were admitted with respiratory distress, tests are yet to confirm that they were Covid-19 patients. I am not sure what led to shortage of oxygen,” said Sudip Ranjan Kanrar, superintendent of the Uluberia Superspeciality Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/uluberia-hosp-probes-deaths-of-two-patients/articleshow/82487574.cms||---
---||Surat||In Surat’s corona battle, community isolation centres turned lifesavers||SURAT: Contribution of the community isolation centres (CIC) in the war against coronavirus will remain etched in gold in pandemic history. Even though it took off late in this year’s killer second wave, CICs fought the pandemic, as valiantly as it had even in the previous year,while helping government and private facilities stall the spread of the virus. These centres were literally, life saviours for the virus-battered Diamond City. According to data compiled by Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC), total 26 big CICs handled over 2,400 Covid patients in the past one month, of which 1,665 were discharged after recovery. Looking at the surge in cases, number of beds started to increase in these centres gradually while various communities and welfare groups came forward to set up their own CICs. At present, CICs in the city have 1,500 beds, of which 556 are with oxygen support. Total 266 oxygen support beds are occupied currently. According to senior government officials, CIC is a unique model of Surat that helped strengthen the health infrastructure and improve its efficiency for patients in serious conditions. Apart from the big ones, nearly 500 more Covid patients were provided isolation facilities by smaller isolation centres having 20 or lesser number of beds. “In the second wave CIC model is making wonders for testing and treatment. The CICs of Surat are a unique model,” said Banchhanidhi Pani, city municipal commissioner. The Covid CICs in the city were not only isolating positive patients but are also conducting testing and providing support in vaccination as well. Majority of the centres have come up in either government buildings or halls of any particular community. These centres not only have beds but support of oxygen, doctors, nursing and care taking staff as well. These centres provide food for the patient and their relatives as well. “The new variant is highly infectious and CICs help in isolating the patient. Isolation in the lap of community and care by community health care workers and community made delicacies makes these centres more attractive than individual isolation,” Pani added. Further these centre as are geographically close to the residence of the patient and this adds to the comfort of patient and family. Compared to individual isolation this does not add to anxiety and stress, experts believe. “At CIC we are providing better care compared to hospitals. The patient feels at home, can interact with family members and other patients. Some of the best city doctors are providing volunteer service at our centre,” said Velji Sheta, president of Samast Patidar Samaj. SPS is running a 52-bed CIC at Katargam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/in-surats-corona-battle-community-isolation-centres-turned-lifesavers/articleshow/82487579.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Health officials went into a tizzy after the word spread that nearly 100 villagers were being treated under home isolation as the infection had rapidly spread in the village. Officials, however, refuted the claims. “We have cross-checked the details with our medical officers who are present at the village. We have received confirmation of 5-7 deaths in the last three days. None of the deceased were infected with Covid-19 and all of them were above 60 years of age,” said Dr Vimal Singh, taluka health officer of Padra.He said that the deaths were scattered and not from any particular locality in the village that counts for nearly 12,000 population. He however confirmed that the positivity rate in the village has remained high since a couple of days. Out of 25-odd villagers that get tested on daily basis, five to six were testing positive of Covid-19 infection. “There are 38 individuals who are under home isolation. Since the positivity rate was high, our medical officers and ‘dhanvantri’ rath are already doing the rounds,” said Singh, refuting claims that enough tests were not being conducted in the village. Both the rapid tests and house-to-house survey are going on, he said. The word regarding the high mortality rate had spread after a programme where ayurvedic and homeopathy medicines were distributed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/reports-of-15-covid-deaths-in-24-hrs-sends-health-officials-into-tizzy/articleshow/82487580.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Liquidation of Meena Jewellers ordered||Hyderabad: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) at Hyderabad has ordered liquidation of Meena Jewellers Diamond Pvt Ltd (MJDPL), Meena Jewellers Pvt Ltd (MJPL) and Meena Jewellers Exclusive Pvt Ltd (MJEPL) for their failure to repay Rs 254 crore loan availed from SBI. Though the two-member NCLT bench, comprising BP Mohan, member (judicial), and A Veera Brahma Rao, member (technical), ordered the corporate insolvency process to be initiated in November 2019, the management of these firms has been dodging the insolvency process. The bench finally passed the liquidation order on April 26, 2021. According to resolution professional KV Srinivas, who verified the accounts of the firms, the previous management of these firms was not forthcoming with actual accounting figures. For instance, he said, Meena Jewellers and Diamonds conducted Rs 810 core worth transactions between 2016 and 2020, but only Rs 70 crore was deposited in the banks and hence transactions related to these transactions alone were visible on records. The RP also said the directors of the company had not been extending their cooperation and dishonoring promises made regarding handing over the company’s assets and books of accounts to the resolution professional. MJEPL too conducted transactions worth Rs 884 crore, but the bank records reflect only Rs 70 crore. Operating on similar lines, MJPL too did the same thing by concealing Rs 906 crore worth of transactions. The firm’s bank account reveals that only Rs 110 crore was deposited in the bank, the RP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/liquidation-of-meena-jewellers-ordered/articleshow/82487583.cms||---

---||Surat||50% admissions at govt hospitals from rural areas||Surat: Almost 50% of the new admissions in city’s government Covid-19 hospitals are patients coming from outside the city. These patients are reaching hospital in critical condition with requirement of higher oxygen support. The rush of patients from outside city limits and from different districts of Gujarat indicates that the coronavirus infection has spread to the rural areas. In absence of oxygen-supported hospital beds in the rural areas these patients are admitted to the city hospitals. At the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) run Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER) around 50 new patients are admitted daily, of which nearly 25 are those coming from out of the city limit areas. Due to the rise in hospital admissions from rural areas the Covid-19 bed occupancy has gone up. “There is a significant drop in cases from within the city but among new daily admissions almost 50% are from rural areas of Surat district and other parts of state. Patients are coming from districts of south Gujarat, Saurashtra and central Gujarat too,” said a senior official at SMIMER. “The only cause of concern is the critical condition of patients. Those coming from other districts need higher oxygen support,” the SMIMER official informed. Similarly, at New Civil Hospital (NCH) daily 70 patients are admitted of which nearly 35 are from rural areas. “NCH being a government hospital a large number of patients come here for treatment on normal days as well. But currently there is rise in number of patients being admitted due to spread of the infection in rural areas,” said an official at NCH. “There is a significant drop in the overall cases, so the demand for oxygen has also dropped. Meanwhile, other districts too are getting sufficient oxygen,” the official added. Currently 335 patients are under treatment at SMIMER while NCH has 427 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/50-admissions-at-govt-hospitals-from-rural-areas/articleshow/82487590.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

They further threatened that nearly 700 faculty members of all the eight GMERS medical colleges of Gujarat will go on strike from May 11 if their demands are not met by then. In a representation to Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani, GMERS Faculty Association said that against the sanctioned strength of 1,800 faculty, the eight medical colleges are being run by only 700 staff members. “The current strength is enough to run only three medical colleges in the state but eight colleges are being run on this strength,” said association president Dr Hiren Prajapati. “Whenever the need to get permission for any medical college arises, staff members are transferred from one college to another. There are not enough teachers to teach students,” he said. Stressing that the association is demanding just basic rights like promotion of faculty, government’s contribution to PF, non-practicing allowance and transport allowance like other government employees, the association said that the faculty has not even received arrears even as four years have passed to implementation of seventh pay commission. “It is unfortunate that during pandemic, we have to resort to protest. But it is equally unfortunate that we have to bear expenses of medical treatment of our relatives even if our families get infected as we are on duty,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/gmers-docs-observe-black-day-threaten-stir-from-may-11/articleshow/82487593.cms||---

With an increase of 29 paise per litre on Saturday, the petrol price touched 94.86 per litre in the state. Until May 3, the price was steady at 93.99 and from the next day oil companies started revising them. Diesel, which was Rs 88.25 on May 4 is now Rs 89.11 on Saturday.  Consumers are anguished as steep hike is burning a hole in their pockets. “They started increasing the fuel prices again. I think it will touch 100 in a couple of weeks. The petrol I used to commute for a week between Gachibowli and my residence in Neredmet is lasting only three days now,” said Soma Sekhar Reddy, a private employee.  Autorickshaw drivers are concerned with the ever increasing prices. “We are getting only two to five trips per day and are sitting idle most of the time. As the fuel prices are rising we are forced to charge more. That’s why people are preferring city buses and other public transport,” said Gopal, an auto driver.  Defending the rise in prices, a dealer said. “A day after the counting was over, fuel prices increased in the international market. On May 2, crude per barrel was Rs 4,500 but on May 6 it increased to Rs 4,800. That is why state-owned oil companies were forced to increase the prices,” said G Dheeraj, who runs a BPCL outlet in Erragadda. He added that due to the second wave conditions, the sales have dropped by about 50%.  Several outlets across the city are witnessing a deserted look. “Before the second wave we used to have 1,000 to 1,500 consumers. But now only 400 are coming,” said the owner of an outlet in Begumpet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/consumers-upset-as-fuel-prices-rise-for-fifth-consecutive-day/articleshow/82487596.cms||---

The cops also learnt that a 6 litre cylinder was being sold for Rs 15,000 while a 10 litre cylinder was being sold for Rs 25,000. Crime branch officials raided the godown and found the 39 cylinders. During interrogation, the three revealed that they had got the cylinders from Zaid Alam Junani, the owner of Gujarat Fire System situated in Bharuch. They said one Aslam Junani had stored the cylinders in the godown in Sarkhej. The three told the cops that from April 25, they had supplied 200 medical oxygen cylinders to relatives of Covid patients who were in home quarantine or hospitals. The crime branch has registered a case under several IPC sections including 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of a common intention). Provisions of the Essential Commodities Act and the Disaster Management Act have also been invoked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/three-held-for-black-marketing-of-oxygen/articleshow/82487615.cms||---

CM should ask the senior IAS officers to study the Mumbai model which is being hailed even by the Supreme Court, instead of deploying them to survey the Devarayamjal lands. He said the CM should appoint a doctor or a public health policy expert or a health care professional as the new health minister as part of the constitutional responsibility. “Greater Hyderabad, which accounts for about one third of the total Telangana population is currently being devastated by Covid-19. It requires an efficient model to contain the spread of Covid-19,” he sought to suggest the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-should-adopt-mumbai-model-dasoju/articleshow/82487605.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Fair price shop dealers said they have not received any directions from the government to give an additional 5 kg free rice. Presently, they are continuing to give the regular quota of 6 kg of rice per person. The rice is priced at Rs 1 per kg and is given to all the members whose names are on the ration card at 6 kg per person. CM K Chandrasekhar Rao is likely to take a decision soon on extending free rice to the poor, officials said. The FPS dealers are also demanding that they should be recognised as frontline warriors as they have been risking their lives by continuing to distribute rice to the card holders during the pandemic. The central government announced 5 kg free rice for the benefit of the poor keeping in view the curfew, lockdowns and market situation due to the second wave of the pandemic. The Telangana government too had supplied 12 kg free rice per person and Rs 1,500 financial assistance towards purchase of essential commodities to 87.59 lakh white ration card holders during the first wave of coronavirus in the summer of 2020. The government spent Rs 2,417 crore per month to ensure supplies for the white ration card holders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ration-card-holders-yet-to-get-free-5kg-rice-from-centre/articleshow/82487617.cms||Roushan Ali
---||India||Fix vaccination drive, ensure poor & villagers not left out: Lancet||NEW DELHI: India needs to overcome its shortcomings in combatting Covid quickly by adopting a two-pronged strategy to control the outbreak, that include setting right the vaccination campaign and measures to ensure poorer and rural citizens are not left out, medical journal The Lancet has said. Pointing out the weaknesses in the government’s response, The Lancet said in an editoral that, “First, the botched vaccination campaign must be rationalised and implemented with all due speed.” There are two bottlenecks that need to be overcome: the vaccine supply needs to be raised, with some imports, and a distribution campaign that can cover not just urban but also rural and poorer citizens needs to be set up to ensure a more equitable distribution. The editorial recommended measures to reduce transmission of the virus as much as possible, while the vaccine is being rolled out. “As cases continue to mount, the government must publish accurate data in a timely manner, and forthrightly explain to the public what is happening and what is needed to bend the epidemic curve, including possibility of a new federal lockdown,” it said. The journal said the Indian government gave the impression that India had beaten Covid-19 despite repeated warnings of the dangers of a second wave and emergence of new strains, in comments that are sharply critical of the Centre on the recent surge of Covid-19 cases and deaths in the country. “The impression from the government was that India had beaten Covid-19 after several months of low case counts, despite repeated warnings of the dangers of a second wave and the emergence of new strains,” the editorial said, while also criticising health minister Harsh Vardhan for announcing in early March that the country is in the end game of Covid. “At times, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has seemed more intent on removing criticism on Twitter than trying to control the pandemic,” the editorial said. “Modi’s actions in attempting to stifle criticism and open discussion during the crisis are inexcusable,” it added. The editorial also quoted estimates by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), a global health research institution, that said India could potentially see one million deaths due to the Covid-19 pandemic by August 1. “The message that Covid-19 was essentially over also slowed the start of India’s Covid-19 vaccination campaign, which has vaccinated less than 2% of the population,” it said. The journal also criticised the government’s decision to allow religious and political congregations despite warnings and said these events are “conspicuous for their lack of Covid-19 mitigation measures”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fix-vaccination-drive-ensure-poor-villagers-not-left-out-lancet/articleshow/82487599.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Monoclonal antibodies’ cocktail drug can be game changer in Covid treatment: Experts||Nagpur: Experts here are expecting the antibody cocktail drug for Covid-19 developed by pharmaceutical giants Roche and Regeneron to work effectively in home-isolated mild to moderate patients who are at high risk of developing severe illness. The therapy was granted emergency use authorization in India a couple of days ago. Named ‘REGN-COV2’, the drug is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies, Casirivimab and Imdevimab. It is projected to reduce hospitalization by 70%. The drug was tried by former US president Trump after he developed Covid-19 last year. The therapy is also being looked at something that would help those whose vaccine barrier the virus has breached. It is also expected to be effective on children above 12 years (having body weight more than 40 kg) during the projected third wave when the younger poulation is likely to be at greater risk of contracting the infection. Reaserchers is the western world are strongly pushing for yet another combination of monoclonal antibodies, Eli Lilly’s Bamlanivimab and Etesivimab, which have a strong data outcome on Covid patients. In March, it received US FDA approval as a potential therapy against variants of SARS-COV2. A triple combination drug — repurposed Interferon Beta-1b with Lopinavir-Ritonavir and Ribavirin — is also projected to help in reducing the viral load and symptoms. The study has found a place in the ‘The Lancet’. According to senior physician Dr Rajesh Atal, Roche-Renegeron’s REGN-COV2 needs to be given at ‘entry level’ or at an early stage to ensure the spike protein of the SARS-COV2 virus doesn’t attaches itself to the cells of the host body. “The drug is to be given on priority to high risk patients like obese people, elderly with comorbidities, diabetic, those ailing having renal issues and so on,” he said. “The drug is expected to work effectively on patients with pre-exposure or early exposure to the disease,” said Dr Atal and added, “If one monoclonal antibody fails to act on the mutant virus, the other is expected to shoot it down or reduce the risk.” Infection disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, said the cocktail therapy is a good solution for families where one or more members are already infected and others too are showing symptoms. “It’s a well formulated ‘rescue therapy’ which must be administered during the incubation period before the virus gets the better of one,” said Dr Shinde. He further said that it should be used prophylactically and prove good for those whose vaccine shield is breached. He hoped the cocktail drug would be effective on children above 12 years of age. Roche Pharma India’s managing director V Simpson Emmanuel has said the outpatient treatment of Covid patients with the therapy would ‘complement’ the vaccination drive in the country. Well-known senior physician Dr Nikhil Balankhe said studies have shown that the cocktail drug, if introduced at an early stage, is an excellent combination drug to check severe manifestation of the disease. Dr Satish Deopujari, a well-known paediatrician, feels the monoclonal antibodies would prove to be the game changer in treatment of Covid-9 in the coming days. “The hybrid antibody (combination of Bamlanivimab-Etesevimab and Casirivimab-Imdevimab) has 85% efficacy as compared to other anti-viral drugs in demand now,” he said. Dr Deopujari warned that with major pharmaceutical players set to import the drug, there could be similar chaos as seen in the case of Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Itolizumab and Bevacizumab. He said the government and ICMR needs to start planning now to ensure only the needy patients gets the therapy. “This drug will have high demand in the time to come. Blackmarketing and all kinds of malpractices can’t be ruled out. The government needs to start working on a strategy immediately. What happened with Remdesivir shouldn’t become the case with monoclonal antibody therapy too,” he said. He said the US is following a scoring pattern. “If you fit the criteria only then you would be given the injection. Similarly, we will have to define a high-risk group. There seems to be no planning yet on how it will be rolled out,” said Dr Deopujari. What is monoclonal antibody therapy A mouse is given antigen injection having tumor cells The tumor cells get mixed with the plasma cells already in the body to form hybridoma, a hybrid cell The hybridoma has only one task, that is to produce antibodies These antibodies produced in huge quantity are called monoclonal This antibody immediately kills the novel coronavirus How it became popular Former US president Donald Trump was one of the early patients on whom this experimental therapy was used When it must be given Ideally, in the first three days or maximum up to first 10 days from onset of Covid symptoms Major it is administered during OPD treatment in early stage No other drug has so far same efficacy, provided it is given in the first 3 or 10 days Limitations Recommended only for the high risk group like elderly patients and those with comorbidites Cost could be Rs1 lakh or 2lakh per dose as doctors/govt will have to triage patients In India, indiscriminate use can’t be ruled out Benefits Prevents hospitalization of mild to moderate patients Three months passive protection to patient Could be given before travel or attending an event with big gathering The cost may go down depending on the agreement with the company At 85%, it has highest efficacy rate as on date and prevents mortality||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/monoclonal-antibodies-cocktail-drug-can-be-game-changer-in-covid-treatment-experts/articleshow/82487621.cms||Soumitra Bose

DCP (Crime) Chaitanya Mandlik said, “Being stockists, they should have sent the drugs to hospitals. Instead, they sold the medicine directly to customers. The police also found 32 prescription from their possession. During the check and raid, the team found discrepancies in the inward and outward registers.” Senior officials said that inspector H M Vyas, who is part of the anti-organised crime squad, had got specific information that black-marketing of remdesivir injections was being carried out from the godown of Anand Medicine situated near Gujarat Ginning Mill, Prem Darwaza. The cops raided the godown and seized some 34 remdesivir injections. The cops arrested Chirag Shah, a 44-year-old resident of Sola, Sandeep Mehta, a 49-year-old resident of Usmanpura, and one Jayesh Bhavsar, a 32-year-old resident of Nikol. Officials said that a case has been registered under the Essential Commodities Act and under the Disaster Management Act. The Crime branch officials said that instead of sending the stock to hospitals, these three would show it as having being delivered to hospitals and then sell it in the open market to retail customers at a price higher than the one printed on the cover. Also, stockists are not permitted to carry out retail sales.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/remdesivir-sales-in-open-market-three-stockists-held/articleshow/82487628.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Covid-19: Cases down, recovery up even as testing remains high in Vidarbha||NAGPUR: Despite conducting more than 62,000 tests in the last 24 hours, Vidarbha region reported only 11,150 new cases — the second-lowest in May so far. On the other hand, 16,276 patients recovered in a day, the highest in May. The daily death toll increased and it was 241. Overall, 8.12 lakh patients out of 9.59 lakh have recovered and the recovery rate is once again at 84.6%. All these positive developments happened on Saturday due to an impressive decline in number of new cases in Nagpur district. The second capital of Maharashtra reported 3,827 new cases, lowest over the last few days and 7,799 recoveries. However, other districts in Vidarbha, especially rural and tribal areas, continued to report high number of cases. Amravati (1,241) and Chandrapur (1,160) reported more than 1,000 cases again. Buldhana (957), Yavatmal (841) and Wardha (821) continued to report a surge. Bhandara (548), Akola (523), Washim (491), Gadchiroli (431), and Gondia (310) reported fewer than usual cases, but most of these districts have curtailed the number of daily tests below average. Deaths also are coming from rural parts of Vidarbha and not from cities and towns. Out of day’s 241 deaths; 51 were registered in Nagpur city, 16 from Nagpur rural and 14 were the patients recovered from the other states/divisions. Wardha reported 27 deaths, Gadchiroli and Akola 22 each and Chandrapur 21. Yavatmal reported 20 deaths. Most of these deaths were reported from villages and not from the cities. Cases are declining, but deaths are not reducing in that comparison. Due to this, the case fatality rate of Vidarbha surged to 1.74% on Saturday. As the number of patients recovering from the last 8 days is more than the number of new cases, now Vidarbha has 1,30,699 patients under treatment. This number was more than 1.60 lakh in the beginning of May. In a nutshell, cases are declining and more beds are free for Covid-19 patients in cities, but conditions are still alarming in rural areas of Vidarbha. Bhandara: 548 out of total 1,841 samples tested in last 24 hours in Bhandara tested positive. Recoveries continued to be at higher end at 1259. The district used to conduct more than 8,000 cases per day earlier. This number is under-2000 since last three-four days. Cases have declined due to this. Bhandara reported 12 deaths taking death toll to 963. Total 6,824 patients are under treatment. Gondia: The district conducted total 1,238 tests out of which 310 tested positive. Positivity rate is more than 25% which is alarming. Seven deaths were reported in Gondia on Saturday taking total death toll to 587. Totally 4,072 patients are under treatment. Gadchiroli: 22 deaths were reported in Gadchiroli on Saturday taking total death toll of the district to 528. Totally 431 new cases and 545 recoveries were reported. Now, Gadchiroli has 4,258 patients under treatment. Washim: 491 new cases, 524 recoveries and 1 death was reported in Washim. This took total case load to 31,605 and recoveries to 26,795. Total 4,477 patients are under treatment. Akola: Out of 3,758 tests conducted in last 24 hours, 523 tested positive in Akola. On the other hand, 550 patients recovered.

The GMERS Gotri Hospital and SSG Hospital are expected to be the first beneficiaries.A oxygen plant having a capacity of 50 cubic metres per hour has been donated to the Gotri hospital by the Paradise Foundation. The order was placed on Friday to mark the birth anniversary of Shri Vallabhacharya Mahaprabhuji of the Vaishnav sect. The plant can serve 100 beds and will come up at a cost of around Rs 70 lakh. Sources said that the Vadodara Gas Ltd — the joint venture city gas company formed by GAIL Gas Ltd and Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) — has also mobilised funds and is looking to donate an oxygen plant with a capacity of 25 cubic metres per hour to any government hospital.Sources said that other associations as well as corporates were also looking to donate oxygen plants. One such association has already decided to do so and is in the process of ordering the plant while an industry major having operations in the city too is likely to donate one.Several private hospitals in the city have also started looking for such plants. They are also desperate to get one to avoid getting into desperate situations in which they find themselves in wake of the delay in oxygen supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/series-of-oxygen-plants-to-be-donated-to-vadodara-hospitals/articleshow/82487636.cms||---
---||Surat||‘Chalo Saurashtra’ campaign by NGO||Surat: Surat-based Seva group has started a new movement of ‘Chalo Saurashtra’ — an initiative to help Covid patients get treatment at their doorstep and forced to travel to Surat and other cities seeking help. As many as 2,000 volunteers of the group from Surat have left for the region and will be camping in villages for a week, setting up isolation centres and facilitating the already existing centres. “We had seen so many people paying Rs 45,000 to Rs 50,000 for ambulance and oxygen cylinders travelling to Surat with great difficulty. Therefore, we thought of providing isolation centres at a distance of every 50 kilometres,” Mahesh Savani of PP Savani Group, a member unit of Seva Group, told TOI. Savani further said that most of the villages in Saurashtra are left with elderly people as the younger generation lives in the city. “When they are affected by the virus, they do not know what treatment should be taken, how to avail medicines among other things,” said Savani, adding that every village there witnessed 30 deaths on an average in the second wave. Earlier this week, the group had helped start a 100-bed isolation facility at temple town Palitana. “We have started from Vallabhipur, and will cover Botad, Bhavnagar, Amreli, Junagadh and Gir Somnath districts. We will start centres on our own or help other organizations start one. We will help them get everything that they need in places where such centre exists,” Savani said. These volunteers hail from different villages of Saurashtra and are settled in Surat. Around 2000 of them reached their villages in the past two days and will spread awareness among people about the treatment and clear doubts and misconceptions about vaccination or its side effects . Around 40 senior doctors from Surat will also be visiting different districts to update the doctors and medical staff about the treatment to be given.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/chalo-saurashtra-campaign-by-ngo/articleshow/82487642.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Remdesivir-Baricitinib combo can work’||Nagpur: The theory of using oral Janus Kinase or JAK inhibitor Baricitinib in combination with anti-viral Remdesivir on Covid patients has many supporters among the top medical practitioners who are treating Covid-19 due to early recovery shown in many cases. Though steroids are popular as being a safe and sure bet, the post-Covid complications, especially due to high blood sugar related ones, like Mucormycosis, are now compelling experts to rethink over the treatment strategies. Many experts feel Baricitinib is a viable substitute of steroids but the theory is yet to gain grounds, barring in a few cases. As per studies and experts, Baricitinib, a potent drug for arthritis, was repurposed for use in treating Covid-19. It is known to reduce IL-6 that leads to cytokine storm. Bariticinib was also found to reduce the oxygen requirement and lessen the viral load. Dr Nikhil Balankhe, senior physician attached to Viveka Multispecialty hospital, said Baricitimib is a proven anti-inflammatory drug like steroids. “Bariticimib may drastically change the recovery pattern,” he said and added, “The use of non-invasive ventilator and oxygen therapy may take up to 18 days but Remdesivir and Baricitinib combination may show recovery results within 10 days. Baricitinib works in the same way as steroids, perhaps even better.” Balankhe said steroids have a proven track record in trials done for one-and-half year but the proposed theory suggests Baricitinib could be a good choice too at times. “Trials on Baricitinib have shown almost nil side-effects while steroids have many including rise in blood sugar, one becoming immunosuppressant and so on,” he said. Dr Rajan Barokar, associated with Kingsway Hospital, said steroid should not be given in the first week if the oxygen is not low. “Steroids should be judiciously used and administered to control the cytokine storm. Baricitinib can replace steroids if the treating physicians feel it should be done under his supervision,” he said. “Remdesivir with Baricitinib can lead to better results when used properly during appropriate time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/remdesivir-baricitinib-combo-can-work/articleshow/82487643.cms||Soumitra Bose

However, he could not succeed in the burglary and police arrested him on Saturday. During the early hours of May 6, K Sitaram from Church Gagillapur in Dundigal, gained an entry into the Muthoot Finance office at Gandymysamma by making a hole in the front wall with the help of a crowbar and a sledge hammer. Sitaram had to leave the spot empty handed as he could not break into the strong room. Based on the complaint lodged by Muthoot Finance staff, Dundigul police and Balanagar SOT sleuths analysed the CCTV footage near the crime scene and identified Sitaram as the accused. Police arrested him on Saturday and seized the tools he used to commit the offence. “Due to pandemic, Sitaram was not getting enough work. His debts increased to Rs 4 lakh. In the past he took gold loan at Muthoot Finance and he was familiar with their office at Gandimysamma. Sitaram decided to commit a burglary to clear his debts and make some quick money,” Dundigal inspector P Ramana Reddy said.  Police produced the accused before the court for judicial remand and they are verifying if he had any criminal history.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centring-worker-attempts-burglary/articleshow/82487648.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Double mutant sub-lineage equated with British strain||HYDERABAD: Public Health England, the executive agency of the UK department of health, has equated the novel coronavirus sub-lineage, B.1.617.2 of Indian variant or double mutant B.1.617, with the UK strain B.1.1.7 in terms of transmission rate. This sub-lineage was earlier declared as a ‘variant of concern’. Apart from the UK, the sub-lineage B.1.617.2 is prevalent in Maharashtra and other parts of India. Its presence, however, is yet to be established in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, though the main variant, B.1.617, is present in the Telugu states. The UK variant B.1.1.7 is also found in the Telugu states to a lesser extent. According to the latest update of novel coronavirus variants by Public Health England, B.1.617.2 is assessed as at least as transmissible as B.1.1.7 with moderate confidence. This is biologically plausible based on the mutation profile. “It can compete with B.1.1.7 in the population and modelled growth estimates, suggesting transmissibility at least equal to B.1.1.7,” the UK health agency said. Referring to its neutralising potential against known Covid-19 vaccines, the report said as of now there is insufficient data to assess the potential for immune escape. “B.1.617.2 has spread rapidly in India based on available data. In some regions, S gene target data suggests that this variant may be more frequent than is indicated by the current sequence data, due to the lag in sequencing, and may have replaced B.1.1.7 to some extent. Modelled growth estimates suggest that the variant is at least as transmissible as B.1.1.7,” the report added. Some early laboratory data suggests limited antigenic change, the report said, adding that there is insufficient data as yet to assess reinfection or vaccine effectiveness through national surveillance. The report further said that the transmission of the sub-lineage appears to be greater than the wild type virus. It also has more severe clinical picture or higher infection fatality than from wild type novel coronavirus infections. There is evidence of frequent infection in humans with known prior infection with earlier virus variant. However, there is no evidence that B.1.617.2 emerged from a zoonotic source. Referring to the severity, it says there is insufficient information. “Most of cases are very recent and there has been insufficient follow-up time to allow an assessment of the severity. There is experimental evidence of functional evasion of natural immunity. The effect of the combination of mutations present in the variant is unknown. Reinfection data will be monitored through national surveillance,” it added. The variant B.1.617 was first detected in India. It carries as many as 15 mutations though the variant became popular as double mutant. It has three sub-lineages B.1.617.1, B1.617.2 and B.1.617.3. Of these, the Public Health England has designated B.1.617.2 as the ‘variant of concern’, escalated from its earlier ‘variant of interest’ designation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/double-mutant-sub-lineage-equated-with-british-strain/articleshow/82487651.cms||Syed Akbar

Ever since the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic hit the country, the group has stepped up its efforts to help the government in its battle against the pandemic. Adani Group has procured these 51 cryogenic tanks from the countries such as Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan and UAE. According to an Adani Group spokesperson, some of these cryogenic tanks were shipped in through the group’s Mundra Port in the state. Other tanks were also airlifted into the country with the help of the Indian Air Force, which deployed its biggest transport aircraft for these time-critical operations. The Adani Group has also arranged 5,000 medical grade oxygen cylinders from Saudi Arabia. It has started a Covid care centre in Ahmedabad by converting its Adani Vidya Mandir school campus in the city. Adani Group is further sourcing high-throughput oxygen generator plants and oxygen concentrators. Sixteen of these independent oxygen plants and 300 oxygen concentrators will be pressed into service in the next few days. The group is also refilling and distributing thousands of medical oxygen cylinders every day in several states and districts, the spokesperson stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/adani-group-procures-51-cryogenic-oxygen-tanks/articleshow/82487657.cms||---

In the last fortnight, two incidents have come to the fore where large number of fully-grown trees along national highways were ruthlessly pruned. While the first incident took place at NH-7 near Kamptee some days back, the second incident recently took place on NH-69 near Saoner. Photographic evidence shared by activists shows that trees of different species were brutally chopped off from the main stem. According to them, MSEDCL has powers to trim branches in case they pose a threat to overhead electric wires. “This right has been given to electricity distribution agencies across the country. However, instead of trimming required branches, MSEDCL completely cut the trees along national highways near Nagpur,” said green activist Shrikant Deshpande. He further alleged that in rural areas it is easier to harm green cover. “In Nagpur, we are alert and so are the citizens. The awareness about importance of saving trees is increasing. However along national highways, there is no scrutiny and the agency took advantage of that,” said Deshpande. Adding that the green cover in rural areas too is depleting, Deshpande added, “Trees along highways act as a barrier in controlling air pollution. They are also habitats of various species of birds.” TOI learnt that NHAI officials too were opposed to the action as the trees were planted and maintained by them. According to activists, NHAI should file a police complaint in the matter. NHAI officials confirmed that trees were being felled by MSEDCL and that they will take initiate necessary action. MSEDCL officials did not respond to calls. This is not the first time that trees under overhead wires were cut. “This has become a repeated phenomenon. We understand that branches pose a threat to cables and can lead to a breakdown and interrupted power supply. MSEDCL should sensitize its workers to not cut entire trees but only trim the required branches,” said Deshpande. Ahead of monsoon, MSEDCL is trimming and cutting trees under overhead wires as its routine activity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/msedcl-cuts-trees-under-power-lines-instead-of-trimming-branches/articleshow/82487659.cms||Manka Behl

She was kept beside the bed of her mother, who was serious and later succumbed to mucor-fibrosis a couple of days back. NU had entrusted its affiliated colleges and departments to hold the exams of PG, external, failure, and diploma students at their level. Even for some undergraduate courses where the number of examinees is below 100, exams would be conducted by the colleges. NU had directed them to schedule the paper from May 5 to 20. It was only after TOI and other newspapers took up the issue the university postponed its PG exams on Friday, but by just ten days. The girl, studying in one of the city’s autonomous colleges, tested positive on April 22 after her mother contracted the virus. Subsequently, all of them, including her father and brother too, tested positive. As the condition of her and mother deteriorated, both were admitted to a hospital. While she was kept on an oxygenated bed, her mother was put in ICU. Next day, her papers started and she was forced to appear from the hospital. She also emailed the college authorities about deferring her exam citing her disease as she wasn’t in a position to solve the paper on mobile. “After many of my classmates turned positive and witnessed a spate of deaths in their families, we, under the banner of ‘The Platform’ and ‘Human Rights Protection Forum (HRPF)’, had written to college authorities for postponing the exams at least by a month. But they said the NU administration was unwilling to extend dates,” the girl told TOI. The college authorities provided an option to them to appear along with the repeaters, but the students denied stating that it would affect their performance. “I somehow appeared in the exam despite being extremely weak and suffering from severe body pain, which is a normal sign of Covid. Probably due to tension and exertion, I was shifted to ICU from where I appeared for the last paper. I couldn’t perform well due to all these problems,” she said. The girl and her mother recovered by May first week and went back home, but the latter suffered from post-Covid complications and succumbed. “Even my brother studying engineering is also appearing in an online college practical exam while performing last rituals of our mother. In fact, many students from our college are suffering from similar plights. My friend’s father passed away recently due to Covid and she’s also positive, but colleges are unrelenting and forcing them to appear in exams,” the girl said. According to her other classmates, they had rushed a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, higher education minister Uday Samant and other authorities to reschedule their exams, but received no response. “We had also tweeted our demands to the authorities concerned, but our pleas fell on deaf ears,” they told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-ve-girl-appears-for-pg-exams-from-icu-bed/articleshow/82487672.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Though the dip in fresh cases was small, but it was an indicator that the situation was under the control of the health department. Another indicator of fall in cases is that the number of tests being conducted daily has nearly halved compared to that in April. Doctors and health experts believe that the decline was because of various reasons including people strictly following Covid norms fearing infection and subsequent health complications. Problems faced people over non-availability of beds and oxygen supply in hospitals too has made people more cautious. According to Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC), from April 10 to 30 the daily test conducted were between 11,000 and 13,000 (both antigen and RT-PCR). During the same period, people testing positive was between 500 to 700 per day. Since the first week of May, the number of tests have come down to about 7,000 per day and the number of new infections too has gone below 400 in RMC areas. RMC health officer Lalit Vaja said, “The number of cases have declined and so has the number of tests. Our team traces all those who have come in contact with a Covid positive patient and do antigen test on them. If the test is negative but the person has some Covid-like symptoms they are referred to our two facilities for RT-PCR tests.” There are five private laboratories conducting RT-PCR tests, besides and the PDU Hospital. Dr. Niraj Mehta, a Rajkot-based pulmonologist said, “The Covid-19 patients in OPD too have decreased by 30%. In April, a number of families got infected, so now there is less room for the virus to infect new persons. Also, the increase in awareness among people about the precautions to be taken is also a factor behind the fall in new cases.” President of Rajkot Medical Association Dr Praful Kamani, said, “There were numbers of deaths because of Covid-19 related complications in the last one month. This has lead to fear among people who have now become extra cautious. They have started wearing masks, have stopped going outside their home unnecessarily. Moreover, people immediately get themselves tested even if they have minor symptoms.” He added that night curfew and other daytime curbs too have added to fall in new cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/new-cases-in-rajkot-continue-to-decline-testing-down-nearly-50/articleshow/82487680.cms||---

Close to 800 beds have been identified in hotels by various hospitals to facilitate isolation facilities for patients reaching out to them. The move, hospitals authorities said, is intended to help them offload some of their burden and keep beds within their facilities available for critical patients. “We have per day packages that vary from Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000 in which accommodation as well three meals are included. One full floor of the hotel has been allocated for the isolation facility, which is only open for Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms,” said Rizwan Ahmed, sales manager, Siesta Hotels, Kondapur. In most hotels, direct check-ins are not allowed for patients seeking isolation. Hospitals will direct patients to the tied-up hotels following thorough probes. Meanwhile, the hospitality industry has sought priority on vaccinations for its staff from the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hosps-tie-up-with-hotels-for-mild-covid-cases/articleshow/82487731.cms||Preeti Biswas

The company also said it is working with the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) to set up 30-40 oxygen generation plants across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh shortly. The plants, each of which will have a capacity to generate 150-1,000 litres per minute of oxygen, will be set up by using the on-board oxygen generation technology that is deployed in fighter planes. The Hyderabad-based infrastructure player also said it is manufacturing a cryogenic oxygen liquefaction plant with a capacity to make 30 metric tonnes per day of cryogenic oxygen that will be installed and commissioned at ITC Bhadrachalam by May 15. The cryogenic oxygen will be converted into usable liquid oxygen for medical purposes at the MEIL facilities, it said. The company said that if the state governments of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh require, the company is also ready to import 10-15 cryogenic oxygen tanks from its own unit located in Spain to help the governments in the sourcing and movement of liquid oxygen. The company also said it has written to the Telangana government about its capability to manufacture 20-30 cryogenic oxygen tanks of 20 tonnes capacity each within just 20 days and has sought the government’s clearance for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/megha-engg-to-help-augment-o2-supplies-in-t-ap-by-35l/day/articleshow/82487759.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Covid surge in 0-19 age group, doctors for vaccinating kids at the earliest||NAGPUR: Experts are anticipating the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic to hit India around September this year, and children to be under greater threat during that period. The administration has started preparation for setting up special Covid-19 ward for children in major hospitals to tackle the third wave. But experts have once again stressed the need to vaccinate children. Data from Nagpur division shows that the 0-19 age group has already been in the grip of virus since last four months. It means despite strict lockdown-like restrictions, children are being infected and that too in a large numbers. In January, near 5.50% of total Covid-19 cases were detected in the 0-19 age group. In April, it increased to over 11%, which means the number as well as percentage of kids with Covid-19 has increased in Nagpur division. The increase is not limited to Nagpur city only. Even rural and tribal areas of the division are reporting similar surge. In January, Gadchiroli had 38 cases of Covid-19 in the 0-19 group. In April, cases increased to 939. From 30 cases in Gondia in January, the number swelled to 1,938 in April. Nagpur district had 903 cases in January and the number saw multi-fold increase to 20,810 in April. Similar is the situation in all other parts of Vidarbha. “As against 1,191 cases in January 2021, Nagpur division has reported 32,991 cases of Covid-19 in the 0-19 age group in April. In last four months, 45,520 cases were reported in this age group. More than 72% of them were reported in April alone,” said a senior official from divisional health office. The gender-wise break-up shows girls and boys in the 0-19 age group were almost equally affected. “The gap is more in the elderly age group. But in children, it’s almost equal to their birth ratio. This indicates that girls and boys are equally at risk,” said paediatrician Dr Arun Gulhane. So, is this already a beginning of the third wave? No, said doctors.“Children getting infected is not an issue to worry. In the first as well as in the second wave, children generally remained asymptomatic carriers without facing any serious consequences. But, as per the predictions by national and international experts, a few children may require hospitalization in the third wave. Till May first week, this percentage is negligible. So, it’s not the so-called ‘third wave’,” said epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte. “We have three-four months in hand to prepare for the third wave. We must expedite the process to bring vaccine for children,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde and added, “By September, vaccine will be available for all adults and a significant number will get protection. Children will be the worst hit in that case.” Sources said that Nagpur has already been shortlisted as a trial site for human trials of Covaxin (Bharat Biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine) for children between 5 and 16 years. But green signal is awaited from the health ministry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-surge-in-0-19-age-group-docs-for-vaccinating-kids-at-the-earliest/articleshow/82487775.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Advocate Navin S Parmar accused Dr J H Hariyani and Dr KP Delwadia, the health officials at the Civil Hospital in Deesa, of misleading the public by claiming sufficient availability of oxygen cylinders for critical Covid-19 patients. Parmar claimed that on the contrary, the hospital faces recurrent shortage of oxygen and oxygen concentrators which had resulted in many deaths of late.The false assurance of oxygen availability has misled many patients to risk their lives and get admitted to Deesa Civil Hospital, claimed Parmar. Once the patient is admitted, the hospital officials say that they don’t have enough oxygen. The relatives of the patients are then forced to buy the oxygen at an exorbitant price in the black market. This has become a rule rather than the exception, Parmar, an Ahmedabad-based advocate who has now shifted to Deesa, charged.The hospital officials refuted the charges. “The number of oxygen cylinders and concentrators can vary at a given time depending on the number patients. When there is an influx of patients there is bound to be a sudden shortage and where is the question of disinformation or misinformation from our side on this issue,” asked Dr Hariyani when TOI spoke to him on Saturday. But Parmar wants a thorough inquiry in the matter. “Is it not the duty of the hospital to make available enough oxygen for critical patients instead of forcing them to fetch it from outside?” Parmar asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/patients-misled-on-o2-availability-alleges-lawyer/articleshow/82487780.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Covid hotels not pleased with NMC’s rate cap decision||Nagpur: The association representing residential hotels in Nagpur is not happy with the civic authority’s rate cap decision for Covid hotels at Rs 4,000 per day. Many hotels in the city have turned into Covid Care Centre (CCC), where asymptomatic or mild condition patients are put up by the partner hospital. Nagpur Residential Hotels Association (NRHA) said that though Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) may have “good intentions”, the impact will be negative. NRHA president Tejinder Singh Renu said, “Regardless of genuine concern of the NMC for patients, this capping of rates will be detrimental for both hoteliers and patients. If a star category hospital is expected to provide room at the rate of Rs 4,000 along with all meals, Oxygen cylinder, doctor consultation, nursing charges and housekeeping services, then it’s not financially viable. This will result in operational losses and force hotels to shut down their CCCs. And if the CCCs shut down, patients will have nowhere to go for beds.” Hotel Centre Point director Micky Arora agreed that the price cap decision will affect financial feasibility. “The rate capping was already there in three categories. First was for Rs4,000, then Rs7,000 and Rs9,000 depending on the package. If the NMC says that just one category of Rs 4,000 will be there, then it’s almost impossible to proceed,” Aroa said and added that he will now have to rethink his CCC operations in his hotel. On Friday evening, the NMC issued an order in which it was mentioned that all step-down facilities operating as the CCCs will now have to cap their rates at Rs 4,000. The order mentioned that step-down facilities include hotels, schools, colleges, marriage halls etc. Nagpur Halls and Lawns Association secretary Vinod Kanakdande feels that both the NMC and the CCCs need to meet at the halfway point. “All CCCs are being operated purely out of goodwill and for society at large. At the same time, the NMC too is thinking about patients who may find themselves in financial ruin due to high bills. At such time it’s important to find an amicable solution so that neither party suffers,” Kanakdande said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-hotels-not-pleased-with-nmcs-rate-cap-decision/articleshow/82487808.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Police have arrested five people, including the in-charge of ICU section of Christ Hospital Dr Javed Siddique, two nurses and two peddlers working for him. The health department has acquired a section in Christ Hospital here to set up Covid treatment facility. However, it came to fore that Dr Siddique was smuggling out Remdesivir injections allocated to the hospital to treat patients and selling it illegally outside at exorbitant price. FDA officials got a tipoff about a deal for sale of Remdesivir at Gandhi Chowk and trapped two peddlers trying to sell two such injections. They had made a deal for Rs25,000 per injection with the customer, but duo was apprehended with two vials in a joint raid by FDA officials and city police. The arrested duo was interrogated at the police station where they spilled the name of Dr Siddique and other two nurses involved in stealing Remdesivir injections from the hospital. Dr Siddique and the nurses were arrested late in the night. Officials involved in the investigation said Dr Siddique was whisking away injection from the hospital with the help of two nurses. He used to prescribe injections to serious patients and get them in their name. They would mention the injection being given to the patients in treatment record, but would instead steal it for sale in the market at excessively high price. Police are investigating how many injections were stolen and sold in a similar manner. All the five accused were produced before the court on Saturday which remanded them in magisterial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/chandrapur-doctor-among-5-held-for-remdesivir-black-marketing/articleshow/82487855.cms||Mazhar Ali

Now, we have been forced to postpone it to November,” said Ragunandan, a businessman and father of bride, told STOI. “I have spent of nearly Rs 1 lakh for just printing wedding cards and invited people from both in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. I even booked an air-conditioned private travel buses to ferry people. But that has all been ruined,” Amarender Reddy, whose son BR Sharat’s is set to get married on May 29 at Madhapur. Though there are auspicious days to perform weddings in June, July, November, and December, as luck would have it, there are 17 auspicious days for muhurthams in the month of May only, according to Ramana Deekshithulu, a senior purohit. He says he has fixed muhurthams for nearly 20 weddings in May in Hyderabad and Secunderabad. “But now, most weddings have been postponed to November and December,” said Deekshithulu. After the Telangana government extended the partial night lockdown till May 15, tehsildars stopped getting requisitions for permissions, altogether. “Earlier, we used to receive five to seven requisitions in a month, seeking permission, but the number has gone down to two or three,” a tehsildar in Hyderabad told TOI. “All requisitions will be forwarded to police stations concerned for final permissions, a revenue official added. The continuous spike in Covid-19 cases, panic over the emergence of new strains of the virus and the police discouraging weddings have all played a part in weddings being postponed in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-weddings-hit-by-pandemic-this-yr-too/articleshow/82487866.cms||Sunil Mungara

The professor in charge of Trauma Centre was changed on Friday, a day after a new medical superintendent of SS Hospital was appointed. BHU spokesperson Rajesh Singh, however, claimed that the changes were made after the two heads submitted their resignations. “The vice-chancellor appointed Prof Saurabh Singh of the department of orthopedics as prof in charge of Trauma Centre on Friday after Prof SK Gupta of the department of general surgery resigned. Just a day earlier, Prof KK Gupta of the department of medicine was appointed medical superintendent of Sir Sunderlal Hospital after the resignation of Prof SK Mathur. Sources, however, claimed that changes were made following adverse feedback from the attendants of the admitted Covid patients. Family members of many Covid patients had alleged carelessness and mismanagement in treatment and the district administration had apprised higher authorities about the issue. The allegations are not new in the two BHU hospitals, both Level-3 Covid facilities. The hospital had been in eye of the storm during the first wave of Covid-19 last year, when two patients had committed suicide. During his visit to BHU on August 30, 2020, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had asked the university authorities to utilise all resources on Covid-19 front and live up to its reputation. Besides, the episodes of bodies getting exchanged, death of a photographer due to alleged negligence had invited trouble for the BHU hospitals leading to magisterial, NHRC and departmental probes in these cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bhu-hosps-see-change-of-guardamid-allegations-laxity-plaints/articleshow/82487905.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Give me some sunshine: Exposure to sun is vital for good health||Nagpur: While work-from-home, online classes and self-imposed social lockdown has prevented many families from getting exposed to the virus, it has also deprived them of getting ‘exposed’ to something highly beneficial - sunlight. Dr Sandeep Mogre, a paediatrician, said not getting adequate exposure to Sunlight is ‘bad’. “You need sunlight for Vitamin D conversion to happen. Vitamin D synthesized in the skin by ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun has been considered to meet nearly 90% of the daily requirement. It has been suggested that sunlight exposure for approximately 15-30 minutes, twice or thrice a week, is sufficient to produce the required amount (Vitamin D) in children,” he said. For strong bones and muscles, Vitamin D plays a key role as without it the body cannot effectively absorb calcium that is essential to good bone health. Orthopaedic surgeon Dr Sushrut Babhulkar said, “We require approximately 1,500 international units of sunlight per day. This means around 40 minutes of exposure to the Sun, but with certain precautions. Maximum benefit comes when the sunlight hits the earth at a 30 degree inclination. Hence it’s suggested that morning time is the best. In Nagpur, where it’s relatively hot, exposure window can be between 7AM to 9AM.” Eye surgeon and TOI Nagpur Heroes awardee Dr Vinay Nangia said a fair bit of sunlight does benefit. “It’s good for the eyes and it’s good for the body. Direct exposure to sunlight is also beneficial for eyes. When you are deprived of that, there is an increase in chances of myopia. So yes, everyone should make it a habit to step out in the morning sun,” said Dr Nangia who, for the past two decades, has also been involved in epidemiology studies. Getting exposure to direct sunlight may not be impossible, but in current times it could be a bit cumbersome. Ad guru and fitness enthusiast Sanjay Arora said, “I know it’s not easy but then it’s also not impossible. I never miss my walk and as a precaution I wear two masks. People can go to their apartment terrace or just venture out in the garden with all due precautions. That much exposure to the morning or evening sun will be more than enough.” But doctors say people must not take every medical advice to the extreme limit. Dermatologist Dr Vikrant Saoji said, “While it’s definitely important to get some exposure to sunlight, there can be negative effects too. Prolonged exposure where your skin starts to feel the pinch is bad. Too much exposure causes problems like wrinkles, faster aging and other skin issues. It’s white skinned people who need all that tanning etc whereas our skin is adapted to the environment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/give-me-some-sunshine-exposure-to-sun-is-vital-for-good-health/articleshow/82487909.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: With wife dead, Pak man’s crossover with daughter in limbo||NAGPUR: Ajit Kumar Nagdev had shifted to India from Pakistan with dreams of a better life, which were shattered. Covid struck in a year after he came from Usta Mohammed city in Balochistan province of Pakistan. His business of selling hosiery at Balaghat town, over 160km from Nagpur, ran into losses during the pandemic. Disheartened Nagdev wanted to return to Pakistan, all the papers were cleared.  As Covid spiked in India, Pakistan shut the borders before the date of crossover fixed for Nagdev and 136 others. His wife died in-between, leading to a fresh legal hassle. Even if borders open, it may not be easy for him to take his eight-year-old daughter Lavleen along, he says. Lavleen was born in India and since the family was living on a long-term visa (LTV), her name was endorsed on her mother’s name Rekha Kumari, who died some days ago. Now with the mother no more, her passport is also not valid. Nagdev hopes Lavleen’s name is now included in his passport at the earliest or else he may remain stranded in India. “They will not allow her to cross on the basis of my wife’s passport who is no more,” he told TOI. In the meanwhile, Covid has once again left people stranded across the border. There are over 136 Pakistani citizens, majority of whom Hindus, who were supposed to cross over on April 23, but the borders were closed before that. A helpless Nagdev now hopes for the Pakistani side to relent and take him in. “We have lost all our hopes. If I go back to Pakistan, maybe I get some support from my people there. My kids can go to a school there,” he says. As per the original schedule from Pakistani side, they were first supposed to cross over on April 17, along with others. The date was extended to April 23 by Pakistan government. His wife passed away on April 18. “She was not keeping well since a week before the first date of crossing. The date was extended till April 23, but she died at Nagpur on April 18,” he said. Rajesh Jhambia of Sindhi Hindi Panchayat, an organization of Pakistani immigrants, said the outfit is ready to provide any assistance if the immigrants are facing financial troubles in India so that they can stay in the country. Attempts are being made to convince him to stay back. Nagdev, however, said he had no hopes left. Back in Pakistan, he had a rented shop and had sold his entire stock to arrange funds for coming to India. There are others like him too. Sattanbai in Nagpur had come to meet her son living here.  “Though some of the stranded persons have already left when borders were opened earlier, she planned to extend her stay. Now my brother is not well, and she wants to go back, but the borders are closed,” said her son Om Prakash, who lives in Nagpur. Sattanbai is from Ghotki city in Sindh province. Thirty-two-year-old Anil Rakhria from Raipur in Chhattisgarh also had plans to go back to Ghotki as his father wanted him there. Now, he waits for the border to open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-wife-dead-pak-mans-crossover-with-daughter-in-limbo/articleshow/82487916.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Nagpur||MARD protests as PG-NEET, other exams put off||Nagpur: Resident doctors in the medical colleges and hospitals across the state, who have been working as Covid warriors since last one-and-a-half-years, received a major jolt on May 3 when the central government postponed exams like PG-NEET and postgraduate JR3 and also extended the tenure of all resident doctors. Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) on May 5 called these decisions ‘very impractical and unacceptable’. “Instead of solving the problems, these measures by Central Government will choke-up the flow of well-qualified doctors to the healthcare system of country. On the one hand, exams are postponed to avoid Covid exposure to students, while on the other the same students are expected to perform full-time Covid duties,” reads the statement issued on Wednesday by central committee of MARD. Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhobale Patil, president of the committee, told TOI that postponing exams takes great mental toll over any student. “We demand not to postpone the final year MD, MS Examinations as well as PG-NEET 2021,” he added. According to doctors, the decision by central government will further exploit the already overburdened and exhausted residents by making them work in Covid wards continuously and hamper their specialty training. “We don’t get any health insurance, don’t have proper quarantine facilities, neither any significant Covid-19 incentives. The decisions are of sheer dictatorship in name of Pandemic Act that further demoralises the working force in state and country,” reads the letter addressed to the Prime Minister. Residents in Maharashtra have also warned of non-cooperation movement if Centre failed to review its decisions. Dr Ravi Wankhedkar, treasurer of the World Medical Association, termed the move as ‘quixotic retrograde’. “Postponing PG-NEET will create more shortages of doctors. It will also add to the burden on serving junior doctors who are already physically and mentally fatigued,” he said adding that the government should conduct PG-NEET at the earliest to bring more doctors into the system.

Named ‘Dost for Life’, the app will initially be available on the Android platform and will later be extended to Apple’s iOS platform. Marking a departure from the existing practice of counselling through toll-free numbers, the app would bring counselling within the reach of students and parents in the safe environment of home, school principals said. The app will allow students seek guidance and therapy from counsellors, receive tips on mental health and well-being and suggestions on courses after Class XII. It also contains a guide on Covid-safety protocol and learning from home as well as self-care. To make the app attractive to youngsters, two sections have been introduced: on “frequently asked questions” and on rap songs. Lakshmipat Singhania Academy director Meena Kak welcomed the move. “The app will be a handy tool for children who are feeling vulnerable at the moment. It will help improve their mental health,” she said, adding students who had come to campus for practical tests looked dejected and were insecure about future. “We held counselling sessions to address their problems and teach them how to be resilient,” she said. “It is a commendable initiative as students’ mental health in the pandemic is a cause for concern. Most students have been unable to go out and lead a normal life. Hence, it will benefit them as the app will play the role of a psychologist,” said the principal of a CBSE school. Child psychologist Indira Roy Mandal said children, particularly in the 15-18 age group who considered peers as their lifeline, were distressed with real-life interaction with friends, classmates and teachers being cut off for over a year. “Lack of social interaction will have an impact on personality development. Children are unable to vent their feelings. Some are getting depressed and even feeling suicidal. Online classes, too, are taking a toll on their mental health as not all are able to follow them properly. Given the barriers between parents and kids in many Indian homes, where certain topics are taboo, or parents don’t have time to spare, a friend to whom one can reach out to, be it on an app, becomes important,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbse-to-launch-app-for-kids-mental-well-being/articleshow/82487923.cms||Somdatta Basu

The reason, according to him, is that the country has a younger population, potential of high economic growth improving affordability and relatively low level of insurance penetration that offers a massive opportunity for growth of the insurance sector in the country. “All the stakeholders need to work together to create awareness about the need for protection and for higher levels of customer engagement throughout the insurance life cycle for enhanced customer satisfaction,” he said. Khuntia said that Indian capability in the IT and IT-enabled services sector will further accentuate the potential growth of the Indian insurance sector as well. He pointed out that the emerging risks arising out of global climate change and cyber-risks will have to be addressed by insurance players. Along with offering risk protection, the former IRDAI chief also advised insurers to concentrate on ‘prevention of risk’ and continuous engagement with policyholder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/insurance-sector-on-cusp-of-transformation-ex-irdai-chief/articleshow/82487934.cms||---

Foresters said Jivabhai was sleeping in a mango orchard when a lion appeared around 1 am and attacked the goats tethered here. “He tried to chase away the lion but the lion mauled Jivabhai and later ate the goats,” Dheeraj Mittal, DCF (Gir west), told TOI. The lion after killing Jivabhai dragged away his body for 10-15 feet. The forest department tranquillized the lion and took it to an animal care centre. “The villagers witnessed the victim being mauled by the lion. Going by their statements, it seems that the lion did not intend to kill the victim. Also, the lion did not eat the human body. It got furious because the person tried to protect the goats. However, after further investigation, senior officers will take a decision whether the lion should be released again in the forest or not,” Mittal added.

---||Kolkata||As cases and deaths go up in WB, online flaunt zone becomes platform for despair & angst||KOLKATA: Jokes, groupfies, travel photos, memes and happy pictures have disappeared from the social media, with doctors, hospital CEOs, NGOs, social workers and individuals increasingly turning to online platforms to express their angst. Some are seeking medical help for themselves or acquaintances. Others have been taking to Facebook to plead helplessness. Those not affected yet are trying to be useful, sharing information on available beds, oxygen, doctors for tele-consultation and contacts for home-delivered cooked food. The second wave seems to have united all, in unhappiness. “We are truly on the same boat this time. Just browse your phone a few seconds and you’d know,” said senior consultant psychiatrist Rima Mukherji. Rupali Basu, MD and CEO, Woodlands Hospital, posted two days ago: “Never had to say ‘no beds’ to so many patients needing hospital admission. Sad.” Basu, who is also the founder-director of BCCI’s Bengal Fashion Heritage, keeps sharing stories relating to handloom and the six yards, apart from updates on how her organization was coping with the Covid-19 crisis. Basu agreed her posts had always been optimistic earlier. “Our resources are stretched. We are fervently praying for the curve to come down,” she said. Businessman Manish Dalmia, known in friend and professional circles as the crises man, is forwarding “I am helpless” messages to various WhatsApp groups. “I have been receiving calls only related to hospitalization or medicines or oxygen for the past fortnight. Unable to do much despite my best efforts. Never felt this defenceless and scared,” he said. Mukherji explained the despair that has filled the social-media space, which was once the platform to flaunt happiness. “There is a mass-scale negativity among netizens as the numbers of Covid-affected are fast turning into names. This fear is much worse than it was when the virus was unknown to us last year.” She added, “Last year, people tried to keep themselves occupied and were getting used to the new normal as Covid-19 took everyone off guard. This time, they are really, really frightened. Angry, too. Because of the election rallies, the role played by governments and our own foolishness in aggravating the pandemic.” The feeling of despair is across continents. Raja Biswas, senior consultant at Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Wales, said, “As someone who grew up, studied and with close ties with Kolkata, I am horrified at the unfolding medical disaster back home. The Facebook is full of videoclips of pyres, people crying for hospital beds or oxygen, and the governments’ incompetence in providing infrastructure. It’s heartbreaking. Can’t bring myself to share a picture of a dish I have cooked or a holiday I am taking in the countryside.” Instead, the doctor shared his own Covid experience. “The numbers in India are slightly more than what was there in the UK around December 20. UK’s NHS wasn’t overwhelmed because vaccination started on December 2. We went into lockdown on December 21. By March 21, the wave subsided. There wasn’t a single Covid patient in the hospital,” he wrote in one of the posts. The social media has been revolving around the disaster and probable solutions. Mukherji said, “The other big different between the first and the second waves is that Covid is now affecting people across ages. So it’s more scary. My son, who used to be out distributing food packets after Amphan, stays put at home now. Facebook and WhatsApp are his only links to the dark world outside.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/as-cases-and-deaths-go-up-online-flaunt-zone-becomes-platform-for-despair-angst/articleshow/82487963.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The social media users meanwhile claimed that the video of the gas leaking from a running white colour tanker is of the Cantonment area. Many among them questioned the authorities as to why the `Life saver' (oxygen) is being wasted like this when the country is experiencing an oxygen shortage. One of the users stated, "It is really very shocking...while the people are dying owing to oxygen shortage, an oxygen tanker is releasing people's lives (Oxygen) in the air." ADM (City) Atul Kumar, on being contacted, said, "Going by the preliminary findings, it came to fore that the oxygen tanker, which carries a tag of some private company is not being hired by district authorities here. It seems the video was probably shot while the tanker, carrying the registration number plate of another state, was on its way to deliver oxygen to another part of the region." Meanwhile, the technical staff of an oxygen refilling unit claimed that it is a part of a safety mechanism wherein some gas releases whenever there pressure builds up. A tanker, containing liquid oxygen, has a pressure release valve at its rear. "When the pressure inside the tanker increases due to difference in temperature between the atmosphere and inside the tanker, the valve opens up automatically to release pressure," he said and added, "This is a safety mechanism which is installed in almost all the tankers containing liquid oxygen so as to prevent the tanker from exploding and avoid any kind of eventuality."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/oxygen-releases-from-rear-of-tanker-goes-viral/articleshow/82487982.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Mothers recall their #PandemicChallenges||Motherhood, they say, is the best phase of a woman's life. And it affects every woman differently. A mother too grows with the child and learns a lot in the process. However, every journey is different. And with the COVID-19 pandemic posing a huge threat to humanity in ways more than one, every individual has been facing different sets of challenges. On Mother's Day today, we spoke to a few moms to understand how they survived the last one-and-a-half years of the pandemic. Read on… ‘Check-ups & vaccination can’t be avoided even in this pandemic. So, I made sure the paediatrician has a private chamber’I got my marriage registered on January 29, 2020, and the social marriage was scheduled to take place in April. But the national lockdown was announced and all our plans had to be postponed. In July, I discovered that I was pregnant and what I felt was a mix of euphoria and apprehension. At that time, I was in my second year of MBA and had no idea how I would balance my pregnancy with studies. Moreover, my husband had moved to Delhi for work. When I was in my 12th week, I suffered a few complications. I had to be hospitalised. COVID cases were at its peak and getting hospitalised was quite traumatic. My social marriage happened in November when I was six months pregnant. Though we had taken enough precautions, the constant fear of contracting the virus was quite stressful. But every struggle seemed worthwhile when I held my baby for the first time on February 8, 2021. After the birth of my son, Uttoriyo, special care had to be taken to keep him safe as the second wave of COVID hit us. Work from home is a blessing right now as I get to spend maximum time with him. But with a newborn at home, doctor check-ups and vaccinations cannot be avoided even in this pandemic. I made sure the paediatrician has a private chamber because hospitals are too risky right now. This Mother's Day will be twice as special since it's my first. Motherhood has changed me as a person, more so because I am a 'pandemic mom'. The whole situation has made me more resilient, patient and given me the urge to go the extra mile when it comes to safety and hygiene to protect my baby from the virus. — Pooja Dasgupta, IT professional ‘Making my daughter understand why she couldn’t play downstairs was tough’I am a mother to a seven-year-old girl, along with two more beautiful girls - Coffee and Luchi - my pet Golden Retriever and Pug respectively. Coffee, my first pet played an important part in my journey as a mom. My daughter, Pasta, was a slow speaker and it was not until she turned five that she started to converse. We did speech therapies, consulted doctors, but nothing seemed to work. Then one day, a friend suggested that pet therapy can help the child bond with the animal and she might start speaking. So, two years back we brought Coffee home. To our surprise, Pasta started interacting with the dog and also with us. As the pandemic struck last year, it brought with it a lot of challenges for mothers like me. I had to make my daughter understand why going to school was not the right thing now. Or, why she couldn't play downstairs in our residential complex. Then came the challenges of her online classes. Though kids today are tech-savvy, we as parents, had to learn the nitty-gritty of this entire online class setup. But both Mehboob (Alam, husband) and I decided not to interfere while she was attending her classes from home, despite the fact that she is a slow learner compared to her peers. Making her more dependent on us could be a problem in future when our WFH period would get over. So, I request all parents not to put unnecessary pressure on kids with education during this time, since we can't fully understand what they are going through mentally by staying cooped up at home for months. Recently, we brought home our second pet, Luchi, and now the three of them have a world of their own and it's really helping my child sail through the pandemic. — Debjani Chatterjee Alam, food writer ‘My days of isolation were the most difficult for me as a mother’While I am a gynaecologist, my husband is an oncologist. And COVID-19 was a huge turning point in our lives, both as healthcare providers and also as parents. Initially, I was at home with my kids and only attending to emergency patients. My husband would go to work, check COVID patients, and isolate himself in a room for three to four days. Last year, on my daughter's birthday, I got an emergency call as one of my patients' C-section delivery had to be done immediately. I did the operation wearing a PPE kit and when I returned home, I got a call from the hospital saying that the new mother tested COVID positive. It was a shocker for me as I didn't know whether I had already contracted the virus while operating her. I took preliminary measures like taking steam, had homoeopathy medicines but didn't break the news to my kids. I isolated myself in a room in the same house. Those few days of isolation were most difficult for me. I didn't have any domestic help at home for assistance. As a mother, all I could do to boost my children's immunity was by making healthy food at home. I also made sure I let my kids get enough sleep. In the second wave, when the virus is sparing no one, I attend COVID patients too. Though I have taken my two doses of vaccination, there is always a lingering fear of contracting the virus somehow. — Dr Payal Banerjee Ray, gynaecologist, also treats COVID patients at a city hospital||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mothers-recall-their-pandemicchallenges/articleshow/82479673.cms||Srishti Dasgupta

The gap between two doses now stands at 50-60 days for some, as against the 45-day limit. Prasad Bhujang, whose parents received the first Covaxin shot on March 16, said, “They still have not been able to get the second dose. The recommended gap between the two Covaxin doses is four to six weeks, which has now stretched to more than seven weeks in my parents’ case. Efforts since the last 15 days to get the shot have failed to yield any results.”A PMC official said, “We do not have any more vaccines for recipients in the 45 years and above age category. Covishield is also not available for 18-44 years age bracket. Covaxin doses were administered to the latter on Saturday. If we get more stock till Sunday, we could restart the drive by Monday in the 45 years and above category. However, Covaxin administration for the 18-44 years category will continue on Sunday at the four fixed centres in the PMC areas.”The official said there were no Covishield doses available with PMC at all. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said it’s unsure when the new vaccine stock for the 45 years and above age group would be received. “We are prepared for 1 lakh vaccinations per day with 600 live sites if vaccine is available in sufficient quantity,” he said.25 private vax sites in Pune rural charging Rs 250/dosePrivate hospitals in Pune rural are now listed as ‘paid’ vaccine sites on Co-WIN (for the 45 years and above age category) as these centres continue to provide vaccines at Rs 250 per dose. Pune zilla parishad CEO Ayush Prasad told TOI, “Vaccination policy for 45 years and above age group in Pune rural remains unchanged. The vaccine stock that we are getting is going to all 404 centres in Pune rural, of which 25 are private centres, which are undertaking paid vaccination. The reason we continue with the same policy in Pune rural is because peri-urban locations like Baramati and Hinjewadi, among others, do not have too many primary health centres to cater to the large population. This helps in preventing crowding.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vax-shortage-holds-up-drive-for-45-group-at-most-sites/articleshow/82487998.cms||Neha Madaan

The plant with a capacity of 5,000 litre of oxygen was lying defunct since the past two years due to some snag in it’s compressor unit. An engineering team of 509 Army Base workshop of Agra rectified it on Saturday after a 10-day exercise and made it operational. The engineering team had visited the Saifai university on May 1 and met the authorities there and sought their assistance in getting the plant functional. “A 10-member team led by expert engineers of 509 Army Base Workshop Agra had visited the university on May 1. They had collected initial vital technical inputs and returned to Army Base along with compressor parts of the plant. On Friday, the team came again and installed the compressor parts and made the plant operational. Currently, the plant of 5,000 litres has started producing oxygen,” informed registrar Suresh Chandra Sharma. A group of resident doctors told TOI, “This is certainly positive news in the time of crisis. We hope that our second plant also starts working soon.

He was also discharged from AIIMS, Delhi and brought back to the prison on Friday night. Kappan has been lodged in Mathura jail since October 5 last year over charges of sedition and UAPA. He was shifted to AIIMS on April 30 for “better treatment” on the direction of the Supreme Court on April 28. Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) had approached the Supreme Court for urgent hearing of his bail application along with a request for shifting him to Delhi hospital, a day after Kappan was admitted to a private hospital in Mathura after he tested positive for Covid-19 on April 21. However, he had tested negative on April 27, according to jail authorities. His family members have expressed surprise that he was shifted back to Mathura jail from AIIMS within four days of testing Covid-19 positive, and that too at midnight. Kappan is suffering from other health problems too. Senior superintendent of Mathura district jail Shailendra Maitrey, told TOI that Kappan was shifted to the jail at 1:30 am on Friday. “The delay in his transfer happened due to problems in getting an ambulance for transporting a Covid-19 positive patient from one to another state during lockdown,” the SSP said. “He was stable at the time of discharge. As per directions he has been put up in an isolation ward of the district jail hospital and is under observation,” he said, adding that all diagnostic tests had been conducted at AIIMS. However, Kappan’s lawyer Wills Mathew expressed surprise at these developments and wondered how a severe diabetic patient had recovered from Covid-19 within a few days and again got infected. In a letter to the Mathura jail superintendent, the lawyer requested, on behalf of Kappan’s wife Raihnath Kappan, for an update on his present medical condition and also sought permission for his wife to meet him in the jail. The jail authorities have said that they denied permission to Kappan’s wife to meet him due to the prevalent Covid situation. They told Kappan’s lawyer that meetings with prisoners are prohibited in the jail right now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/journo-siddique-kappan-tests-covid-19-positive-for-2nd-time-discharged-from-aiims-brought-back-to-mathura-jail/articleshow/82488010.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Allahabad||‘Cavalier approach of locals can spur rise in cases again’||Prayagraj: At a time when the district administration is putting all efforts to strictly implement restrictions to curb the pandemic and the number of Covid cases is declining, the carelessness and callous attitude of citizens is threatening to undo the good result and threatens to spark a resurge of corona infection. Despite clear instructions, vegetable vendors, shopkeepers, commuters, public transporters can be seen violating restrictions, putting everyone’s life at stake. The vendors and shopkeepers seem to be playing the ‘hide-and-seek’ with police. Though the malls, multiplexes and main markets having showrooms of branded items remain closed, the vendors and shopkeepers in residential areas and narrow lanes are not following restrictions. The local police take regular rounds and ask people to remain indoors and warn vegetable sellers and shopkeepers to follow the norms, but as soon as the team moves on, the usual trade is back on the roads. “People can be spotted wearing masks on their chins, while local residents collect at the paan shop picking flaws in the system and government policy,” said Prof HN Mishra, former head of geography department at Allahabad University. Similar scenes can be witnessed in Preetam Nagar, Neem Sarai, lanes of Sulem Sarai, Katra, Allahapur, Tagore town, Muttiganj, Chowk and Naini. Similarly, people in rural blocks of Prayagraj and Pratapgrah have also failed to realize the crisis and gravity of the situation. “People have to understand that police are enforcing restrictions for the good and safety of people, but as soon as the police team moves on, vendors and locals are back on streets,” said Ankit Shukla, a teacher in Pratapgrah. SSP Prayagraj, Sarvashresth Tripathi said, “It is a collective fight. We can win only when everyone follows norms with responsibility.” “We try to implement the restrictions to keep people safe and healthy, to curb the spread of infection, but some people fail to understand. Each individual has to be safe if we want to defeat the virus,” said IG Zone (Prayagraj), KP Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/cavalier-approach-of-locals-can-spur-rise-in-cases-again/articleshow/82488036.cms||---

The hospital management claimed that they never had the need to use these machines. A senior doctor at the hospital said the ventilators were not sent elsewhere in the district as there are no qualified people to run them. The hospital authorities are now trying to send these machines elsewhere. Firozabad’s poor healthcare system can be gauged by the way health authorities have responded to a human crisis caused by the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of saving critical patients in need of ventilators, the health authorities are embroiled in paperwork to shift the state-of-the-art equipment elsewhere. According to sources, last year, the hospital was provided with 90 fully digital ventilators by the central government using PM-CARES funds. Out of these, 67 are yet to be unpacked. These ventilators are designed for use as bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) for treatment of patients in critical condition. The district hospital has a 172-bed Covid-19 ward. Till date, the district hospital authorities have intermittently put to use just 23 of the digital ventilators, sources said. Superintendent in charge of the district hospital, Dr Alok Sharma, said, “Presently, we have a total of 144 ventilators available with us. Out of these, 90 were received from PM-CARES funds last year. Some 67 of these new machines have not been put into use so far. We didn’t have the need to use them. We are trying to supply them to other centres, so that they can be utilized in treating critical patients.” A senior doctor at the district hospital said, “There is not a single chest physician or technician to operate these machines in the entire district. The hospital administration had alerted higher authorities that these machines can be transferred to other places, but no action has so far been taken.” TOI had reported a similar situation in Agra district, where two digital ventilators are lying unused in the district hospital due to lack of qualified manpower to operate them. Divisional commissioner Amit Gupta said, “I was not aware that the ventilators are lying unused at the government centres. I will ensure they are suitably utilized.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/67-brand-new-ventilators-lying-unused-in-firozabad-dist-hospital/articleshow/82488040.cms||Deepak Lavania

During the virtual meeting held late Friday evening, the office bearers of the associations highlighted the recent warning by the UNICEF about the third wave, and asked all traders dealing in medicines and medical equipment to be ready to fight this big challenge. The UNICEF head had recently said that the tragic Covid-19 situation in India should raise alarm bells for all of us and that there would be reverberations across the region and the world in terms of virus-related deaths, virus mutations and supply delays unless the world steps up and helps India right now. Lalu Mittal, a prominent member of the association who was present at the meeting, asked all medicine dealers to be on high alert in view of the bulletin issued by the Union Ministry of Health regarding the third Covid wave. He appealed to the producers and distributors involved in drug production and distribution to be ready with enough face shields, oxygen, face masks, PPE kits, sanitizers, etc from now on to be able to deal with the possible emergency and the subsequent rise in demand of such products. The virtual meeting expressed concern over the prediction that the third wave might prey on children. The members were informed that Cipla’s distributor, SS Traders Shadab wrote a letter to the company urging to increase the production and supply of Remdesivir injectiosn. Those present in the meeting included division in charge Shushant Kesarwani, woman president Avantika Tandon, Manish Gupta, Ratna Jaiswal and Shweta Mittal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/chemist-association-gears-up-to-stock-up-on-oxygen-masks-ppe-kits-sanitizers-after-unicef-warns-about-a-possible-third-wave/articleshow/82488041.cms||---
---||Pune||1,400 gram panchayats need shot facilities for max cover||Pune: Covid vaccination centres should be set up in gram panchayats to ramp up vaccination in rural Pune, Zilla Parishad chief executive officer Ayush Prasad has said. Rural Pune covers 13 tehsils which have 1,400 gram panchayats and 14 municipal councils. Schools, colleges, NGO offices should be converted into vaccination sites in view of the limited number of sub- centres in the rural areas, he said in his letter to Archana Patil, additional director of health services, state family welfare bureau, on May 6. “At present, we are administering approximately 50,000 doses daily in Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and Pune rural. At this speed, we will take approximately 220 days to cover the 11 million population provided we get uninterrupted supply of vaccine. If we maintain the vaccination speed, it will take almost 9 to 10 months to cover all beneficiaries in all the age groups in Pune,” the letter said. Prasad told TOI on Friday, “Ramping up vaccination with existing guidelines would be a difficult task, particularly in rural areas. At several places we have only two rooms at sub-centres to cater to a large population. So, we need to vaccinate at the gram panchayat level where a larger population can be covered.” He said currently BHMS doctors are not permitted on Covid duty, but they can work in the vaccination drive. “Several experts have said that third wave of Covid may come in August. Our endeavour is to vaccinate the entire population before July 10 so that we can handle the situation better,” Prasad added. Rural Pune has vaccinated 45,000 beneficiaries on one day. “We want to take this number further so that we can reach closer to our target. Also, we need to get more vaccine doses,” said Prasad Meanwhile, in rural areas, many beneficiaries are travelling distance to get doses of the vaccine at Primary Health Centre (PHC), sub-centres and rural hospitals. Amol Naravade, zilla parishad member from Velhe, said, “We had arranged for vehicles for people to bring them to the vaccination centre which is about 20 to 25km away from their villages. Vaccination should happen at the gram panchayat level.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1400-gram-panchayats-need-shot-facilities-for-max-cover/articleshow/82488044.cms||Sandip Dighe

Therefore, PGI leadership immediately flagged the issue to the higher authorities and expects an immediate redressal to avoid turning the already pressing situation into a crisis,” the release added. “PGIMER has been designated as the Covid hospital of Chandigarh and is allocated a quota of 20MT of oxygen per day to meet its requirements. On the day, PGI has already reached the consumption of 20MT in view of the consistent surge in the patient load. Therefore, it may not be possible to increase the Covid bed strength in the institute in case the oxygen allocation is not enhanced with immediate effect,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-asks-firm-not-to-supply-more-o2-cylinders-to-pgi/articleshow/82488046.cms||---

A former VP of a pharma major claiming world governments are lying about Covid-19. Drinking hot tea in the afternoon is why Israel is “relaxed about the virus”. These were among fake messages that were found circulating in local social media networks.Since April 30, the Times Verified service has busted at least 215 fake messages out of more than 300 Covid-related forwards submitted by readers, who said misleading posts have become a menace. One message claimed that a hospital in Pune city has set aside 5,000 beds for Covid-19 patients. That message was certified as fake by the Times Verified initiative. “I'm sure many people receive such messages every day,” said Alok Kamath, a resident of Hadapsar. “There are viral that claim families can get remdesivir if you dial a particular numbers. The authorities should do more to contain such misinformation.”Besides medicines, Times Verified was also able to bust fake home therapies and incorrect claims on testing. One message, which had been forwarded many times, claimed antigen tests were picking up the virus in tap water. According to WHO, Covid doesn't spread via water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tea-wont-stop-covid-toi-busts-over-200-fake-messages-in-just-eight-days/articleshow/82488051.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune not among 30 national districts seeing increase in Covid cases||Pune: It's certainly some relief after weeks of concern. Pune is now not on a central list of 30 districts that have been recording an increase in Covid cases over the last two weeks. The high-caseload list, released by the Union government on Thursday, included 10 districts from Kerala, seven from Andhra Pradesh, three from Karnataka, one from Tamil Nadu and two from Maharashtra - Satara and Solapur. Experts TOI spoke to said Pune's Covid caseload may start dropping over the next two weeks. State disease surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate, who helps prepare projections for Maharashtra, said casecount has been dropping in Pune.He said, "According to our assessment, the next 15 days could see further dips in Pune and in the state too. Besides Pune, we're already seeing drops in 13 other districts."The state, overall, has registered a 4% dip in Covid cases, Dr Awate added. As for reasons why, he said high testing levels and restrictions that prevented crowding have helped. "Most key cities that had high caseloads are now seeing drops. And gradually, the rest of the state districts should start seeing declines too," Dr Awate said. He said Pune's positivity rate is now at 23% (down from 25%). "We're hoping that it reduces to 10% soon," he said. Dr Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state on Covid control, said if the current situation is managed well, the coming fortnight should see a further drop in cases across Pune and other cities of Maharashtra. But he warned that authorities and citizens should not let their guard down. "Officials should ensure there are no super-spreader events until the end of this year," Dr Salunke said, adding that lockdowns are temporary solutions and regular economic activity should be allowed to resume amid Covid protocols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-not-among-30-national-districts-seeing-increase-in-covid-cases/articleshow/82488056.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh finds private hospital taking excess oxygen, orders probe||CHANDIGARH: The UT administration found a private hospital taking oxygen cylinders in excess and has initiated an inquiry. A team of senior officials, led by Yaspal Garg, nodal officer for oxygen supplies in Chandigarh, in consultation with the GMH-16 medical officer, checked the data and found that the hospital was taking many more cylinders than its requirement for earmarked Covid beds. The administration will take action after the probe report is submitted. Sources in the administration said the hospital was taking almost four times more oxygen cylinders than required, which forced the UT to conduct an inspection to ascertain the number of patients and daily oxygen needs. Since all the private hospitals have earmarked dedicated Covid beds, UT has been monitoring their requirements. “The private hospital was taking 400 cylinders per day while another of almost the same capacity was consuming about 90. The consumption of the hospitals was examined with regard to their capacity and beds reserved for Covid patients. Senior doctors from government hospitals could not find out the possible reasons for such an abnormal consumption shown by the private hospital,” said Garg. Asserting that it was almost impossible to consume such quantity even when all patients were on ventilators, he said, “It has been decided to conduct an inquiry, after which appropriate action will be taken against its authorities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-finds-private-hosp-taking-excess-oxygen-orders-probe/articleshow/82488084.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Jaipur||Lockdown decision should have been made by centre: CM||JAIPUR: Amid lockdown imposed by several states to check the coronavirus spiral, chief minister Ashok Gehlot said the decision should have been made by the Centre to avoid hardships to people. In a statement, Gehlot said several states have imposed a lockdown to control the spread of the virus and prohibited the entry of people from one state to another. “Today, many states, including Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Haryana, Karnataka and Delhi, had imposed lock down. Some states have prohibited entry of people from other states. We have also decided to impose lock down from Monday.” The chief minister also expressed concern that the infection is spreading fast to the rural areas. “It has been observed that in the rural areas and youth are also increasingly falling prey to Covid this time around.” “A lockdown is needed more than ever to prevent the infection spread. I am of the opinion that on the basis of previous experience, this decision should have been made at the level of the central government, so that the common people including the labourers should have minimum hardship and at the same time ensured better coordination among the states,” Gehlot said. He said to stop the virus spread, a strict lockdown will be in place across the state from Monday (May 10). It is the duty of every citizen to follow the guidelines, the chief minister said. The state government has decided to implement a strict lockdown in the state from May 10 to 24. During this period, marriage functions, intrastate movement and public transport have been suspended. Only shops dealing in essential items will remain open from 6- 11 am. 15 acre land allotted free for hospital in BarmerChief Minister Ashok Gehlot has approved the proposal to allot 15 acres of land free of cost in the village Sambhara of Pachpadra tehsil for the construction of a hospital to HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Limited, a joint venture of HPCL and State Government. The hospital would help the personnel working in the refinery area and the local to get better medical facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/lockdown-decision-should-have-been-made-by-entre-cm/articleshow/82488088.cms||---
---||Jodhpur||Needful is not being done by the Centre: State to HC||JODHPUR: Training guns on the Centre again, the state government has submitted before the high court that enough was not being done by the central government in dealing with Covid crisis. The state government, in its reply during the hearing of a PIL by Surendra Jain on Friday, said all efforts were being made to operationalise oxygen generation plants attached to medical colleges in the state. Assistant solicitor general Mukesh Rajpurohit, however, submitted that a high-powered committee had been constituted by the central government to deal with the supply of oxygen and essential medicines to all the states taking into consideration the number of Covid patients in the state. But the state government contended that the requisitions, which were sent to the committee, were not being fulfilled adequately. The state, in its affidavit, claimed that the central government has allotted 1.41 lakh Remdesivir vials to the state between April 21 and May 9, while citing the overall daily demand reaching 20,000 per day leading to shortage at some places despite rational use. The court has requested the high-powered committee to consider allotting oxygen to the state and source it in Rajasthan or around in order to save the time of transportation. It also requested the committee to enhance supply of Remdesivir and other life-saving drugs to meet the demand of the State. Recognising the efforts of doctors, para-medical staff and government functionaries, the division bench comprising Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Vinit Kumar Mathur said, “Although best efforts are being made to utilise the available resources, but we feel that requisite efforts are not sufficient and further efforts need to be made to meet the prevailing situation and the situation which is likely to arise in the state of Rajasthan because of the pandemic.” While advising linking doctors at PHCs and CHCs in rural areas with those of higher centres for better treatment, the court directed the state government to strengthen infrastructure as well as medicine availability at these PHCs and CHCs in order to provide better medical aid to the rural population in villages itself. This will reduce the pressure on the bigger hospitals in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/needful-is-not-being-done-by-the-centre-state-to-hc/articleshow/82488090.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Team conducts surprise checks at oxygen plant, refilling centre||CHANDIGARH: To keep a check on the daily supply of oxygen to private hospitals of the city, a team of senior officers, led by Yaspal Garg, nodal officer for oxygen supplies in UT, conducted surprise checks at an Industrial Area-based plant and a refilling centre in Derabassi on Saturday. Besides the police, the UT administration has also deputed its employees at the plant and the refilling centre to monitor the supply and ensure there was no pressure from any private hospital or person. Garg said, “During the surprise visit, it was observed that the process was going on smoothly and proper security has been provided by the police. The pressure of oxygen in the cylinders was randomly checked and found to be correct and there was no complaint of short supply. The rates fixed by the administration were being charged and the daily quota fixed for the private hospitals was being adhered to.” The government of India has fixed the daily quota of 20MT of medical oxygen for UT from M/s Inox, Barotiwala. This medical oxygen is being utilized for GMCH-32, GMH-16 and the Covid hospital at Sector 48, Chandigarh. Oxygen generation plants were commissioned recently at the three hospitals. Private healthcare institutions are also being catered to from this quota, besides cylinders are used by other government hospitals and ambulances. The requirement of medical oxygen for PGIMER is met from a separate quota. For glitch-free supply To ensure smooth supply of oxygen, the administration has taken the following steps: 1: Officials have been stationed at the Inox plant in Barotiwala, Baddi 2: Police escorts have been provided to the oxygen tankers from the plant to Chandigarh to reduce travel time and avoid any untoward incident 3: Three private vendors have been authorized for re-filling medical oxygen from the UT quota 4: The re-filling rate has been fixed as per the approved rate of GMCH-32 5: Officers have been stationed on the premises of private refilling vendors to ensure that cylinders are being issued in a regulated manner and there is no diversion from the UT quota 6: Round-the-clock police security has been provided at the oxygen generation plant at Industrial Area, Chandigarh 7: A senior PCS officer has been deputed to ensure supply of oxygen to private hospitals, for whom daily quota has been fixed 8: Each private hospital has been attached with a private vendor to avoid confusion and regulate the supply 9: Efforts are being made to have some back-up arrangements from Punjab and Haryana to get oxygen on loan in case of crisis 10: The voluntary organizations that have come forward to set up mini-Covid Centres have been requested to have their own arrangements of oxygen through concentrators||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/team-conducts-surprise-checks-at-oxygen-plant-refilling-centre/articleshow/82488091.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Jaipur||Petitions seeking directions for Centre pending before High Court||JAIPUR: Several petitions have been filed in Rajasthan high court about severe shortage of oxygen and alleged partiality of the Centre in allocation of medical oxygen and other life saving medicines to the Congress-ruled state. These are now pending before the high court, unlike in Karnataka and Delhi where the high courts gave orders to the Centre to allocate sufficient oxygen to these states. The chief minister has been demanding allocation of oxygen and medicines in proportion to the active Covid cases, but has not been acceded to by the Centre. The Rajasthan High Court Bar Association and senior lawyer PC Bhandari had filed petitions in the court seeking directions to the Centre to ensure sufficient supply of oxygen to the state. The high court initially said it did not want to interfere at that stage as the Supreme Court was seized of the matter and directed the state government to ensure sufficient supply of medicines and oxygen. The court will now hear the case on May 10. While the centre had taken over all oxygen plants and centralised supply of essential medicines, how could the state ensure sufficient supply of these items to the hospitals is the moot point. Rajasthan High Court Bar Association, Jaipur, president Bhuwnesh Sharma said the high court should have dealt with the petition more seriously and given directions to the centre earlier. He said he will apprise the court of the serious situation in the next hearing. Since the Supreme Court now directed the centre to comply with the Karnataka and Delhi high court orders, those high courts took up the issue with urgency to get more allocation of oxygen for that states, while Rajasthan is still struggling. While oxygen express trains pass through Rajasthan for Delhi, the state has to fetch oxygen from far off from West Bengal and Odisha by tankers. When the situation became grim, finally the state decided for the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/petitions-seeking-directions-for-centre-pending-before-hc/articleshow/82488092.cms||---
---||Jodhpur||Donors seek GST exemption on medical equipment||JODHPUR: Donors of medical equipment have sought exemption from Goods and Services Tax. Some of them have appealed to the state government that if the equipment, they have been importing or purchasing for donation to the hospitals should be considered for GST exemption. It may be noted that so many donors, individuals or organisations/associations, have come forward to provide the life-saving equipment like oxygen plants, oxygen concentrators, oximeters and oxygen cylinders etc. to help the administration meet the burgeoning demand of these equipment. District administration has also issued appeals twice to the donors to help the administration address the shortage of many such equipment by donating generously and complement the efforts of the administration and doctors to help save lives. As per the GST regime, these equipment attract tax ranging from 12-18%, thereby adding significantly to the actual price of the equipment. “So we have appealed to the government to consider exemption from GST so that the money saved this way could help in getting more equipment”, said an officer bearer of Jodhpur Builders’ and Developers’ Association, which has initiated an import of 25 oxygen concentrators from China. Likewise, a real estate developer of the city has ordered an oxygen generation plant worth Rs 40 lakh, which will incur Rs 7.5 lakh in form of GST. According to an estimate, a total equipment worth Rs 6 crore have been ordered by the donors in the city for various hospitals, urban and rural, which will be incurring a GST of around Rs 1 crore approximately. One of these donors said that this is not the time for the governments to earn revenue in the form of tax at least on these important and life-saving equipment. “This gesture of exemption of GST would motivate more donors to contribute to this fight against the virus, which would ultimately help in mitigating the situation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/donors-seek-gst-exemption-on-medical-equipment/articleshow/82488093.cms||---

Deputy commissioner MK Ahuja said a person needs to visit http://oxygenhry.in and apply for getting oxygen supply at home. “During these tough times, we will have to work in coordination. We have decided to refill oxygen cylinders at homes of Covid patients,” the DC added. About the procedure, the DC said on visiting the website, a patient must register a mobile phone and provide the photo of Aadhaar card and of oxygen level in oxymeter, name and age. The request would be processed and the Red Cross Society would provide the oxygen refill. Besides this, the administration was also taking the help of NGOs and has registered interested ones on the portal and they or the Red Cross Society would connect with the victims. Residents would receive a message on their phone and the supply would be delivered, he said, adding that one mobile phone would be able to get the supply once in a day. The victims under home isolation with co-morbidities require oxygen and the door-to-door supply would decrease rush at hospitals and beds could go to serious patients. The step would also stop black-marketing of oxygen going on throughout the country at present, said officials. Sant Nirankari Bhawan is Covid centreIn view of the recent surge in the number of Covid-19 cases, the Panchkula DC notified Sant Nirankari Bhawan, Sector 9, as a dedicated Covid care centre.

They told police that they purchased these injections at an inflated price while their parents were down with Covid. However, they did not need the injections as their parents recovered and wanted to sell it to make up for the losses. The women were identified as Bhumika and Priyanka, residents of Kotra Colony. While one is working in a nationalised bank, the other is a teacher in a government school. Police have registered a case against a medical representative from whom they purchased the injections. DSP Priyanka Raghuvanshi said police were investigating the matter and all aspects were open. “This is pandemic time and we will not spare any culprit,” she said.

Ajmer is facing a shortage of the injections and patient parties are making every effort to manage an injection from the black market. The matter came to light after complainant Ashish Soni got a call from one of his relatives that they needed money to purchase Remdesivr. After talking to people, Ashish found that two women possessed three injections and wanted to sell each at Rs 25,000. Ashish went to purchase the injections and both women came in car and met him near Ajmer club. Unknown to the women, the complainant recorded it following which police questioned both the women.

These ventilators were sent to Udaipur by the Centre under the PM relief fund last year. The consignment was, however, faulty. Some 24 ventilators were installed, but all of them stopped working after a few hours. Most of the ventilators have not yet been unpacked and installed in the wake of several that turned out faulty. The equipment have been lying unused for a year in the medical college storeroom. According to sources, few ventilators were installed for serious patients, but all of them stopped working within three hours of installation. After Diwali, the pandemic situation normalised and so the faulty ventilators too became a forgotten thing and their repair or replacement was not taken on priority basis. Now with spurt in fresh cases and hospitals running short of ventilators and oxygen-supported beds, the forgotten ventilators made a re-entry in the scenario. Leader of Opposition and Udaipur MLA Gulab Chand Kataria wrote to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan apprising him of the situation. Kataria said the company which manufactured the ventilators had sent a technical team to repair the fault but the problem has not been solved. He said the state government too had been informed about the ventilators, but no action had been taken yet and patients were suffering. Kataria said if the details of the manufacturers were known, the follow-up would be done at the local level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/95-ventilators-lying-unused-in-udaipur-hospital/articleshow/82488097.cms||---

On Friday, Shanmugam went to his brother’s house and knocked at the door. Since there was no response, he peeped through the window only to find both his brother and sister-in-law hanging from the ceiling. He broke open the door and went into the house. An ambulance crew that arrived on call declared them dead.

Of these, 15 centres were for 18 plus category people. Only those youngsters who got registered and got a confirmation SMS were let to pass through the main entrance, amid shortage of vaccination. At a centre in Tulsi Nagar, token arrangements was made at to manage the crowd. Only one counter was available to give tokens for a queue of about five hundred people creating chaos and ruckus. Certificate issuing is also a problem being widely reported. Many beneficiaries are downloading the certificate easily while others are facing problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/11k-get-innoculated-in-bhopal/articleshow/82488121.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat’s daily Covid testing dips 17%, cases fall 10% in a week||AHMEDABAD: From May 1 to 7, Gujarat recorded an average daily 12,894 Covid-19 positive cases, which fell to 11,892 on Saturday which was the lowest daily tally after 18 days. While the data for daily testing on Saturday was not available, analysis of the past two weeks – from May 1 to 7 and April 24 to 30 – reveal that the daily testing for Covid went down by 17% in a week. Since May 1, the daily tests have not exceeded 1.5 lakh, which according to experts, is one of the reasons for the fall in daily cases – 10% in seven days. “While dependence on Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) is reduced even in the rural areas, there is no restriction on RT-PCR tests. But people would go for the Covid testing if they get the symptoms. Thus, one can safely say that the overall cases are on the downward slope in Gujarat,” said a senior health department official, citing less queues outside testing centres and major hospitals. To put the figure in perspective, bed occupancy in private hospitals in Ahmedabad was 82%, down from 93% on April 30. On the other hand, the average test positivity rate (TPR) has increased in a week – compared to 9.2% in the first week of May, the last week of April had recorded a TPR of 8.5%. The urban-rural divide is also recorded with four major districts (Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot) recording 8% TPR on Friday compared to the state's 8.7%. The rest of Gujarat had a TPR of 9.5%. Analysis of the vaccination in Gujarat records a downward trend for the first and upward trend for the second doses – on Saturday, against 62,283 first shots, 1.25 lakh got the second shot. State health department officials said that the division of vaccination centres for the 18-45 years and 45+ years is one of the reasons. They added that once the new stock of vaccines arrives, the number of first jabs would improve. The share of eight municipal corporations in the total vaccination fell to 38% on Saturday from 49% or nearly half the share on May 1. The experts interpret it as a rise in vaccination in rural areas and other districts, as the cases have also recorded a rise. “Earlier vaccination had higher share in cities, but people have realized that vaccination is one of the ways to keep the virus at bay. We can see the correlation,” said a public health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/daily-covid-testing-down-17-cases-dip-10-in-a-week/articleshow/82488124.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Hyderabad||‘Any amount of prep and care will still leave gaps’||Union minister of state for home and national Covid-19 control room in-charge G Kishan Reddy says many chief ministers are against national lockdown and that is why Centre has left it to their discretion. In an exclusive interview with Koride Mahesh, he says Centre has taken several steps to ramp up vaccine distribution, Remdesivir production and oxygen supplies. Excerpts: Is Centre contemplating imposing a national lockdown to check the alarming surge in Covid-19 cases? Already, some states have announced total lockdown. It is not correct to say that the Centre is against lockdown. The Centre has asked the states to impose complete or partial or weekend lockdown or night curfews based on their local conditions. For instance, many BJP-ruled states like Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh have clamped total lockdown. Some CMs like Telangana CM KCR and north-eastern CMs are opposing lockdowns. As of today, 180 districts in the country have not reported any fresh cases in the past one week, 54 districts have no new cases in the last 21 days and 32 districts have not reported a single case in the last 28 days. There are allegations that the surge in many states is mainly due to  rallies. What would you say on this? Holding elections to state assemblies is the decision of Election Commission of India. When the election notification was issued for four states and one UT, there was no alarming rise in coronavirus cases. But, in Maharashtra and Delhi, cases increased rapidly though there were no elections. It was not Modiji alone, all other parties’ leaders like Rahul Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee and Stalin and parties like CPM held election rallies. Did the Centre let its guard down? Was it unprepared for the second wave? Prime Minister Narendra Modi had chaired 14 meetings to review Covid-19 situation in the country. Two meetings were held in September 2020, two in October, one in November, two in January 2021, one in March and six in April 2021. Each of these meetings was attended by states’ CMs, cabinet ministers and department heads. The PM also held meetings with manufacturers of vaccines and even visited three companies. This is a pandemic which is a once-in-a-century situation. Any amount of preparation and care will still leave gaps The Centre was proactive in the first wave of Covid-19. But, the same spirit was not seen in the second wave. Why? In the first wave, there were a lot of uncertainties and gaps in medical infrastructure. We did not have masks, PPE kits, ventilators and oxygen availability. We also did not have a tested medication regime and vaccine availability. For example, we have been able to provide 50,000 ventilators in one year, while there were only 48,000 ventilators in the country since Independence. In the second wave, states have been given the freedom to take decisions at their end. However, continuous reviews and inputs are being given to states by Centre States such as Telangana are complaining about insufficient supplies of vaccines, Remdesivir and oxygen and alleging only some states have been getting a major chunk of stocks... Vaccines, medicines such as Remdesivir and oxygen are being allocated by taking into account the number of positive cases, deaths and population of the state concerned. Maharashtra and Delhi are getting more allocations as there are more cases being reported. Even, deaths are more there. The Centre is doing everything in a transparent manner. In both the states, the BJP is not the ruling party. In Telangana, only a few thousand cases and 30 to 40 deaths are being reported every day. The Centre has supplied over 56 lakh doses of vaccines and 1.25 lakh Remdesivir injections. Another 1.45 lakh injections are being sent to Telangana Seven companies are manufacturing Remdesivir 24x7 through their 20 plants. When there is a shortage of vaccines for people aged above 45 and only 12 per cent of the population covered so far, why did the government hurriedly announce vaccination for people aged between 18 and 44? Seventeen crore people, including frontline workers, have been vaccinated till now which is 12 per cent of our country’s population after a successful rollout of vaccination drive across country on January 16, 2021. So far, 85% of frontline warriors like cops, health workers, municipal workers and revenue staff have been covered. Our vaccination coverage is 50 per cent of the US has done, 2.5 times more than what the UK has done, seven times more than Australia and 34 times more than New Zealand. How are you going to meet the country’s vaccine demand? In November 2020, the Centre had ordered 500 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine and one billion doses of Novavax. Both these were to be made by Serum Institute of India. We also purchased 100 million doses of Sputnik V from Russia. We also have our procurement of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech. Unfortunately, Novavax did not materialise. The Centre has already increased orders made to SII and Bhart Biotech. Modiji announced Rs 4,700 crore advances to both SII and Bhara Biotech to ramp up production. Many states have been facing shortage of oxygen. Even KCR has asked for more allocation of oxygen. What is the Centre’s strategy on this? There has been a sharp increase in oxygen demand for treating Covid-19 patients. All the government PSUs and private steel firms have stopped production of industrial oxygen and providing medical oxygen across the country on the directions of Modi. The ministry of railways is supplying oxygen through 352 tankers in 85 dedicated trains to various states every day which comes to 3302 MTs a day Apart from this, the ministry of defence has arranged oxygen beds in cities like Lucknow, Bengaluru and Delhi. The ministry of steel has provided 5,000 oxygen beds. Over 70,000 isolation beds have been provided by the railways by converting rail coaches into isolation wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/any-amount-of-prep-and-care-will-still-leave-gaps/articleshow/82488125.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||India||Covid-19: Positivity rate 20% or more in 2 out of every 5 districts in India||Over 40% of India’s 741 districts, or 301 of them, had a test positivity rate of 20% or more for the week from May 1 to May 7, according to data put out by the Union health ministry on Saturday. The fact that these districts are spread across 31 of the country’s 36 states and UTs reveals how widespread the current surge in Covid infections is. Of the 15 districts with positivity rates above 50% for the period, Haryana had four and Arunachal Pradesh and Rajasthan two each. What is striking is that most of these districts are rural ones. Since the testing numbers are not available, it is not clear whether this is due to inadequate testing or not. The highest positivity rates for the seven-day period were in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh which registered 91.5%, but this is probably more an indication of an extremely low number of tests conducted. Next on the list were Yanam in Puducherry, Bikaner in Rajasthan, Diban Valley in Arunchal Pradesh and Pali in Rajasthan. The state with the highest proportion of districts on the 20%-plus list is Kerala with 13 of its 14 districts figuring here. Haryana (19 out of 22), West Bengal (19 out of 23), Delhi (9 out of 11) and Karnataka (24 out of 31) were the others with over 70% of their districts in this worrying list. All districts in Goa and Puducherry, the lone district in Chandigarh and three out of four in Sikkim were also part of it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/positivity-rate-20-or-more-in-2-out-of-every-5-districts-in-india/articleshow/82488107.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Yadadri works hit by pandemic||Hyderabad: Inauguration of Yadadri temple is likely to be delayed as the ongoing refurbishing works of Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple project at Yadadri have been affected by the second wave of the pandemic. Of the nearly 1,000 workers, over 800 of them have left for their homes fearing Covid-19 infection. Several staff members and priests of the temple too have tested positive in the last two months. Yadadri temple executive officer N Geeta Reddy confirmed to STOI that that works on pilgrim facilities will pick up speed after the workers return. “The second round of pandemic has resulted in workers leaving for their homes in large numbers or not coming to work,” she said. Sources said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is likely to hold a review meeting on the status of development of Yadadri temple project soon. Though the chief minister was to visit the temple this month, officials are not sure whether he will go ahead with the trip as proposed earlier. The CM recovered from Covid-19 only a few days ago. Though works on the main temple atop the hill have almost been completed, the project is far from over when it comes to putting in place the facilities for pilgrims. KCR, who is personally monitoring the temple project, directed the Yadadri Temple Development Authority officials to ensure that the project is pilgrim-centric in addition to being a role model for the world. During his previous visit to the temple in March this year, KCR, who is also chairman of YTDA, instructed officials to ensure hassle-free amenities, devotee-centric facilities, world class audio-visual experience, best queue management and development of greenery in and around the temple. The CM had indicated that the temple could be inaugurated in May if the works were completed. The CM had also suggested that a team of officials and artists visit temples and religious structures in the country and abroad to derive inspiration and emulate it in Yadadri suiting the local needs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/yadadri-works-hit-by-pandemic/articleshow/82488130.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Mother’s Day New moms responding to call of duty & motherhood!||AHMEDABAD: Valentina Christian, 54, is a diligent head nurse at the 1200-bed Covid facility at Civil Hospital. Managing nursing resources amid a flood of patients and rushing to the aid of critical patients is all part of the job daily. But as her shift ends, her heart fills with joy of going back to her precious child and dread what if she carries possible infection to her toddler. Valentina and her husband Sobers, an employee with Western Railways, were blessed with a daughter on January 30 last year, less than three months before first Covid-19 was admitted in Civil Hospital. The couple has named her Erica. “I became a mother at a very late age and hence I’m very protective of Erica. I was very afraid of going near her earlier, lest she gets infected because of me,” Valentina pours her heart out. “Thus, it’s a strict no-no for all to go closer to her without proper sanitization. I hold myself back when she comes running towards me nowadays.” But duty comes first. “Many of my fellow nurses fell sick due to the pandemic, and I voluntarily did their shifts. By God’s grace, we are safe so far. I am happy that I am contributing to the healthcare machinery that helps save many lives.” says the nurse. As the world marks Mother’s Day on May 8, hundreds of healthcare workers – ranging from doctors to nurses and paramedical to supporting staff – have successfully learnt to walk the tightrope between duty and motherhood. Similarly, Dr Shruti Sangani, 36, an assistant professor in the emergency medicine department, handles the triage at 1200-bed Covid hospital. “I have been in Covid duty for the past one year. At that time, my son Dhruvansh was barely a year old. It seems like a fast-forward that he’s two. My husband is an orthopaedic surgeon. He along with my mother take care of him when I’m attending to Covid patients,” she says. Dr Sangani who contracted Covid during Diwali with a high viral load had to get hospitalized. “The past few days were really a blur with unprecedented rush – but I forget everything when I reach home in the evening and Dhruvansh excitedly tells me that he has learnt a new rhyme. The mother in me gets energized to do my best to help as many patients during the pandemic. Like all other health workers, I cannot stay back.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mothers-day-new-moms-responding-to-call-of-duty-motherhood/articleshow/82488132.cms||Parth Shastri

The result is an increase of 10 intensive care unit (ICU) beds at a government hospital in Modasa using Rs 18.45 lakh that were raised in less than a day’s time. Earlier this month, Rajiv Darji, a teacher in Varthu Primary School in Modasa, called up Krishna Kharadi, a young girl living in Isari village of Mejrat taluka in Aravalli district. It was part of Darji’s Covid duty to call up patients who are home quarantined and inquire about their well-being. The girl said she was alright and recovering but her voice seemed to tremble and was heavy with some forlorn concern. When the teacher inquired further, she said that her father too had tested positive and that the doctors have advised to get him admitted to a hospital. The father, Jagdishbhai Kharadi, working with the state electricity board, was critical with poor oxygen levels. But there were no beds available, she said. The teacher, who had been tele-calling patients for the last few days, felt it was time to do something. “He came to me the next day and said that we all are so helpless in this unusual crisis but we should do something about it,” recalls Smita Patel, District Primary Education Officer, Aravalli. The issue was discussed at the block resource centre and cluster resource centre of the state education department. Soon help poured in from all sides as word spread that money was required to set up more ICU beds in the area. Townsfolk and villagers opened their purse strings and contributed money. “In a span of 24 hours, about Rs 18.45 lakhs were raised,” Patel said. Rakesh Patel, office superintendent of Sarvajanik Prathmik Hospital where funds were used to add ICU capacity, said that 10 new ICU beds have been readied and will soon start taking patients for them. The hospital has a capacity of about 120 beds presently of which 16 are with ICU facilities having bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) machines. With the new additions, there are presently 26 ICU beds. Krishna Kharadi, who lost her father recently in his fight against Covid-19 after he was moved to a hospital, said the new hospital infrastructure facility in Modasa is much needed in these critical times for saving human lives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/how-a-teachers-call-added-10-covid-icu-beds-in-modasa-hospital/articleshow/82488174.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Once they realized that the shops will function till 6pm and on Sunday, the crowd came down a bit,” a Tasmac salesman said.The elite shop at RS Puram sold liquor worth Rs 6 lakh till 12pm against the shop’s average sales of Rs 8 lakh, a salesman said. “Sales are expected to rise,” he said.Customers wanted to stock up till the shops are reopened, said a salesman at an outlet at Gandhipuram. “The maximum permitted limit is nine litres of beer and wine each and seven litres of liquor per person.” Sales graph had started to go down after working time was reduced to just four hours, said a senior Tasmac official. “Revenue from the northern division of Coimbatore was just Rs 2.82 crores against the average revenue Rs 3.5 crores. We expect sales to pick up on Saturday and Sunday as outlets will be closed for the next two weeks.” “We have formed a team to inspect outlets to ensure that Covid-19 guidelines are followed. We have placed boards and stuck bills at all shops, directing customers to wear masks and maintain social distance. Of the three workers deployed in each shop, one has to ensure that the guidelines are followed,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tipplers-throng-tasmac-outlets/articleshow/82488197.cms||Nivedha Selvam

When TOI spoke to relatives of patients, ambulance staff and workers at the government-owned crematorium, it was clear that Covid SOPs are being violated blatantly at all levels, thereby facilitating easier spread of the deadly viral infection. R Viswa of Thirunagar said he was allowed to be an attender to his relative who was admitted to the Covid ward at Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai in a serious condition. ``But what I saw there was unbelievable. I found that several patients (who were serious) had at least six people attending to them in the ward. They were sitting around them and also commuting between their homes and the hospital using public transport and autorickshaws,” he said. He further said there were eight bodies including that of his relative, who succumbed to the disease, that were released on Friday. “I saw young men packing the body in the zipped cover. They were not wearing PPEs,” says Viswa. Responding to this, monitoring officer for Covid-19 in Madurai, Dr B Chandramohan, said he would take up the matter with the dean of the hospital and take action to reduce the crowds. Thatheneri crematorium, which usually receives less than 10 bodies on a normal day, has been seeing between 40 and 45 now — certified Covid, suspected Covid as well as those who died due to other causes. TOI noted that ambulance staff were without PPEs while the relatives of victims follow the vehicle in autorickshaws. On arrival, a disinfectant is sprayed and the bags are partially unzipped by the crematorium workers for the relatives to see the face. They are asked to perform rituals from a safe distance and even garlands are put on the body only by the workers who are however without PPEs or even gloves.There was a three-hour wait for ambulances at the crematorium on Friday and attenders/ relatives were given a token and made to wait for their turn. When eight bodies arrived simultaneously, grieving relatives of the victims were seen gathering in close groups. One of the crematorium staff, Thangam (name changed) said neither he nor his family members had been vaccinated because “We don’t want to”.Centre for Environmental Sciences founder S V Pathy said the government’s efforts to rein in Covid would be a disaster if it did not rein in the attenders at GRH as well as at cremation grounds. ``We are supplying disinfectants and kits, but what is the use when crowds from funerals and hospitals continue to be major carriers of the disease,’’ he said. A corporation official said they had taken steps to prevent crowding at the Thatheneri crematorium. They have asked private hospitals closer to Moolakarai electric crematorium to send bodies there. ``We are also distributing tokens with cremation timing and allowing only two people to accompany the body,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/protocols-go-for-a-toss-as-relatives-crowd-patients-in-grh-covid-ward/articleshow/82488200.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||150 spl buses help people head back to hometowns||Coimbatore: Close on the heels of the state government’s announcement on the complete lockdown from Monday, the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) has started operating special buses to provide uninterrupted and comfortable service to the people travelling to other cities. About 150 special buses were operated from the Coimbatore region, which comprises Tirupur, Erode, Nilgirs and Coimbatore districts, on Saturday. Of them 50 vehicles were operated from Coimbatore alone. Moderate crowd was seen at the bus stands, including the ones at Singanallur and Gandhipuram, since the morning. A TNSTC official said, “Buses will be operated without any restrictions till Monday 4am. As we are expecting a rise in the number of passengers travelling to other districts, we have increased the number of mofussil buses from the city by 50.” While 1,015 buses are being operated in the district, 675 of them are town buses. Pointing out that there was a huge demand for the buses to Madurai, Trichy, Theni and Salem, the official said they had increased the service to these districts and buses were running with full seating capacity. “Our average revenue per kilometre was just Rs 16.5-Rs 16 for town buses and Rs 17 for mofussil buses as on Friday. The revenue generated through mofussil buses is expected to go up by 30%-40% in two days, because of the rise in footfalls. While the own buses are also seeing a rise in passenger traffic, the same is yet to be reflected in the revenue as free ride is provided to women travellers,” the official said.He said they used to earn Rs 27 to Rs 28 per kilometre before the lockdown. “In the past few months, it remained at Rs 22. After the night curfew was introduced, the earnings had dipped to Rs 18 per kilometre. During non-peak hours, it goes down to Rs 10 to Rs 12.” Some private buses have also recorded a sudden rise in the last-minute booking shortly after the complete lockdown was announced. A private bus authority said the booking had increased by 40% in the morning and most of the seats were filled for the first time in the past few weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/150-spl-buses-help-people-head-back-to-hometowns/articleshow/82488214.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The western parts of the city received heavy rainfall compared to the eastern parts, where the meteorological department has a rain gauge.Weathermen had earlier forecast that the district, along with other parts of interior Tamil Nadu, would receive rain from May 5 to 8 because of a weather trough extending from North India to south Sri Lanka. “Isolated but heavy rainfall will continue in the Nilgiris and adjoining districts for the next few days,” said a statement by the weather department.While the district recorded only 6cm of rainfall, water stagnated on many stretches till Saturday afternoon. Race Course, which was filled with sludge, seemed to be the worst affected, especially because of the ongoing model road project work.There was a massive puddle opposite the public health office at Race Course. And it caused inconvenience to the shoppers, who flocked to the nearby shopping complex to buy and stock essentials for the lockdown period. “Muddy water splashed on us as motorists were speeding their vehicles to find a parking lot,” said Shyamala Nataraj, a local resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/summer-rain-reduces-race-course-to-sludgy-mess/articleshow/82488235.cms||---

This was when 53 of the 68 vacant oxygen beds were avilable with the private hospitals on Saturday. However, the 15 oxygen beds in the government sector remain unused. As per the tnega website, beds are vacant at eight government hospitals in rural areas and those at Periyanaickenpalayam, Mettupalayam, Kottur and Thondamuthur. However, they refuse to admit patients.When TOI contacted the government hospital at Annur to admit a patient, it flatly refused stating it didn’t have Covid-19 treatment facilities. “We have listed an oxygen bed, but we can’t take Covid patients.”The response wasn’t any different when TOI contacted the government hospital at Madukkarai that had listed two vacant oxygen beds. “Our ward is not converted to a Covid-19 ward yet. We are handling many general patients, so please do not bring any Covid patients,” said a medical officer with the hospital.An official with the medical services department said the hospitals were making excuses like lack of continuous power supply, generators to support the oxygenation, electric issues for not allocating oxygen beds to Covid patients. “They should have brought these issues up and corrected them after the first wave.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/68-oxygen-beds-vacant-but-of-no-use-to-patients/articleshow/82488241.cms||---

Most small vendors ran out of stock by afternoon itself as they were not prepared for the rush following the lockdown announcement.S Saravanan, from K K Nagar in Trichy, decided to get groceries for the next few days as soon as he heard the lockdown announcement. He said he was reminded of the first few weeks of lockdown last year when there was shortage of essentials due to sudden lockdown imposed by the government. Grocery store owners said that a section of people wanted to stock rice, pulses and other essentials as they fear an increase in price of essential products. However, he said that there is no chance of shortage of essentials or price rise this time.G Lakshmi, a vegetable vendor from Anna Nagar Farmer’s Market in Madurai, said she had procured less vegetables so that she could sell it off before noon as she cannot keep the leftover as Sunday was earlier a complete lockdown. All the vegetables procured by traders were sold off before 11am. “Even out regular customers who came late had to return disappointed. We would have procured more if the announcement came a day earlier,” she said.S Magilan, running a vegetable shop near Kajah Malai, had to ask people to maintain physical distance as the crowd kept swelling in front of his shop around 9am.Bakeries too had prepared less stock and had fewer employees.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Fungal infections, silent killer in diabetic Covid-19 patients||HYDERABAD: If you develop a nose block, running nose with blood, pain in the cheek bone or eyes just days after recovering from Covid-19, it may be a warning sign of a life threatening mucormycosis infection. This has mainly been seen in diabetics who recover from Covid-19. The infection takes 3-7 days to infect the brain, after which saving the patient is impossible say doctors. With each corporate hospital in the city seeing 3-4 new cases everyday, the number of cases since the start of the pandemic is estimated to run into thousands. As the symptoms of this infection mimic those of Covid-19 and common flu, people ignore it and end up missing out on treatment. “If unattended, this infection, which originates in the nose, can quickly affect the eyes resulting in loss of eyesight. If it progresses to the brain, it reaches a point of no return. Sometimes the progress from eye to brain can happen in a few hours. The usage of steroids is the reason behind this,” said Dr K Rambabu, senior consultant ENT surgeon Apollo hospital, Jubilee hills citing a recent case of a 20-year-old from Guntur who succumbed to the infection. Another thing hampering treatment is that there is little awareness about the infection even among doctors. “Since the awareness is less even in medical fraternity, many physicians tend to overlook the symptoms,” said Dr Sampurna Ghosh, consultant ENT, head and neck surgeon, Medicover Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fungal-infections-silent-killer-in-diabetic-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82488331.cms||Amrita Didyala

On Thursday, the Tamil Nadu health department told the Madras high court that it would run out of supply by Saturday if the Centre does not increase the allotment. Through Saturday, the health and industries department diverted industrial oxygen to medium-sized hospitals. A letter from National Health Mission director Sanjay Roy on Saturday said the allocation from Inox Sriperumbudur —the sole supplier for Chennai district— will be increased by 50 tonnes a day from 140 tonnes.  JSW Salem proposed to increase oxygen allocation to 15 tonnes a day from 10 tonnes a day, while National Oxygen Erode’s allocation will be increased by 8 tonnes to 38 tonnes.

---||Hyderabad||Willpower beats virus||I kept telling myself my lungs are strong By Supriya Bedi Sikka I am not sure where and how I got infected. I have been going out a few times but never to crowded areas. The first symptom -- sore throat -- manifested four days after my last outing. Two days later, I developed cough and low-grade fever. I quarantine myself on Day 3. My family took the RT-PCR test on Day 6 and both my husband and I tested positive. Thankfully, my husband had mild symptoms. Perhaps, because he had taken his first shot of the vaccine. I didn't get vaccinated because I was skeptical about its efficacy. In hindsight, I was wrong. By Day 7, my SPO2 levels had come down to 91-92 and I had difficulty in breathing. I was put on oxygen support on Day 8. I got a CT scan done also. Reports showed 50 per cent damage to lungs. On our doctor's assurance and a trip to KIMS, I decided to get treated at home. As I lay there gasping for breath and turning blue in the face while my husband and daughter watched helplessly, I thought this was the end. I was blacking out when I felt my daughter's desperate touch on my feet trying to do something. That moment, I thought I could not die just yet. I kept telling myself that I am strong, my lungs are strong and I'm fine. What helped me recover was strong support from my family and my extended family and mental strength. (Supriya is soft skills training consultant) What kept us going was our 10-yr-old son By Sanjib Bhattacharya and Tanulekha Bhattacharya It all started with fever and body pains on April 23. We got ourselves tested and the results came positive on April 27. While we were relieved that we had kept our 10-year-old son away from us since Day 1, we were worried about his stay if we were to get admitted to a hospital. Our worst fears came true. By April 27 night, the situation worsened as my wife and I started suffering from breathlessness and were unable to even get up from the bed. Our oxygen levels dipped to 80. Somehow, I managed to inform my company HR who helped us not only to get admitted to a hospital but also made arrangements for our son to stay with a family in Gachibowli. Since there were a couple of fatalities in our family due to Covid-19, our child was traumatised. My sugar levels started shooting up during hospitalisation. We were administered Remedesivir, among other medicines, and I was continuously on oxygen. The only thing that kept us going was that my wife and I must recover for our son. Our mental strength and self-confidence kept us going. We are gradually recovering. One needs to have faith that this is only a passing phase. While taking precautions like breathing exercises and steam inhalation help, concentrating on enhancing mental strength is equally important. Now that we have recovered, we would like to help any Covid-19 patient who needs any kind of succour. (Tanulekha is a teacher and Sanjib is a techie) I told myself I'd beat the virusBy Chanchal Sarbajna It was in early 2020 that the coronavirus started spreading like wildfire across Europe and the US, wiping out families and cities. Fast forward to 2021 and I suddenly found the virus at my doorstep. About a week into my first dose of the vaccine, I came home from work one day feeling extremely fatigued and feverish. For the first few days, I brushed it off as just another bout of flu, but temperatures – as high as 103-104 degrees -- persisted. Though a subsequent RT-PCR test came negative, I drove myself to a clinic to get a CT scan. The readings indicated a moderate infection. Anxiety set in on Day 6 as I started suffering from an acute cough. On Day 7, despite all medication, even my oxygen levels dropped to 87. I knew my next step had to be hospitalisation. I called close friends in Hyderabad and Kolkata seeking help. I did manage to find a bed at a corporate hospital in Jubilee Hills. My driver, on learning about my illness, quit in a huff. I was wary about using an ambulance service. That’s when help came from a local cab operator. Shafiq bhai immediately sent one of his drivers, who took me to the hospital. I will remain grateful to the doctors who treated me. Now, as I recuperate from severe weakness, I realise that in those moments of anxiety and stress, what helped me was my positive attitude and help extended by my wife Ruchira.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu shuts for 15 days as Covid-19 cases spike, hospitals run out of beds||CHENNAI: As Covid-19 cases crossed 27,000 a day and an overstretched healthcare sector struggled to handle the growing number of patients, the state government on Saturday announced a complete lockdown across Tamil Nadu from 4am on May 10 to 4am on May 24. Chief minister M K Stalin said that more than 23 districts in TN had reported a positivity rate of more than 10%. On Saturday, nearly 86% of oxygen beds and 87% of ICU beds across the state were occupied. In high incidence districts such as Chennai, 99% of beds in ICUs and 96% oxygen beds were full. In districts like Dharmapuri, Tirupur, Tiruvallur and Ranipet there were no ICU beds. Puducherry, too, on Saturday imposed a two-week lockdown starting May 10. Several states, including Kerala, Karnataka and New Delhi, have announced varying degrees of lockdown.  “In view of the impending total lockdown, the government has allowed all shops and establishments to operate for two days, May 8 and 9 (Saturday and Sunday), between 6am and 9pm,” the CM said. The decision has been taken following the views expressed by collectors, medical experts and recommendations of the Union government. The number of active cases in the state has crossed 1.35 lakh a sharp increase compared to the same period in March. All government offices, except essential departments like secretariat, medical and family welfare, revenue, police, electricity and drinking water supply, will remain closed. Central government offices, autonomous/subordinate offices and public corporations will also remain closed. All private offices, IT and ITES establishments too will remain shut and so are industries other than exempted ones. In a statement, AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam said the total lockdown would be of great help to contain the spread. “I welcome the government’s decision to continue Amma canteens and shut Tasmac outlets,” he said. The AIADMK leader said the government could increase the mini clinics and allow it to function 24 hours by engaging temporary doctors to reduce the burden on government hospitals. He also urged the state to extend incentives to health workers. PMK leader S Anbumani Ramadoss suggested the government could waive off power bills for two months. AMMK leader TTV Dhinakaran demanded that the government extend free food thrice a day in Amma canteens. The permitted activities during the lockdown include supply of milk, newspapers, courier service, hospitals, medical labs, pharmacies, ambulance, hearse and allied medical activities, goods vehicles, vehicles carrying agricultural produce, oxygen and fuel. Shops selling fertilisers, pesticides, seeds and fodder outlets will be allowed to function between 6am and noon. Takeaway service will be permitted in restaurants, hotels, bakeries and mess between 6 am and 10 am, noon and 3 pm and 6 pm and 9 pm. E-commerce activities will be allowed only during this permitted time. Road-side eateries would not be allowed. Amma canteens will continue to function, while pavement vendors selling vegetables and fruits will be permitted till noon. PDS outlets will function between 8 am and noon. Volunteers and caregivers attending to people with special needs, differently-abled and elderly citizens will be allowed to travel with ID cards and permission letters issued by respective organisations. Judiciary and courts, ongoing construction activities and media will be allowed. The government has already permitted continuous process industries and industries manufacturing essential commodities. The staff/workers will be allowed to travel by carrying their ID cards either in company vehicles or own vehicles with display of ID cards. There is no bar in conducting wedding ceremonies with a maximum of 50 people. For funeral and performance of last rites, there is a cap of 20 people. Telecommunication and related activities, maintenance and operations of data centres and other critical IT infrastructure needed to support backend operations of medical, financial, transport and other critical services, warehousing activities, including loading, unloading and storage of goods will be permitted. Even in sectors where complete lockdown is applicable, essential maintenance like fire and machine safety would be permitted. Movement of goods and workers to and from all railway stations, sea ports and airports and fuel pumps are among the permitted activities. Banks, ATMs, bank-related transport and insurance services will be allowed with 50% workforce.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-shuts-for-15-days-as-cases-spike-hosps-run-out-of-beds/articleshow/82488476.cms||---
---||Delhi||Oxygen supply: Please give Delhi 700MT daily, says Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and Aam Aadmi Party national spokesperson Raghav Chadha on Saturday appealed to the Centre to increase Delhi’s oxygen supply to 700 metric tonnes. Delhi’s oxygen supply has been declining since May 5 when it was provided 730 metric tonnes, they stated. Delhi received just 488 metric tonnes of oxygen on Friday, which is only around 70% of the current requirement, Sisodia said. “At present, Delhi requires a minimum of 700 MT oxygen supply to cater to patients, and an increase in Covid beds and health infrastructure would necessitate oxygen allocation of 976 MT in the city. Delhi received 730 MT of oxygen for the first time ever on May 5, however, we saw a persistent decline from May 6 onwards. We received 577 MT on May 6 and 488 MT on May 7,” said the deputy CM. “It is my humble appeal to the Government of India to increase Delhi’s oxygen allocation to 700 MT as soon as possible,” he added. The deputy chief minister said the figure of 700 MT was decided after reviewing the central government’s formula of allocating oxygen supply to hospitals and the patient-wise data of Delhi. “Although the Supreme Court has demanded that the Centre allocate 700MT of oxygen to Delhi, no step has been taken on this front. With this current deficit, it would be hard to manage proper supply for all hospitals.” Referring to the Supreme Court proceedings, Sisodia stated the central government had claimed that India was still receiving surplus oxygen and that out of 10,000 MT of oxygen being received each day, around 7,000-8,000 MT was being consumed. “A need has emerged for the Centre to streamline their processes, manage supply better and ensure that all states receive supply in better quantities so that there is no fight for oxygen supply,” he said. Senior AAP functionary Raghav Chadha said despite receiving only 488 MT of oxygen, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s team and government were ensuring efficient distribution and management of oxygen. “We are somehow managing the situation even with 488 MT. Team Kejriwal and all its officers, ministers and MLAs are working on efficient and effective distribution and management of oxygen. Their good governance is helping us moderate even the shortage that we are facing today because of decreased supply by the Centre. However, if we do not receive 700 MT everyday, a huge problem will befall upon us,” said Chadha. He further said that “while Delhi requires 976 MT of oxygen overall, it will be taking the figure of 700 MT into its daily oxygen bulletin after keeping in mind the Supreme Court’s insistence on meeting the same figure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/please-give-capital-700mt-daily-sisodia/articleshow/82488498.cms||---

NCR residents within this age group, who recently got their jab, share their experiences & learnings from the process‘I tried over 30 times a day to book a slot, but my booking got cancelled’36-year-old Rakshay Dhariwal, MD of a hospitality company, says, “After bookings opened, I tried over 30 times a day to get a vaccination slot. I finally got a slot the next evening at a south Delhi hospital. But a few hours later, I got a text from the app saying that the vaccine was yet to come to the hospital, so my appointment had been cancelled. I started checking for a slot again, and after many attempts, I got a slot at another hospital. After this, the vaccination process was quite smooth.” Rakshay Dhariwal receiving his first jab at a Delhi hospital‘I got the jab in 30 minutes, my wife got hers after hours’A 40-year-old architect from Delhi says, “By the time I got a slot, I had become an expert in booking it. Now, I’ve memorised pincodes where slots are easier to find. My wife’s vaccination was at a government centre in Delhi and mine was at a private hospital in Mathura Road. We reached her centre at 1pm and planned to drive to Mathura Road for my dose after she got her jab. When we arrived at her centre, there was a half-kilometre queue just to reach the building. After half an hour she got an entry and a coupon. Two hours later, she was still waiting for the vaccine, so around 3.30pm I went to my centre. I was the third person there, and they said that unless there are 10 people, we won’t get our shot. They asked us to arrange seven more people as they had no access to the contact details of those who had registered. In the next 45 minutes, we somehow arranged five people, and 30 minutes after that, I was done. I returned to my wife’s centre, where she was still waiting for the vaccine. She finally got vaccinated at 6.30pm after which we went home.” Some citizens have complained of long queues at vaccination centres, so much so that some returned home without getting the vaccine‘Had a slight fever after jab, but was completely fine later’33-year-old Sikander Kamal, an MNC professional who lives in Delhi, says, “I went for vaccination on the first day and the process was quite smooth. I had a slight fever and my sister had high fever that night, but after that we were completely fine. At our centre, which was a private hospital, we didn’t face any issues. One of my friends who went to another centre decided to return as it was very crowded.” ‘At my centre in Gurgaon, 13 people were registered, but only my sister & I showed up’20-year-old Delhi University student Shivaak Sharma and his sister, who live in Gurgaon, got their jab at a centre in Patel Nagar in Gurgaon. Shivaak says, “We were not checking slots obsessively because we knew they aren’t easily available. But on May 4, after refreshing the app a few times, my sister got a slot. We had to figure out where the centre was because only its name was mentioned in the appointment receipt. When we reached the area, there were no markings or indications, but we finally located the centre in a lane. We went inside around 5pm and it was just us who had showed up out of the 13 people scheduled in that slot. We asked if we need to wait for 30 minutes after the shot, and they suggested we wait in our car.” Shivaak Sharma got his jab in GurgaonDelhi-based influencers and digital content creators Ankush Bahuguna and Kusha Kapila took to social media to share that they have received the first jab of the COVID vaccine.

---||World||Scotland's long quest for independence||EDIBURGH: As votes are being counted in a key Scottish election, we look at the country's long quest for independence from its southern neighbour England: Faced with Norse domination, the Picts and the Gaelic Scoti were united under Kenneth MacAlpin, considered the first king of Scots, who died in 858. But when the succession of his dynasty fell into question and Edward I of England was invited to arbitrate, he claimed suzerainty, invaded in 1296 and earned himself the nickname "Hammer of the Scots". The Wars of Scottish Independence lasted until 1357, though Robert the Bruce had effectively established independence by defeating the English forces at Bannockburn in 1314. The 1502 Treaty of Perpetual Peace, signed by Scotland's James IV and England's Henry VII, sought to put an end to the intermittent Anglo-Scottish wars. It agreed on the marriage of Henry's daughter Margaret to James. A century later in 1603 in the Union of the Crowns their great-grandson, King James VI of Scotland, inherited the English throne from the childless Queen Elizabeth I. Sixteen years earlier, Elizabeth had had James' Catholic mother Mary, Queen of Scots, executed for treason, fearing she could become a magnet for dissent. The two countries remained separate states for more than a century until Scotland was crippled by a disastrous 1698 attempt to establish a colony in Panama, all but ruining the nation. An English financial rescue deal helped unite the two kingdoms into Great Britain. However, London political parties' failure to address Scotland's problems revived the issue of independence in the late 1960s. In 1967 the then marginal Scottish National Party (SNP) won a spectacular victory in a by-election in Hamilton, a town in central Scotland, with other wins following. IN 1979, a referendum on creating a devolved assembly in Scotland won a narrow majority but the UK government ruled the turnout was not high enough for it to pass into law. However, in a second referendum in 1997 after Labour prime minister Tony Blair came to power, 74.3 percent voted "yes". Two years later on May 12 Queen Elizabeth II officially opened the 129-strong devolved Scottish parliament, initially dominated by a coalition of the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties. But in 2007 the SNP won a majority and the charismatic Alex Salmond was named First Minister. With the parliament already having tax powers, he launched a campaign for a referendum on independence. In 2013 the nationalist-dominated Scottish government published a 649-page white paper pledging that an independent Scotland would keep the pound and British monarchy but establish its own defence force. On September 18, 2014, more than four million voters went to the polls in a hotly contested independence referendum. Scots voted to stay in the union by 55 percent to 45 percent. Salmond resigned and was replaced by Nicola Sturgeon. In the 2016 Brexit referendum 62 percent of Scots voted to stay in the EU while England and Wales chose to leave. Sturgeon argued that leaving Europe against its will had changed Scotland's constitutional situation. Before this week's vote Sturgeon said Britain's Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson would have no "moral justification" to prevent a second vote on independence if the SNP emerges on top in this weekend's elections. The SNP won a fourth consecutive term Saturday but appeared likely to fall short of an outright majority. bur/jmy/fg/am/cdw||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/scotlands-long-quest-for-independence/articleshow/82486427.cms||---
---||Goa||GFA secretary rejects protests, executive committee overrules||Panaji: Goa Football Association (GFA) president Churchill Alemao has come up with a detailed order explaining why the executive committee decided to agree with the protests lodged by Panjim Footballers and Youth Club, Manora against Sesa Football Academy. On April 13, Manora filed a protest against Sesa for fielding ineligible players. The club alleged that players who had tested positive for Covid-19 were registered for a match, without completing the mandatory 14-day quarantine. One of their players, who was among the Covid-19 positive cases, the club said, submitted a negative report which only mentioned his first name. On April 17, less than 48 hours after their clash against Sesa, Panjim Footballers also lodged a protest of their own. Both clubs were certain that, according to the rules, they would be awarded three points with a three-goal margin. However, they were shocked to receive a letter on April 19 that their protest was rejected. “I have to inform you that even though you have complied with Article 41 of the GFA Official Competition Rules, your protest does not stand due to non-compliance of Article 40. Hence your protest is null and void in terms of Article 42 and consequently it cannot be forwarded to the appropriate committee,” GFA general secretary Jovito Lopes said in a letter to Manora. In his letter, the GFA secretary – who has been barred from speaking to the media – did not say who took the decision to reject the protest. On April 22, when the GFA executive committee met at the Duler Football Stadium in Mapusa, Welvin Menezes, current member from Ilhas zone and former secretary, pointed out that Lopes was wrong with his interpretation of GFA competition rules. “Welvin Menezes pointed out that Article 40 (signing match report form by teams) was not applicable in these cases. After discussion and perusing the document concerning the GFA official competition rules, the members observed that the protests were lodged within 48 hours for ineligibility and addressed to general secretary, GFA, with protest fee of Rs 1000 each being paid in cash as per Article 41,” Alemao wrote in his order early this month. Article 40, Menezes pointed out, was only about signing referee’s match report and collecting the player cards, while Article 41 dealt with lodging of protest. According to Article 41, the protest should be lodged within 48 hours, accompanied by a protest fee, both of which were fulfilled by the protesting clubs. “The members observed and agreed that Article 40 was not applicable in both cases and that since the clubs had fulfilled the provisions of Article 41, it was within the powers of the executive committee to decide on the protests," said Alemao. The executive committee was left in no doubt that Sesa had fielded ineligible players, in contravention of Covid-19 protocols set by state government and GFA, besides violating Article 19-21 (fielding ineligible players). “Under Article 19, decision on ineligible players: protest lodged under Article 18 shall be decided by the executive committee. Such protest being upheld, all matches won or drawn by the guilty team when fielding the ineligible player(s) -- Omkar Shetgaonar in this case -- shall be declared lost by a score of 3-0,” said Alemao. Sesa were then stripped of six points, while Manora and Panjim were both awarded three points each. While Sesa may have been encouraged by the letter from the GFA secretary, the executive committee decided otherwise. “No protest can be deemed null and void by an individual. The executive committee is the only body to decide on it as per GFA rules,” said Menezes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfa-secretary-rejects-protests-executive-committee-overrules/articleshow/82488512.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Gurgaon||Haryana: 3.5 lakh doses to arrive, more slots likely this week||GURUGRAM: Finding a vaccination slot is likely to get easier for the 18+ population in Haryana this week after the state receives 3.5 lakh doses, the first tranche of its order of 66 lakh vaccine doses, from the manufacturers. Of these, 2.5 lakh will be Covishield vaccines that the Serum Institute will supply. The rest is Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. At present, the regional vaccination storage centre in Kurukshetra has around 5 lakh doses, received through the central pool. With the new supplies coming in, more slots are likely to become available on the Co-WIN portal but it may not renew the supply lines for private hospitals, which is needed for aggressively vaccinating the state’s population. The arrival of fresh stocks is also unlikely to result in any significant increase in session sites. At present, there are 60 session sites in Gurugram, all of which are at government facilities. According to health department officials, there are no plans to increase the number of session sites immediately. “We have already designated community health centres, primary health centres and polyclinics as session sites and till the time we start getting a steady supply of vaccines, we will not be increasing the number of session sites,” said an official. The daily vaccination target in Gurugram is around 10,000 (for both categories, 45+ and 18+) and the plan is to take this up to 15,000 over the next week. In the first eight days of this month, the daily average of vaccine shots given has been only 6,269. While the government had announced vaccination for the 18+ would start on May 1, due to the unavailability of vaccines, it began here on May 2. According to district immunisation officer Dr MP Singh, Gurugram currently has a stock of 15,000 doses and 32,000 more doses will be received from Kurukshetra on Sunday. “All these doses will be used in government facilities only and not in private hospitals. These doses will be used for both categories (18+ and 45+). The state government allots vaccines to each district according to population and requirement,” said Singh. Sources in the health department said private hospitals, which were earlier getting vaccines from the government, can now procure directly from the manufacturers. Three big hospital chains – Apollo, Fortis and Max – have been administering vaccines at some of their facilities in various cities for the 18+ population since May 1. At present, there are around 5 lakh vaccines at the storage facility in Kurukshetra that are being allotted to the district, based on demand. While Gurugram will get 32,000 doses on Sunday, Faridabad will get 30,000, Sonipat 18,000, Karnal 17,000 and Mewat 8,000. The Haryana government has placed an order for 66 lakh doses (40 lakh Covishield and 26 lakh Covaxin) with the manufacturers. So far, it has received 48 lakh doses from the central government. According to the state immunisation officer Dr Virender Ahlawat, the maximum demand for vaccines is in Gurugram, followed closely by Faridabad. “We have an adequate number of vaccines. In this second wave, all of Haryana has got affected and walk-in vaccines are not being allowed. Those above 45 years who are not being able to get their second dose at a private hospital can get it at any government facility,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/3-5l-doses-to-arrive-more-slots-likely-this-wk/articleshow/82488547.cms||Shahnawaz Alam

As per the new rules, Ghaziabad residents will be able to venture only for a few hours during the lockdown. Milk parlours will now remain open for three hours in the morning, from 7 am to 10 am, and for two hours in the evening, from 4 pm to 6 pm, officials said, adding that the grocery stores, fruits and vegetable shops will remain open for four hours only, from 7 am to 11 am. In Noida too, the district administration has directed grocery shops to remain open from 7 am to 11 am only. Meanwhile, the move has received a mixed response from resident and trader associations in Ghaziabad. “Earlier too, the administration had announced similar directions for the lockdown. In reality, grocery stores, vegetable and fruit shops in most parts of the city remain open throughout the day. There was no enforcement at all,” said Alok Kumar, an Indirapuram resident. He added, “We are not sure it the lockdown will be extended. In either case, the new timings will only work if it is enforced properly.” Anirudh Vasistha, a member of a traders’ body Vaishali Vypaar Mandal, said: “If the shops open for a fixed time, it will result in more people thronging to the markets. In such a case, maintaining Covid-appropriate behaviour will be tough.” He added, “As of now, most of these shops remain open all through the day. From morning to evening, people can choose staggered timings to go to the markets.” Suresh Mahto, a vegetable vendor, said that the new timings will affect their business in more ways than one. “As a norm, we procure fresh vegetables from the mandi. We sell all through the day and visit mandis after three or four days. Now, with just four hours in the morning, it would be difficult to procure large quantities of fresh vegetables. In that stipulated time, we would not be able to sell it off,” said Mahto, adding that “due the prevailing situation, we will have to bear with the timings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/ghaziabad-limits-timings-of-fruit-and-vegetable-shops-to-4-hours/articleshow/82488551.cms||Abhijay Jha

Such children will be provided care on priority at a family-based care or child care institution and their status shared with a central control unit set up by the department. The decision was taken during a virtual meeting held in the presence of Delhi WCD minister Rajendra Pal Gautam. Recognising the vulnerability of children during Covid pandemic, especially those who have lost their parents or families, the task force has been formed. It has members from different agencies, including district WCD officers, district child protection officer, chairman of child welfare committee, sub-divisional magistrate (HQ) and a nominated member from the Delhi’s child rights panel. Gautam encouraged the task force to be alert all the time and work diligently to protect the interest of children and to bring them to safety net either through family-based care or in the child care institution. The newly constituted task force will set a good model of child care, especially in Covid management through testing, timely medical care and good nutrition for children, said the minister. During the meeting, WCD director Dr Rashmi Singh highlighted the efforts being made by the department in the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/task-force-in-each-district-to-protect-orphan-kids/articleshow/82488539.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: Those at home can get oxygen refilled via portal||NEW DELHI: Indicating that the supply of medical oxygen was getting streamlined in Delhi, the number of distress calls from hospitals has reduced from 49 on May 4 to 10 on May 7. Seven PSA oxygen plants commissioned through donations and four at DDU, Lok Nayak, Ambedkar and Burari hospitals with the central government assistance have also helped. In the plan are 40 more PSA plants. Delhi government has permitted Covid patients isolating at home to book refilling of oxygen cylinders online at https://oxygen.jantasamvad.org. The website provides only the address of the oxygen refillers at the moment, but soon will be upgraded to fix appointments with refill stations. Over 1,100 oxygen cylinders were distributed on May 7 for the home isolation patients needing oxygen support. Delhi is ramping up the capacity for transportation of liquid medical oxygen to the capital. The supply chain of oxygen has become more efficient with the railways coming in the picture. All the district magistrates are tracking each and every refill station and making sure that the oxygen reaches the destination it is earmarked for. A team of officers is working 24x7 monitoring the status of demand and supply of the gas in the city. Real time monitoring of oxygen tankers is also being undertaken by a special team formed by the state government to get past the challenges and obstacles in the supply chain management of oxygen, the government said in a statement. Ashish Kundra, principal secretary (transport) and OSD, health department, delineated in a Zoom meeting the steps the government has taken to improve the situation, including deputing a team of officials to each of the oxygen plant locations, to make sure that there were no setbacks or administrative obstacles in the movement of oxygen to Delhi. Kundra said that around 29% of the oxygen is being brought to the city by train, the rest through roadways. An average of 507.5 metric tonnes of oxygen is being supplied to Delhi on a daily basis. Another official said that the central government hospitals consumed around 9.4% of the allocated oxygen, Delhi government hospitals 20.2% and private hospitals 50.2%. The remaining 15.7% was reserved for the emergency distress management. 3.03% of the allotment was given to the districts for the use of individual citizens. “A fair distribution and allocation strategy is being prepared for the optimal utilisation of the given oxygen. GPS tracking system is helping to monitor the real time locations of the tankers, ensuring seamless supply of oxygen to Delhi,” claimed an official. A network team has been formed to give real time information from different parts of the country on the oxygen management system. The DMs are tracking the movement of oxygen and ensuring that the gas reaches the earmarked hospitals and institutions on time. To mitigate the hardship created by the Covid wave and economic lockdown, the government has opened 174 hunger relief centres across the city. Through these centres, close to nine lakh meals have been distributed to the needy in the last one week. Meanwhile, Niti Aayog is the body that will supervise the total number of donations of oxygen cylinders to Delhi.

If required, a team will reach the hospital and provide assistance if any developer or labourer is admitted.  The developers have also taken up the task to get their labourers vaccinated. Rajasthan Credai chairman Gopal Prasad Gupta said, “The move will not stop migration, but will develop trust among labourers that they are safe at the sites. The inauguration of these concentrators was done by the urban development and housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal.” Recently, developers in the state had requested the UDH department to open shops of construction materials. They claimed even though the government had allowed labourers to work on site, construction was happening at snail’s pace in the absence of materials. Following this, the decision was taken by the government. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/developers-to-give-o2-vax-aid-to-workers/articleshow/82488581.cms||---

RWAs of Grand Arch, Skyon, Uptown and Victory Valley have joined hands to set up the 10-bed facility in Sector 60 for the residents of the condominiums as well as their domestic staff. The facility will help patients who are pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic or in urgent need of medical attention. There are about 2,500 families residing in these four condominiums and over 2,000 domestic staff work here. Pranav Kumar, president of Uptown Condominium Owners’ Welfare Association, said, “We have started the 10-bed facility at a nursery school. There will be nursing staff and a panel of doctors who will be available for the tele-consultation. If required, they will visit the facility. Also if the need arises, we will also increase the bed capacity. This is a transit facility for the emergency cases till the time the patient gets a hospital bed.” The facility is equipped with oxygen cylinders and concentrators, PPE kits, oximeters, basic medicines, and an ambulance service, the RWAs say. Rahul Dahiya, general secretary of Skyon Condominium Owners’ Welfare Association, said, “The current healthcare infrastructure in the city is completely overwhelmed and is not sufficient to meet the demand. We have a large number of residents in these four condominiums, along with our staff members, and considering their healthcare needs, we have pooled in resources together and set up this facility.” “Though we have already started a round-the-clock ambulance service and arranged few oxygen concentrators for the residents at Skyon, which has helped us tackle five to six Covid cases, we decided to make a collective effort so that our residents can take advantage of the infrastructure and resources at our disposal,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/rwas-of-citys-4-big-condos-set-up-covid-care-facility/articleshow/82488596.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Delhi||SC appoints panel to audit oxygen utilisation in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Brushing aside strong opposition from the AAP government, the Supreme Court on Saturday set up a panel comprising AIIMS director Randeep Guleria, Max Hospital’s Sandeep Budhiraja and an IAS officer each from the Centre and Delhi government to carry out an audit of supply, distribution and utilisation of oxygen supply in the national capital. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta had stressed that Delhi’s demand of 700MT liquor medical oxygen (LMO) was way beyond its requirement, which could be met with 500-600 MT. He had told the court that there must be an audit to examine whether there were any snags and pilferages in distribution of oxygen to hospitals in Delhi. Representing Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra had stoutly opposed oxygen utilisation audit for Delhi saying it would distract the attention of healthcare professionals at this crucial juncture and accused the Centre of indulging in witch-hunt against the AAP government at this pitiable juncture when lack of oxygen supply by the Centre was endangering the lives of thousands of Covid patients. He had sought an audit of oxygen allocation, actual supply and transportation, all done by the Centre. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah accepted the SG’s suggestion for setting up a National Task Force (NTF), which will provide mechanism and methodology for a transparent and need-based allocation of oxygen and take a futuristic approach to deal with the challenges to health infrastructure posed by the pandemic. The bench tasked the NTF to facilitate audits by sub-groups within each state and UT for determining — “whether the supplies allocated by the Centre reached the state/UT concerned; the efficacy of the networks in distributing supplies meant for hospitals, healthcare institutions and others; whether available stocks are being distributed on the basis of an effective, transparent and professional mechanism; and accountability in regard to the utilisation of the supplies of oxygen allocated to each state/UT”. The bench clarified that the purpose of the audit is not to harass doctors who in good faith prescribed higher oxygen limits for gasping Covid patients. “We emphasise that the purpose of conducting audits is to ensure accountability in respect of the supplies of oxygen provided to every state/UT. The purpose is to ensure that the supplies which have been allocated are reaching their destination; that they are being made available through the distribution network to the hospitals or, as the case may be, the end users efficiently and on a transparent basis; and to identify bottlenecks or issues in regard to the utilisation of oxygen,” it said. The solicitor general had submitted that many of the demands by states and UTs, including Delhi government, for the provision of medical oxygen were unrealistic, because of which the Centre had to make an assessment by devising an allocation formula. He had said that the problem of shortage in the national capital is due to a systemic failure and to ensure proper distribution of oxygen and streamline the process of distribution and optimum utilisation of the supply, an oxygen audit was necessary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-appoints-panel-to-audit-oxygen-utilisation-in-delhi/articleshow/82488604.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh said there was no international conspiracy in these sacrilege cases which required a special investigation team (SIT). “There have been a series of incidents of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib following which the Kotkapura police firing incident took place for which a magisterial or judicial inquiry should have sufficed, but the chief minister is bent upon not letting justice come about,” said Chugh. By entrusting the probe about the police action in 2015 to the senior police officers, how can one expect justice for all those whose religious sentiments had been hurt, he asked. The BJP functionary also questioned the propriety of forming yet another police SIT to investigate the Kotkapura police firing incident after the earlier SIT report was turned down by the Punjab and Haryana high court. Chugh alleged that the new SIT was formed to put the entire matter in cold storage and let culprits go scot-free. He claimed the chief minister was just whiling away time with the formation of SITs and giving culprits a long rope. The chief minister should be held accountable for the failure of the first SIT to deliver after wasting lakhs of rupees from the state exchequer in courts, said Chugh. “Amarinder seems to be fooling people by leaving the investigation to the SIT,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-fooling-people-with-sacrilege-sits/articleshow/82488618.cms||---

Gautam reviewed the facilities at the centre, including food, healthcare and sanitation and also interacted with the residents to get their feedback on the facilities and asked for their concerns. “All the senior citizens are being provided nutritious food and all kinds of medical facilities. The elderly residents informed me that they get food, milk, food, fruits on time and all their facilities are being taken care of,” Gautam said. There are 57 senior citizens currently living at the old age home, of whom 45 are women and 12 men.

It provided a platform for several voluntary groups to discuss ways to provide help to the last man standing in the state. The event saw volunteers, especially college students, sharing their experiences and ideas to fight disinformation and dispel the myths around vaccines. Sudarshna Bhati, based in Jodhpur, who is a volunteer at Covidsupportrajasthan, shared that the pandemic has further widened the gap between haves and have-nots. "Every city has several areas with no access to medicines, forget medical care and vaccination. These areas should be listed with the local administration and volunteers to make them a part of the vaccination drive and give them equal right to live," said Bhati. "Young volunteers from across the state are playing a key role in arranging medicines, beds and oxygen for patients. Additionally, they are trying to bust fake news using the power of social media. The aim of such an initiative is to bring the youth groups and volunteers on a common platform to serve the society in a more constructive manner in the pandemic," said Ankush Singh, communication specialist, UNICEF. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/unicef-holds-tweet-chat-for-young-volunteers/articleshow/82488623.cms||---

TOI also called the landline number which was answered promptly by the staff. The department officials said at present they were only warning the ambulance providers in case of complaints and would take action only in extreme cases. Transport commissioner Mahendra Soni said usual action which can be taken against other vehicles is not applicable for ambulances. “We are not going to be trigger-happy in taking action against the ambulance providers and will mostly resolve the issues by explaining to them, but in extreme cases we can suspend the licence of the drivers.” An aggrieved person can call on 0141-2708318 in case the ambulance provider charges more than the fixed fare, refuses to ply the patient or body, charges extra for night transportation, etc. At present, there are 1,600 registered ambulances in the state though there is no data with the department as to how many of them are functional. When the control room receives the call, they get in touch with the flying squad and send them the location of the caller following which the team reaches the spot. For the control room to be operational 24/7, the designated officials work in three shifts of eight hours each. When they receive a call from outside Jaipur, they convey the complaint to the district transport office concerned in other districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/24x7-control-room-for-complaints-on-ambulance-charges-becomes-functional/articleshow/82488626.cms||---

It comes amid a feeling among a section of Congressmen that the SIT should be made to expedite its probe so that there is some “visible action” ahead of the next assembly elections. Sidhu tweeted, “Sad!! Due to incompetence of Home Minister, Govt is forced to accept orders of the High Court, which the People of Punjab are standing up against. Giving six months to New SIT, extends the delay of Govt’s biggest poll promise, unfortunately up-to next elections code of conduct.” Capt Amarinder holds home department portfolio. Sad !!

After Multiple Inquiry Commissions, SITs and passage of six years, evidence has weakened while accused have gained in wisdom, making their defence stronger due to repetitive investigations on the same matter.” This comes a day after the Punjab government on Friday constituted a new three-member SIT, comprising of senior IPS officers, and directed it to complete the investigations into the Kotkapura firing incident, preferably in six months, as per the court’s orders. As per the orders issued by the home department, the SIT would ensure “meticulous compliance of the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court stipulating that there would be no interference from any quarter; internal or external, in the investigations”. Sources said a section of MLAs and cabinet ministers want that a shorter deadline should be given to the SIT so that it the charge of delay or soft paddling in the case is countered. However, the order for the SIT says it should complete the probe “preferably in six months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/6-months-to-sit-will-delay-poll-promise/articleshow/82488627.cms||---

Police have cited security as the reason for his shifting. “There were consistent attempts by devotees of Asaram to sneak into the hospital to get a glimpse of him or get close to him since his admission in MG Hospital. Considering his security, we shifted him to AIIMS where it will not be possible for devotees to get around,” said a police official. Asaram and his devotees had constantly been demanding admission in AIIMS, but doctors at MG Hospital said there was no such need. According to doctors of MG Hospital, his oxygen saturation was under control and there was no other issue. “He was being taken care of properly here and he was just on oxygen in the ICU with no any immediate risk to his health,” said a doctor. Asaram had tested Covid positive during examination in jail along with some other inmates. Doctors of jail had been taking care of him until he complained of breathing problems on Wednesday night when he was taken to MG Hospital despite his insistence to take him to AIIMS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/asaram-shifted-to-aiims-jodhpur-police-cite-security-as-the-reason/articleshow/82488629.cms||---

The stocks were, however, lower than the full storage capacity of these hospitals, but the Centre said it is scrambling to ship oxygen to the capital and has had to reallocate supplies. Amid more gas getting earmarked for Delhi, other states such as Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh are complaining that they have inadequate supply, sources said. The data analysed by the Centre was for the period from May 5 evening to Saturday morning and came at a time when it argued in the Supreme Court that Mumbai had managed to deal with Covid-19 patients with lower supply. While Delhi government has been demanding 700MT oxygen, and the Supreme Court has also backed the plea, the Kejriwal administration has claimed that supplies are not near the promised level. Over the last few days, supply to the capital has, however, increased. According to data analysed by the Centre, the 60-odd hospitals saw stocks rise from around 220 metric tonnes on Thursday morning, to around 328MT on Saturday morning. On Wednesday evening, stocks were to the tune of 267MT. The average daily consumption of these hospitals added up to around 287MT, while their storage capacity was 522MT. In addition, the 11 refillers had stock of around 117MT on Saturday morning, almost 60% higher than the level on Wednesday evening. The refillers have a storage capacity of 187MT. Among the hospitals studied by the Centre, on Saturday morning, those run by the government, such as AIIMS, Safdarjung and Lok Nayak Hospital had nearly 1.5 times their average daily consumption. At the same time, there were others such as ESI Hospital in Rohini, Brahm Shakti and Tirath Ram Shah, which had negligible stocks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/60-hosps-11-refillers-had-enough-o2-in-last-few-days/articleshow/82488632.cms||---
---||Nagpur||HC stops BIS from action against jewellers for hallmarking breach||Nagpur: Coming to the rescue of jewellers across the country, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court restrained the government of India’s Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) from taking any coercive action for violation of mandatory hallmarking that would be coming to effect from next month. The petitioners — All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council (GJC), the industry’s apex domestic council that ensures promotion, protection and progress of jewellers — were apprehending a penal action from the authorities under Section 29 (2) of the BIS Act, once hallmarking becomes compulsory. While adjourning the hearing till June 14, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote issued notices to the central government and BIS asking them to reply before the next date. Assistant solicitor general of India (ASGI) Ulhas Aurangabadkar and lawyer Mughdha Chandurkar waived off notices for both respondents. The new regulations make it mandatory for the jewellers to hallmark gold ornaments before it was sold from June 1. In case of violation, the violators could face one year behind bars as per Section 29 of the BIS Act. The petitioners contended that these new rules are impractical and would lead to several hardships to over five lakh jewellers across the country. According to them, it would also lead to stalling the sale of over six crore gold ornaments that were not hallmarked and they would be unnecessarily subjected to criminal prosecution if they failed to act. The rules would further result in several other problems like hallmarking old jewellery deposited as surety with the jewellers. While demanding a stay on the BIS’ rules, the petitioners pointed out that present dispensation is inadequate and would spell a doom for traditional jewellery shops across the nation. The GJC added that only 34% avail the hallmarking facility while 488 districts in India don’t have centres for utilizing it. With strict restrictions in place due to Covid-19 pandemic, it would be impossible for them to get each and every gold ornament hallmarked before selling it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-stops-bis-from-action-against-jewellers-for-hallmarking-breach/articleshow/82488633.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The move comes a day after the state government announced it would provide a door-to-door oxygen cylinder refill facility. Covid-19 patients in home isolation in the city can apply online to get doorstep delivery of refilled oxygen cylinders from Sunday. Gurgaon has 38,330 active cases at present, of whom 35,822 are in home isolation. “An area will be identified for oxygen refilling in Gurgaon and we are also planning to set up an oxygen cylinder bank for those who don’t have cylinders. Moreover, the facility of applying online to get oxygen cylinders delivered at home will help patients in home isolation, besides putting an end to the black-marketing of oxygen cylinders. It will also reduce the burden on hospitals and will make oxygen beds in hospitals available for critical patients,” said deputy commissioner Dr Yash Garg. The doorstep delivery of the refilled oxygen cylinders will be facilitated by NGOs and Red Cross Society. MCG additional commissioner Surender Singh convened a meeting with the NGOs, organisations willing to volunteer for the initiative and other MCG officials on Saturday. He said that the MCG teams and volunteers of NGOs will provide doorstep delivery to the applicants. The corporation has assigned duties to MCG employees, who will work from 8am to 11pm to ensure doorstep delivery of oxygen cylinders in exchange for an empty cylinder. “We have appointed three supervisory officers, who will submit daily reports on the applications and oxygen cylinders provided to patients in home isolation,” added Singh. Residents have welcomed the move. “I have been struggling to arrange oxygen cylinders for my friends and family members who have tested positive for Covid-19. I had no option but to take a friend to a hospital in Palwal for oxygen support. I have made calls for hours to arrange cylinders. The facility of doorstep delivery, if it functions properly, will definitely help patients in home isolation and their attendants too,” said Tanya Anand, a resident of Sector 43. Applicants will have to register on the website http://oxygenhry.in and submit their Aadhaar card details, along with a photo of the oximeter reading determining their oxygen requirement or a doctor’s prescription. Moreover, other details like the patient's name and age should also be mentioned in the application. An applicant can apply only once a day using one mobile number. Once the applicant submits the application, it will be reflected online to the NGOs involved, as well as Red Cross Society. The acceptance of the application will be informed to the applicant through an SMS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/for-home-delivery-of-o2-refills-city-to-get-empty-cylinder-bank/articleshow/82488645.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

At least seven oxygen generating plants will be set up in the district by Ghaziabad-based industries from funds earmarked for corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, officials said on Saturday. Of the seven, four plants will be set up at MMG hospital and the remaining three at Dasna, Loni and Muradnagar community health centres, respectively. “The state government appointed nodal officer for the district, Senthil Pandian, held a meeting with industry bigwigs in the city on Friday, who assured him of setting up at least seven oxygen plants in the district under CSR initiatives,” said RK Gupta, deputy chief medical officer of Ghaziabad. “As per initial discussions, the plants at MMG hospital will have a capacity to generate 400 litres of oxygen per minute (LPM), enough to meet the demands of about 50 patients in one go. These plants will make government hospitals and the city oxygen sufficient and will help us tide over the ongoing crisis,” he added. Earlier BEL had also announced that it would set up an oxygen plant at District Combined Hospital as a part of its CSR initiatives. State health minister Atul Garg had also donated Rs 50 lakh for setting up an oxygen plant at MMG District Hospital.

Under the initiative, panellist doctors will guide people on medication and treatment over the phone. If resources permit, we will extend it to other locations like Pench and Kanha too,” said Sarosh Lodhi, founder-member of CLaW. Lodhi said the biggest challenge will be to raise awareness and convince rural folks to be part of the consultation. “We have urged our members to play this part by sharing banners with their friends, guides, drivers in villages and convince people for early treatment. The TATR management has also extended support to the project,” he said. TOI recently reported how people are reluctant to get vaccinated in the Tadoba landscape and even for RT-PCR tests in case of symptoms. Many are not wearing face mask and also not following Covid distancing. Healthcare facilities in rural areas have crumbled and there is shortage of nursing staff, medicines and equipment. Dr Tushar Chopawar, who is an MD and will help people through teleconsultation about Covid-19 treatment, said there is lack of awareness about the virus in rural parts. “This is leading to increasing cases in these areas. Most people confuse the virus with a common cough and cold. This is true in Tadoba landscape too,” said Dr Chopawar. “As 85-90% people develop only mild symptoms, early detection is very crucial as it helps in starting appropriate treatment at right time. Monitoring and systematic treatment approach can prevent its progression and also break the chain of transmission,” he said. “This campaign will help create awareness and guide people to overcome the infection through teleconsultation. There are still many myths about Covid-19 among people. Guides and drivers play a crucial role in tourism. All of them should be tested for the virus and also get vaccinated,” said Lodhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/claw-takes-covid-teleconsultation-to-tadoba-landscape/articleshow/82488661.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Jaipur||RERA provides relaxations in registering sale agreements||JAIPUR: The Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), Rajasthan has provided relaxations to execute registration of agreement sale till March 2022 which is likely to benefit both the promoters and the buyers. After RERA was set up in the state, the regulator directed the builders to follow the new agreement to sale format in registration of documents with the allottees. An official informed, Sec 13(1) of RERA Act 2016 states that a promoter shall not accept a sum more than 10% of the cost of the apartment as an advance payment or an application fee from a person without first entering into written agreement for sale and register it with sub- registrar. The order dated May 6 reads, in view of the corona pandemic (May 15, 2020) it was ordered that once an agreement for sale is executed on a stamp paper of appropriate value between promoter and the allottee, pending registration of the agreement should be registered preferable in four months or within eight months of execution. “Now, in view of the second wave of Corona pandemic, the order dated May 15 2020, shall continue to be in force till March 31, 2022.” The RERA has also allowed the allottees to deposit the instalments. Moreover, it has directed the banks to release the loan amount. The order further reads, “Accordingly, the allottes are allowed to deposit instalments and the banks /financiers of the allottess are allowed to sanction housing loan for the sold unit and disburse the due amount on the basis such executed agreement for the sale. However, after the registration of such agreement within the time stipulated under the Registration act 1908 the registered document should be deposited with concerned bank,” reads order. These directions would apply on only such units which do not involve transfer of possession of sold units. An official informed, the registration of agreements of sale is an important document as it reduces many litigations. “Earlier many unscrupulous property owners enter into agreements of sale and take huge earnest money and advance, and then sell the property to others, thereby plunging the original agreement holder and the subsequent purchaser into litigation. After RERA came into force these things gradually ended.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rera-provides-relaxations-in-registering-sale-agreements/articleshow/82488613.cms||---

On Saturday, we attended to 50 patients,” he added. The gurdwaras are getting cylinders from all over the country, including from BHEL in Haridwar. “On an average, our volunteers are bringing in 50 cylinders a day to the two gurdwaras while oxygen concentrators are being gifted to us by our patrons from across the globe,” said Khurana. Nitish Sherawat, a patient who availed the service at Hapur Mode Gurdwara, said, “My oxygen level had dipped considerably and finding no other place to go, I went to the gurdwara, where I was given a bed and paramedical staff looked after me. I stayed there for five hours, they didn’t charge a penny from us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/after-indirapuram-ghaziabad-gets-its-2nd-o2-langar-with-10-beds/articleshow/82488684.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Young citizens turn guardian angels to serve humanity in testing times||LUCKNOW: A few weeks ago, Nabeel Ahmad (25), a research assistant at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), was given a leave of one month by his professor following an untimely death of Ahmad’s relative due to Covid-19. Because of the trauma he underwent due to the death, he couldn’t complete his research work on time. Experiencing a tough phase himself, Ahmad, a resident of Lucknow, thought of running an initiative for other students who have lost their loved ones or are not able to complete their projects and assignments during these difficult times. On Wednesday, he posted a message on his Instagram handle: “Since we are heading towards a total/partial lockdown, it is getting difficult for students to handle assignments/viva/exams especially when most of us are grieving the unprecedented loss or going through some mental/physical hardship...Hence, I am lending a helping hand. DM me if you or any of your friends need some help or guidance regarding assignments, bibliography, editing, proofreading, etc. I will be more than happy to help (sic).” “Till now, I have received two assignments and a request to write an SOP document. Students are worried because teachers in their respective colleges are not coordinating and asking them to meet the deadline. I am trying to assist them in the best possible way I can in providing the right material,” he added. With the second wave of coronavirus pandemic hitting the country, besides doctors and healthline workers, ordinary citizens like Nabeel are being regarded as heroes as they are coming forward to volunteer in different ways possible to assist Covid-affected families. From raising awareness through social media to arranging ambulances and hospital beds overnight, moving out of comforts of their home to arrange oxygen cylinders, many residents are serving humanity. Vasu Gupta, a 28-year-old former restaurateur, recently joined his father-in-law’s 60-year-old medical and surgical equipment business. He has been helping needy through a network of people by providing medicines, oxygen cylinders and refills as well as contacts of plasma donors. He also helps people via video calls on how to use oxygen cylinders. “Recently, I received a call from a girl at 2am crying that her parents are not able to set up the cylinder and are unable to breathe. I took them on video call and helped them fix it,” said Gupta, who has received over 5,000 calls so far from people asking him to help. Similarly, Chahat Malhotra has started a free cab service through her NGO. The service can be availed by anyone in need of a vehicle during emergency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/young-citizens-turn-guardian-angels-to-serve-humanity-in-testing-times/articleshow/82488678.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Kolkata||Most violence clips on social media are fake, says Mamata||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday urged BJP to “accept defeat gracefully” and said the clips of Bengal violence doing the rounds on social media were “99% fake”. Any attempt to foment unrest will not be tolerated, she asserted. “BJP is unable to accept people’s verdict,” the CM said in her first remarks to the new assembly on Saturday. “I don’t like violence. I am always for peace. Please accept this defeat gracefully. 99% (of what is in circulation) is fake news. Yesterday, someone sent me a message that a girl was being tortured. I immediately sent the police. This cannot be accepted. Someone may have some political belief, but she (the girl) must not bear the brunt for that. When police asked her she said nothing of that sort had happened. There was a minor altercation over felling of a tree. I called back the person to ask why he had sent me such unverified lies,” Banerjee said. The CM, iterating that attempts were being made to fan communal riots, said: “Some people are trying to cause trouble. They want to engineer a riot. No one who tries to foment violence will be spared, this will not be tolerated. I urge every one of you to be alert. If you find any trouble-monger, lodge an FIR. Police will take appropriate action. Their only campaign is to cause communal tension. They don’t have any other ideology.” Bengal is for everyone, for Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and Buddhists, and “we have been living here peacefully together for hundred years”, she said. “Whether it is me or you, if anyone indulges in fomenting communal tension, police will not spare anyone. There must be action.” Urging party workers to be “humble”, Banerjee said, “I will tell everybody that after this historic victory, we have to be humble. We will do more work for people with all our heart and soul. But for the time being, it is important to stay with people in this Covid situation. Ensure that none in your constituency goes untreated.” Taking a dig at BJP MLAs for boycotting the election of the assembly speaker, the CM said: “Most of them have won due to benevolence of the Election Commission. Those who boycotted the assembly today have been boycotted by people. Had the EC not been there, they would not even have won 30 seats (in Bengal).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/most-violence-clips-on-social-media-are-fake-says-mamata/articleshow/82488691.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Chandigarh||BJP seeks minister’s exit over panel indicting him||Chandigarh: BJP national spokesperson and former IPS officer Iqbal Singh Lalpura has said Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi had no moral and ethical grounds to continue as a cabinet minister in the Punjab government after he had been indicted of fraud against the state government by taking double relief for land compensation. The BJP leader said chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had not yet dismissed Sodhi or asked for his resignation. He added the Supreme Court had issued a notice to Sodhi and family members for taking Rs 1.8 crore compensation for land acquisition for which the owners had already been paid in 1962. “This is absolute fraud played by Sodhi, who, as a minister, has used his influence on revenue officers and PWD to fudge documents. He demanded Sodhi’s immediate dismissal from the cabinet. “The chief minister has taken a serious dent in his moral obligations under the Constitution for not protecting the state while giving patronage to a cabinet minister,” said Lalpura, adding that Sodhi should have been sacked. Demanding registration of a case under the appropriate sections of law against Sodhi, Lalpura said it was a point of nadir in the state politics where the CM had chosen not to take action against the erring minister. A sub-committee constituted by Punjab government indicted Sodhi’s family for pocketing double compensation against a piece of land acquired by the state government for a road project. The family received ₹1.83 crore compensation in 2013 for the land after re-acquisition in 2012, which, as per records, was also acquired in 1962 and a sum of ₹7,384 paid. The said land at Mohanki Attar village had been acquired for the Ferozepur-Fazilka-Gurharsahai road. The land — 55 kanal and 6 marla of Rana Sodhi and 38 kanal of his nephew Jasdeep Sodhi (son of Hardeep Singh) — was re-acquired by the Punjab government and compensation was paid after the owners approached the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-seeks-ministers-exit-over-panel-indicting-him/articleshow/82488693.cms||---
---||Nagpur||600-bed jumbo Covid hosp to start before 3rd wave in June-July: Raut||Nagpur: Guardian minister Nitin Raut on Saturday directed officials not to relax with the decline in Covid-19 cases in the district and to start a 600-bed jumbo Covid hospital along with 25 oxygen plants and 10 cryogenic oxygen plants as soon as possible as part of the preparations for the third wave. Meanwhile, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B announced that the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will start three drive-in vaccination centres in the city soon. “According to epidemiologists and experts, the district is expected to witness the third wave. Therefore, we have decided to start a 600-bed jumbo Covid hospital at the Mankapur divisional sports complex in June or July. The state government approved the plan a day ago,” Raut told TOI after a review meeting. Talking about drive-in vaccination, Radhakrishnan said, “NMC will start three drive-in vaccination centres in the basement parking of Bhat auditorium, VR Mall (formerly Trillium) and Central Mall on Monday or Tuesday subject to the availability of doses. It will be for those above 60 and only with online appointment. Zones have been directed to identify more centres. We will also explore the possibilities of setting up centres in big playgrounds.” The civic body’s latest plan, however, does not include the physically challenged. A couple of days ago, Raut had requested the government to allow drive-in vaccination centres in the city on the lines of Mumbai. Through a notification, the civic chief issued instructions to zones. “Centres should have single lane barricades for regulating entry and exit of vehicles. Adequate and temporary shelter should be provided at the centres along with facilities for adverse event following immunization (AEFI), ambulance, public toilets etc. A driver or attendant is a must with the beneficiary who will not be allowed to drive in and out,” stated Radhakrishnan. During the meeting, Raut directed commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar to ensure effective sealing of the district’s borders. “A couple of adjoining districts are again witnessing a rise in cases. The need of the hour is to maintain a strict vigil and effectively manage the e-pass system,” said Raut, who also directed the officials to chalk out a plan and create the necessary infrastructure for the paediatric population as part of the preparations for the third wave. “Expedite the process of procurement of 1,000 oxygen concentrators and increase the number of jumbo oxygen cylinders by 5,000. Work in all the proposed Covid hospitals should be completed as soon as possible. All major hospitals should be self-sufficient in terms of oxygen. Also, prepare a plan to reduce the burden on GMCH and IGGMCH. Covid hospitals at all tehsils should have all the facilities so that patients can get treatment immediately. There should be no shortage of beds, oxygen and medicines in the district before the third wave,” he said. A few days ago, health minister Rajesh Tope had stated the possibilities of a third wave in state citing reports of epidemiologists and experts. Raut also asked officials to prepare a list of doctors to treat patients who are in home isolation. “The government is likely to give permission in this regard very soon. These doctors will get compensation,” he said. Raut directed stringent action against doctors who are violating treatment protocols by giving more doses of Remdisivir and other medicines. “This has affected patients adversely. Also, stringent action should be taken against people engaging in black marketing of Remdisivir and bogus RT-PCR results,” he said. Radhakrishnan urged the CP not to discharge people who tested positive in the rapid antigen test (RAT) on roads during the special drive before 14 days. Raut requested people to celebrate Eid at home. “The NMC and police should ensure no crowding in markets,” he said. Collector Ravindra Thakre, CEO of ZP Yogesh Kumbhejkar and other officials have started visiting villages where the percentage of vaccination was less. “We have observed that villages where vaccination was low had high number of cases,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/600-bed-jumbo-covid-hosp-to-start-before-3rd-wave-in-june-july-raut/articleshow/82488695.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

As the head of the Covid intensive care unit (ICU) at the Lokmanya Hospital, he has been working tirelessly for nearly a year, living away from his family in a rented house so that he does not infect them. "I am constantly interacting with patients and their relatives at the hospital, so I cannot put my family at risk. Therefore, I decided to move out and stay in a rented place," said Dr Kate. His family comprises his two children, wife, parents and a brother, also a doctor. Since the Covid centre came up at the hospital, he has been seeing around 200 Covid patients daily. With the spike in infection, his workload has increased manifold. But he hardly gets a respite even after returning home from hospital late at night. Living alone, he has to take care of household chores, too. It was while washing clothes one day that he slipped and fractured his hand in the bathroom. But that did not stop him from going to the hospital. "I had plaster on my left hand for nearly six weeks, but I knew I had to keep doing my work. When there were around 150-200 patients in the hospital, I could not sit at home," said Dr Kate. “This is a very important phase and every medical professional needs to extend his/her services,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/doctor-works-non-stop-to-save-lives-amid-pandemic/articleshow/82488699.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: No vaccination in private hospitals for 8 days after norms tweak||LUCKNOW: Almost all the private hospitals empanelled for Covid-19 vaccination in the city have not been able to administer vaccine to beneficiaries for the last eight days due to procurement issues. As a result, many people who have taken their first dose in private hospitals are now flocking to government centres for the second shot of the two-dose course given 4-8 weeks apart. At least 74 private hospitals were shortlisted for the vaccination campaign. According to the private nursing home and hospital association, the health department, on April 30, ordered hospitals to return the leftover stock of vaccines given earlier and asked them to buy vaccines directly from manufacturers as per the new guidelines of the central government. District immunisation officer Dr MK Singh said, “After the policy change by the Government of India private hospitals will now buy vaccines directly from manufacturers. People who want to get the jab, including those whose second dose is due, can go to nearest government centres.” The secretary of Private Nursing Home Association, Dr Anoop Agrawal, said private centres were asked to hand over remaining stock given to them and get fresh consignment directly from manufacturers. “There were no further instructions, hence, we had to stop vaccination,” he added. According to an estimate, private centres administered nearly 25% of about five lakh doses that were given to healthcare and frontline workers as well as senior citizens and people in the age group of 45-59 years during the mass immunisation drive from January 16 to April 30. Now, with these hospitals out of the picture, the vaccination rate has gone down. “Earlier, private hospitals used to buy vaccines from the health department and charge Rs 250 per shot from beneficiaries. Now, they have to get vaccines directly frommanufacturers. Rates differ from one vaccine to another,” said a senior health officer. Sumit Srivastava of Aliganj said, “My mother had taken the first shot at a private hospital on Faizabad Road. When I called, the staff asked me to go to a government hospital. I am afraid of taking her to an overcrowded centre because of her old age and cancer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-vax-in-pvt-hosps-for-8-days-after-norms-tweak/articleshow/82488703.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Apart from contributing 108 doctors, 14 nursing officers and 205 paramedics in various hospitals set up by DRDO, the Western Command is setting up 100-bedded Covid hospitals at Chandigarh, Patiala and Faridabad, which will have the capacity to accommodate 100 mild to moderate symptomatic patients. The hospitals at Chandigarh, Patiala and Faridabad are likely to be inaugurated and opened up for the civil population on May 10. Sharing the details, a spokesperson of the Western Command said in the effort to support the civil administration, paramedics were being re-oriented towards Covid care. At present, 33 paramedics are deployed at Government Rajendra Hospital at Patiala, SVBP Hospital at Delhi and another 100 paramedics are to be deployed shortly at various locations. To tide over the shortage of oxygen in the region, a dedicated team of Army Electronics and Mechanical Engineers are working round the clock to resuscitate the oxygen plant under Bhakra Beas Management at Nangal. Lt Gen R P Singh, Army Commander, Western Command has assured the state administrations of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and UTs of Chandigarh and Jammu and Kashmir of full commitment from the Indian Army in these testing times. Last month, the Army Commander Lt Gen R P Singh had interacted with Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh through a virtual meeting in which he had assured the CM of all possible assistance within the institutional capacity of Western Command to help manage the crisis. Consequent to the virtual meeting with the chief minister of Punjab, requests were also received from other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/western-command-setting-up-3-covid-hospitals-in-region/articleshow/82488706.cms||---

Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, in his letter to the CM, stated that Bengal had been allocated 308 MT of oxygen from April 25 and out of 1,27,000 oxygen cylinders that the Centre would procure, 700 would go to Bengal this month. Majumdar said the Centre in consultation with the states had undertaken a “universal vaccination programme” for all 135 crore Indians. “The Centre, the state governments, NGOs and health workers should come forward to expedite the programme and tend to patients badly in need of oxygen support,” he said. The BJP leader pointed out that Bengal had already received 1.18 crore doses so far and more doses would be sent to the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-questions-bengals-daily-demand-for-550mt-oxygen/articleshow/82488707.cms||---
---||Pune||Experts stress on apt behaviour among kids to check Covid spread in families||Pune: As the Covid-19 cases rise among children during the current upsurge, medical experts have stressed on inculcating appropriate behaviour among the young ones to help them avoid becoming ‘superspreaders’. “Parents send their wards to their grandparents or some other family members when they (parents) fall ill. And the child goes on to spread the infection among the most vulnerable family members. This way, the child becomes a superspreader by moving base from one family to another. I have seen quite a few children who infected quite a few extended family members during the surge,” said Deenananth Mangeshkar hospital’s (DMH) paediatric intensivist Sumant Patil. DMH has treated about 1,000 children with Covid-19 in the last few months and 50% of these cases were reported in the last two months alone. “The good news is that the disease severity continues to be less among children,” Patil said. About 95% of 1,000 Covid infected children who sought treatment at DMH in the last few months recovered only with minor supportive medications, including anti-fever drugs and cough syrup. Less than 5% children required minimal oxygen support. “All the infected children recovered and there was no casualty at DMH be it this wave or the last,” he said. DMH had treated 597 children with Covid-19 during the first round of the pandemic between March and October last year. “We had only two paediatric cases with lung lesions — predominantly seen among adult patients — one each during the two waves. That shows that the severity has remained extremely minimal through the pandemic so far,” Patil said. Paediatrician Tushar Parikh of Motherhood Hospital in Kharadi said, “Infection among paediatric patients is certainly a distinctive feature of the second wave. Fortunately, there has not been much morbidity or mortality in paediatric age group so far.” The vaccination drive is currently underway but children can’t get the vaccine as it is not tested in their age group. “As we march through this pandemic further, more paediatric patients may turn Covid positive due to non-vaccination as only adults are vaccinated now,” Parikh said. Once the second wave subsides, there is a possibility of the third wave. “But it is likely to be milder than the second one,” Parikh added. GRAPHIC TEXT Teach children the importance of wearing masks, hand sanitization and social distance Don’t allow them to play with children from another family if someone at home has flu-like symptoms Provide them a well-balanced diet and keep them away from sick people Contact to the doctor if your child has symptoms like cough, cold, fever and vomiting THE NEED Children may remain asymptomatic and may become a source of the spread of the virus to the elderly and other family members Children are super-spreaders during this second wave Compared to last year, many paediatric patients contracted Covid in April 2021 CASELOAD AMONG KIDS BELOW 10 YRS March-December last year: 9,555 January - May 7: 10,610 (Sources: PMC’s health department & Motherhood Hospital, Kharadi)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-stress-on-apt-behaviour-among-kids-to-check-covid-spread-in-families/articleshow/82488710.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: At current rate, first dose for 18 plus may not be over before ‘3rd wave’||NAGPUR: The first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine for the above 18 category will not be complete by the projected third wave if the programme continues as per the current rate. There will be more delay if the city continues to witness interruptions in the programme which has happened in six out of the last eight days. Health minister Rajesh Tope has stated that there are chances of a third wave in the state in July-August. As per the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW), a sufficient number of protective antibodies is produced two weeks after the second dose. TOI had on Saturday reported that 37,745 (31.89%) out of the total 1,18,348 positive patients were below 30 in April of which 34 died. As per the data of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), 17 lakh are above the age of 18 in the city. The first dose of around 4.5 lakh people has been completed. Around 1.2 lakh people, including healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs), have taken the second dose. Thus, the first dose of around 12.5 lakh people is pending. When doses are available, the city vaccinates around 12,000 a day. At this rate, an additional 104 days will be needed to complete the first dose for the remaining eligible people. It means that even the first dose is not likely to be complete till August due to the current rate. “At present, NMC is equipped for inoculating 20,000 people per day. The target is to increase this to 40,000 per day. The availability of doses is an issue. We can complete at least the first dose for the remaining people in seven-eight weeks if doses are available in an uninterrupted manner,” municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI. Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals’ Association Dr Anup Marar said, “The government’s decision to vaccinate all above 18 years was much-needed. Even children need to be vaccinated. Unfortunately, lack of vaccines will derail the ongoing attempts to provide cover before the probable third wave. In the second wave, two doses of vaccines made a distinct difference for those above 60 years and even for the 45 plus. The second wave has shown that non-vaccinated persons below 45 are getting seriously affected by the disease. Vaccination is the only key to control it. However, if this trend of vaccine non-availability continues, we will have more persons below 18 years and even children being seriously affected as it is very difficult to inculcate self-discipline in them.” Vice-president of Maharashtra Medical Council Vinky Rughwani said, “Looking at the current rate of vaccination, people above 18 years will hardly get time to protect themselves in the third wave. Majority of them will remain unvaccinated if the third wave comes early, say in July or August. The government should expedite the process to approve more vaccines like Pfizer, Moderna etc. so that they can be imported as early as possible.” Vaccination for the 45 plus category was badly affected on Saturday due to shortage of doses. Out of the 90 centres, the NMC conducted inoculation at only seven. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said vaccination will resume at all centres on Sunday. The district received 29,000 doses of Covishield on Saturday. The civic body continued vaccination for the 18 plus age group at six centres on Saturday where 1,735 took the jab. From Sunday, there will be nine centres for this age group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/at-current-rate-first-dose-for-18-plus-may-not-be-over-before-3rd-wave/articleshow/82488720.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Of them, 72 have been held for heinous crimes like murder and arson. There have officially been 19 deaths related to political violence since the announcement of the poll results, of which three took place after the new government was sworn in, officers said. The police said that several steps had been taken to ensure peace, as a result of which there had been only one political clash in the state in the past 72 hours. The only incident of violence has been reported from Khayrasol in Birbhum. Another incident in Jambani was non-political, cops said. “We have initiated several peace measures. Several confidence-building exercises are currently underway across districts. Please des-ist from rumour-mongering and sharing unverified data and news,” said ADG (law and order) Jawed Shamim. Home department sources said necessary orders have been passed to all superintendents of police to ensure peace talks are held regularly and every displaced political worker can return home. Arrests have followed in all heinous crimes. Sources said special drives have been initiated in Cooch Behar, which has witnessed more violence than other places. In addition, SPs have been instructed to respond to individual calls for help, do area domination and involve community leaders to build confidence. Response time to an incident is also being closely monitored. CM Mamata Banerjee had earlier stated that 16 people of different political parties had lost their lives in clashes after the elections, when the administration was under the EC.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Olympian Ravinder Pal loses Covid battle||LUCKNOW: Known for his grit, quick passes and dribbling, veteran hockey player Ravinder Pal Singh, who helped Team India clinch a gold at Moscow Olympics in 1980, failed to dodge the deadly coronavirus and succumbed to infection on Saturday. Lovingly known as ‘Rabu’ in the team, he played on the field as centre half and was known for with speed and accuracy which ensured that a goal is executed with precision. Grappling with financial constraints, the 63-year-old player had tested positive for Covid-19 on April 12. When his condition did not improve, he was shifted to a hospital in Chowk on April 22 and then to another facility in Niralanagar on April 24. Two days later, he tested negative and was shifted to a non-Covid ICU but his condition remained critical. He was put on ventilator and breathed his last on Saturday morning. Ravinder Pal, who was unmarried, is survived by elder sister Saraswati Devi and elder brother Rajendra Pal Singh. His niece Pragya Yadav had been trying hard to garner support for his treatment. Soon after his demise, tributes started pouring in from all quarters. “He was the youngest in the Olympic team and closest to me. I still remember the composure he kept while playing a tough Spanish side in league matches when the opponents kept a check on Mohammed Shahid. Pal passed the ball swiftly and helped the team seal a draw,” recalled Vasudevan Baskaran, captain of the winning team. “He never kept a penny for himself and whatever he earned during his stint in the State Bank of India, he gave it to poor people,” said Baskaran. Zafar Iqbal, also a Padma Shri awardee, said: “He was very accurate and sharp with the passes and a good human being. He played every match with equal passion and was very jovial off the field.” Another junior teammate, Sujit Kumar, said Ravinder Pal Singh loved movies and music. Olympian Ashok Kumar Dhyanchand said Ravinder Pal’s death was a great loss of Indian hockey. “I remember when I decided to bid adieu to international hockey, many players, including Ravinder Pal, were getting ready to play for the Indian team and carry forward our legacy,” he added. “Though he is no longer with us, the memory of Moscow Olympics matches is still fresh in my mind,” he said. Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Olympic Association (UPOA) and Hockey UP also condoled the death of hockey veteran. Secretary general of UPOA Anandeshwar Pandey said Pal played an important role in Indian hockey and his death was a big loss to the sport. UPOA president Viraj Sagar Das termed it to be “an irreparable loss to the sporting world”. UP sports director RP Singh said Ravinder Pal was a role model for hockey players and was always ready to promote hockey. He also played in all major tournaments including Karachi Champions Trophy (1980 & 1983), Silver Jubilee 10-Nation Cup (Hong Kong, 1983), World Cup (Mumbai, 1982), Asia Cup (Karachi, 1982), the India-Pakistan Test series in 1981 and the Malaysian quadrangular series in 1980. He also played in 1979 Junior World Cup.

---||Delhi||Delhi’s green cover safe till dead trees keep pyres burning||NEW DELHI: With options for ‘deadwood’ trees drying up fast to carry out cremations in Delhi, the capital could significantly start losing tree cover over the coming weeks, with already permissions given to fell over 1,500 trees in the last one month. The forest department said permissions were being given separately in each division — north, south, west and central — with the municipal corporations identifying a list of suitable ‘dead’ trees, which could be used for cremation purposes. Officials in the department said that though they had requested for more timber from both Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, no timber is being sent at the moment, compounding Delhi’s problem further. TOI contacted forest officials in each division and found that the south division had given permission to fell over 400 ‘dangerous’ or ‘dead’ trees in the last one month, the north division and the west division had given a combined permission to fell over 1,000 trees, while over 400 trees have been felled in the central division, officials said. These permissions included pruning and felling. A senior north division official said the permissions given so far were for all ‘dead’ trees, with the list identified by North Delhi Municipal Corporation. A west division official, too, stated a list of trees had been sent to them by the municipal corporation, however, some trees had been identified by them, too. “So far, these trees will meet the demand for cremations, but we don’t know what after that. We may have to identify more trees in the future for felling,” said the west division official. A central division official said as compared to normal times, demand was currently up by around six to seven times. “Permissions to fell around 1,000 trees have been given collectively by the north and west divisions. These largely include trees in far off locations such as Mundka. Dead trees that have completely dried have largely been felled,” the official said, adding over 400 trees were being felled in central division. An official said each cremation required three-four quintals of wood. As per protocol, trees felled for any project or those naturally found to be uprooted are first inspected by the forest department before being transported to any crematorium in the capital. The official said that in normal circumstances, there had never been a shortage in the ‘regular’ supply of wood to crematoriums in Delhi. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash had last week written to the chief minister over shortage of wood to carry out cremations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/capitals-green-cover-safe-till-dead-trees-keep-pyres-burning/articleshow/82488739.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Thai woman on Lucknow visit dies of virus infection||LUCKNOW: A 41-year-old woman from Thailand, who was in India on a tourist visa, died of Covid-19 infection at a hospital here on May 3. After clearance from the Thai embassy in New Delhi, the woman’s body was cremated by Lucknow Police in the presence of her local acquaintance on May 5. The entire ritual was aired live for her family in Thailand. The woman, identified as Tiyathita, was undergoing treatment at Ram Manohar Lohia hospital in Lucknow. “Once the hospital authorities informed us about her death we contacted the Royal Thai embassy at New Delhi for further instructions. We were then informed by the embassy that we may go ahead with the last rites of Tiyathita in consultation with her Lucknow acquaintance named Salman, a resident of Wazirganj,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, east zone, Qasim Abidi, who is coordinating with the Thai embassy on behalf of the Lucknow Police. Abidi said during communication with the Thai embassy it was revealed that Tiyathita’s family knew about Salman and had asked the authorities to ensure that her last rites were performed in his presence. “Tiyathita’s family had also requested for live streaming of the cremation, which was done accordingly,” he said, adding that ashes of Tiyathita will be sent to Thai embassy from where they will be sent to her family in Thailand. Though the police were yet to establish the exact purpose of Tiyathita’s visit to India, investigations so far have revealed that she reached India in April. “On April 28, she flew down to Lucknow and got herself admitted to the hospital. Police were now planning to question Salman to decipher the exact reason behind her visit to Lucknow. TOI also contacted the Thai embassy for their comments. The officials said they were in touch with Tiyathita’s family and the Lucknow police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/thai-woman-on-lucknow-visit-dies-of-virus-infection/articleshow/82488742.cms||---

On Saturday morning, a few kilometres away, the house of a Trinamool-run Khayrasole panchayat samiti leader was allegedly ransacked by BJP supporters. Birbhum Police arrested 14 people in this connection. Trinamool men had come to Muktipur from neighbouring Amjole village on motorbikes to take part in a feast. BJP supporters, however, refused to accept this version. “Bike-borne Trinamool toughs have been hurling bombs in our village since the assembly poll results came out. They targeted our village because most of us had voted for BJP. Villagers put up a resistance last night,” said Muktipur villager and BJP supporter Nanni Bagdi. TMC supporter Kanta Bauri (26) was killed in the clash. On Saturday, BJP supporters ransacked the house of Khayrasole panchayat samiti swasthya karmadhyaksha Makhan Mukherjee. While Mukherjee was away during the attack, his wife and his daughter were in the house. Local Trinamool leaders alleged that BJP workers vandalised more houses of Trinamool supporters, adjacent to Mukherjee’s. Trinamool Birbhum vice-president Malay Mukherjee said BJP was creating unrest in Dubrajpur after winning the assembly seat. “BJP has targeted our leaders and workers. We have already reached out to the area and have appealed for peace. Our supporters assembled there for a feast and came under attack from BJP miscreants. The house of our Khayrasole leader was attacked. We have urged the police to restore peace,” he said. BJP Dubrajpur MLA Anup Saha said villagers had acted on their own. “BJP has no hand in the violence. I gathered from the locals that Trinamool miscreants had gathered at a feast last night with firearms and bombs. On getting the tip off, Muktipur villagers across party affiliations put up a resistance, three days after they witnessed the Trinamool terror,” Saha said. Birbhum SP Nagendra Tripathi told TOI that all the injured were rushed to hospital. “Forces have been deployed in the area. They are keeping a vigil to restore peace,” Tripathi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-supporter-killed-leaders-house-ransacked/articleshow/82488745.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Gurgaon||Covid-19: Positivity rate above 50% in 4 NCR districts around Delhi||GURUGRAM: Four Haryana-NCR districts around Delhi have shown a positivity rate of over 50% and three more over 40% in the first week of May, leading to fears of a surge in cases around the national capital, which is already reeling under the onslaught of the second wave of the pandemic. The most alarming numbers have come from Nuh (Mewat), the predominantly rural district to Gurugram’s south which has the highest positivity rate of 64.7%. It’s followed by Sonipat (57.6%), which is Delhi’s immediate neighbor, Bhiwani (54.1%) and Panipat (51.5%), Faridabad (44.5%), Rewari (42.6%) and Rohtak (42%). The numbers sent the Haryana government into a huddle on Saturday because the rural belts in Hisar, Rohtak and Bhiwani have also been reporting a spurt in deaths. After a meeting with senior officers chaired by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, the government decided to screen all 40 lakh households in more than 7,500 villages. Khattar directed the health authorities to constitute 8,000 teams — each comprising a health worker, an anganwadi worker and a final-year student MBBS or BAMS student drawn from medical colleges — to scan and test all households. Each team will be allotted 500 households. “We have to protect rural areas from this deadly infection at any cost. Every officer concerned should ensure special vigilance is kept on each village. A massive Covid-19 screening campaign should be conducted in all villages and each person should be scanned in the rural belt,” Khattar said. Testing numbers in many of these districts are extremely low — Nuh, for instance, is averaging around 1,200 tests a day and Panipat around 1,500. Even Faridabad, which is very much part of the Delhi urban grid, is conducting only 3,300 tests on an average daily. The highest number of tests is happening in Gurugram, which is averaging around 12,000 per day and yet continues to show a high positivity rate (36% in the first week of May). Other Haryana districts with positivity rates between 30% and 40% include Mahendergarh, Yamunanagar, Karnal, Jind, Hisar, Ambala, Panchkula, Charkhi Dadri and Jhajjar. A senior health department official said districts with high positivity rates were given revised testing targets so that infections could be detected early. The official admitted healthcare infrastructure in these areas cannot handle a surge in cases, which is why early detection and isolation needed to begin on a war footing. “The spread has to be checked if we are to stop more deaths,” the official said. Nuh’s chief medical officer Surender Yadav had a different explanation for the positivity rate in the district, pointing out that the overall active case numbers were low. Nuh’s active cases on Saturday were 723. However, this number has to be seen in the perspective of so few tests being done there. Many people who live in adjoining districts are coming to medical college in Nalhar for testing, which might be the reason for the positivity rate being so high,” said Yadav. The health teams that will fan out into villages have been instructed to put patients into three categories — mild, moderate and serious. Those with mild symptoms will be shifted to isolation homes set up in village dharamshalas and anganwadi centres or schools, while those with moderate symptoms will be put up in community health centres or schools by converting them into makeshift hospitals. Serious patients will be required to be immediately shifted to district hospitals or Covid care centres. Khattar told officials at the meeting in Chandigarh that a special awareness campaign-cum-counselling of people in villages should be conducted. He asked officers of the health department along with ASHA workers and former and current public representatives to encourage people to get themselves tested at camps that will be set up. “Strengthening of medical infrastructure along with ramping up Covid management preparations coupled with aggressive surveillance, stringent containment and focused clinical management should also be done in every village on a priority basis,” Khattar said. He directed panchayat development officers to ensure logistics support to screening teams on their travel and stay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/positivity-rate-above-50-in-4-ncr-districts-around-delhi/articleshow/82488749.cms||Shahnawaz Alam

---||Hyderabad||Dose shortage in Telangana, CoWin glitches leave many frustrated||HYDERABAD: Confusion prevailed at several government-run vaccination centres following the roll-out of second doses. Many had to wait for around four to five hours only to be turned away as vaccine doses ran out. In some cases, after waiting for hours and getting their turn, many were told that their data was not available on the CoWin app. An acknowledgement of the first dose was not being accepted as proof at the centres, thus increasing the delay for some. Arguments between vaccine beneficiaries and vaccination centre were reported at several places. At the Hafeezpet primary health centre, 45-year-old Suvarna Tanduri was told after waiting for nearly four-and-a-half-hours — from 8 am to 12:30 pm — that the centre had run out of doses. Tanduri was not even given a date for her dose after being sent back. “I had booked the slot almost a fortnight back. My second dose is already overdue by 12 days and even today I had to return without a vaccine. We are not sure what to do next,” said the resident of Lingampally area. She was among many who are overdue for their second shot by ten days or more. Many such beneficiaries scampered from one centre to another hoping to get the dose but had to return disappointed. Technical issues on the CoWin platform was among the factors leading to arguments at many centres. “We registered for second dose at the PHC in Kondapur but it was cancelled abruptly and without any reason given. When we went to the centre, the staff told us there was no record of our first dose and hence it was cancelled. Even after showing them the confirmation SMS and certificate for first dose, they did not consider,” said a beneficiary at the Uppal centre which saw several arguments break out between staff and beneficiaries over similar grievances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dose-shortage-cowin-glitches-leave-many-frustrated/articleshow/82488753.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: ‘Candidate absent, but gets marks’||CHANDIGARH: A complaint was sent to the chief secretary’s office, Punjab on Friday after a medical officer alleged that a candidate sitting in front of her was absent, but he was granted marks after declaration of results on Saturday. The complaint was marked to the vice-chancellor, Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), Faridkot, the same day. The complainant, Arshpreet Kaur, had alleged that a candidate who was allotted a seat in front of her, did not appear for this exam but the result published by the university on Saturday on their official website showed that candidate scored 34.5 marks. She stated that the absence of the candidate was confirmed by other candidates in the examination hall. “I request to reconduct this exam in a fair and partial manner,” wrote the complainant. After investigation, vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur and the registrar verified the allegations. “The candidate who was not sitting in front of the complainant could not download his photograph on the form. As this was not fulfilling the requirements, the invigilator made him sit outside the hall along with another candidate for the examination,” said Dr Bahadur. He said, “His attendance and answer-sheets were checked. It was verified that he had appeared while he was present but he was not made to sit inside the examination hall.” There were 250 medical officers to be selected in which 1,000 of candidates appeared on Saturday. The result was declared the same day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/candidate-absent-but-gets-marks/articleshow/82488757.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Lucknow||No more on-the-spot vaccine registration in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to suspend on-spot registration for vaccination across all age groups to avoid overcrowding at centres. Till now, the rule applied only to people in the age group of 18-44 years. Now, all beneficiaries will have to book an appointment and secure a slot on CoWin portal. “The rush for vaccination at centres has forced us to suspend spot registrations. From Monday, people will have to book a slot before reaching centres. This is being done to ensure that vaccination sites do not become Covid-19 spreaders,” additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal said. The decision, however, got a thumbs down from several quarters. “First they did away with private vaccination centres and now they are asking us to register and then go for vaccination. The government must think of ways to simplify the process rather than making it cumbersome,” a retired doctor said. Sehgal said about 1.35 crore doses of the vaccine had been administered since January. “So far, 27 lakh people have taken both doses and efforts are on to boost it further. UP is among few states which rolled out the vaccination programme for the age group of 18-44 years. Though we began with seven cities, it is now being extended to 11 municipal corporations and Gautam Budh Nagar from Monday,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-more-on-the-spot-vax-registration-in-up/articleshow/82488761.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh BJP to make ‘panna pramukh’ post permanent for better voter outreach||LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh BJP is planning to make the post of ‘panna pramukh’ a permanent arrangement to further consolidate party’s support among voters. Appointed only before elections till now, a ‘panna pramukh’ is key functionary at booth level. The post is already permanent in some BJP-ruled states. Addressing the state executive committee meeting of the BJP in March, defence minister Rajnath Singh had said that the role of ‘panna pramukh’ was as important as that of a party president. Later, during the regional working committee meeting of the party’s Awadh Kshetra in Ayodhya, which was chaired by UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, party functionaries had deliberations on the appointment of ‘panna pramukhs’ so that the party could get enough time to reach out to voters before state assembly elections. “The step will help the party in micro-planning and micro-management. Most of the ‘panna pramukhs’ will be appointed by September 25,” a senior party functionary in Ayodhya said. The UP BJP learnt to go ‘micro’ in its approach and vision to win elections when Amit Shah was appointed the in charge of Uttar Pradesh in May 2013. He made the existing 1.63 lakh booth committees active and relevant. His work is being taken forward by state general secretary of UP BJP (organization) Sunil Bansal. ‘Panna pramukh’ will be the smallest unit at booth level but only in hierarchy and not in influence. The Election Commission releases a voter list for every booth which has names and addresses of all voters. A ‘panna pramukh’ acts as the in charge of one page (both front and back) of a voter list. His role is to reach out to the voters mentioned on that page, build communication with them, help them get the benefits of the government’s welfare schemes if they fulfil the criteria, and look into the problems faced by them. “This way, a ‘panna pramukh’ will work in the interest of the party,” a senior office-bearer of UP BJP said. Booth is the party’s smallest level. The maximum that a booth can have is a committee of 21 members. Every booth has a president, a general secretary, two vice-presidents and two secretaries, besides other office-bearers and members. A booth committee is formed on the basis of social and caste scenario and booth members will be made ‘panna pramukhs’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-to-make-panna-pramukh-post-permanent-for-better-voter-outreach/articleshow/82488763.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Lucknow||Subhash Mishra, TOI’s man for all seasons, passes away||LUCKNOW: Always enthusiastic about a robust political debate and ever ready to disentangle the complex threads of UP’s politics for junior colleagues, the Times of India lost to Covid veteran journalist in Lucknow, Subhash Mishra at the age of 57 who breathed his last early May 8 after battling Covid since late April. Condolences poured in for his death from all quarters, including chief minister Yogi Adityanath and union defence minister Rajnath Singh who said he was deeply saddened by Mishra’s demise. “He distinguished himself as a diligent observer, prolific writer and a wonderful human being. He made notable contribution to English journalism in UP. My condolences to his bereaved family,” he tweeted. The CM condoled his passing in a message where he expressed his sympathy with the bereaved family and offered prayers for the departed soul. Mishra started his career with Northern Indian Patrika in 1989, and moved to The Pioneer in Kanpur in 1990. His keen news sense and impressive body of work saw him become state correspondent for the Financial Express from 1994 to 1996. In his 16 years with the India Today group, Mishra notched up an enviable record of political coverage, informed by sharp analysis and deep understanding of his home state. He joined The Times of India’s Uttar Pradesh Bureau in 2014 to soon become the newsroom’s go-to person on all matters political, and for help that any individual needed. He is survived by his wife and two sons. The TOI newsroom is left significantly poorer with Mishra’s passing and leaves colleagues across the country shaken. In what is a tribute to Mishra’s unbiased journalism over decades, condolence messages came from across party lines. UP Governor Anandiben Patel prayed for peace for the departed soul and expressed sympathy for his family. Former Governor Ram Naik said: “I first met Mishra ji during my interaction with journalists right after taking oath. For[NL1] the next five years there was hardly a day when we did not speak on phone. We became good friends. Even after my retirement we continued to stay in touch. There are very few journalists who were as hard working as him.” Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said the news had stumped him. “He was a symbol of unbiased journalism and he had an energetic personality,” he said. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav called it an extremely sad event, an immeasurable loss. “May God give peace to the departed soul and courage to the bereaved family to bear this loss,” he tweeted. Speaker of the UP Hriday Narayan Dikshit said that Mishra belonged to his home district of Unnao. “Before he joined The Times of India, places like India Today and Northern India Patrika benefitted from his talents and he made a big name for himself. His passing has left a huge void in journalism which will be difficult to fill,” Dikshit said in his message. Vidhan Parishad chairperson Kunwar Manvendra Singh called him a fine example of unbiased journalism and that his comments always carried a message. “His death is an unmeasurable loss,” he said. UP MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh said: “Pained hearing the news of demise of Subhash Mishra, senior journalist of The Times of India, Lucknow. May the departed soul rest in peace. My condolences and prayers to the bereaved family. Om Shanti.” Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (L)’s Shivpal Yadav said that he was stunned by the news and called Mishra’s passing a “personal loss”. BJP MP Syed Zafar Islam, said: “I am extremely pained to hear about the untimely passing away of Lucknow-based veteran TOI journalist Subhash Mishra ji. He always came across as a beacon of independent journalism in India. My deepest condolences to his family and friends.” Samajwadi Party spokesperson Juhie Singh said: “Subhash Mishra ji, you were always just a phone call away for our family. Your passion for football and politics infectious, you had the courage to believe which many did not, you will never ever be forgotten.” Expressing grief over the death of Mishra, national secretary of the Communist Party of India (CPI) Atul Kumar Anjan said more than 45 journalists have passed away in last 20 days while discharging their duty. “The government should provide financial aid to families of journalists, especially from rural areas, who have died in the line of duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/subhash-mishra-tois-man-for-all-seasons-passes-away/articleshow/82488767.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Don’t fall for rumours, get yourself vaccinated: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath visited Moradabad and Bareilly divisions on Saturday to review the implementation of Covid-19 control and management protocols. The CM inspected the Integrated Command and Control Centres in both divisions and also visited Manoharpur village and Mudia Ahmad Nagar village where he interacted with monitoring committees and rapid response teams. Encouraging people to get vaccinated, Yogi said drive for those above the age of 18 years was scheduled to start in Moradabad from Monday. “Do not fall for rumours and get vaccinated. However, don’t take the vaccine if you have fever and wait for at least a month before taking your shot. Also, register online so that we can avoid crowding at centres,” he said. The CM said some had voiced concerns that UP would be reporting 1 lakh positive cases per day by May 1 but “today is May 8 and we have 26,000 cases. We have therefore been successful in Covid management and our strategy has been correct”. He also directed officials to ensure that there is at least one dedicated hospital for women and children in the district for which the 102 ambulance service should be made available and another one, especially for non-Covid ailments like cancer, liver disease etc. The CM said that active cases were down by 3,500 in Moradabad division and by 2,800 in Bareilly division over the past week, adding that he had been alerted to the possibility of a rise in infection in rural areas after the panchayat polls and that his government was taking all care to prevent the spread of the virus there. “We had already set up monitoring committees and they will be panning out in the more than 97,000 revenue villages and screen everyone for symptoms. We are making arrangements to increase monitoring committees in Moradabad and Bareilly,” he said. On the availability of oxygen in Moradabad, Yogi said that not only was the area being supplied with oxygen through Oxygen Express trains but more was being brought from nearby areas through tankers. He added that air separator units were also in place in some areas. “The Centre has approved of three oxygen plants for Moradabad through the PM CARE funds. We have supplied more than 200 oxygen concentrators in Covid hospitals and are making arrangements to supply more to community health centres. We are also making plans to ensure oxygen supply to patients in home isolation,” he said. In Mudiya Ahmad Nagar, Yogi met the monitoring committees and rapid response teams and spoke about the surveillance and testing drive. He also interacted with the newly elected pradhans and gram panchayat members and discussed the distribution of medicine kits and encouraged them to carry out intensive checking to mark out Covid patients so that they could be given early treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dont-fall-for-rumours-get-yourself-vaccinated-yogi/articleshow/82488773.cms||---
---||Delhi||Wrestler murder: Olympian Sushil Kumar still missing||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police questioned two wrestlers and identified two others who were present when 23-year-old wrestler Sagar Dhankad was killed at Chhatrasal Stadium on Tuesday. The two wrestlers interrogated on Saturday have been identified as Bhagtu and Ravinder. While the former was present with Dhankad and his friend Sonu, the latter was seen in a CCTV footage in the company of the third victim, Amit, minutes before they were forced into the car and driven to the stadium. Police are in pursuit of wrestler Sushil Kumar, Olympic medalist, and his friends for the killing of Dhankad. The group has been on the run since the May 4 incident. Sources revealed that Ravinder stayed in the stadium, while Bhagtu lived close to the stadium in the proximity of the flat rented by Dhankad and Sonu. The deceased often called Ravinder and asked about what was happening inside the stadium. During questioning, Ravinder told the cops that on May 4, the Olympian had hit him and thrown him out of the stadium. A police source said, “Ravinder reached Amit’s house in Shalimar Bagh and realised he had left his phone behind. They called Ravinder’s brother, a wrestler who lives in the stadium, to retrieve the phone. Apparently, Kumar asked Ravinder’s brother about his whereabouts and left immediately for Shalimar Bagh in two cars. Amit, meanwhile, informed Dhankad and Sonu about Ravinder’s harassment.” Dhankad, in turn, summoned Bhagtu. Dhankad later made a call to Ravinder’s phone, which was allegedly answered by Kumar after Ravinder picked it up. According to the police source, the Olympian then took Ravinder in his care to Dhankad’s flat, where the 23-year-old wrestler was conferring with Sonu and Bhagtu. The trio, however, were accosted by Kumar and his friend and brought to Chhatrasal Stadium. When a fight broke out, Bhagtu and Ravinder alleged they were beaten by the senior wrestler but that the main targets were Dhankad and Sonu. Police are verifying the claims of Bhagtu and Ravinder. On Tuesday night, police had also seized four vehicles from outside the stadium. A double barrel gun was recovered from one of the cars. Dhankad was the son of a Delhi Police head constable. When the cops got into action, however, they found that Kumar and his associates, Ajay, Prince and some others, named in the FIR based on the statement given by Sonu, had vanished from the scene.

For over a year now, 25-year-old Rocky Clement David’s school van venture has not brought in a single rupee.  Still, David decided to start a free ambulance service so that his idle van could be of some help to society. “Last month, an acquaintance was in urgent need of an ambulance. Since there was none available immediately, I ferried the patient in my van. And that’s when it struck me that so many people in Nagpur need this service and because of the high demand, would be facing a long waiting time. So, I decided to offer my services for free to anyone in Nagpur,” said David. He invested in an oxygen cylinder and slightly modified his van to accommodate patients who will be lying down. “The oxygen cylinder will support the patient till we reach the hospital and sometimes it can take quite a while to find beds,” said David. Through word of mouth and social media, David’s contact details are reaching people but he hopes to get ‘more’ calls.  “My only aim is to ensure that patients reach the hospital as soon as possible. No one should suffer because there was no transportation available. Since it’s just word of mouth publicity, not many people are aware of this. But I hope I can help more and more people in the coming days,” said David. While the pandemic has hit everyone hard, David considers himself ‘lucky’. “Well, I am single and have support from family and friends. Hence, the van business going down has not put me in dire financial straits. At the same time, I have managed to get a job with a logistics and trading company, so some amount also comes from them,” said David. He said his service is available 24x7 and there is no charge either for transportation or oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/youth-turns-school-van-into-free-ambulance-service/articleshow/82488788.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Pune||26% of patients are from neighbouring regions||Pune: A survey of Covid-19 response has found that 26% of hospitalised patients in Pune are from neighbouring districts - mainly Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Solapur and Ahmednagar. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said a similar trend was seen last September too, when at least 30% of admitted patients were from other districts. Officials said while Pune district administration is slowly increasing the number of beds, collectors of neighbouring districts too have been asked to ensure infrastructure is ramped up to handle surges. “We have patients from all over the state. It's not just the neighbouring regions. We are ramping up the number of oxygen beds in urban and rural areas," Rao said. He added that civic and jumbo facilities in Pune city have been receiving patients from other districts. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said most facilities in the city have admitted patients from the outskirts and other districts. The CoEP jumbo unit, for instance (restarted on March 22) has admitted 2,454 patients so far. Nearly 700 patients have been from outside PMC limits. "Recently, we admitted a patient from Nashik. We have people coming in from all over the state now," said PMC deputy commissioner Rajendra Muthe. At the Baner Covid hospital, there are more than 200 patients from outside Pune district. State surveillance officer Pradeep Awate said many Covid patients from neighbouring regions prefer Pune because of its ready infrastructure. State health department projections show Pune may face a shortage of 4,952 oxygen beds and 191 ICU beds by May 16. But officials said they are increasing beds and training more doctors. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said more rural areas - than urban centres - are now registering high caseloads. “So, currently, 10-12% of our patients from outside Pune city. Because cases are rising in rural areas, this number could increase."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/26-of-patients-are-from-neighbouring-regions/articleshow/82488795.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||India||Covid-19: Early signs of second wave peaking as growth slows||NEW DELHI: Even as India recorded more than 4 lakh fresh Covid cases for the fourth day running on Saturday and over 4,000 deaths for the second consecutive day, there were early signs in the data that the devastating second wave in the country could be reaching its peak. For the first time since the beginning of the second wave in mid-February, the seven-day rolling average of daily cases dipped on Friday. The dip was negligible, just a drop of 118 cases out of the day's total average of over 3.9 lakh. But it indicated a distinct slowing down in the growth of daily cases over the past week. The seven-day average stood at 3,91,263 on Saturday, having risen by 20,117 in the past week. The slowdown was evident when one compared this with a growth of 61,173 cases in the previous seven days (April 24-May 1), and a massive increase of 1,06,024 witnessed in the week before (April 17-24). While the curve is surely bending, the trend needs to continue into the next week before a more definitive statement can be made about the country having reached the peak of the second wave. There were several uncertainties around that. For one, the positivity rate in the country was still high and increasing. India recorded a positivity rate of 22% the past three days, up from 21% recorded on the same three days last week.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Cases were still surging in several states of the country, led by Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh in the south, Assam and Bengal in the east and Uttarakhand, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir in the north. Besides, the growth in cases remained higher than the national average in states such as Rajasthan and Bihar. On the positive side, Maharashtra was showing a drop in weekly cases while there was a distinct slowdown in other big Covid-hit states such as Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); On Saturday, India recorded 4,01,012 fresh cases. This was the fourth straight day of 4-lakh-plus daily infections in the country. However, the numbers have declined marginally over the past two days after hitting a peak of 4,14,554 on Thursday. Deaths continued to surge with 4,135 fatalities reported on Saturday, nearly as high as the previous day's record toll of 4,187. Active cases in the country continued to rise, although the growth rate had slowed over the past week. On Saturday, the count of active cases stood at over 37.8 lakh.

---||Gurgaon||Containment zones in city likely to go up to 202||Gurgaon: The district health department has recommended setting up 202 containment zones in the city to break the transmission chain of Covid-19. The district at present has 170 large outbreak regions, which were notified by the district administration on April 30. The health officials said that a majority of the cases are being reported from the urban primary health centres (UPHC) of Tigra, Chanderlok and Wazirabad. “We have sent a recommendation of 202 containment zones and now the administration will take a final call. While the containment period is 14 days, cases are continuously being reported from these areas, due to which they have not been taken off the list,” said Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer. The city in the last week of April had switched from micro-containment zones to macro-containment zones. The recommendation was to create macro-containment zones in the areas that have 15 or more active cases. However, it takes at least three Covid-19 cases to declare an area a micro-containment zone. Teams have been deployed to conduct door-to-door screening and thermal scanning of residents in the areas falling in the large outbreak regions.  ‘Critical Covid patients count not correct’  Till Friday, Haryana had total 1.15 lakh active cases in the state. But while health authorities peg the critical patients who are on oxygen ventilator support at 1,450, sources said more than 10% of the active patients — 13,221 — are found to be critical. Senior officials in the health department give lack of resources as reason behind the lagging. “Priority of the government is to save lives. You need additional manpower for compiling and posting this kind of data. This data is collected and compiled as well, but teams preparing handouts too have their hands full,’’ said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/containment-zones-in-city-likely-to-go-up-to-202/articleshow/82488824.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune, with boost in surveillance, is testing more than Mumbai||PUNE: A review of data has shown that Pune district has carried out more Covid tests than Mumbai in the past week. Authorities here said besides high testing, they have stepped out surveillance and contact tracing measures across the district to break the transmission chain, particularly in the rural areas. During the seven-day period, Mumbai also reported a steady drop in Covid cases. In Pune, caseload has not changed, but it hasn't increased substantially either. The difference in testing on some days was high. On May 7, for instance, Mumbai carried out 33,400 tests; Pune carried out 42,974. One the same day, Mumbai reported 2,633 cases and Pune district had 9,034 cases. Ayush Prasad, CEO, Pune zilla parishad, said officials have been testing aggressively, with door-to-door surveys still part of the main strategy in Pune rural, which spans 13 tehsils and 14 municipal councils He said, "Last month, we were testing 9,000 to 10,000 samples daily. But now, we're testing 12,000 to 13,000 samples. The testing ratio is 70:30 - 70% are RT-PCR tests; 30% are via rapid antigen kits." Prasad added that staff from the rural administration have tested shopkeepers and vegetable vendors across market towns and villages that have high industrial presence. "The district administration is now in the process of acquiring more rapid antigen kits," he said. Rural authorities have also roped in ASHAs and school teachers for door-to-door health surveillance, which has been designed to identify cases in early stages of infection. In Pune city, the PMC too has boosted testing and tracing. Officials said at least 16 contacts per patient are currently being traced by health workers. Sanjeev Wavre, the PMC's health chief, said, "Pune city is carrying out 18,000 to 20,000 daily tests. The PMC is operating 15 swab collection points. Weekly testing has been above 1.2 lakh for the past five weeks." In Mumbai, civic chief IS Chahal said high testing has been the BMC's policy from the start. Before the second wave, Mumbai’s highest single-day testing - from March 2020 till February 10 this year - was 24,500. Chahal said, “Immediately thereafter, our testing more than doubled to 56,000 tests on a single day in April. Our average daily testing in the month of April was nearly 44,000. It has been observed that the testing figures have fallen in last few days to 38,000 on May 1 and 28,000 on May 2. Our aggressive testing policy has resulted in reduction of positivity rate. We need to increase testing to 40,000 per day, if not more.

Also, the number of deaths crossed 8,000 in the district on Saturday, with the latest 1,000 fatalities in the last 12 days. As per data of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), weekly TPR was 11.61% between February 26 and March 4 and started to increase since then. It increased to 18.06% between March 5 and 11. Then, it surged to 24.15% between March 12 and 18 followed by 25.18% between March 19 and 25. The rate declined to 22.97% between March 26 and April 1. Thereafter, the city started to witness a spike in cases. Weekly TPR surged to 28.3% between April 2 and 8. There was slight increase to 28.36% between April 9 and 15. It again spiked to 31.25% between April 16 and 22. Then, the city started to witness a decline in weekly TPR. It reduced to 24.31% between April 23 and 29 and dropped to 18.06% between April 30 and May 6 (19,977 cases as against 1,10,602 tests). Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde told TOI, “Weekly TPR was below 32% in the city. In the second wave, many cities have TPR of more than 40%. The downfall is reasonable and good in a sense that testing has been consistent. We need to maintain it even in coming days for completely getting out of the pandemic,” he said. Meanwhile, Covid-19 positive cases further declined to 2,016 in the city on Saturday, the lowest in a day after 38 days. Also, cases in the district dropped below 4,000 after 32 days. There was no decline in testing as the civic body held special camps in residential areas where active cases are high. Also, RT-PCR testing capacity has been increased by 2,000 per day by engaging the laboratory of SpiceHealth. On Saturday, 7,799 patients recovered in the district, the highest-ever in a day. The previous highest recoveries were 7,575 on May 1. The recoveries are more than new cases for nine consecutive days. Due to high number of deaths in the second wave, the toll of the district increased to 8,069 on Saturday. Total 2,035 deaths have been recorded in the last 23 days. Among 35 districts in the state, Nagpur is third after Mumbai and Pune to record over 8,000 fatalities. The population of Nagpur district is less than Thane and Nashik. But Covid-19 deaths are more in the district as compared to Thane and Nashik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/test-positivity-rate-falls-rapidly-in-city/articleshow/82488855.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Delhi||Under-treatment Covid patients go missing from Delhi corporation hospitals||NEW DELHI: After reports that 25 Covid patients left Hindu Rao Hospital in Malka Ganj between April 19 and May 6 without recovering or informing the administration, North Delhi Municipal Corporation has strictly directed the hospital staff to prevent all such incidents. There are reports of similar cases in other hospitals run by the municipal corporations. Hindu Rao has reported the matter to the local police. However, north corporation mayor, Jai Prakash, claimed the verification process established that a majority of the patients had left the hospital after getting admission in other hospitals. The mayor said, “Our hospitals are doing their best and the staff is toiling day and night to bring relief to the patients. Even today, all 280 beds at Hindu Rao are occupied and many people are in the waiting list for new admissions.” Jai Prakash claimed that the hospital administration had immediately reported the fact of 25 patients leaving the hospital midway through their treatment to police, but were later discovered to have taken admission in other hospitals. “The staff had noted their details and we were able to locate the patients,” said the mayor. He also asserted that any complaint was immediately addressed. “An incident of water shortage for two-three days was reported recently, but we immediately arranged for water tankers,” he said. The three municipal corporations run Covid facilities in five prominent hospitals, namely Hindu Rao, Rajan Babu, Balak Ram (from Saturday), Tilak Nagar and Swami Dayanand. Till date, these hospitals have admitted, respectively, 650, 210, 25, 141 and 223 Covid patients. Of them, 164 died at Hindu Rao, 50 at Swami Dayanand, six at Rajan Babu and one at Tilak Nagar. In east Delhi also, 3-4 cases of missing Covid patients have been noticed, according to mayor Nirmal Jain. The EDMC mayor claimed that patients often left after they or their relatives expressed unhappiness at the arrangements. “Our staff can’t do much except to try and calm down the patients and their kin,” Jain said. “Such patients mostly refuse to give us details about what they intend to do after leaving our hospitals. After some absconded, we have asked the hospital staff to be more alert and note down details so these people won’t become spreaders.” SDMC has reported no missing Covid patients at its hospital in Tilak Nagar. A civic official added that round-the-clock security with eight Civic Defence Volunteers in three shifts has been mounted at the hospital. “This is in addition to security guards deployed at the hospital,” the official said. “Two teams of doctors and paramedical staff are available in the ward and screening room. Though we can’t stop anyone from leaving the hospital, we will ensure we have on record their detailed information, including reasons they want to leave the hospital.” The official added, “When the oxygen saturation level of patients falls below 80, we immediately refer them to link hospitals or those with ICU facilities. So far, 25 patients have been shifted for this reason to other hospitals to prevent their conditions from deteriorating.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/under-treatment-covid-patients-go-missing-from-corpn-hospitals/articleshow/82488871.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Amritsar||Punjab: Farmers defy lockdown, shopkeepers stay away||BATHINDA: Acting on a call given by 32 farm organisations of Punjab, protesting farmers openly defied the weekend lockdown on Saturday by coming on the roads in large numbers and taking out protest marches. However, shopkeepers stayed away from opening shops despite assurances by farmers of standing by them. Protests were held at nearly 200 places across the state, separately by activists of 30 farm organisations, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) and Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union (PKMU). The 30 farm organisations held protests at 120 places across the state, whereas BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) held protests at 87 towns and mandis in 15 districts of the state. At some places, they also joined protesters from 30 farm organisations. At Baghapurana town of Moga district, farmers gheraoed a police station when they found that a cop had filmed an open shop for issuing challan. Farmers raised slogans against the police and made the cop apologise. At Talwandi Sabo in Bathinda district, farmers raised slogans against police for a cop issuing challan to two cart vendors. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan and PKMU general secretary Lachman Sewewala said it had been over a year since Covid started raising its head in the country, but governments failed in creating infrastructure to deal with the situation. “In this year, doctors, paramedical staff, beds, ventilators and oxygen could not be arranged in adequate strength due to which people have to spend huge amounts on treatment in private hospitals. The governments, instead of making arrangements, are using lockdown as the only remedy due to which poor and small shopkeepers are facing the heat,” he said. BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) vice-president Manjit Singh Dhaner said the poor were being forced to pay for the inefficiency of the government. “With the lockdown, a large population of the country will not earn anything. Going by it, we are opposing and defying the lockdown,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/farmers-defy-lockdown-shopkeepers-stay-away/articleshow/82488921.cms||---
---||Delhi||All Covid beds taken at Balak Ram on Day 1||New Delhi: After a long wait, a 25-bed facility at Balak Ram Hospital was made operational on Saturday morning, and by the evening, all the beds were occupied. This is the third North Delhi Municipal Corporation hospital, which has been converted into a Covid facility. Mayor Jai Prakash said the centre was opened within 25 days. “Now, we have a total of 500 Covid beds at Hindu Rao, RBIPMT and Balak Ram hospitals. Initially, the plan was to start a quarantine facility at Balak Ram, but after the surge in demand, we decided to develop a proper Covid facility,” he added. The mayor claimed that they had arranged for the cylinders but refilling them became an issue. “So, we called on various organisations to donate concentrators under their CSR activities. We were successful in obtaining them in sufficient numbers and only then was the facility opened. We have plans to increase the number of beds to 50 as soon as sufficient arrangement for oxygen supply is made,” he said. The municipal commissioner, Sanjay Goel, said, “Besides the facilities for Covid patients, we are arranging for regular sanitisation of the areas under our jurisdiction using 93 sprinklers. For cremation, we have increased the number of pyres from 230 to 570 in the last fortnight.” The civic body also flagged off a bus, oxygen on wheels, with 10 oxygen concentrators with the help of an NGO, Aranya Foundation, on Saturday. “The bus is currently stationed at Balak Ram Hospital and will be sent to the other corporation hospitals on requirement. These can be used by visitors/patients while they wait for admission,” said senior BJP member Siddharthan, who was also present at the inauguration. The facility has been started for three months, which will be extended based on requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/all-covid-beds-taken-at-balak-ram-on-day-1/articleshow/82488960.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Mumbai||Mumbai City kid’s chemo in Kerala hosp halted amid Covid wave||Mumbai/Thiruvananthapuram: Underlining how Covid-19 impacts treatment of other diseases, a city couple seeking continuation of cancer medication for their three-year-old daughter are caught between Thiruvananthapuram and Mumbai. As the child, Caroline, was diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia during the lockdown last year when her parents, Joseph George and Grace Cherian, had visited their native town with her, the treatment was started at Regional Cancer Centre in Thiruvanathapuram. They want to return to Mumbai for further treatment now, as services in the Kerala hospital have been disrupted due to a Covid outbreak there. They haven’t been successful. After 12 children and one nurse tested positive for Covid-19 in RCC’s paediatric ward on May 1, admissions for chemotherapy have been delayed. “Caroline was due for chemotherapy over 10 days back, but we have been asked to come later. We are worried about the impact of the delay on the treatment,” said 33-year-old Joseph George, a resident of Mira Road. He, along with other parents, has appealed to the Kerala health minister for continuation of chemotherapy for the children. Over the past few days, Joseph spoke to several doctors in Mumbai, including those from Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, seeking a transfer of the case. “All the doctors, though, said it would be wise to continue the first phase of treatment at RCC and then move to Mumbai,” he said, adding he needs to get back to work as well. On Saturday morning, he tweeted: “RCC has stopped taking admissions in paediatric ward due to the Covid crisis. This has put the high dose chemotherapy on hold for around 25 kids. High dose chemotherapy is the most complicated stage for these children in their recovery, and in an ideal world four doses should be given with 15 days gap each. Unless they start taking admissions, the chances of relapse is higher for these kids and their lives are in danger.” Another parent whom TOI spoke to said, “We fear there would be relapse due to the delay in administering high dose chemotherapy.” The parent recalled unfortunate outcomes last year when admissions were halted due to the lockdown. RCC authorities, though, said the hospital has put in effect triaging on non-emergency cases due to the current situation. “Admissions for emergency cases are not withheld. Admissions for chemo and radiation are going on as planned. But some triaging of non-emergency cases is being done so as to overcome the current situation,” RCC authorities said. The parents said the hospital authorities should continue chemotherapy without interruption. “Children’s lives are at stake here. At present, there are only six children in the paediatric ward. They can be isolated and new admissions can be taken, we don’t understand why we are being asked to wait, endangering our children’s lives,” a parent said. Meanwhile, a parent of one of the children in the ward tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-kids-chemo-in-kerala-hosp-halted-amid-covid-wave/articleshow/82488160.cms||---

However, the morcha has given the go-ahead to farmers reaching protest sites on Delhi borders in batches on May 10 and 12. The convention was aimed at strengthening the farmers’ movement at the national level and contacts were made with academics, intellectuals and activists for the convention. The new date of the convention will be announced at an appropriate time, morcha leaders stated on Saturday. The morcha said that a large number of farmers from Punjab will gather at Punjab-Haryana borders in Shambhu and Khanori on May 10 and 12 before proceeding towards Delhi borders. Farmers from Haryana will also join Punjab groups from different locations. With the groups reaching borders, the protests will be strengthened to mount pressure on the Central government to repeal the farm laws and enact a law giving legal guarantee of minimum support price (MSP) on every crop. Farm leaders said arrangements will be made for vaccination of farmers at protest sites and they will be asked to wear masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/skm-says-no-to-natl-convention-nod-to-jathas-bound-for-delhi/articleshow/82488990.cms||---

A research by city doctors has revealed that Covid-19 results in excess formation of blood acids, technically called diabetic ketoacidosis, which may complicate the treatment process. It is already known that the virus makes matters worse for people suffering from type-2 diabetes. The latest study has focussed on type-1 or insulin-dependent diabetes vis-à-vis Covid-19 infection. The study revealed that though further research is needed to establish a direct link between the virus and type-1 diabetes, it indirectly helps in its onset in Covid-19 patients. “The novel coronavirus can trigger severe diabetic ketoacidosis in individuals with new-onset diabetes. However, at present, there is no hard evidence that the virus induces type-1 diabetes on its own accord. Long term follow-up of children and adults presenting with new-onset diabetes during this pandemic is required to fully understand the type of diabetes induced by Covid-19,” the study, published in scientific journal Elsevier, said. The study was conducted by doctors from the department of paediatric endocrinology at Rainbow children’s hospital in Hyderabad, department of endocrinology at Care multispecialty hospital in Hyderabad, and the division of endocrinology and diabetes at Medanta hospital in Gurugram, Haryana. The research team comprised Dr Sirisha Kusuma Boddu, Dr Geeta Aurangabadkar, and Dr Mohammad Shafi Kuchay. Stating that Covid-19 is an indiscriminate disease with unequal vulnerability, the researchers said while hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels) is seen to increase mortality and morbidity related to Covid-19, the virus itself can induce/worsen hyperglycaemia, culminating in a vicious cycle. “While we comprehend the intriguing mechanism of Covid-19 inducing diabetes or worsening the existing disease, we are still left with some unanswered questions. Is Covid-19 induced Beta-cell damage transient or permanent? Can Covid-19 linger on in the beta cells, causing chronic infection and new-onset of type-1 diabetes? As this pandemic evolves, coordinated global efforts might throw some light upon these important concerns,” they said, adding that till then it is prudent to keep a diligent and close long-term follow-up of children and adults presenting with new-onset diabetes during this pandemic. The virus can enter islet cells (which produce insulin) via angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors and cause reversible beta-cell damage and transient hyperglycaemia, they added. Type-1 diabetes makes up about five per cent of diabetes. It is increasing every year by three per cent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-may-induce-type-1-diabetes-in-patients-study/articleshow/82489007.cms||Syed Akbar

They are out in the field, volunteering and helping people during the pandemic. A group of mentor teachers of Delhi government schools, for example, have been delivering rations and meals to those in need, while several university teachers are engaged in delivering oxygen and medicines to families that need them. Alok Kumar Mishra, a mentor teacher, took the lead and decided to lend a helping hand to people in Rohini, where he lives. When he posted a note on social media asking people to refer those in need to him so he could see how he could assist them, seven other mentor teachers joined in. Now each of them is working in five different areas, delivering rations to needy families and individuals. “Several people in my circle were helping others, getting them hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and medicine. I felt I wouldn’t be able to do anything of that sort, but realised I could be of aid in other ways,” said Mishra. “That is when I decided to focus on providing rations and meals to the strapped families.” Now he has even been getting requests for food from distant neighbourhoods. “An elderly, ailing woman from Patparganj wanted to eat some good home food. But since her home was far away from mine, I asked someone in our teachers’ network living closer to her to have some food delivered,” said Mishra. Like Mishra, mentor teachers Manu Gulati and Gaurav too have been doing the same in Dwarka. “We get a lot of requests on our social media accounts,” said Gulati. “People have also been sending us pleas for help on behalf of those who do not have access to social media. In this way, we have been able to reach out to a lot of people. The pandemic has made us realise we need each other’s support.” In a similar exercise, Jamia Teachers Association has been providing lunch packets to people and also oxygen cylinders, oxygen flow meters and support kits to those who need them. Majid Jamil, president of the association, said, “We had ordered and received the oxygen cylinders from some places in UP and Hardwar. We are thankful to people there who helped us. We fill small cylinders with oxygen and give them to those who need the gas.” Nafis Ahmad, vice-president, and his colleagues from the faculty of dentistry have also been offering online consultancy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/happiness-curriculum-teachers-step-out-to-serve-those-in-need/articleshow/82489016.cms||Shradha Chettri

The Worli woman was at home with her 8-year-old grandchild. The accused had came to the first floor of Bhapkar Housing Society near Worli Naka. She asked the elderly woman if she had taken the vaccine. The woman then asked for a glass of water. As the elderly woman went to fetch water, the accused woman entered the flat and followed the elderly woman. She threatened her with a knife, led her into a room, tied her hands with shoe laces. At knifepoint, she took away jewellery worth around Rs 3 lakh from the cupboard and fled the place. “The accused woman was wearing a mask,” said DCP Paramjit Singh Dahiya. The victim was in a state of shock and couldn’t call out for help. Later, she called up a neighbour, said Anil Koli, senior inspector.  ––Mateen Hafeez||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaicovid-vax-data-staffer-robs-woman-of-rs-3l-gold/articleshow/82489022.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||No question of sabotaging farmers’ stir: Punjab CM Amarinder Singh||CHANDIGARH: Saying there was no question of sabotaging the farmers agitation against the Centre’s agriculture marketing laws, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday reiterated that no violation of the weekend lockdown and other restrictions in the state could be allowed at any cost, given the current grim situation. “There are lives at stake, saving them is our priority, and it is the responsibility of every Punjabi to save them,” he said, urging BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) and BKU (Ekta Dakaounda) leaders not to give a twist to his comments on the issue. Amid the call of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha to oppose the weekend lockdown, the chief minister had on Friday asked the DGP to strictly enforce all the weekend restrictions and not allow any violation at any cost. Nobody can be allowed to play with the lives of the people, he reiterated. The CM’s statement said leaders of two organisations had misinterpreted his statement to raise doubts about his intentions towards the ongoing farmers’ stir. “How can my government go against the interests of the farmers when it was the first in the country to move the amendment laws in the Vidhan Sabha to annul the draconian farm laws of the central government,” asked Amarinder, adding that as far as the central laws were concerned, his government’s stand against them had been clear and consistent. Noting that the situation in the state was extremely grim, the chief minister said that as on May 6, the state had 24-hour case load of 8874, 154 deaths, 265 patients admitted in isolation facility, 30 patients on high dependency unit and 16 on ventilator support. “This is not the time to play politics but to put all our energies into protecting the life of every human being,” he said. Appealing to the farmers to extend all support and cooperation to the state government in its endeavour to combat the Covid crisis,the chief minister said the lives and safety of the people of Punjab were of paramount interest to his government. The state government, said Amarinder, had stood with the farmers in their fight since the outset and continued to do so but at the moment, his government was completely focused on saving the lives of the people, while ensuring that they do not suffer due to the harsh measures, he said, pointing out that to alleviate the sufferings of the people, he had even asked the DCs to allow opening of even non-essential shops and private offices on rotation basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-question-of-sabotaging-farmers-stir-amarinder/articleshow/82489023.cms||---
---||India||Assam: Himanta may be CM, BJP may recall Sonowal to Delhi||NEW DELHI/ GUWAHATI: Newly-elected BJP MLAs in Assam will meet on Sunday to finalise the selection of the new chief minister of the state amid likelihood of Himanta Biswa Sarma pipping incumbent Sarbananda Sonowal to the post. Sources said the party leadership, which deliberated the vexed issue in the face of Sarma's dogged insistence on taking the wheel, will announce its decision after meeting the newly-elected MLAs at Library Auditorium in Guwahati. Sonowal, sports minister at the Centre before moving to Assam, will be brought to the Centre, should Sarma nose ahead in the final lap on Sunday, sources said. Union agriculture minister Narendra Tomar along with two central observers, party general secretary Arun Singh and vice president Baijyant Jay Panda will be present on the occasion. However, sources said the meeting in Guwahati will be a proforma exercise to ratify the choice of the leadership which might favour Sarma, the resourceful No 2 in the outgoing government. Sarma, who crossed over from Congress before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, more than equalled chief minister Sonowal in influence and prominence. Regarded as a big factor in the party's wins in 2016 polls and 2019 Lok Sabha polls as well as the handling of the challenges of the anti-CAA agitation and the pandemic, the former Congress leader is also the spearhead of the party's effort to increase its presence in the north-east. Apart from handling almost all the important departments except home which is under Sonowal, the former Congress leader also serves as the convenor of North East Democratic Alliance ( NEDA), BJP's successful "special purpose vehicle" for expanding its influence in the north-east, which has dwarfed Sonowal in profile. Sarma's ambition, especially his desire to take over Sonowal's job after having persevered as the No 2, at least in de jure way, is no secret either. Sonowal along with Sarma reached the national capital on Saturday and met the party brass separately before they met them together in the third round. Union home minister Amit Shah, party president JP Nadda and general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh sat with the two Assam leaders and the entire process of meetings took place for almost four hours.

---||Chandigarh||Haryana seeks 183 oxygen plants, gets Centre nod for 43||CHANDIGARH: Haryana would soon start generating more oxygen as the central government has permitted the state to install 43 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants that would be set up in all government medical colleges, civil hospitals, and community health centres. The state had asked for the setting up of 183 plants, sending a requisition through a letter on April 28. After seeking approval, six PSA plants had already become operational at Sonipat, Hisar, Karnal, Faridabad, Ambala and Panchkula. Vijai Vardhan, chief secretary, Haryana, gave this information to the Punjab and Haryana high court in a status report submitted on Friday. The high court is hearing a case about the availability of facilities in the region to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. The surge in Covid-19 infections -- six lakh cases and around 5,500 deaths till date -- has led to a steep increase in the demand for oxygen. Haryana has the capacity to produce 271 metric tonnes (MT) of liquid medical oxygen, with 260 MT at Air Liquide, Panipat; 6MT at Jindal Steel Works, Hisar; 3 MT at Gupta Industrial Gases, Hisar; and 2 MT at Gupta Oxygen, Hisar. The central government has allocated Haryana 232 MT of oxygen whereas the demand of the state was 270 MT. The Haryana chief secretary had written a letter dated May 3 requesting the central government to increase the quota to 330 MT in view of the increasing number of patients. U’khand plants not providing Hry quota Of the total oxygen allocation quota of Haryana from the Centre, 25 MT is to be supplied by Linde, Selaqui, Dehradun, Uttarakhand; and 25 MT from Air Liquide, Roorkee, Uttarakhand. However, both the plants have failed to supply as per Haryana’s quota. Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, department of health, Haryana, had written a letter dated May 3 to the central government to allot 25 MT quota to Haryana from Air Liquide, Panipat, in place of Uttarakhand plant and ordered Air Liquide, Roorkee, to release the state’s quota according to the allocation. Not receiving allocated quota Through its letter dated May 5, the central government had increased the quota of Haryana from 232 MT to 267 MT but supplies from Panipat had been reduced from 100 MT to 80 MT. Now, Haryana has been attached with Jamnagar (Gujarat) Reliance Industries for 30MT. Till May 4, the allocation of Haryana was 232MT per day and against this allocation, the state has received 146MT on May 1, 166MT on May 2, 143MT on May 3, and 139MT on May 4, far below the allocated quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hry-seeks-183-oxygen-plants-gets-centre-nod-for-43/articleshow/82489028.cms||Ajay Sura

Rupnagar SSP said the SIT will be headed by SP (headquarters) Ankur Gupta, and will comprise two DSPs and an SHO. He said they will seek the help from drug control department in the case. He said police suspected the vials were fake as they found differences in the labels of original Remdesivir and those recovered from the canal. On May 6, Ropar police confiscated around 3,000 injection vials, including 621 of Remdesivir, 1,456 of Cefoperazone and 849 unlabelled, floating in the Bhakra canal near Morinda. Police said it took more than five hours to collect the floating vials initially near Salempur village in Morinda and, later, during a search operation upstream of the canal near Balsanda village in Chamakur Sahib. Police suspect these vials were thrown from a bridge over Bhakra canal on the Mohali-Ropar highway during the night intervening Wednesday and Thursday. Police claimed to have raided the location of marketing address mentioned on the label of Cefoperazone vial, but found it closed. Police managed to contact the owner, who informed that Haryana Police had also checked the place in search of an accused of an FIR registered there. Ropar SSP Akhil Chaudhary said a police team was sent to Himachal Pradesh at the address of pharma company mentioned on the back of the vials. Besides, the vehicle, which took supply of these vials using batch number, was also being traced. “We have sent another police team to UP, which is the address of one of the suspects. We have also directed DCO to get samples of these medicines and send them to the drug testing lab to know if they are genuine,” SSP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ropar-police-form-sit-to-probe-floating-remdesivir-vials-in-bhakra-canal/articleshow/82489029.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||Chandigarh||Group D employees in GREF can’t be treated as part of Army: Punjab and Haryana HC||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has made it clear that the Group-D employees of General Reserve Engineering Force (GREF) working on Army duty cannot be treated as part of the Army and are not entitled to extraordinary pension in case of any mishap with them during the service. Justice Anil Kshetarpal passed these orders while disposing of a petition filed by Tohto Devi, a native of Haryana’s Bhiwani district. The petitioner is the widow of late Tuhi Lal, who worked as PNR COY in GREF. Tuhi Lal met with an accident on July 18, 1991, and died on July 27, 1991. The petitioner was given ordinary family pension. She, however, claimed that she is entitled to extraordinary pension in terms of the Central Civil Services (Extraordinary Pension), Rules, 1939. The petitioner claimed that since GREF is a part of the Army and her husband died while he was on duty, therefore, she is entitled to extraordinary pension under the 1939 Rules as amended with effect from January 1, 1996. She also claimed ex-gratia lump-sum compensation and other statutory benefits as per the government rules. Rejecting her claims for extraordinary pension, the Union government submitted that an investigation was held to find out the reasons that led to the death of Tuhi Lal and it was found that he was deployed for night sentry duty. He went inside the barbed wire fencing of the electric transformer and tried to hold the main supply line of electricity and consequently died due to shock and burn injuries. It was asserted that Lal was a Group-D employee and in terms of Rule-2 of the 1939 Rules as amended vide notification dated February 14, 2011, the employees who are governed by the Workman’s Compensation Act, 1923 (now Employee’s Compensation Act, 1923), are not entitled to the extraordinary pension. The counsel for the petitioner contended that no negligence on the part of Lal is proved and therefore, he cannot be said to be negligent and contended that since the husband of the petitioner was regularly appointed in GREF on a permanent post as an Army personnel, therefore, he was not a civilian and hence, Workman's Compensation Act, 1923 is not applicable. After hearing both the parties, the HC held observed that there is no dispute that the deceased husband of the petitioner was employed in GREF and not in the Army. The court observed that regarding the claim of the petitioner to the extraordinary pension, it may be noted here that such an extraordinary family pension is payable in accordance with the rules applicable. “Under Category-C, no doubt, in case of death or disability due to accidents in performance of duties including the death by electrification is included. However, these rules are not applicable to Group-D employees. Rule 2 of the 1939 Rules, clearly provides that these rules shall apply to all persons who are paid from the Civil Estimates, other than those to whom the Workman's Compensation Act, 1923, applies,” the HC held while declining the petitioner’s plea for extraordinary pension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/group-d-employees-in-gref-cant-be-treated-as-part-of-army-hc/articleshow/82489030.cms||Ajay Sura

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: DRDO rejigs cancer drug for Covid fight||HYDERABAD: A potential cancer drug – 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) – that has been repurposed for Covid-19, has received Drugs Controller General of India nod for emergency use as adjunct therapy for moderate to severe Covid-19 patients. The anti-Covid-19 application has been developed by the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS) of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in collaboration with pharma major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories. The drug, which comes in a powder form, must be taken orally by dissolving it in water. It works by accumulating in the virus infected cells and prevents growth of the virus by stopping viral synthesis and energy production. According to DRDO, the results of clinical trials on Covid-19 patients showed that 2-DG helps in faster recovery of hospitalised patients and reduces their dependence on supplemental oxygen. “It’s the selective accumulation in virally infected cells that makes this drug unique. Higher proportion of patients treated with 2-DG showed RT-PCR negative conversion in Covid patients,” it said. Being a generic molecule and an analogue of (similar to) glucose, it can be easily produced and made available in plenty in the country, INMAS-DRDO added. The drug, which is an inhibitor of glucose transport and glycolysis, was originally being developed for cancer as it cuts the supply of glucose molecules to cancer cells, which require higher glucose than normal cells to survive, thereby killing them. “In the ongoing second wave of the pandemic, a large number of patients are facing severe oxygen dependency and need hospitalisation. This drug is expected to save precious lives due to the mechanism of operation of the drug in infected cells. As it reduces the hospital stay of Covid-19 patients, it will also help reduce the burden on the country’s health infrastructure,” it explained. Dr Reddy’s Labs had earlier said it believes that the disproportionately high accumulation of 2-DG in the inflamed lung tissue of Covid-19 patients (as per PET scan study) due to the high metabolic activity induced by the coronavirus infection could lead to starvation in lung cells and result in inhibition of viral replication. While research into repurposing of 2-DG for Covid-19 began in April 2020 during the first wave of pandemic, the laboratory experiments were conducted with help of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad. The phase-II trials, conducted on 110 patients in 17 hospitals last year, found that patients using 2-DG showed a faster recovery and a 2.5 days difference in terms of the median time for achieving normalization of certain vital parameters as compared to standard of care (SoC). The phase III clinical trials showed that a significantly higher proportion of patients that took 2-DG improved symptomatically and became free from supplemental oxygen dependence (42% vs 31%) by Day-3 in comparison to SoC, indicating an early relief from oxygen dependence, DRDO said. The phase III study was conducted on 220 patients during December 2020 to March 2021 period at 27 Covid hospitals in states like Delhi, UP, West Bengal, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drdo-rejigs-cancer-drug-for-covid-fight/articleshow/82489036.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Hyderabad||10 killed in gelatin blast at quarry site in Kadapa||Tirupati: Ten workers were killed in a blast at a barytes quarry near Mamillapalli village under Kalasapadu mandal in Kadapa district of Andhra Pradesh on Saturday. The explosion occurred while workers were unloading gelatin sticks from a vehicle for use in the quarry. Police said though the quarry operator had obtained permission to run the unit, he was allegedly mining outside the prescribed boundaries assigned to him. The impact of the blast was so powerful that the bodies were blown to pieces and lay strewn all over. Police struggled to identify the dead as they were beyond recognition. No one was injured in the blast. As the bodies were strewn all over, police were forced to take the help of the workers’ family members who managed to identify the deceased with the clothes on the bodies. The severed parts were collected and sent to the local government hospital for forensic experts to put together. The blast was heard several kilometres away. People in nearby villages ran out of their homes in fear on hearing the deafening sound. Thick smoke engulfed the area soon after. Confusion prevailed at the blast site as nothing was visible due to dense clouds of smoke triggered by the explosion. Police said a vehicle loaded with gelatin sticks had arrived at the quarry site from Badvel in Kadapa district on Saturday morning. The explosion is believed to have happened while the workers were unloading the explosives. It is also being said that the workers were drilling holes in granite to insert the explosive materials when the blast happened. It is not yet clear what triggered the explosion. A forensic team has collected the material from the site to ascertain the cause. Kadapa SP KKN Anburajan said ten workers died in the blast, and all bodies have been identified. “A case has been registered at Kalasapadu police station. We will investigate if the quarry has the necessary licences, besides the permission to procure large quantities of explosives,” he said. The deceased have been identified as Prasad, K Prasad, Abdul Vemula, Lakshmi Reddy, Easwaraiah, Venkatesu, Gangireddy, Venkataramana, Bala Gangulu and Subba Reddy, Allegations of over-exploitation of barytes and other mines near Kalasapadu village by the lessee have also surfaced. An RTI reply over various aspects pertaining to mining leases allotted by the mines and geology department of Kadapa went viral on social media soon after the blast on Saturday. The district administration has ordered an inquiry into the blast. Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan and chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy expressed shock over the loss of lives in the quarry explosion and extended condolences to the bereaved family members. Former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu expressed condolences and demanded the state government to order a detailed probe into the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/10-killed-in-gelatin-blast-at-quarry-site-in-kadapa/articleshow/82489042.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

The SAD leader accused the MLA of getting a case registered at a time when the family was dealing with grief. Raja Warring has denied this and has demanded stern action against police officials for registering a case against Dhillon. Warring commisserated with the bereaved family and clarified his position on social media on Saturday. Bhog ceremony was held at Dhillon’s residence on May 6. On May 7, a case was registered against Dimpy for assembly of more persons than permitted. MLA Raja Warring said, “I do not indulge in such type of politics where you get framed your political opponent in case when he had lost father. I have strong sympathy with Dhillon family, I offer my heartfelt condolences and strongly condemn the police act. I urge chief minister to take action against police officers who are behind registration of case.” On this, Dhillon said while he appreciated Warring condoling his father’s demise, he was “playing a double game.” “The case is learnt to have been registered at his behest. He should not have done so and now should not try to shed crocodile tears. If police have acted against his wish he should say that police not listen to him,” he said. Muktsar superintendent of police (investigations) Rajpal Singh said, “police is looking under which circumstances case was registered.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/booked-for-exceeding-guest-limit-at-fathers-bhog-sad-leader-sees-rival-hand/articleshow/82489043.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Jaipur||State managing with daily supply of 350MT O2 against need of 615MT||JAIPUR: Against a demand of 615 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen daily for Covid patients, the state government is currently supplying around 350MT (on an average) to the districts. Though the Centre had allocated 270MT to Rajasthan daily, supply has been hampered because of shortage of tankers and distance of the oxygen plants (West Bengal and Odisha). As of now, the government is getting 350 MTs daily by lifting the backlog quantity (of oxygen) from Jamnagar (Gujarat), through increased output at Bhiwadi plant and producing another 145MT through 24 local manufacturers. Some officials said the late response by the state government and mismanagement by the central government led to an oxygen crisis in Rajasthan. “In Rajasthan, infection is rapidly spreading in rural areas. A number of deaths are not getting reported from there. Now, there are too many IAS officers in the decision-making process. One person should be in command and others should report to him. Moreover, perception is very important in Covid management. Ministers and senior officials should start visiting the districts to boost people’s confidence. It is a psychological war, more than medical war,” a senior official said. Another senior official said, “The Centre’s ill-preparedness to handle such a situation led to the crisis. They didn’t build oxygen plants in the last 4-5 months. Also, the number of tankers is limited in the country as most of these are imported. Allocating oxygen is not enough, the Centre must provide more tankers to the state. The state government should have also set up oxygen plants in district hospitals to meet the demand. But, nobody anticipated this crisis.” “We are meeting the shortfall in a few ways. First, we have increased the production of oxygen at Bhiwadi plant (over and above 120 MT, which is the capacity). So, it is producing additional 10-15MT per day. Second, we are lifting more than 100 MT from Jamnagar daily including the backlog quantity,” said an official. “Third, we have a target to increase the production of oxygen at Dariba’s Hindustan Zinc plant and another at Chanderiya up to 40 MT in the next couple of weeks,” he added. “It will take around 4 to 5 days for tankers from Odisha and West Bengal to reach the state. Till then, we will meet the requirements by lifting oxygen from Bhiwadi and Jamnagar,” he added. Two tankers have gone from Bellary (Karnataka) to Kalinganagar (Odisha) on Saturday to lift oxygen for the state. “Despite supplying up to 350 MTs of oxygen to the districts daily, there is still a shortfall of 265MT,” said the official, adding the state government had urged the Centre to further increase the state’s quota by shifting the allocation of oxygen from the eastern states to Jamnagar. He added that of the 37 tankers operating in the state, only 10 have been allocated by the Centre. Currently, there are 72,000 cylinders available with the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-managing-with-daily-supply-of-350mt-o2-against-need-of-615mt/articleshow/82489062.cms||Sidhartha Dutta
---||Hyderabad||Putta Madhu traced to Bhimavaram, held||HYDERABAD: TRS leader and Peddapalli zilla parishad (ZP) chairman Putta Madhu, who has been missing for the past one week from Manthani town, was taken into custody by Ramagundam police in Bhimavaram town in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh on Saturday. It was speculated that Madhu might have gone underground fearing a police crackdown on him in advocate-couple Gattu Vaman Rao and PV Nagamani’s murder case. As per an official statement issued by Ramagundam police, Task Force cops took Madhu into custody to verify his exact whereabouts and also to question him about issues raised by G Kishan Rao, father of Vaman Rao, in the murder conspiracy. Police said that a week ago Madhu asked his gunmen to stay back in Manthani and went underground. Since then, his cellphone had remained switched off and his whereabouts have been not known. Police sources said that a few days ago they started tracking the whereabouts of Madhu to Maharashtra’s Chandrapur area and subsequently to Bhimavaram where they picked him up on Saturday. “Madhu is being questioned about certain points raised by Kishan Rao in a recent letter he wrote to Ramagundam CP V Satyanarayana and inspector general Y Nagi Reddy pertaining to the double murder. We are also asking him why he had gone underground suddenly and change cellphones and cars frequently. We asked about allegations like transfer of Rs 2 crore from bank accounts and purchase of a car. He is asking us to investigate and find out the truth,” said an investigator. In the past, police have questioned Madhu in connection with the February 17 murder of Vaman Rao and Nagamani. So far, police have arrested seven persons — Madhu’s nephew Bittu Seenu, Kunta Srinivas, S Chiranjeevi, A Kumar, P Lachanna, K Anil Kumar and V Vasantha Rao — in the murder case. Police are yet to file a chargesheet in the case. On April 26, Satyanarayana wrote to the law secretary requesting to ask the high court for constitution of a fast-track court to try the advocate couple murder case and the same has been sent to the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/putta-madhu-traced-to-bhimavaram-held/articleshow/82489066.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Dr Hari Narain, a retired civil surgeon who is presently running a private hospital at Gidderbaha town in Muktsar, is accused of not maintaining complete record of patients and admitting more suspected Covid patients than permitted. The hospital allegedly is not conducting proper RT PCR and Rapid Antigen tests on patients. A case was registered on the complaint of Gidderbaha senior medical officer Dr Paravjit Singh. According to a report sent by the SMO, during a visit to the hospital on May 6, it was found that 26 patients were admitted in the hospital, with some of them even in the corridor. The doctor could provide records of only 19 patients and failed to give satisfactory answer about the seven remaining patients. It was found that six Covid positive patients were discharged on May 4 and 5. The hospital has permission to admit five Covid patients but RT PCR reports of many was shown to be negative. Infection level as per CT scan of some patients was found to be high, necessitating RT PCR and Rapid Antigen tests from a recognised laboratory. The CRP score was also found to be more than the permissible limit and D-Dimer report was not within permissible limit. The report stated that during the visit, it was found that the doctor and staff were not wearing PPE kits, N-95 masks or gloves. Muktsar superintendent of police (SP, Investigations) Rajpal Singh said, “A case has been registered against Dr Hari Narain Singh u/s 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 336 (negligent act to endanger human life or the personal safety of others), section 54 of Disaster Management Act and Section 3 of Epidemic Diseases Act.

On Saturday, additional chief secretary (public health) Pradeep Vyas also wrote to Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan urging him to make available sufficient quantities of Covaxin doses to cater to those due for a second dose in the 45-plus age-group. “As was being instructed in various video conferences by the Government of India that no buffer be kept for second doses, so no doses have been kept as reserve by the state government and now the situation is very precarious. We have not received any quantity of Covaxin for the 45-plus age group since long and as a result, Maharashtra is unable to provide the second dose to those who have completed more than four weeks after the first dose and in some cases, even six weeks. It is leading to a lot of discontentment in the public,’’ Vyas said in his brief letter. NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik condemned the Central government for “complete mess” in allotment of vaccines to the state government. “PM must fix the responsibility for the mess,” Malik tweeted. On Saturday, in Mumbai, 58,906 people took the Covid-19 vaccine. While 4,698 were in the 18-44 age-group, 22,146 were those above 45 years old. The city has so far managed to vaccinate 26 lakh people. On Saturday, vaccination sessions were conducted for the 18-44 age-group at eight BMC centres such as BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central, the jumbo facility at BKC, Seven Hills Hospital in Andheri, Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar, Cooper Hospital in Juhu and Chunabhatti maternity home and community hall in Bandra. In the private sector, the HN Reliance Hospital in Girgaum vaccinated 842 people, while Nanavati Hospital in Juhu managed 740 vaccinations. On Friday, the state managed to vaccinate 3.6 lakh people, taking the total shots given in Maharashtra to 1.7 crore since January 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-buffer-stock-kept-for-2nd-dose-maharashtra-to-centre/articleshow/82489094.cms||---

Ashok Kumar Gujjar, a male nurse at Metro Mas Hospital at Mansarovar, was caught red-handed while accepting a bribe of Rs 23,000 (part of the agreed amount) from the family of a Covid patient. The complainant had approached the ACB office saying Gujjar has asked for Rs 1.3 lakh in lieu of providing an ICU bed in the RUHS. “The complaint was verified by our team. Since the complainant had already paid Rs 95,000 to the accused two days ago, a trap was laid on Saturday,” said ACB ADG Dinesh MN. The complainant told the agency that Gujjar had assured them of having good contacts with RUHS doctors who would give the best medical attention. The family, which was looking for an ICU bed for their kin, agreed to the demand initially but later realised that it was an unlawful practice.“We searched Gujjar’s house and collected evidence to prove his involvement in the case,” the ADG said, adding that he was trying to establish Gujjar’s links with RUHS doctors. The RUHS has 163 ICU beds and hundreds of patients are in the waiting list at any given time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nurse-held-for-taking-bribe-for-allotting-ruhs-icu-bed/articleshow/82489115.cms||---

In the past week, several localities including Cantonment, Big Bazaar Street, East Boulevard road, Sangliyandapuram and Vayalur road have reported unscheduled power shutdowns stretching up to 90 minutes, mostly around 2 pm and 11 pm. Residents say power disruption and voltage fluctuation have been the norm. “We have online classes that cannot be missed. Power shutdown in the past few days has been affecting productivity,” R Parthasarathy, a medical college student from Kumaran Nagar said. The disruptions are attributed to delayed maintenance of substations and transmission lines during the assembly election. Ever since the model code of conduct came into effect in February, Tangedco officials said scheduled maintenance was deferred periodically. “We are only doing emergency maintenance by turning off power supply for up to an hour. Faults in transformers and transmission lines are being attended to,” an official of Tangedco said. Sources said scheduled maintenance of transformers, substations and transmission lines has been temporarily suspended for the next few days. Although people have inverter and battery backup, as most internet service provider facilities are not linked to the backup connection, internet disconnection has been troubling the residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/power-outages-irk-techies-students-in-trichy/articleshow/82489128.cms||Deepak Karthik

Khan, in turn, has alleged that police snatched his mobile phone and posted an “absurd” denial of his accusations on his Facebook page without verifying if they were true or not. For the past few weeks, Khan, who works for a local newspaper, has been writing about the “mishandling” of the Covid situation by the local administation. Police called him on Saturday afternoon and rebuked him for spreading misinformation. “They didn’t stop at that and took my phone to post an absurd post which is still present on my Facebook timeline. It reads, ‘The posts made by me highlighting the shortage of Remidesivir and oxygen was a mistake by me and a result of nightmares I am witnessing. In Tonk district, police and local administration is doing a great job and we have all medical requirements and resources at the civil hospital.” Circle officer (Kotwali) in Tonk, Chandraveer Rawat said Khan was arrested under CrPC Section 151 for disrupting peace with his posts. “Our senior police officers and collector’s office was upset over his post made in recent days. He was arrested for disrupting peace and was granted bail soon after,” said Rawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tonk-scribe-held-for-fb-posts-on-o2-shortage-granted-bail/articleshow/82489154.cms||---

The first flight under the mission took off to Kuala Lumpur to bring back 179 passengers on May 9, 2020. It was flown by an all-woman crew in connection with Mother’s Day. Since then, around 995 flights have been operated under Vande Bharat Mission bringing 1.45 lakh passengers to India through the airport. Out of the 995, the most number of flights, 262, were operated from Singapore alone. This was followed by Dubai, 220, while 113 flights were operated from Kaula Lampur.The first Vande Bharat Mission flight was operated between Abu Dhabi and Kochi on May 6. The flights were allotted and operated based on registration by the stranded people with overseas Indian missions. “Trichy international airport became more popular because it handled more number of passengers under the mission than Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Kolkata airports,” said H Ubaidullah, aviation analyst.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/vande-bharat-flights-from-trichy-complete-a-year/articleshow/82489164.cms||Sampath Kumar

---||Goa||Goa: State-level curfew from today, tourist entry only with Covid negative or vaccination certificate||PANAJI: The state government on Saturday issued the orders enforcing the curfew that begins on Sunday. The state-level restrictions will come into force at 7am on Sunday and end at 7am on May 24. Also, following a nudge from the high court, the government has now mandated that tourists who wish to enter Goa must produce a negative RT-PCR test report that’s less than 72 hours old, or a vaccination certificate. North Goa collector Ajit Roy said that Goans and those entering Goa for work do not require these documents. “If a Goan goes to work in Maharashtra or Karnataka, they have to show their Goa ID card while returning to the state, and if any person from Maharashtra or Karnataka comes to Goa for work, then they have to show proof of working in Goa,” Roy told TOI. An important change is the operating hours of shops selling essential commodities, which will now be allowed to open only from 7am to 1pm (as opposed to 7am to 7pm earlier). However, delivery of all grocery items and other essential items (excluding liquor) will be permitted throughout the day. Standalone liquor shops will be allowed to operate only for takeaway. However, despite the change in nomenclature, the “curfew” announced by chief minister Pramod Sawant is not substantially different from the “lockdown” he ordered last weekend, and the “restrictions” that followed it. Sawant said this time around, the curfew will be enforced strictly, and DGP Mukesh Kumar Meena also said Goa police had “enough staff” to deal with any law and order situation and violation of curfew orders. While weddings were earlier permitted with 50 or fewer persons, from Sunday, all weddings stand prohibited. Cremations, however, will be permitted with fewer than 20 people. Restaurants will continue to remain shut for dine-in customers, but their kitchens are permitted to operate for home-delivery of food.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-level-curfew-from-today-tourist-entry-only-with-covid-ve-or-vax-cert/articleshow/82489244.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa pips Kerala for top spot in ‘not wasting vaccines’ list||PANAJI: Goa’s efficient utilisation of vaccines has earned the tiny state praise from the Centre, as it administered more doses than those allotted to it by making use of leftover doses in vials. The Union ministry of health and family welfare rated Goa the highest, above even Kerala, Odisha and Himachal Pradesh. State immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said that Goa has been able to get more out of the vials. Instead of ten doses per vial, vaccination centres have been using leftover doses in vaccine vials to vaccinate a total of 11-12 people per vial, he said. “We are very careful while administering the vaccine, as this is a very precious commodity and we don’t want any wastage. We instruct centres to open the vial only when there are atleast ten people in the queue, since vials have to be discarded four hours after opening,” he said. Reducing wastage depends on accuracy and efficiency of the vaccinator and quality of syringes. “If we get 11-12 doses per vial throughout the day but open the last vial for the day when there are only two people in the queue, it is wastage,” said the nodal officer at TB hospital, Margao. “That’s why at the end of the day’s session, before opening the last vial around 3:30-4 pm, we ask the people in the queue to call their friends, relatives and colleagues so that at least ten people will benefit from the vial. Otherwise, we ask them to return the next day.” The centre vaccinated 386 people using only 33 vials on Saturday, administering the dose to 12 people from each vial. Initially, the state had reported some wastage, and the health secretary asked for this to be checked. The importance of reducing wastage is also brought up at every video conference, Borkar said. Another vaccinator told TOI that the quality of syringes they received initially were tight and of good quality, which helped reduce wastage. “The ones we have received now tend to leak, so we often have to manage only ten per vial. Despite this, we have been efficient in our use,” the vaccinator said. When the vaccination drive was in its early days, small centres would open a vial at 9am and not even receive ten people, resulting in them having to discard the entire vial. “Now, there is more eagerness than hesitancy,” the vaccinator said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-pips-kerala-for-top-spot-in-not-wasting-vaccines/articleshow/82489250.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 2 health workers ‘abandon’ elderly patient on KEM sidewalk, sacked||Mumbai: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday sacked two contractual health workers for allegedly abandoning a patient outside KEM Hospital in Parel. The officials said that on Saturday a video had gone viral of an elderly patient being left on the sidewalk without treatment outside the hospital. BMC officials clarified that there was no negligence on the part of the KEM hospital administration. Officials said that the hospital administration has sacked two contractual health workers who took the patient out of the hospital instead of admitting him to another department in the hospital. Officials said that the patient seen in the video was an unknown person who was admitted to KEM Hospital for abdominal pain. He was directed to be referred to the ESR on the ground floor of the new building for consultation and sent with two contractual healthcare workers. “A citizen filmed the incident and informed the security guards of the hospital that the patient was brought outside of the entrance no. 6. At that time, the patient was immediately re-admitted to the room and given the necessary treatment. The patient is still unknown and is receiving appropriate treatment. There is no negligence,” a BMC official said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-health-workers-abandon-elderly-patient-on-kem-sidewalk-sacked/articleshow/82489253.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa has most Covid cases per mn, almost four times nat’l avg||Panaji: Not only does Goa have by far the highest positivity rate in the country, it also has the most number of Covid-19 cases per million. At over 70,898, Goa’s count is almost four times the national average of 15,864, and far higher than other severely-affected places like Delhi and Kerala. However, experts say that even this is possibly an undercount. “Most of the tests being conducted in Goa are rapid antigen tests,” said a health official. “If even these are picking up so many positives, the positivity rate is much higher than reported.” He said that in other states, cases appear to be plateauing, but in Goa, there is large-scale community transmission. “We know how many people are dying at home and being brought dead to hospitals,” he said. Indian Medical Association (IMA), Goa, president Dr Vinayak Buvaji said that Goa is going through a “very bad patch” despite having some of the country’s best healthcare infrastructure. “I am heading the IMA, but I feel totally helpless,” he said. Buvaji said the wave would have been milder if borders were sealed and Covid protocols were observed by the people and enforced by the state. “We understand that the government has to balance economy and health, but when they got the first whiff of a second wave, they should have enforced Covid protocols in the most stringent way possible by doing simple things like restrictions on gatherings, elections, weddings, parties and casinos. It should also have sealed borders to some extent,” he said. Once this was done, containment zones should have been declared in high risk areas (like last year at Mangor Hill). He said the government has all the data to do studies like this and identify areas. “Containment zones are very few and their declaration came too late,” he said.  Meanwhile, president of the South Goa advocates’ association Antonio Clovis da Costa, who filed a PIL in the high court when the Covid situation went out of hand, told TOI that everybody — people and government included — let their guard down and took things for granted. “The government failed us on this front,” he said. “It should have insisted on Covid-negative certificates. Things are falling in place only after we petitioned the high court. Who is accountable for this mess? Each one is blaming the other. The government should have been stricter with SOPs.” Pathologist and Covid volunteer Dr Anan Jaiswal said that the situation is bad on the ground, with multiple requests in a day for oxygen beds and ventilator beds for young patients. The small state with a high percentage of senior citizens is very vulnerable now. “Entire families are testing positive,” he said, adding that the lockdown came too late. “You don’t dig a well when you’re on fire. You buy fire extinguishers when you’re constructing a building. It’s an open and shut case, the state wanted to protect industry and tourism more than its population. In December, all states were told about the second wave at a parliamentary committee meeting, but no action was taken,” he said. Cases are now reaching Goa’s hinterland, which is worrying, he said. “The most effective strategy would have been to lock down one area at a time and vaccinate everyone there,” he said. “Even educated people were not wearing masks. People must take responsibility. If the government had been harsh on people not following Covid protocol months ago, things would have been different,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-has-most-covid-cases-per-mn-almost-four-times-natl-avg/articleshow/82489259.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Goa||Goa's positivity rate dips slightly, but 55 more die||PANAJI: Goa’s positivity rate marginally dropped to 46% on Saturday with 3,751 new infections, but the second wave continued to wreak havoc, claiming 55 more lives. “Covid is not at our doorsteps but has entered our homes,” said IMA-Goa president Dr Vinayak Buvaji, in a grim assessment of the situation in the state. However, despite the ferocity of the pandemic, citizens on Saturday made a beeline to grocery stores to stock up, ignoring Covid protocols and chief minister Pramod Sawant’s repeated assurances that shops selling essentials wouldn’t be shut. The day’s toll included as many as five persons in their 30s. Also, 11 patients died within 24 hours of admission. Even as cases mount in urban Goa, several deaths were reported from villages, indicating community spread there too. Meanwhile, the recovery rate fell further to 70.7%, and in a first, over 3,000 persons were declared recovered in a single day. However, the tally of active cases continued to grow, with the count soaring to 32,387. Meanwhile, the ministry of health and family welfare stated that a Covid-positive certificate is not mandatory for admission into a Covid health facility. “No person shall be refused services on any count,” it stated. “This includes medications such as oxygen or essential drugs even if the patient belongs to a different city. No person shall be refused admission on the ground that he/she is not able to produce a valid identity card that does not belong to the city where the hospital is located,” the ministry stated. The ministry added that no hospital beds must be occupied by those who don’t require it, and that discharges should be in accordance with a revised discharge policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/positivity-rate-dips-marginally-but-55-more-die/articleshow/82489262.cms||---
---||Mumbai||8 of 200 patients treated for black fungus in Maharashtra lost vision in an eye||MUMBAI: Acknowledging the “new epidemic” born out of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, state government officials on Saturday said at least eight people across Maharashtra had lost vision in an eye due to mucormycosis, a fungal infection being detected in a growing number of post-Covid patients. “Eight out of 200 patients treated for mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, in the state have lost vision in at least one eye,” Dr T Lahane, who heads the state Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), told TOI on Saturday. Mucormycosis is a serious but rare fungal infection caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes. These molds live throughout the environment. It is known to affect people who have chronic health problems such as HIV or transplant patients who take medicines that lower the body’s immunity (to avoid rejection of the transplanted organ). At the BMC-run Sion Hospital, more than 25 CT scans of nasal para sinuses done in the recent weeks revealed that the fungal infection had spread to the eye. “We also performed scans of two patients with mucormycosis who suffered a stroke and later passed away,” said Dr Anagha Joshi, head of radiology. Most of these patients with mucormycosis were diabetics who had received steroids during their Covid-19 treatment. During the pandemic, experts believe irrational use of steroids and oxygen for patients weakened their immune system, making them susceptible to mucormycosis. Although steroids are the only medicine that have shown life-saving ability in Covid management, their overuse could worsen a patient’s sugar levels and reduce immunity. “There have been instances of patients given IV steroids that are far above the recommended dose,” said a doctor working for a BMC hospital. Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19, said the “epidemic” of mucormycosis proves the irrational use of steroids and oxygen (it increases humidity). “We are going to carry out a medical audit of treatment protocols in hospitals and also on the use of steroids,” said Dr Joshi. On May 8, TOI reported how patients, especially from Vidharba, were seeking treatment in city hospitals for mucormycosis. The treatment is long drawn-out and costs between Rs 15 lakh and 20 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/8-of-200-patients-treated-for-black-fungus-in-maharashtra-state-lost-vision-in-an-eye/articleshow/82488089.cms||---
---||Goa||Fearing corona, tipplers in Goa shun chilled beer, stock up whisky||PANAJI: The state government’s move to impose a 15-day curfew had an unintended silver lining for liquor traders. Alcohol sales, which were in a slump, suddenly hit a high as tipplers rushed to stores to stock up before the curfew kicks in. While discarding the suggestion of panic buying, retail outlets did notice a quirky trend — despite the hot sun beating down, patrons skipped the beer and preferred whisky. Most of the large alcohol retailers in Panaji and Margao kept their shutters down either because their staff tested positive for Covid-19 or out of respect for lockdowns announced by municipalities and village panchayats. Long queues or crowds were seen outside liquor shops in several parts of Goa, with social distancing and Covid-19 protocols going for a toss. The memories of last year’s stringent lockdown, when alcohol had to be purchased at a premium and clandestinely during the lockdown, compelled many tipplers into lining up outside liquor stores on Saturday. “There was a complete lull till Thursday, and after the lockdown announcement, things picked up. It was like the calm before the storm. Business suddenly picked up on Friday,” said Hansel Vaz, one of South Goa’s major alcohol retailers. President of the Goa liquor traders association, Dattaprasad Naik, concurred. He and said that all association members had decided to voluntarily down their shutters from May 1 due to the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases. However, seeing the demand for alcohol, many retailers opened up to serve the rush. “Almost 75% of our members obeyed the decision to voluntarily close. Small shops who are not directly connected with the association remained open,” said Naik. On Friday, chief minister Pramod Sawant announced a 15-day statewide curfew from 9am on Sunday till May 23, which he said was necessary to deal with the drastic rise in Covid-19 cases and which has left the tiny state’s health system on the verge of collapse. As the news of the lockdown spread, liquor shops were the first to see a rush. Small taverns and bars in the village which are frequented by daily-wage workers and villagers also rushed to stock up on feni, urrak and other mass-category alcohol. Aside from the sudden rush, the choice of poison also caught retailers and traders by surprise. The hot summer makes a chilled beer a natural choice, followed by vodka or gin, but this time around, many opted to purchase whisky across the price spectrum. “Most customers think they shouldn’t drink cold beers because people are afraid of getting a cold and Covid. This time, people are picking up whiskey,” said Vaz. Many traders in both districts noticed a similar trend, while also noticing that customers were not really breaking the bank while stocking up on whisky. “A lot of people are buying two or three bottles of regular scotch and low-end whisky,” said a retailer at Orlim. Vaz said that in the summer of 2020, the super premium whiskey segment did well, along with beer and gin. “Last year was like a party. This time we saw an upsurge in whiskey and feni. People are being more conservative this time, especially about the price point,” said Vaz.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fearing-corona-tipplers-shun-chilled-beer-stock-up-on-whisky/articleshow/82489265.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||India||Covid: Share of those on Oxygen support comes down||NEW DELHI: The share of active cases on oxygen support and ICU has dropped in last one month, though the active caseload has increased exponentially during this period, indicating that the proportion of severe cases might have come down while cases remain high. Currently, 3.7% of total active cases are on oxygen support, as compared to 4.5% on April 9. The number of patients in ICU declined to 1.34%, compared with 2.31% a month ago. The share of patients on ventilator have also come down marginally to 0.39% from 0.46% on April 9. The active caseload has increased substantially and is currently at 37.2 lakh cases, up from 9.79 lakh active cases recorded on April 9. The high caseload may have an effect on percentages, but the admissions to critical care could well have been much higher given the higher transmissability of the virus in the second wave. While the statistics were discussed in a high level meeting of Group of Ministers on Covid-19, headed by health minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday, officials highlighted the need to urgently ramp up health infrastructure in tier 2 and 3 cities as the infection is moving to these regions and a surge in cases is being seen in rural areas. The number of critical cases so far includes 4,88,861 patients who required ICU beds, 1,70,841 patients on ventilator support and 9,02,291 patients given oxygen support, Vardhan said. Some experts also point out that the data may not be adequate to draw a conclusion in a scenario where many patients are struggling to find oxygen support, hospital beds and ICU care. While some states have been showing early signs of plateauing or a decline of positive cases, there are districts where cases are still on the rise. Around 180 districts have showed no fresh cases in the last seven days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-share-of-those-on-oxygen-support-comes-down/articleshow/82489266.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Many vaccination points in some wards, only some in many wards||MUMBAI: A week after the BMC announced that all 227 electoral wards in the city would have vaccination centres, corporators and MLAs have complained that while some areas have a large concentration of centres there are areas that do not have even one. As a result, residents are forced to go to other areas for vaccination and many are travelling as far as Alibaug and Nashik to get vaccinated. BJP MLA from Colaba Rahul Narwekar has written to municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal saying there is not a single vaccination centre in all of Colaba and Cuffe Parade. TimesViewThe BMC’s bid to start 227 vaccination centres in each of the 227 electoral wards is welcome, but the plan has not taken off. The BMC must ensure that the vaccination centres are evenly distributed across the city so that residents do not have to travel too far. The city’s demographic and geographic profile must be taken into account while planning the vaccination centres.A ward covers Colaba, Fort, Churchgate and Cuffe Parade but has only two vaccination centres, the state-run Cama Hospital in Dhobi Talao and a civic dispensary in Fort. “Residents of Colaba, Cuffe Parade and Churchgate are struggling to get vaccinated. They are going as far as Alibaug and Nashik to get vaccinated. It is unfair that some areas like Dadar and Mahim have several vaccination centres but other areas like Colaba and Cuffe Parade have no centres at all. It looks like the BMC is only giving centres in electoral wards where there are Shiv Sena corporators,” said Makarand Narwekar, BJP corporator from Colaba. Cuffe Parade resident Vedant Parikh (23) drove all the way to Nashik to get a jab on May 2 since he was not getting a slot in Cama Hospital. Some wards have a very high number of vaccination centres. G-North has eight, six run by the BMC and two private centres. There is also a drive-in vaccination centre. Vaccination centres in G-North are spread across Dadar (West), Mahim and Dharavi and a new centre will open in Mahim on Monday. “The BMC must ensure that all 227 electoral wards have one centre each. Residents of those wards must be given priority for vaccination in their local centre,” said BJP MLA from Andheri (West) Ameet Satam. The BMC last week announced that it will set up 227 new Covid-19 vaccination centres, one in each electoral ward of the city for inoculation of citizens above 18 years of age. Currently there are 135 vaccination centres in the metropolis. Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh alleged that there were very few vaccination centres in E Ward, which covers Byculla, Mazgaon, Agripada and Mumbai Central. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal said the BMC was running out of vaccine stocks. “Once we get enough stocks, we will start all the 227 vaccination centres in each electoral ward,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-many-vaccination-points-in-some-wards-only-some-in-many-wards/articleshow/82489359.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Sleuth plays airport staff, nabs ex-soldier with Rs 24cr heroin||Mumbai: A former Zambian army man has been arrested with 4 kg of high-grade heroin worth Rs 24 crore at the city airport. The arrest was made after an official lay in wait, disguised as an airline official at the luggage section. The narcotic control bureau (NCB) officer on Friday worked as an Air India staffer for several hours at the baggage claim counter. The suspect, Kenith Mulowa, a Zambian, arrived in the evening to claim a bag “left by mistake” in Dubai. Just as he claimed the bag, the NCB officer and his colleagues detained him. A search of the bag led to recovery of the heroin. Mulowa has worked as staff sergeant for 17 years in Zambia. Mulowa (42), who arrived in Mumbai from Dubai on Thursday, is also accused of violating Covid19 protocol near his hotel and at the airport. Mulowa, who stayed at a hotel in Juhu, did not quarantine himself and was found roaming without restriction. An NCB officer said that they had got a tip-off that Mulowa was part of a drug cartel and was to get along a certain bag. However, when he had arrived in Mumbai, he did not bring any such bag. “We had kept him under our surveillance since he arrived in Mumbai on Thursday. We kept vigil near the hotel where he stayed. On Friday, we learnt that he was to go to the airport to claim a bag which had come from Dubai airport,” said Sameer Wankhede, zonal director, NCB. When baggage is left behind or goes missing, it is later sent to the destination. NCB officer S B Kadam disguised as an Air India staffer. Wankhede and his team — V V Singh, superintendent (Operations), investigating officer Ashish Ranjan and J I O Shinde — stood near the counter. The NCB team had followed him from his hotel. NCB officials and they found three cavities in the bag. Three packets of heroin, weighing 4 kg were hidden inside. “The estimated value of the drug is around 24 crore in the international market. The price has gone up during the pandemic, said an NCB officer. The drug was concealed such that even the scanner would not have detected it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-sleuth-plays-airport-staff-nabs-ex-soldier-with-rs-24cr-heroin/articleshow/82489408.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The NTCA has described Goa’s stretch of the Western Ghats as an important tiger corridor between the Kali Tiger Reserve in Karnataka and Sahyadri Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra and confirmed occupancy of tigers within the state’s borders. The NTCA along with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) has stressed on the need to connect the tiger population across Goa and Maharashtra to aid in long-term conservation. The NTCA has identified 32 major corridors across the country through a tiger conservation plan in June 2020. The Maharashtra forest department has given approval to the WII, Dehradun, to assess whether the Dodamarg and Sawantwadi areas of Sindhudurg are part of a wildlife corridor that need to be conserved. WII has been assigned the work to prepare the map of the exact boundaries of the proposed eco-sensitive zone based on a 2013 Bombay high court order that has directed Maharashtra to declare this area as an eco-sensitive area, where mining and red category are restricted. But as for the Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary in Kolhapur to the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in Goa and the Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary of Karnataka, no concerted efforts have been made to initiate declaration of a tiger corridor that can connect the tiger population separated by human activities. A wildlife conservationist working in the border areas of Goa and Maharashtra, Geerish Punjabi, said, “The Sahyadri-Konkan corridor is crucial as it is the only way tigers can naturally colonise the Sahyadri TR and Radhanagari WLS of Maharashtra. Tigers are breeding in the Kali TR, Bhimgad, Karnataka and Mhadei Sanctuary of Goa and the only way they can re-populate this landscape is if efforts are made to protect the corridor.” He said that fortunately, Maharashtra’s forest department is protecting 870 sq km of this corridor through a network of conservation reserves. This is a vital and formative step in landscape protection, something that will ensure the health of this ecosystem for a long time to come, the conservationist said. The male tiger that was first camera trapped in 2018 and later in 2020 in the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve had been repeatedly caught in the camera trap by the Karnataka forest department at the Kali Tiger Reserve. This has indicated that the tiger travelled almost 300 km. Tigers have been repeatedly found in the connected landscape of north Karnataka, Goa and southern Maharashtra. President of the Bicholim animal rescue squad, Amrut Singh, said, “There is an urgent need for the forest officials of Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka to work jointly to protect the tiger corridor. The natural habitat of the big cat has been shrinking due to anthropogenic pressure.” The deputy conservator of wildlife division, North Goa, said, “We have taken numerous steps to protect tigers in the Mhadei region. We are also in touch with Karnataka’s forest officials, while monitoring the movement of tigers in the border areas of both states.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-drags-feet-over-protecting-tiger-corridor-maha-starts-work/articleshow/82489412.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

CII-Goa said that if the state had shut industrial activity, it would have caused abrupt stoppage of normal functioning and disruption in the working process line of various industries, which are already struggling due to the consequences of the earlier lockdown. It has asked employers, particularly industrial units, to extend all support to their employees to get the vaccination process completed. “We also expect the government machinery to extend all support to employees reporting to work and ease their hardships during their commute during this period. CII appeals to all employees to carry their ID cards or letters permitting their travel,” said CII. The confederation’s chairman Atul Jadhav said serious efforts must be made by Goa’s industry to ensure that all necessary precautionary measures are taken to protect their staff during the curfew.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/allowing-ind-activity-will-benefit-econ/articleshow/82489442.cms||---

They have been lying on the beach since May 4. Surfacing of tar balls along the coastline is an annual occurrence preceding the onset of monsoon. One environmentalist on condition of anonymity said that disposal of tar balls in open fields or burying them in the sand, which the department of tourism resorts, to is abhorrent, as they block oxygen from getting into the soil. The environmentalist suggested that the tarballs be used to tar roads or be compressed into blocks and used to fill potholes. Tar balls are lumps of solidified crude oil found in the sea that get washed ashore. As per experts, tar ball pollution has severe consequences. It not only destroying the scenic beauty of the beach but also threatens marine life like crabs, shrimps and others species. While the tourism director did not respond to calls, tourism minister Manohar ‘Babu’ Ajgaonkar said he was unaware of the issue.

Locals have raised eyebrows over the transportation amid the pandemic even as the firm said the ore was procured through government auctions and would be moved only for a short period. Vedanta’s Codli mine manager Joseph Coelho said the ore is being transported to its jetties at Kapxem-Sanvordem in Sanguem and at Sonshi, Amone and Piligao in Bicholim taluka. “The ore would then be loaded on to a ship for export to China. Transportation would be done only when the ship arrives at Goa,” Coelho said adding that the ore has to be washed at the mine itself and dried to improve its grade. He said Vedanta has 1,500 employees and to bear the expenses of their salaries,it has to procure ore and export it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ore-movement-at-dharbandora-raises-eyebrows/articleshow/82489491.cms||---

Stocks were over, and they had to head back home. But on Friday evening, disappointment was replaced by shock: they got a message that they had been successfully vaccinated, and the Co-Win app generated their certificates. “My parents are senior citizens, and we booked a session from 12 to 1 pm at Cama. When we reached hospital at 12 pm, we were told there was no stock. So we went back home and at 6:23 pm, my parents got a message that they were vaccinated,” said Daniel Sequeira. Daniel’s mother Jacinta (70) and father Kevin (74) had booked a slot on Co-Win for their first dose of Covishield at the state-run hospital. TimesViewThere must be a probe into how senior citizens who did not get vaccinated got messages saying they were vaccinated at Cama Hospital. Action must be taken against those responsible and glitches rectified. Senior citizens are already struggling to get online bookings. Being turned away without getting vaccinated after they have booked a slot and then getting a certificate is highly odd.Daniel said when they called the hospital, authorities told them it was a data entry mistake. “But how can they generate a certificate? Now the app is showing a due date for second dose for my parents,” Daniel said. He said his parents were asked to come for vaccination on Saturday afternoon by hospital authorities after they complained. But there was no response from hospital authorities on Saturday; they said they would get vaccines only on Tuesday. Yohann Louis’s mother Elizabeth had the same issue at Cama and put out a tweet on it. “Registered my mother online for her 1st vaccine dose (45+) at Cama Hospital today under the 1st available slot (12-1pm). However, the vaccines were already over before 12pm as they were administered to walk-ins from 9am onwards. Received an SMS at 6:13pm stating that she has received her vaccination successfully and to download the certificate from CoWIN app/ site. The app/site also marks her 1st dose as complete. This is incorrect, she has not received her 1st dose,” Yohann wrote. Ankita Singh,whose parents had scheduled their 2nd dose, also tweeted about it. Her parents were vaccinated later on Saturday. Dr Tushar Palave, medical superintendent of Cama Hospital did not respond to calls and messages from TOI. SP MLA Rais Shaikh said there were many complaints of mismanagement at Cama Hospital. “There must be a detailed audit of vaccine wastage there and those responsible for this mess should be suspended,” Shaikh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-elders-turned-away-from-vaccination-centre-at-cama-but-still-get-vax-cert/articleshow/82489506.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

He was infected with Covid and admitted to a hospital in Ahmedabad. He was 77. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grief over the demise of the yoga guru. The PM in his tribute recalled Swamiji’s simple ways of explaining deep spiritual learnings. Along with yoga education, Swamiji served the society through many constructive activities, the PM recalled. Swami Adhyatmananda had spread yoga, pranayam and meditation across the world by organizing 814 camps, said a note issued by the Ashram. He represented India for the World Peace Conference at Chiapas, New Mexico in 1999, and was a recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the India Canada Culture and Heritage Association, it said. “Swamiji was fluent in 10 languages. He has been our spiritual guide for decades now. We have not only lost a family member but also a towering spiritual figure who was the guiding light for thousands,” said Yagnesh Pandya, chairman and MD, Print Vision Pvt Ltd. Apart from PM Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani condoled his demise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/swami-adhyatmananda-of-sivananda-ashram-no-more/articleshow/82489515.cms||---

When we got to know about the possible surge, I told my group leader that I will join duty,” said the native of Surendranagar. Rathod touched hundreds of lives in Ahmedabad during the current Covid surge by shifting patients to Civil Hospital. “The kids are now one and a half years old, and are learning to speak. They have also picked up words like Corona from our conversations. I stayed in isolation initially with my parents taking care of her last year. This time, a niece looks after them,” says Rathod, saying the kids won’t sleep without her. “I rush home after work, but often get late.” Similarly, Divya Bhoi, an EMT for the past seven years, also has given precedence to her work in this pandemic. “My kid will soon turn two.

I have seen the EC from (the days of former chief election commissioner) TN Seshan but have not seen such a partisan EC. They kept transferring people scribbling on a piece of paper. The EC needs reforms,” Banerjee said. The BJP spent money, “like water sprayed from a hosepipe on hotels, vehicles, planes, helicopters”, which could have been put to better use to vaccinate people, Banerjee said. “It requires Rs 30,000 crore to vaccinate everyone in India. This is nothing for the Centre. They have funds for a new parliament, a PM residence, planes and statues. But they cannot supply us with enough vaccines,” she said, adding: “There could have been universal vaccination with that money. I wrote to PM Narendra Modi in February, saying we would buy vaccines. They have not even responded to that letter.” Banerjee also accused the Centre of having “a step-motherly attitude” to Bengal and “diverting” oxygen from Bengal. “Indians are fed up with the series of blunders, starting from demonetisation. It seemed the centre had no job for the last six months, everyone camped here. What did they not do? They used agencies to harass us. They tried to intimidate us. But I just told myself how they could intimidate us, who would they intimidate if I did not get scared. Tagore had used these words to describe the fearless Gandhiji,” Banerjee said. Terming the poll results “unbelievable” and “a miracle”, the CM said: “I am indebted to all mothers and sisters. I bow to you. I am indebted to the young generation. People have queued up braving the pandemic. People of Bengal proved they have a straight spine.” The CM then went around the assembly to greet all the new Trinamool legislators, particularly women and first-time MLAs, and asked them to attend sessions regularly. “Please learn rules and practices from seniors. Attend sessions every day. This is the platform to speak for the people you represent,” she told them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-sought-double-engine-govt-people-gave-us-double-ton-cm/articleshow/82489537.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Chairman of Sanjay School, Porvorim, Guruprasad Pawaskar, said that vaccination for persons with disabilities only above the age of 18 will be facilitated at the school from May 10 from 9.30am to 12.30pm and 2pm to 4pm every day. “We will ensure hassle-free vaccination starting Monday. Vaccination is also open for all those people with disabilities, who are 45 years and above. This vaccination is being done by Porvorim Health Center. Persons with disabilities have to carry their Aadhaar card and disability certificate,” Pawaskar said. Similarly, the special centres for vaccination will also be open at T B Hospital, Margao, to be carried out by the Margao Urban Health Centre, and ground floor of Ravindra Bhavan in Vasco. Same timings will be applicable at these centres, where the vaccination is also open for all those people with disabilities, who are 45 years and above. Meanwhile, Avelino de Sa, president of Disability Rights Association of Goa (DRAG), has written to the State Commissioner for Persons with Disability pointing out that persons with disabilities are facing difficulties in accessing Covid treatment. “We are receiving complaints from persons with disability and their family members that the Covid hospitals and care centres are not accessible for persons with disability, the staff are not sensitised to handle persons with disability and the family members are not allowed to stay with special children,” de Sa has said. He has requested the commissioner to direct the authorities concerned to open one special Covid care centre in each district to cater to persons with disabilities and their family members. De Sa has said that a 15-bed facility should be set up in each district. “The Covid centres should be accessible for persons with disability, should have accessible toilets and parking facilities and should have oxygen and ventilator facilities and family members should be allowed to stay with special children,” said de said. De Sa has also asked that home vaccinations be provided for persons with disability who have no one to take them to the health centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vaccination-for-disabled-to-commence-at-special-centres-from-tomorrow/articleshow/82489538.cms||---

In some cases, complications do arise,” she said. Experts say breastfeeding should not be stopped for mothers with Covid. Dr Ritu Rana, assistant professor with IIPH Gandhinagar, said WHO recommends that mothers who are suspected or confirmed cases be encouraged to breastfeed as ‘the benefits outweigh the potential risks of transmission’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ok-for-covid-ve-moms-to-breastfeed/articleshow/82489542.cms||---

There have been several instances of vaccine recipients developing symptoms within days of vaccination and testing positive but doctors are more concerned about several others who may also have contracted the virus but are asymptomatic and so a greater threat to others. While the early breakthrough Covid cases could be due to different strains of viruses getting accelerated after the vaccine dose as has been detected in a study in Israel, others say it could be due to people dropping their guard a little too early after vaccination or catching the virus while waiting for the jab at vaccination centres. A majority of the critical cases in hospitals are those who have not been vaccinated. While they could have acquired the infection from anywhere, doctors suspect some of them may have received it from inoculated family members who got infected, were asymptomatic, and then spread it. Read AlsoCovid cases nosedive in Kolkata and BidhannagarKOLKATA: The number of daily Covid-positive cases has dropped to double digits over the past two weeks in Kolkata, and fatalities are down to a handful. On Tuesday, the city saw only 48 fresh infections and two deaths. In fact, there have been just three Covid fatalities in the city in the pastSubhrojyoti Bhowmick, clinical director (research & academics) at Peerless Hospital, said it could take six-eight weeks from the first dose for a vaccinated person to develop the maximum level of antibody provided the second dose has also been administered. “In the intervening period, the person is susceptible to infection but in a majority of cases, he or she will be asymptomatic. Hence, they will not know that they are infected and will infect others around them,” he said.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Clinical trial specialist and former head of clinical and experimental pharmacology at School of Tropical Medicine, Santanu Tripathi, also cautioned that letting the guard down after the vaccine poses a threat. “The vaccine is not meant to stop transmission. It is meant to boost a person’s immunity against the virus and reduce the severity of the infection. So while they may be relatively safe after the shot, others may not,” he explained. Read AlsoInfected after 2nd shot? Vax still best bet: DoctorsKOLKATA: A handful of people who have taken both shots of the Covid vaccine — mostly healthcare workers — has subsequently tested Covid-positive, but experts have said that this should neither be taken as any indication of the vaccine’s inefficacy, nor a reason to shy away from the jab altogether. AAccording to virologist Amirul Mallick of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata (IISER Kolkata), a person who does not have vaccine-induced protective immunity against the virus may pose a substantial risk to others. Since vaccines being administered in India follow the “prime-boost” regimen (same vaccine for 1st and 2nd dose), it is important to get two doses of the same vaccine within the recommended interval. “Antibody response reaches the peak around 14 days after the first dose. This will subside eventually unless a booster or second dose is given, which provides us with a longer and heightened antibody response to protect us from subsequent infection. Although we do not have sufficient data to answer this, given that there is a gap of 28 days between the two shots, one has to be very careful, not only for oneself but also for others,” explained Mallick. Read AlsoCovid cases after first jab worry doctorsScores of people have contracted Covid-19 infection after they received the first dose of vaccine and this triggered concerns among doctors about those dropping their guards immediately after the inoculation.Sangam Banerjee, a former senior professor at Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics who has worked on non-enzymatic biosensors and bactericidal activities using nanomaterial, further argued that imperfect vaccinal antibodies that are unable to combat a mutated virus can turn recipients into asymptomatic spreaders and infect non-immunized segments of the population. Read AlsoKolkata: Jab 2.0 dates clouded by round-1 CoWIN glitchesEven though it’s time for the first batch of vaccine recipients in the city to get their second — booster — dose, essential for developing proper immunity against the Covid-19 virus, most of them are in the dark about it. Administrators blame CoWIN glitches, even from the first round of vaccination.Behavior scientists say it is the irresponsible behaviour of people post the first dose that puts them at risk of turning into a carrier. Even those who have been carefully following Covid protocols like wearing masks and maintaining distance have started indulging in high-risk behaviour post vaccination. Known as the Peltzman Effect after Sam Peltzman who taught microeconomics in Chicago in the 1980s, it points out how safety perception increases risk appetite. In this case, it will end up putting others in harm’s way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/many-catching-virus-after-1st-jab-turning-silent-spreaders-docs/articleshow/82489543.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Deputy secretary of CPI Goa Suhaas Naik said that the state government must be held accountable for the way the Covid-19 pandemic has “devastated” the state. “With a lot of hesitation the government has declared a curfew, a step which has come at a very late stage,” Naik said. The move by panchayats and municipalities to go in for their own lockdowns is just another indicator that the state administration has lost control, said the CPI. It also said that the state government should have never permitted the Hunar Haat exhibition at Campal, opening of casinos and large scale resumption of tourism. “The government should have managed Goa’s borders strictly. Travel restrictions should have been imposed on tourists in January at the time of opening of the tourism industry, but this government failed in its responsibilities and administrative duties. This is the utter failure of this government,” Naik said, adding that the government has also failed to ramp up the state’s healthcare infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-must-take-responsibility-for-covid-mismanagement-cpi/articleshow/82489544.cms||---

The State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT), Pune, on Saturday sought the opinion of Class X students of the state, CBSE and CICSE boards whether a CET should be conducted for admission to Class XI. Students can respond through a survey on https://www.research.net/r/11thCETEST. Principals, teachers and parents have not been included in the survey, for now. Schools have been given the responsibility of sending out the survey link to a maximum of students. With their exams cancelled, the state was to assess students based on school (internal) evaluation in the current academic year. Internal assessment, though, appeared to be difficult as schools were asked not to conduct online exams throughout the current academic year. Last month, CBSE had announced its assessment scheme for Class X. ICSE students are awaiting a decision on how they will be scored. Both these boards had evaluated their students through online exams. The state wants to conduct the offline test in July or after a decrease in the spread of the virus. The test will comprise multiple choice questions (MCQ) and students will be provided optical mark recognition (OMR) sheets for answering them. The CET would be one paper of 100 marks, comprising questions of all the subjects and the duration will be two hours. The state will follow the Covid standard operating procedure while conducting the offline exams, stated the SCERT directive. Students would get admission to Class XI on the basis of their performance in CET. While CBSE has begun its evaluation process based on internal assessments, in the case of SSC schools, none of the baseline or cumulative assessments were done to help proceed with the internal marking system. “CET is the best option to have a fair evaluation of all students seeking admission to Class XI. Students were prepared for board exams. They can now apply the kmowledge in the CET,” said Suresh Nair, principal of Vivek College, Goregaon. Parents are divided on the CET but are in unison against an offline exam. “The board exam was cancelled due to the Covid scenario. Nothing much will change by July-August when the third wave is expected. And students will be the most vulnerable category then,” said Angela Dias, whose daughter studies in a Borivli school. Another parent said a CET seems like a fair plan. Students, though, are unsure about taking a CET exam. “How will a 100-mark paper decide my ranking? An offline exam is scary and an online one can encourage copying,” said a student. For the survey, a student has to give his or her name, district, school, board details and reply with a yes or no for the CET.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-asks-all-class-x-students-if-cet-can-be-held-for-xi-admission/articleshow/82487374.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Goa||‘Distrust in government’ as citizens resort to panic buying||PANAJI: The lack of trust in the state government’s ability to ensure availability of essential grocery items was clear on Saturday as Goans rushed to stockpile food items. The senseless purchases across the state came despite chief minister and other government officials repeatedly assuring residents that grocery stores will remain open from 7am to 1pm on each day of the 15-day state-wide curfew. Another reason behind the panic was the confusion between the curbs imposed by the state and the lockdowns announced by village panchayats and municipalities. Given that the state government issued the notification regarding the curfew much later on Saturday evening, residents decided not to leave anything to chance and resorted to panic buying. “During the first wave in last year we had to run from pillar to post as government suddenly extended the lockdown. We don’t want to face similar situation hence making provision for at least a week,” said Rajendra Naik, a resident of Khandepar, Ponda. Long queues were seen outside grocery shops, supermarkets and wholesale traders, a clear indication that people do not rely on the government. Hordes were seen at the SGPDA market in Margao prompting police personnel from Farorda Police station to shut down the market. Long queues were seen outside the Goa Sahakar Bhandar and at supermarket stores in Taleigao, Caranzalem, Miramar and Merces. Social distancing was maintained at most places with people queuing up patiently. Double masking has also picked up among people. Law commissioner and chairman of Goa’s largest chain of departmental store - Bagayatdar Bazar, Narendra Sawaikar appealed to people not to rush as the stores would remain open daily. Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida and Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte made similar efforts to create awareness in their respective constituencies. In several villages and constituencies, ward representative were seen moving about and urging people to stay indoors, wear masks and maintain social distancing. This also created friction in some villages. In Benaulim a panch member and a store owner got into a verbal spat after the panch member demanded that the store should down its shutters. The store owner pointed out that the government’s directives permit grocery stores to be open and that the panchayat could not supercede the government’s orders. Magsons, which has 11 stores in the state could keep just nine operational as the Varca panchayat has imposed a complete shut down and the store at Caculo Mall has been shut as the mall itself is shut. Borkar’s superstore, which has 14 outlets could only keep five open for similar reasons. In Vasco, people threw caution to the wind and thronged to the narrow vegetable and fruit market fearing scarcity from Sunday onwards. Some people said that while they knew that essential services would be available, the fear of being beaten up by Goa police during the curfew prompted them to stock up for the curfew period. The purchases were record high as by evening the huge Vasco vegetable market was half empty. Milk was also unavailable at many places. Similar scenes played out in Tiswadi, Salcete, Bardez, Canacona, Pernem, Bicholim and Old Goa as people rushed to make last minute purchases. While there were no long queues at most shops in the Calangute-Candolim beach-belt, in Parra, Saligao and Siolim people started rushing to grocery stores and medical stores. In Calangute and Candolim, the village panchayats had announced ‘lockdowns’ much earlier and people had already stocked up on provisions. Down south in Canacona, crowds were witnessed in the commercial hub of Chaudi but the gathering appeared to be primarily due to boredom and curiosity. Many concerned residents who witnessed the rush at Chaudi town, blamed the authorities for allowing crowds to assemble. “When the government has clearly stated that the groceries and other essential supplies will be open from 7am to 1pm, what’s the need for residents to crowd,” asked a retired teacher. An elderly woman said that people were putting themselves at risk and ignoring the government’s assurances. “We ourselves are culprits for spreading the virus whereby cases for the last two weeks have been increasing,” said a retired government servant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/distrust-in-govt-as-citizens-resort-to-panic-buying/articleshow/82489593.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A total of 1,164 persons were vaccinated at the drive-through centre which has been jointly set up by the AMC and Ashirwad Foundation. As the drive-through vaccination opens at 9.30am, people began to queue up from 8am. Initially there was some chaos, but things were soon sorted out and streamlined. The centre served persons older than 45 years. Bhavin Solanki, AMC medical health officer, said that on seeing the queues, 12 more teams were rushed to the spot. “If these teams were not sent the queue would have reached Income-Tax Circle.” Officials said that citizens were made to remain in the vehicle for 30 minutes after receiving the injection and were then allowed to leave. Rajesh Patel, a businessman, said he was initially unwilling to take the vaccine as he saw that a 70-year-old friend suffered a minor infection after doing so. He said when he learned of the drive-through facility, he decided to get vaccinated. A government employee, who asked not to be named, said the AMC should introduce an app for people to register and save time. He said the AMC could manage the system more effectively on Sundays and off days. The AMC said the drive-through centre will operate on Sunday and walk-in vaccination programmes will also be held at Mangal Pandey Hall (Nikol), Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Hall (Ambli), Community Hall (Vastrapur), Vigyan Bhavan (Science City), Tagore Hall (Paldi), Ranip Community Hall (Ranip) and Joitaram Patel Community Hall (Nava Vadaj). On Saturday, a total of 23,265 people were vaccinated in the city, including 12,484 men and 10,781 women. On Saturday, 5,789 people in the 18-44 age group and 10,941 people older than 45 years were vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/all-roads-lead-to-drive-through-vaccine-facility-at-sp-stadium/articleshow/82489601.cms||---

In a letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray, Fadnavis said WHO and ICMR norms required every death of a Covid-19-positive patient to be reported as a Covid-19 death. “It is clearly seen that to supress the case fatality rate (CFR) or death rate, the BMC is misusing this (deaths due to other reasons) category to the extent that when the deaths due to other reasons category in rest of Maharashtra is 0.7%, in Mumbai it is reported 34.9% in this second wave of Covid. Even in the first wave when rest of Maharashtra was 0.8%, Mumbai reported 12%,” said Fadnavis. He said the BMC, in an attempt at window dressing so as to bring the positivity rate down in its jurisdiction, has resorted to very low testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fadnavis-says-bmc-is-hiding-real-number-of-covid-deaths/articleshow/82489618.cms||Clara Lewis

The employees, who are on third-party contract, were demanding that their salaries be doubled and the management hire adequate staff. The striking employees said they did not have a leader as anyone leads a protest is removed from service once the strike is over. The employees said they also wanted the agency to hear their problems and give an assurance that neighter the agency nor SVP management will remove them from service. The staff also wanted that the agency give them salary slips regularly. SVP officials said that the strike was illegal as the employees had not given any notice to the management. The officials added that whenever an officer approached the protestors, they would respond by raising slogans. “Some staff members want that their salaries doubled, others wanted the agency to hear them out while a third group had a different set of demands,” the officials said. Till reports last came in, the group was still on strike.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/class-iv-staff-go-on-strike-for-better-pay/articleshow/82489630.cms||---
---||Goa||Will ensure strict implementation of curfew: DGP||PANAJI: Director general of police (DGP) Mukesh Kumar Meena said on Saturday that strict action would be taken against those violating curfew order. He said that the Goa police has enough staff to deal with any law and order situation. He also said that more than 100 police personnel have been deployed at Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital for the safety of doctors on Covid duty. Most Goa police personnel have already been vaccinated, he said. Meena said that there is no restriction for people to go to the airport and railway stations, adding that more cops would be deployed at railway stations to maintain social distancing. “There is no restriction on people going for vaccination,” he said. “We have deployed personnel to all Covid hospitals and care centres. We are analysing the requirements of hospitals. We have asked police control room (PCR) vans to patrol. Police inspectors will also take rounds of hospitals. We are in touch with doctors, and if there is any requirement, we are there,” he added. Meena said from April 1 till May 5, 45,753 people have been fined for not wearing masks, and police collected over Rs 92 lakh. He also said that 719 people have been booked for splitting in public places. He said that police presence at the border would be strengthened, and only tourists with a negative RT-PCR report or vaccination certificate would be allowed to enter the state. “The government decision to get a negative RT-PCR certificate or vaccination certificate does not apply to Goans, as on a day-to-day basis, a lot of Goans travel to neighbouring states,” he said. Meena said that staff attached to India Reserve Battalion would also be deployed during the curfew. Speaking to reporters at the police headquarters, Meena said elaborate arrangements have been made to implement the strict curfew. “Checking will be done at all places, and police will act strictly against anybody who violates the curfew order,” Meena said. Meena appealed to the people only to get out of the house only if it is necessary. However, he added that cops wouldn’t stop those going to work. “We will act against those who come out of their house to gossip and play,” he said. The DGP urged people to wear masks if they exit their houses. “Action will be taken against those not wearing masks. Both district police and traffic police have been deployed to fine people violating government instructions,” Meena said. Meena said that unless the people cooperate with the government, the Covid spread won’t be controlled. Meanwhile, public relations officer SP Mahesh Gaonkar said that if anyone obstructs government employees including doctors and police, from discharging their duties, it would be a cognisable offence and action would be taken. Gaonkar said that police would act if any person is found misappropriating government funds allotted for Covid management. He also said that action would be taken against those spreading fake news on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-ensure-strict-implementation-of-curfew-dgp/articleshow/82489649.cms||---

The Ayush doctors are being paid just Rs 20,000 and should be paid Rs 65,000 per month, said GFP vice-president Durgadas Kamat. Kamat also said that none of the Covid healthcare staff have received the 20% wage hike promised by the state government on April 7 last year. Kamat said that there are 82 doctors, who were appointed as part of NHM programme, and who are getting shortchanged as the Ayush doctors recruited recently are being paid Rs 50,000 per month. “Last year on April 7, the chief minister announced that Covid frontline workers would get a 20% hike in salary but till now it has not been implemented and none of the doctors have received any hike,” said Kamat. “For the last three months, the file for increasing their salary is pending with the chief minister.” According to some of the Ayush doctors, the chief minister had assured them that the file would be cleared by March 2021. “The file still is pending and he hasn’t signed it citing the reason that the state government has no funds,” said one of the NHM Ayush doctors. Most of the NHM Ayush doctors have been appointed at primary health centres, subcentres, urban health centres and community health centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-hike-wages-of-ayush-doctors-under-natl-prog/articleshow/82489653.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Across Gujarat, over 100 cases have been reported. At Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad, two wards with 60 beds each have been prepared with experts from different disciplines,” said a senior health department official. The CM told officials to ensure early detection and prevention of the infection by stringent screening at district levels. “Before Covid-19, the prevalence of mucormycosis was rare. But factors such as immuno-compromised status, use of steroids during Covid treatment make patients vulnerable,” said a Civil Hospital official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mucormycosis-ward-in-every-government-hospital-cm/articleshow/82489637.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Electricity duty, NA tax cut for hotel ‘industry’||Mumbai: The hospitality sector, which is struggling in the face of losses suffered as a result of the Covid-19 lockdown in the state, has received a boost with the energy and revenue departments offering electricity duty and non-agriculture (NA) tax to registered hotels at the industrial rate instead of the higher commercial rate. As electricity duty for the industrial sector is charged at 9%, much lower than the 21% for the commercial sector, the overall power charges will go down, giving hotels a major relief. The NA tax for the commercial sector is more than the industrial sector. Inclusion of the hospitality industry in the industrial sector will further bring down costs for hoteliers. “These decisions by both government departments are in line with the state tourism policy announced by the government earlier, which treats the hospitality sector as an industry instead of a commercial activity,” said principal secretary for tourism Valsa Nair Singh. The series of decisions are in line with the new policy and will help hotels reduce tariffs and add tourism infrastructure. “The tourism sector can play a major role in economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic as it has the potential to grow at an annual rate of 8.5% and add Rs 5,500 crore to the state’s GDP. However, the sector is currently losing about 2.8 lakh jobs due to the global pandemic, and hence the need to strengthen the sector,” a tourism department statement said. Though the government has directed the energy department to shift hotel electricity tariffs to industrial rates, this will be implemented only after due process, which requires MERC approvals, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-electricity-duty-na-tax-cut-for-hotel-industry/articleshow/82489679.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

The additional secretary for health, Vikas Gaunekar in a notification said the frontline workers are at the risk of contracting the disease in furtherance of their duties. In a major and much-awaited decision, the government on Monday decided to recognise state and central government employees, workers of banking institutions and journalists, among others, as frontline workers. They will get preference during the upcoming vaccination drive for the age group of 18-44 and also in the ongoing one for those above 45. Those employed in care homes meant for senior citizens, children with disabilities, widows, etc, have also been granted frontline worker status by the state government. Gaunekar said the state and the central government employees will be certified by the respective heads of departments or any officer authorised to certify by them. “All employees of autonomous, semi-government, PSUs of central or state government will be certified by their respective heads of departments or any officer authorized to certify by them,” he said. Gaunekar said that accredited journalists and other media personnel will be certified by the department of information and publicity or any officer authorised to certify. “Employees of banking institutions will be certified by their employer,” he said.

Daily detections in Maharashtra have stabilised for a week now, with over 12 districts reporting a dip in cases. During the call, Thackeray gave details on the measures taken and yet again demanded that oxygen supply to the state be increased. He also gave a brief overview of the planning being done to beat the projected third wave. Thackeray said that the PM and Union government have been guiding Maharashtra in the battle against Covid from the very beginning and that has benefitted the state. He also thanked Modi for accepting suggestions put forth by Maharashtra. According to the state government, among the suggestions made by Maharashtra which were accepted by the Centre were technology transfer to Haffkine Institute to produce vaccines and expanding vaccination to everyone over the age of 18. During the call, Thackeray also gave a brief overview of the state’s plan to beat the projected third wave. “Brief details regarding plans to augment the oxygen production capacity of the state keeping in view the projected third wave and focus on paediatric care during the third wave were shared,” an official said. The state chief secretary had last week written to the cabinet secretary seeking enhancement in the oxygen quota for Maharashtra by at least 200 MT, considering that cases were going up in 16 districts. Maharashtra’s oxygen production capacity is 1,270 MT, which includes major and small producers. Besides, the state is getting 100 MT each from Gujarat, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh. Although the Centre has fixed a quota of 1,814 MT of oxygen for the state, around 1,650 MT is being made available to Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pm-modi-dialled-maharashtra-cm-hailed-covid-fight-says-cmo/articleshow/82489683.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: A card for foster mothers||AHMEDABAD: ‘When I was in Shishu Gruh, an aunty was there. I used to call her Kala Baa. She was like my mother. She took good care of me. I also remember Ritesh Uncle,’ read a letter sent by Kyara, 7, to Shishu Gruh in Paldi on the eve of Mother’s Day. Kyara was adopted two years ago, but has maintained her relationship with her foster home. While kids around the world mark the day with their moms, some can’t connect to their biological mothers. “But that’s why we are here – till the kids live with us, our efforts are always to ensure that they never feel the vacuum of a mother figure,” said Avni Sadhu, a caretaker at Shishu Gruh. It’s a special bond for these women who know that these kids will live with adoptive parents sooner or later. “We know every child’s quirks, their friends, likes and dislikes. Thus, it’s always a long briefing for the new parents,” said Amita Khant, a social worker who lives with the children round the clock. Ritesh Dave, superintendent of Shishu Gruh, said that the children often stay in touch with the organization and their ‘moms.’ “We invariably get calls, messages and sometimes letters on occasions like birthdays, festivals such as Diwali and Mother’s Day. Recently, a child had got Covid. Our caretakers stayed with the kid at SVP Hospital,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/a-card-for-foster-mothers/articleshow/82489530.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Goa||Relatives of deceased patients face ire of distressed hospital workers||MARGAO: Despite the crumbling health infrastructure and rising mortality rate, doctors and nurses have come in for appreciation from all corners for their stellar performance during the pandemic in trying to save lives. However, on the other hand, the daily scenes of death at hospital wards have left many of them facing mental trauma, which has often resulted in the kin of the deceased having to face insensitive remarks and callous behaviour by those dealing with the dead at the hospital. A young doctor attached to Goa Medical College and Hospital had to face the brunt of this insensitive behaviour by a staff nurse on duty at Hospicio hospital, Margao, after his uncle who was undergoing treatment there (non-Covid case), died late Friday night. “He died at around 2am. As it would take time for the Covid test to be conducted on the body, I requested her that the body be preserved until I come back after dropping the family home. I was taken aback by what she told me: We don’t have space in the morgue. You either take the body or I will throw it to the dogs. These crass remarks by the nurse made the wife of the deceased almost faint. This after I had duly identified myself as a GMC doctor,” the doctor, who, like his other colleagues, puts in over 12 hours everyday trying to save lives at GMC, told TOI. The frontline healthcare worker, who requested anonymity for obvious reasons, stressed on the need for sensitising the staff dealing with the dead. “The family of the deceased is already in a state of mental trauma. Insulting them with such insensitive remarks is definitely not an acceptable behaviour by any standards. Nobody should face such behaviour, least of all from trained medical personnel at a hospital,” the doctor said. Navnath Khandeparkar, chairman, International Human Rights Association (IHRA), Goa state branch, has strongly condemned the “inhumane” treatment meted out to the GMC doctor at the Hospicio hospital. “Human dignity should be upheld even after a person loses his battle for life. This type of behaviour by the hospital staff with the family of the deceased, which is already under severe distress, is not acceptable,” Khandeparkar told TOI. Instances abound of the kin of the deceased having to face insensitive remarks, even from senior doctors when questioned about matters pertaining to the death. Similar situation prevails in the South Goa district hospital, too, where inquiries by the kin of the deceased are met with stoic indifference by the staff. Just last week, in what could be termed as a case of mismanagement or a goof-up, the family of the patient was intimated about his death, only to later realise that the patient was very much alive and undergoing treatment in a Covid ward. Though this brought some relief to the kin, the incident brought to the fore the need for streamlining death management in government hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/relatives-of-deceased-patients-face-ire-of-distressed-hospital-workers/articleshow/82489686.cms||---
---||Goa||Triage centre at South Goa hospital for patients with flu-like symptoms||MARGAO: A triage centre has been opened in the South Goa district hospital to screen patients turning up with flu-like symptoms. The facility, similar to a Flu OPD, has become functional from Saturday. Co-administrator of the hospital Dr Rajesh Patil said that the objective of setting up the triage centre was to prevent crowding of suspected asymptomatic patients inside the hospital’s casualty ward. “Doctors will examine the patient at the triage centre and send them for home isolation. Serious patients will be, to the extent possible, given entry into the casualty where their condition will be assessed and admitted in the hospital,” Patil said. The shifting of Covid testing facility from the South Goa district hospital to Ravindra Bhavan, Margao, since Thursday evening has facilitated setting up the triage centre. Both rapid antigen testing and swab collection for RT-PCR will be done at the testing facility at Ravindra Bhavan, Margao, and will remain open from 8am to 8pm, including Sundays, said a press release by medical superintendent of South Goa district hospital Dr Deepa Correia Afonso. Although the South Goa district hospital has been recently upgraded to 500 beds from 390-odd earlier, there has been no scaling up of medical and paramedical personnel. Consequently, the already-overstressed doctors and nurses have to attend to an increasing number of patients, thereby stretching manpower resources further. “We have over 500 beds in the South Goa district hospital now, however, we are still facing shortage of beds,” Patil said, adding that the oxygen supply to the hospital has now been streamlined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/triage-centre-at-south-goa-hospital-for-patients-with-flu-like-symptoms/articleshow/82489691.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rly uses lockdown period to fix ‘danger’ spot at Mahim||Mumbai: Taking advantage of thin train traffic since last year’s lockdown, the railways have fixed a “risky” stretch of track near Mahim, paving the way for trains to run faster on this bend, railway officials claimed. Four years ago, five commuters had been injured after a local train derailed at this sharp curve, hampering smooth movement of trains, and speed restriction being imposed at the spot. Now, Western Railway has overhauled the track geometry here, amid the lockdown. The derailment in August 2017 was an embarrassment for Western Railway as the commissioner of railway safety ordered suspension of services as the authorities had been carrying out train operation without the mandatory safety certification. At that time, a stop-gap arrangement was put in place to ensure running of services, albeit with speed restrictions. Also, no diversion of train was allowed from one track to another due to the sharp curves along the tracks. WR’s chief public relations officer Sumit Thakur said, “We wanted to improve the yard but undertaking work by disrupting the suburban timetable for extended period of time was challenging. Taking advantage of the lockdown we began work in June 2020 to ensure all bottlenecks are removed.” There were four points where trains change tracks where the curvature was sharp. Sources said that the curvature was more than 8 degrees which is “dangerous” and could cause derailment. Thakur said, “ We had to re-lay the track with curves which do not limit speed of trains and are not extremely sharp. However, space was a constraint for which we had to remove the columns and pillars on which water supply lines rested. BMCcooperated by diverting water supply through an alternative pipe. We also created more space by diverting storm water drain lines. Also, the platform at which CSMT-bound trains halt at Mahim had to be cut to ensure smooth curves for trains entering the platform.” The lines built for Harbour line trains rakes at Mahimcould not be used as the track geometry. Thakur said, that since the track geometry has been fixed now, Central Railway can stable three of its trains rakes at this stabling line.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rly-uses-lockdown-period-to-fix-danger-spot-at-mahim/articleshow/82489781.cms||Manthank Mehta

Sawant said that he learned from social media posts and videos that there are crowds and long queues outside grocery and vegetable stores. “All markets are overcrowded, and people should not crowd,” Sawant said, adding that overcrowding could lead to the spread of Covid. On Friday, Sawant announced a 15-day state-level curfew from Sunday to May 23. During these days, shops selling essential commodities will be open from 7am to 1pm (as against the earlier order that stated 7am to 7pm). Sawant said that the curfew decision was taken considering the sentiments of all sections of society, the rise in Covid cases, and the increasing pressure on the medical fraternity. “At least now, 100% of people should stay indoors,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shops-will-be-open-cm-reassures-panicking-public/articleshow/82489801.cms||---

As per official records of the state public health department on May 6, since the vaccination drive was launched, 9.4 lakh people in the 45-plus category have been administered Covaxin, but 5.5 lakh have not got the second dose even after four weeks owing to non-availability, reports Prafulla Marpakwar. However, the BMC will on Sunday hold vaccination for people over 45, seeking either the first or second doses, using the stocks it has so far. The sessions will be held between noon and 5 pm. Meanwhile, on Saturday, BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said the civic corporation has adequate stocks to carry out one more day of vaccination. “We hope we will get stocks on Sunday or Monday so that the drive isn’t interrupted,” he said. On Saturday, additional chief secretary (public health) Pradeep Vyas also wrote to Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan urging him to make available sufficient quantities of Covaxin doses to cater to those due for a second dose in the 45-plus age-group. “As was being instructed in various video conferences by the Government of India that no buffer be kept for second doses, so no doses have been kept as reserve by the state government and now the situation is very precarious. We have not received any quantity of Covaxin for the 45-plus age group since long and as a result, Maharashtra is unable to provide the second dose to those who have completed more than four weeks after the first dose and in some cases, even six weeks. It is leading to a lot of discontentment in the public,’’ Vyas said in his brief letter. NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik condemned the Central government for “complete mess” in allotment of vaccines to the state government. “PM must fix the responsibility for the mess,” Malik tweeted. On Saturday, in Mumbai, 58,906 people took the Covid-19 vaccine. While 4,698 were in the 18-44 age-group, 22,146 were those above 45. The city has so far managed to vaccinate 26 lakh people. On Saturday, sessions were conducted for the 18-44 age-group at eight BMC centres such as BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central, the jumbo facility at BKC, Seven Hills Hospital in Andheri, Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar, Cooper Hospital in Juhu and Chunabhatti maternity home and community hall in Bandra. In the private sector, HN Reliance Hospital in Girgaum vaccinated 842 people, while Nanavati Hospital in Juhu managed 740 vaccinations. On Friday, the state managed to vaccinate 3.6 lakh people, taking the total shots given to 1.7 crore since January 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covaxin-supply-in-maharashtra-running-dry-5-5-lakh-45-now-past-2nd-jab-window/articleshow/82489819.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Virtually tasking the NTF to draw an ambitious and futuristic national plan for the health sector, from combating the present pandemic to shoring up rural health infrastructure, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah asked the cabinet secretary to be the convenor of the group and said the expert body will, within a week, provide the formula for need-based, dynamic allocation of medical oxygen to states and UTs. A more comprehensive plan, including other aspects of healthcare, will be submitted in six months. Accepting the Centre's suggestions for a broad-based expert committee to decide allocation of oxygen to the states, the bench said setting up of NTF became a necessity because of a growing need for "an effective and transparent mechanism" for allocation of oxygen during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the Delhi government complaining loudly that it is not receiving the SC-mandated 700MT of oxygen daily. The bench said the Centre had no option but to maintain a daily supply of 700MT oxygen to the national capital. Justices Chandrachud and Shah said the NTF is meant to facilitate a public health response based on specialised domain knowledge. “We expect that the leading experts in the country shall associate with the work of the task force, both as members and resource persons. This will facilitate a meeting of minds and the formulation of scientific strategies to deal with an unprecedented human crisis.” Members of the NTF are Bhabatosh Biswas, ex-VC of West Bengal University of Health Sciences, Kolkata; Devender Singh Rana and Saumitra Rawat, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi; Devi Prasad Shetty, Narayana Healthcare, Bengaluru; Gagandeep Kang and J V Peter, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu; Naresh Trehan, Medanta, Gurgaon; Rahul Pandit, Fortis Hospital, Mumbai; Shiv Kumar Sarin, Institute of Liver and Biliary Science, Delhi; Dr Zarir F Udwadia, Mumbai; and Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan. The Justice Chandrachud-led bench gave a six month tenure to the task force, which could be extended. The NTF would also look into streamlining transportation and distribution channels and set up state-wise sub-groups to audit the distribution and utilisation of oxygen rationally. “The Union government shall continue with the practice of making allocations of oxygen until the task force has submitted its recommendations... The Union government shall, on receipt of the recommendations of the task force, take an appropriate decision,” it ordered. The NTF’s terms of reference are: “Assess and recommend for the entire country, based on the need for, availability and distribution of medical oxygen; formulate and devise methodology for the allocation to states and UTs on a scientific, rational and equitable basis; recommend augmentation of oxygen supplies based on present and projected demands likely during the pandemic and suggest a mechanism for periodical review.” The SC tasked the NTF to set up sub-groups within each state and UT for determining: (a) whether supplies allocated by the Union government reach the state/UT concerned, (b) efficacy of distribution networks meant for hospitals, healthcare institutions and others, (c) whether available stocks are being distributed on basis of an effective, transparent and professional mechanism and (d) accountability in regard to utilisation of the supplies of oxygen allocated to each state/UT. The NTF will also review measures for ensuring availability of essential drugs. “The NTF will plan and adopt remedial measures for ensuring preparedness to meet present and future emergencies,” it said, adding “The task force may consider it appropriate to co-opt or seek the assistance of other experts within or outside the government.” Watch Covid-19: SC sets up national task force to overhaul allocation of oxygen to states||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-ropes-in-experts-for-national-task-force-to-overhaul-allocation-of-o2-to-states/articleshow/82489728.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The company is into manufacturing and exports of medical diagnostics products. The firm did not respond to emails and phone calls seeking their comment. The company had provided the swab sticks for packing to Manish Keshwani, a supplier of swab sticks, who had outsourced the packing to slum dwellers in Sant Gyaneshwar Nagar. The police have already arrested Keshwani who paid women and children involved Rs 20 for 1,000 packets. Suresh Mekala, holding the additional charge of Thane police commissioner told TOI, “Sen and Hegde had supplied swab sticks to Keshwani for packing purpose. Further probe is on.” After arresting the duo on Saturday, the police produced them before the Ulhasngar sessions court, which has remanded them to police custody till May 13. The police are yet to seize the packed swab sticks which Keshwani had earlier claimed to have delivered in Nashik. On Saturday, he claimed to have delivered it in Thane too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rt-pcr-swab-stick-scam-2-bigwigs-from-thane-co-held/articleshow/82489831.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Goa||Build Covid care teams to aid those in need, Church urges parishes||PANAJI: In order to aid people who are in a state of fear and panic, Goa Archdiocese’ social work wing has appealed to each parish to build up Covid care teams of volunteers and work in collaboration with village panchayats and municipalities and utilise funds from the Church coffers. The Council for Social Justice and Peace has stated that these teams can run information desks in collaboration with local bodies and provide affected people with assistance, including procuring and distributing essentials including medicines, home isolation kits from health centres to people’s doorsteps, arranging cooked food, accompanying persons living alone for vaccinations and monitoring vital levels, including oxygen saturation of people living alone. The council has also suggested that the teams also assist in admitting positive cases in hospitals whenever required, help families complete burial and cremation formalities and offer emotional support and counselling to lonely and distressed. Wherever possible, they can also help in providing isolation/quarantine space for individuals or families in Church institutions with organised assistance. These will “bring some solace to our people in these trying circumstances of their life,” director Fr Maverick Fernandes. “Let us be proactive in searching for those in need, instead of waiting to be approached for help. These are moments of anguish and pain which can best be faced holding hands together in a spirit of genuine collaboration and wholehearted support for one another,” Fernandes stated. “The financial resources for all these initiatives could be accessed, to the extent possible, from the Good Samaritan Fund of the Parish or from the various church bodies (Fabricas, Cofres, Confrarias, etc) or even from the Good Samaritan Fund of the Diocese. The present appeal has the full approval and strong endorsement of our Archbishop,” he stated. The Covid care teams can comprise selected members from parish pastoral council, youth, other lay associations as well as men and women religious. The Diocesan Team can guide in setting up Covid care teams. The Diocesan team comprises Fr Maverick Fernandes, director, Caritas-Goa (9423888255), Fr Jorge Fernandes, director, DCLA (9764683953), Fr Savio Fernandes, executive secretary, CSJP (9326428375), Amancio Fernandes, president, SSVP (7083232184), Lily Pereira, North-coordinator, SSVP, (9822362562), Sr Monica Kujur, social worker (7448071108); Dr Amit Dias, member St Luke’s Medical Guild (9822382842), and Clevy D’Souza, nurse (8698641554).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/build-covid-care-teams-to-aid-those-in-need-church-urges-parishes/articleshow/82489857.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra assures to hike stipend, resume spl pay to resident doctors||MUMBAI: Resident doctors in BMC hospitals will have more than one reason to rejoice if assurance turns into reality. Not only did the civic body assure that it would restart the monthly Covid allowance of Rs 10,000 but also agreed to increase their monthly stipend of Rs 55,000 by another Rs 10,000 that was cleared by the state government last year. In January, the doctors’ Covid stipend was stopped after cases plummeted and the hike in stipend that was cleared in September 2020 was never implemented. The doctors had launched a social media campaign and demanded their arrears. They posted pictures in PPE suits and aprons with a message #BMCBetrayedUs and #BetrayedStillWorking from Covid wards. “We have been assured that our stipend will be increased, and the Covid special allowance will also be paid,” said a Maharashtra State Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) representative. “Arrears too have been assured. However while we have received assurances earlier too, but never received the payment. So we will wait till we actually get the sum in our bank accounts,” said another MARD member. While the doctors were getting Rs 10,000 per month for Covid work from May last year, they were told that it was an advance towards the hike in stipends announced in March. Their stipend was hiked in September and a circular to that effect for BMC hospitals was released in March. The doctors were expecting arrears of Rs 1.2 lakh each for their hiked stipend. The BMC, however, has told them that they were already paid the amount in advance. Meanwhile, senior residents, too, await clarification on their demands. They want their promotions and their final exams to be scrapped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-assures-to-hike-stipend-resume-spl-pay-to-resident-docs/articleshow/82489981.cms||---

The theft occurred within 11 days after one of the accused, Shyamsundar Yadav, was hired on April 4 as a domestic help and left for his hometown claiming that he had to attend his brother’s marriage. “While leaving he introduced his relative, who stole more valuables before leaving for Bihar within 12 days after he was hired claiming that his wife had died,” said police senior inspector Balasaheb Salunkhe. The theft came to light when the senior citizen’s daughter visited the house and noticed cash and other valuables missing. The victim’s daughter, in her complaint, said, “I got suspicious when both the helpers quit jobs and rushed to their hometowns.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-domestic-helps-held-for-stealing-rs-rs-4l-booty-from-sr-citizens-house/articleshow/82490024.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘I wear her oversized blouses’: A daughter’s eulogy for her mother||The airhostess on the Shirdi-bound flight had clicked a picture of the braid of mogra framing Vatsala Patil’s jet-black hairbun in November 2018 when the arthritic 58-year-old had floated above the clouds for the first time, walking stick in tow. The same row of plastic jasmine had adorned Patil again on her second skyward journey in 2019 with all her Bhajan mandali friends for whom she had booked tickets so that they too shared her bird’s eye view. During her third—and final—pilgrimage to the heavens, though, the only flowers accompanying Patil would be stray lilies plucked from the grounds of the Chakala crematorium by her distraught second daughter, Sarita Vaity, who was unable to fulfil any of her mother's last wishes: “Don’t cry when I die. Paint my nails and put lipstick on me.” On June 18 last year, 60-year-old Patil—the robust mother of four who had survived a string of debilitating knee and kidney surgeries—succumbed to Covid. That day, Vaity’s younger sister, Nayna, a nurse working in the ICU in which Patil breathed her last, found herself giving her warm mother a cold farewell: bathing her and wrapping her in a hospital gown before her corpse was sent off to the crematorium. Many in the Warkari community of Kalyan taluka would hold live virtual wakes to mourn the passing of their beloved “Vasa bai”, who would turn up at local shrines with her imported knee to recite kirtans and to innocently boast to her friends: “My Kusum is a teacher”, “My Pankaj is a saheb.” “She could not say software engineer,” recalls 44-year-old Vaity, who wears her mother’s oversized green blouses sometimes to feel her rustic warmth. “She was illiterate but she was never lacking in worldly wisdom,” adds Vaity, citing not only the mother of four’s ready offers of tea to known passersby but also her resilience that once saw Patil hawking baskets full of cluster beans in Ambivali’s Atali village when her husband lost his job. “She would make Rs 500 a day by selling vegetables. This would make her so happy that she would buy us all chikkat halwa on her way back,” says Vaity, reminiscing the times when she and her siblings would sit with their legs folded to enjoy theconfection. “I’m a community head. What will people think?” Vaity’s father would often protest when his cleanliness-obsessed wife would put him up to the task of wiping high glass windows in the house. Patil’s strict sanitary standards extended to her speech too. “She never fought with my father in front of us. We’ve never uttered a single bad word in our lives,” says Vaity. Her mother’s clean tongue was used to slurping cupfuls of tea “boiling hot” and to sticking itself out when presented with chai made from factory-produced pasteurized milk. “She only accepted tea made from fresh buffalo milk,” says Vaity. From puran polis to karanjis, her mother could ace them all but Vaity pines for her methi ladoos the most. “You simply could not eat just one,” says Vaity, reminiscing the devout mother who would sustain herself on packets of homemade shankarpali and chaklis on her annual walking pilgrimages to Pandharpur. “Let the vermilion on my forehead stay on for life,” Patil would chant inaudibly as she rolled prayer beads at home. While the mother’s prayer was answered, the daughter’s wasn’t. “Why are you bringing us birthday cakes when your mother is in the ICU?” patients in the Covid centre in Mulund where she teaches Yoga had asked Vaity in June last year when her mother had sipped spoonfuls of cough syrup in vain till she realised that Covid had stealthily attacked her robust lungs in June 2020. Vaity didn’t tell them that it was her way of pleasing god into sparing her mother’s life. The bribes fared miserably. Not only did Covid claim her 60-year-old sturdy mother who “had never lost a single tooth and didn’t have a single strand of grey hair” but also her 54-year-old husband, right after both their medical reports had promised progress. “My mother would not have been able to swallow my widowhood,” sobs Vaity. “That’s probably why she was taken away early,” adds the 44-year-old single mother, lamenting society’s callous attitude towards a virus that—within a matter of days—had turned her life to rubble. The knee implant, the jasmine braid, the nine-yard saris, the walking stick, the clean windows and the broken husband will all be there next month on June 1, when Vaity and her three siblings—who do not know their mother's real birthdate—will celebrate Patil's “school admission birthdate” with chikkat halwa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-i-wear-her-oversized-blouses-a-daughters-eulogy-for-her-mother/articleshow/82490026.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Community leaders use zakat fund to enable members pushed into poverty||A recent photograph of Mirza Abdul Qayyum Nadvi ironing clothes at a laundry unit gave jitters to many of his friends. Nadvi is a bookseller and campaigns for mohalla libraries. Friends enquired if, due to the devastating pandemic-induced lockdown, he has fallen on bad times and found a new job at a laundry. He is well off and has actually bought the necessary tools to open a laundry to a man who lost job due to the lockdown during this second wave of Covid-19. He bought the tools with Zakat money, the 2.5% of annual savings all Muslims must give in charity. Though zakat can be given anytime through the year, most Muslims do it in Ramzan because every good deed done in this holy month gets divine blessings 70 times more than in any other month. “Doling out zakat to the same group of seekers year after year is like perpetuating poverty. The purpose of zakat should be to turn zakat seekers into zakat givers,” said Nadvi, a graduate from Lucknow-based Islamic seminary Nadwatul Ulema. Nadvi is one of many in the community who increasingly think that the zakat fund should be used to remove poverty in the community. Since a share of the zakat funds go to madrassas, they say that all the zakat money should not go to madrassas alone and efforts must be made to make the needy families self-reliant. “I feel that zakat givers should form groups and adopt some of the poor families. Support these families for a couple of years in every way till some of their members start earning. Stop the support till these families become self-reliant. This way the zakat seekers will become zakat givers in a couple of years,” says Sohail Khandwani, managing trustee of Mahim Dargah and trustee of Haji Ali Dargah. Many feel religious scholars should be roped in to popularize the concept that the zakat fund should be used to remove poverty. “I am not for snuffing out the zakat money to madrassas because these seminaries depend on charity from the community. However, a mechanism should be formed to create a collective zakat fund and money should be used to empower the community,” explains M Asif Farooqui, general secretary, City Congress. A couple of years ago philanthropist and educationist Dr M A Patankar called a huge meeting in the city to create a Baitulmaal or collective fund. Though he didn’t get the kind of support he expected, it made him aware of the need to empower the community educationally and economically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-community-leaders-use-zakat-fund-to-enable-members-pushed-into-poverty/articleshow/82490078.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

The compensation will have to be paid by the owner of the offending car, Sachin Patil, and New India Assurance Co Ltd. While 40% out of total compensation amount will be paid to the victim Sunil Rasal’s wife, his three minor children will receive 10% each. The remaining 30% will be divided equally between his parents. The family submitted their claim in November 2017. On August 27, 2017 when Sunil was on his way home in Thane, a car which was being driven at high and excessive speed, rammed into him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-56l-payout-to-kin-of-cook-who-died-in-accident/articleshow/82490123.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Lockdown has been harsh for estranged moms||Every International Mothers’ Day, the fourth floor children's complex at Thane’s Family Court would witness a bunch of women playing games with their kids aged 3 to 18 years. One of these involved passing photographs of strangers and trying to guess the “emotions and expressions” of the person in it. From their own happy expressions during this annual party, it would be hard to tell the mothers with custody of their kids from those without but they were there, trying as usual to maximize time with their estranged children here just as they would every alternate Saturday in two shifts between 11am and 6pm, their sanctioned access time. Among these rare mothers in exile were Nashik’s Rachna Deshmukh (name changed) who would travel five hours armed with pumpkin pooris shaped like stars and half-moons for her five-year-old and Thane-based Amruta Nalawade (name changed) — an obsessive-compulsive-disorder patient — who would try to gently introduce her resentful teenaged son to the fact that she wasn’t “mental”. But he would refuse to call me ‘mummy’,” recalls Nalawade about her fraught meetings with the eleventh-grader who recently unblocked her on WhatsApp. Given that the law generally awards custody of kids to the mother in most divorce cases, barring instances in which there are serious allegations against her such as child abuse, the stories of mothers — who are striving to prove themselves financially and emotionally capable of joint custody — remain largely untold. For these pining women — who are only allowed to meet their kids under supervision in gardens, coffee shops and malls apart from the monitored interactions in court — the pandemic-induced distance has been particularly grueling. Recently, a desperate Deshmukh — who had last seen her daughter’s face on a video call on the little one’s birthday on March 30 last year—approached the court for special permission for meeting her in person this birthday. Deshmukh was asked to produce a Covid report. “Since I tested positive, I could not meet her,” says the 34-year-old, who wished her chirpy, moody daughter over a 45-minute video call.  “I could not tell if she had grown taller. I could only see her face,” says Deshmukh, adding that her husband’s family does not allow her daughter to make video calls on messenger apps. During their regular phone conversations, her six-year-old—oblivious to why her parents had been living separately for five years—fills her in on everything from how she liked the frock her mother sent her for Diwali last year to the mango pickle she would like her to bring during the next court meeting. At such times, Deshmukh lies: “I must stay here for my job” or “There’s a virus outside.” “I’m not even allowed to attend her PTA meetings in school,” says Deshmukh, who worries that she would miss her mother when puberty hits. She is now looking for a job in Thane in the hope that she would win “half custody”of her child which means: “she’d spend six months a year with me and six months with my husband.” Nalawade, who says she has recovered from her OCD through intensive cognitive behaviour therapy sessions, is now not only trying to win the approval of the neighbours in the building in which she stays on her own but also the affection of her son who lives ten minutes away. In January, when her husband had allowed her son to spend one whole day at her place, she had introduced him to her neighbour’s kids and prepared his favourites — sheera and bhindi bhaji. “I asked him if he remembered these being the staples of his school tiffin,” says Nalawade. “He didn’t.” Yet, something other than her therapy-induced deliberate positivity tells her he will come around soon. “He messages me asking if I have eaten,” she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lockdown-has-been-harsh-for-estranged-moms/articleshow/82490125.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

They have been in jail for around 45 days. A fifth accused, an 18-year-old girl who he was teased about, was also granted anticipatory bail. “However, the deceased Ravindra Savardekar had an option to lodge the report against the accused if at all he was being felt any mental harassment,” the court said. Savardekar had taken his life on March 18 at Andheri. Four persons were arrested two days later. The court also pointed out that while the investigations were completed, the filling of the chargesheet and conclusion of the trial would take its own time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/suicide-not-provoked-by-teasing-in-mumbai-4-get-bail-in-case/articleshow/82490128.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rtd babu gets post wk after inquiry notice||Mumbai: In a move that has created a stir in bureaucracy, retired officer V K Gautam has been appointed as officer on special duty (OSD) of the sensitive irrigation department a week after an inquiry was proposed against him for alleged irregularities in awarding of contracts for the Commonwealth Games (CWG) held in Delhi in 2010. Earlier, Gautam had served there on deputation. Gautam retired as the additional chief secretary of the irrigation department on April 30. He was served a notice from the Centre’s Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on the same day, saying an inquiry was proposed against him for alleged irregularities in the awarding of contracts during his tenure as chief operating officer on the CWG’s organising committee. His appointment as the OSD of the irrigation department, which has budgets running into hundreds of crores, came a week later, on May 7. In 2012, Gautam had been named in the CBI chargesheet on the CWG scam along with former chairman of the organising committee Suresh Kalmadi and others. He later became a star witness against Kalmadi in the case. In the notice addressed to Gautam on April 30, the DoPT has outlined the charges against him during his tenure on the CWG’s organising committee from 2007 to 2009. “The Central government proposes to hold inquiry proceedings for major penalty against him under Rule 8 of the All India Service (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969,” the notice says. The notice from the DoPT was routed to Gautam through the office of the state chief secretary. It asks him to respond to the charges in writing within a month. The charges laid out in the DoPT’s notice claim that Gautam had allegedly inserted a clause in contract documents to favour a Swiss firm and a consultancy firm, which had formed a consortium. It claims that Gautam had held discussions with the consultancy firm although he was not authorised to do so. It claims that he did not take approvals for such actions from those authorised. Gautam told TOI: “Until my retirement at 6.30pm on April 30, I had not received any notice for a departmental inquiry against me. Even today, I have not received anything. I have been appointed by the government on a contractual basis in the same department I retired from.” On the CWG case, Gautam said, “No corruption charges were ever made against me. In fact, I am the star witness against Kalmadi in the case.” Sources close to the retired officer claimed that a notice served by the DoPT for a departmental inquiry after retirement is “infructuous”. Defending the appointment, irrigation minister Jayant Patil from the NCP said, “Gautam has superannuated on April 30. To my knowledge, no charges for departmental inquiry had been served on him till then. No case under Prevention of Corruption Act has been made against him till date.” Bureaucratic circles say the retention of retired officials on contracts is not a healthy trend. “There is no accountability for such officials. In the case of a clash between the department secretary and officer on a post-retirement contract, who will prevail?” asked a senior officer. Radheshyam Mopalwar, who retired in 2018, continues to head the MSRDC, which is overseeing implementation of key projects such as the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway and the Bandra-Versova Sea Link. MMRDA chief R A Rajeev was given a three-month extension on a contract after he retired at the end of March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rtd-babu-gets-post-wk-after-inquiry-notice/articleshow/82489011.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||India||India, UK variants equally transmissible, finds study||HYDERABAD: Public Health England, the executive agency of the UK department of health, has equated the novel coronavirus sub-lineage, B.1.617.2 of Indian variant or double mutant B.1.617, with the UK strain B.1.1.7 in terms of transmission rate. This sub-lineage was earlier declared as a 'variant of concern'. Apart from the UK, the sub-lineage B.1.617.2 is prevalent in Maharashtra and other parts of India. Its presence, however, is yet to be established in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, though the main variant, B.1.617, is present in the Telugu states. The UK variant B.1.1.7 is also found in the Telugu states to a lesser extent. Covid live updatesAccording to the latest update of novel coronavirus variants by Public Health England, B.1.617.2 is assessed as at least as transmissible as B.1.1.7 with moderate confidence. Read AlsoCoinciding with panchayat polls, Covid-19 cases soared 120% within a monthThe massive exercise to hold panchayat polls in Uttar Pradesh, whose four phases saw at least 9 cr voters and about 12 lakh govt servants and security personnel, coincided with a sharp surge in Covid-19 cases in the state. From Jan 30, 2020, and April 4, 2021 UP recorded 6.3 lakh Covid-91 cases. InThis is biologically plausible based on the mutation profile. "It can compete with B.1.1.7 in the population and modelled growth estimates, suggesting transmissibility at least equal to B.1.1.7," the UK health agency said. Referring to its neutralising potential against known Covid-19 vaccines, the report said as of now there is insufficient data to assess the potential for immune escape. "B.1.617.2 has spread rapidly in India based on available data. In some regions, S gene target data suggests that this variant may be more frequent than is indicated by the current sequence data, due to the lag in sequencing, and may have replaced B.1.1.7 to some extent. Modelled growth estimates suggest that the variant is at least as transmissible as B.1.1.7," the report added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-uk-variants-equally-transmissible-finds-study/articleshow/82490306.cms||Syed Akbar

At present, these two hospitals operate under the Grant Medical College. “I have asked the medical education department to submit a proposal for setting up a new medical college as early as possible. We will use the infrastructure of the two hospitals for the new medical college,” Deshmukh said. Deshmukh held a prolonged meeting with medical education director T P Lahane,J J Hospital dean Ranjeet Mankeshwar and St George's Hospital medical superintendent Akash Khobragade. St George's Hospital has 282 beds, while G T Hospital has 220 beds and the government can start a medical college with 100 seats. The minister reviewed the preparedness of St George's Hospital for tackling the Covid-19 situation. St George's was the first government hospital in Mumbai to develop basic infrastructure with oxygen plants, ventilators and even ICU facilities for treatment of Covid patients. Deshmukh said since St George's Hospital has been designated as a Covid hospital, extra measures must be taken for better healthcare. A senior professor welcomed the decision of an independent college, but said Deshmukh must take steps to end ad-hocism in medical colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/gt-st-georges-hosps-to-have-independent-medical-college-in-mumbai-min/articleshow/82490372.cms||---

Many poor countries are offering help to India. Earlier, countries like Pakistan, Rwanda and Congo used to get help from others. But due to the wrong policies of today’s rulers, India is going through that situation now,” the Sena said. “The country is currently surviving, thanks to the development works, projects set up by and the confidence given by the previous governments of Pandit Nehru, (Lal Bahadur) Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, P V Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh,” it said. The Sena, in an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamna, said: “The Unicef has expressed fear that there is a threat to the world from India due to the pace at which coronavirus is spreading in the country. It has also made an appeal that a maximum number of countries should help India in its fight against Covid-19. Bangladesh has sent 10,000 remdesivir vials while Bhutan has sent medical oxygen. Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka have also offered help to ‘aatmanirbhar’ India.” The Sena said while smaller countries in the neighbourhood are offering help to India to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is not even ready to stop work on the multi-crore Central Vista project worth Rs 20,000 crore.  The redevelopment project of the Central Vista envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common Central Secretariat and revamping of the three-kilometre-long Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and new residences for the prime minister and the vice-president. The Sena said even as the world is battling a second Covid-19 wave, experts have predicted the third wave will be more severe. The ruling BJP, though, is doing all it can to corner Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal even today, it said. “A sensitive and a nationalist government would not have thought about the political pros and cons and set up a national panel of all main political parties to discuss ways to defeat the pandemic,” the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said. BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has demanded that Union minister Nitin Gadkari be given charge of the health ministry and this is a proof that the current union health ministry has been a complete failure, it added.PTI||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-india-is-surviving-on-system-nehru-gandhis-created-sena/articleshow/82489020.cms||---

The committee will study and analyse the Supreme Court verdict. We expect the committee to guide us on options before the government within 15 days. A decision on whether to file a review petition will be taken on the basis of recommendations made by the committee,” Chavan said. Chavan presided over the meeting, which was attended by home minister Dilip Walse Patil, urban development minister Eknath Shinde, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and general administration department secretary Kishore Raje Nimbalkar. Chavan said the chief secretary has been asked to review the pending recruitments under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act from Monday. “We expect Kunte to take a review with all secretaries and complete the task in a time-bound manner,” he said. Further, Chavan said the apex court has granted protection to the candidates selected before September 9, 2020 as per provisions of the Act. The chief secretary is expected to take a review of all those candidates selected before September 9 who were not given appointment letters. “We are keen to do justice to all the candidates who were selected, but not appointed. The CS will submit a report,” he said. The Supreme Court said the Maratha quota law was unconstitutional as it was passed after the 102nd amendment to the Constitution, which stated that a state government does not have the right to provide for reservation. Chavan said that the privileges committee of Parliament had observed that the amendment would not have any adverse impact on the government’s powers to provide for reservation. However, during the hearing of the special leave petition before the apex court, the attorney general mentioned that in view of the amendment, states have lost their powers. Chavan said in view of calls from across the state, the government has decided to appoint additional collectors in each district for redressal of grievances of Maratha candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maratha-quota-panel-headed-by-retd-hc-judge-to-study-sc-order-in-mumbai/articleshow/82490799.cms||---
---||India||CWC meet on Monday to dissect dismal poll show||NEW DELHI: Congress Working Committee will meet on Monday to discuss the party performance in the recent five state elections that Congress chief Sonia Gandhi has termed "disappointing". The apex body of Congress comprises senior loyalists like former PM Manmohan Singh, A K Antony, as also the Gandhi siblings, besides dissidents belonging to G-23 group Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma. The discussion may turn out to be a serious dissection of gaps in the party's functioning which the G-23 had earlier flagged while making demands for reforms like internal elections down to the block level and collective decision making. According to pollster Shashi Shekhar Singh of Ground Zero Research, which did extensive work in Bengal polls and whose prediction was on the mark, Congress lost its Muslim strongholds of Malda and Murshidabad to TMC because it chose to target Mamata after the Sitalkuchi incident in which five persons including four Muslims were killed in CISF firing. While the force claimed it acted in self defence, Mamata called it a “genocide”. Scoffed Singh, “After Sitalkuchi incident, Congress leaders attacked Mamata Banerjee and they were expecting that Muslims would vote for them. What a strategy.” The defeats are viewed as serious because Congress failed to win Kerala which has a tradition to alternating between LDF and UDF, besides ending up behind ruling BJP in Assam and getting washed out in West Bengal. Also, senior leaders of G-23 like Azad were kept out of the election campaign despite Assam, Bengal and Kerala, having high Muslim populations. The poll strategy adopted in states may come under fire as many Congressmen believe that the party erred in targeting TMC chief Mamata Banerjee when she was facing an aggressive BJP in Bengal. Congress drew a blank in the state. Similarly, Congress insiders have also slammed the tie-up with ISF led by a Muslim cleric in Bengal. At the same time, party leaders have also questioned the alliance with Muslim outfit AIUDF of Badruddin Ajmal. Sources said the party may also discuss the Central Vista project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cwc-meet-on-monday-to-dissect-dismal-poll-show/articleshow/82490809.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

---||India||PM Modi seeks EU's support for TRIPS, EU says not a magic solution||NEW DELHI: The first India-EU Leaders' Meeting Saturday saw a major boost to trade ties with the 2 sides agreeing to resume negotiations, which had remained suspended since 2013, for balanced and comprehensive free trade and investment agreements. Described by the government as an unprecedented occasion when PM Narendra Modi was a special invitee at the EU Council meeting, the summit saw Modi calling for EU’s support for India's joint proposal with South Africa for a TRIPS waiver on vaccine production-related patents. While the US has supported the proposal, as MEA secretary (west) Vikas Swarup said after the virtual being, the EU’s support at WTO for this waiver will ensure that India can scale up the vaccine production for equitable and global access and save lives. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted after the meeting that while EU was ready to discuss "other proposals" for improving access to vaccines, it was important for countries to lift restrictions on vaccine export. EU leaders also urged US to first remove its curbs on vaccine export before getting into any discussion on patent waiver that may augment production in the future. European Council chief Charles Michel was also quoted as saying that the proposed waiver wasn't a magic solution. "PM appreciated the EU’s swift response for mobilizing support to India’s COVID-19 response. As you would recall, India had kept its supply chains open during the first wave of COVID-19 last year and supplied essential drugs and masks to several EU countries. The EU’s current assistance is an example of trusted partners supporting each other in times of need," said Swarup. A joint statement said the 2 sides supported universal, safe, equitable and affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics and treatments, and the strengthening of health systems. Modi had sought support from Australian PM Scott Morrison too for patent waiver on Friday. The 2 sides also agreed on a comprehensive Connectivity Partnership outlining a shared desire to promote a "transparent, viable, inclusive, sustainable, comprehensive, and rules-based connectivity". The summit saw the participation of leaders of all 27 EU Member States as well as the President of the European Council and the European Commission. The connectivity initiative was also said to reflect the ambition of both sides to build on their synergies and pursue sustainable joint projects in third countries, most notably in the Africa, Central Asia and Indo-Pacific region. This will open up new avenues of cooperation for both sides, according to the government. The government said in a statement that negotiations on both the trade and investment agreements will be pursued on parallel tracks with an intention to achieve early conclusion of the agreements together. "This is a major outcome which will enable the two sides to realise the full potential of the economic partnership. India and the EU also announced dedicated dialogues on WTO issues, regulatory cooperation, market access issues and supply chain resilience, demonstrating the desire to deepen and further diversify economic engagement," it said. On discussions related to foreign policy and security, and when asked if the border conflict with China was raised, Swarup said India had outlined its concerns about developments in the region and that issues concerning Myanmar and Afghanistan had come up. Swarup said both sides had worked intensively over the last few months to arrive at a common understanding on free trade negotiations and that the decisions were also a result of the political desire on both sides to harness the full potential of India-EU economic engagement and work towards an early post-Covid-19 recovery.

They found all signals green up to their destination for supply of the crucial medical aid, termed as "sanjeevani", for Covid-19 patients gasping for breath. Till Saturday evening, the Indian Railways had delivered 3,400 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen in 220 tankers to various states across the country. So far, 54 Oxygen Express trains have delivered the supplies and more such trains with 26 fully loaded tankers, carrying around 470 tonnes, are on track. The Indian Railways is scheduling more such trains to meet the increasing demand of medical oxygen. Speaking to TOI, Banik, who is deployed at Angul in Odisha, said: "I drove a train carrying oxygen tankers from Tata to Angul." Everyone in railways understands the urgency and how it’s time to work together with full coordination. It was a proud moment for me to run the train, which was carrying oxygen that could save lives.” He said there was no halt for the train which was heading to Faridabad as all signals were found to be on “proceed” mode. Arun Pandey, who is posted at Rajkot, said he drove an Oxygen Express loaded with tankers from Hapa. “There was not even one second delay on the route. There was unprecedented urgency and coordination at loading and unloading sites. Everyone was prompt and showed dedication. I feel proud that when the entire country is gasping for oxygen, I became a part of the effort for faster transport of medical oxygen,” he said. Both the loco pilots said they could run the trains at maximum permitted speed simply because the signals were green all along the route during the journey. The Indian Railways has created “green corridors” in most of the cases for Oxygen Express trains so that they can reach their destination as soon as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/all-signals-green-for-oxygen-expresses/articleshow/82491470.cms||Dipak K Dash

---||India||Release inmates to decongest jails, orders SC||NEW DELHI: In order to protect prisoners' right to life, the Supreme Court has directed states to examine releasing inmates, convicted or facing trial in non-serious charges, from jails either on regular bail or on parole to prevent overcrowding and spread of Covid-19 infection in prisons during the current surge in virulent cases. The SC not only ordered release of prisoners on parole or bail, but also took into consideration the difficulty they would face in reaching their homes during lockdown. It asked the state governments to provide prisoners, released on the basis of SC orders, with transport facility till their homes. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices L N Rao and Surya Kant said, "Appropriate steps shall be taken for transportation of the released inmates of the prisons, if necessary, in view of the curfews and lockdowns (enforced by) in some states." It asked the authorities to be considerate to the concerns of inmates and directed them "to ensure that proper medical facilities are provided to all prisoners who are imprisoned. The spread of Covid-19 virus should be controlled in the prisons by regular testing of the prisoners and jail staff. Immediate treatment should be made available to the inmates and the staff. It is necessary to maintain required levels of daily hygiene and sanitation. There are 1,350 prisons in the country consisting of 617 sub-jails, 410 district jails, 144 central jails, 86 open jails, 41 special jails, 31 women jails, 19 Borstal schools and 2 others. The prisons have a capacity to house 4,03,739 inmates, but there were 4,78,600 of them as of December 2019. Among them, 19,913 are women. The CJI-led bench said, “Some of the prisons are overburdened... we may notice that the requirement of decongestion is a matter concerning health and right to life.” The WHO had on March 11 last year declared Covid-19 as a pandemic and within a week, the SC had ordered the states to set up high-powered committees to examine the cases of prisoners suitable for release on bail or parole for 90 days. But, with the pandemic slowing down considerably in January and February this year, the inmates were asked to report back to prisons. It asked the state governments, who have not constituted the HPCs (high-powered committees) yet, to do so immediately and asked the Delhi government to include Commissioner of Police in the HPC. The bench directed that “those inmates who were granted parole, pursuant to our earlier orders, should be again granted parole for a period of 90 days”. “...our attention was drawn to the example of Delhi, wherein the prison occupancy is updated in websites. Such measures are required to be considered by other states. Moreover, all the decisions of HPC need to be published on websites,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/release-inmates-to-decongest-jails-orders-sc/articleshow/82491962.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||World||Labour's Sadiq Khan re-elected as London mayor||LONDON: Labour politician Sadiq Khan won re-election as London mayor on Saturday in a narrower than expected victory over Conservative rival Shaun Bailey. Khan became the first Muslim mayor of a Western capital when first elected in 2016. He won a second term with just over 1.2 million votes, who gained 977,601 votes in Thursday's poll. Turnout was lower than at the previous election, at 42 percent. The 50-year-old politician's victory was one of the bright spots for the main opposition Labour party after a largely desultory showing in local elections on Thursday. In his victory speech Khan said that during his second term he would be focusing on "building bridges between the different communities" and between city hall and the government. He said he wanted "to ensure London can play its part in a national recovery" and to "build a brighter greener and more equal future" for the capital. Khan campaigned on a promise of "jobs, jobs, jobs", bidding to keep London on its perch as a top world city while tackling the crisis and the fallout from Brexit, which could threaten the capital's vital financial sector. Khan has made a name for himself as a vocal critic of Brexit and of successive Conservative prime ministers, including his mayoral predecessor Boris Johnson -- as well as for a feud with former US president Donald Trump. The pair became embroiled in an extraordinary war of words after Khan criticised Trump's controversial travel ban on people from certain Muslim countries. In a series of bizarre attacks, Trump accused Khan of doing a "very bad job on terrorism" and called him a "stone cold loser" and a "national disgrace". Entering his first term, Khan vowed to focus on providing affordable homes for Londoners and freezing transport fares, but saw his agenda engulfed by the pandemic. He is London's third mayor after Labour's Ken Livingstone (2000-2008) and Johnson (2008-2016), and there is widespread speculation he could try to follow in his predecessor's footsteps to Downing Street. In his previous role as a human rights lawyer, Khan spent three years chairing the civil liberties campaign group Liberty. In his victory speech, Khan referred to his humble origins, growing up in public housing in an ethnically mixed residential area in south London. "I grew up on a council estate, a working class boy, a child of immigrants, but I'm now the Mayor of London," he said, describing himself as "a Londoner through and through".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/labours-sadiq-khan-re-elected-as-london-mayor/articleshow/82491980.cms||---

Moreover, large number of people gather at vaccination centres unaware of the new guidelines fixed by the district administration. A vaccination centre at Kadavanthara witnessed unruly scenes after a councillor refused to enrol names of the persons to be administered the second dose. At Covid Apex Centre, PVS Kaloor, too many people returned without getting the vaccine. Many, including elderly and those with comorbidities, turn up early on each vaccination day in front of the centres hoping to get the second dose. They are turned back as only limited number of doses are administered at each centre. The vaccination officials had issued a standard operating procedure in which details of people to be vaccinated have been divided into three categories based on priorities. “They should approach respective ward member who have all the details of persons who took first dose earlier. The person who needs to be inoculated with second dose should reach the centre based on the details in the list. Those who took first dose from private hospitals will get the second dose at the designated centres in private hospitals from next week,” said district nodal officer of Covid vaccination Dr M G Sivadas. Ernakulam recorded inoculation of total 8,83,845 doses, including 7,01,708 first doses, till Friday evening. However, Thiruvananthapuram surpassed Ernakulam with total inoculations. As many as 9,21,312 doses of vaccine were administered by Thiruvananthapuram, including 7,01,470 first doses. Ernakulam could give only 1,82,137 second dose whereas Thiruvananthapuram gave 2,19,842 second doses till Friday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rush-for-2nd-dose-continues-in-ernakulam/articleshow/82492004.cms||---

While giving details, the CMO Srinagar apprised the Deputy Commissioner, Aijaz Asad, who is also chairman DDMA, that the patients referred by a physician having mild symptoms of Covid-19 infection and requiring oxygen support of less than 10 litres per minute can be admitted for isolation as well as treatment. He further added that Health Department is in the process of procuring more Bulk Oxygen Cylinders and Oxygen Concentrators to augment the bed capacity at Hajj House. The DC was informed that a duty roster for Medical Officers and Paramedical staff has also been framed to look after the admitted patients. The spokesman said that all 100 beds have been provided by R&B department. Adequate arrangements for water supply and uninterrupted power have also been made. The PDD has also set up a 63 KVA capacity DG set as back-up to overcome any power failure. "With regard to sanitation, cleanliness and fumigation measures, the Chairman DDMA was informed that SMC has deployed a dedicated team for ensuring cleanliness and sanitization in and around the premises." Earlier, the Chairman DDMA Aijaz Asad said the facility will decongest occupancy of beds in tertiary care hospitals by shifting patients having oxygen requirement of less than 10 liters per minute and are not on injectable medications to Hajj House. He said this is not a medical facility but oxygen support facility and shall act as an Oxygen Bank. Aijaz Asad further said the initiative is a joint venture of DDMA Srinagar, District Health Society and District Red Cross Society. He added that more Oxygenated beds shall be established as per directions of the Hon’ble LG to further strengthen the Oxygen support system in Srinagar district.

---||Kochi||Tech giant IBM to start office in Kochi soon||KOCHI: Software technology giant International Business Machines Corp (IBM) will be opening a large office in Kochi soon and by the time its new facility is fully functional, post-Covid, the company will have a new name — Kyndryl. The IBM signboard will be in Kochi only for a few months more, before assuming the new moniker Kyndryl. Globally, IBM’s ‘managed infrastructure services’ business is being spun-off into an independent new company named Kyndryl, with its headquarters in New York. This new firm will continue with the original IT infrastructure business of IBM and it will enable IBM to focus on more profitable business areas of cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI). However, there are chances that the transition might be delayed for a few months more, until the end of the calendar year. When asked about the ongoing hiring, a senior official with IBM’s corporate communications team commented, ''Hiring is part of IBM’s Business As Usual (BAU) process. Our workforce decisions are made to best support our clients on their journey to adopting an open hybrid cloud platform and AI capability''. She also shared an FAQ on Kyndril which said, “Throughout 2021, and until the spin, IBM will continue to invest in Kyndryl to ensure it maintains its leadership position in the market and can capitalize on the changes taking place to innovate in managed services”. “IBM India is expected to open their larger office during Q2 or Q3 of the current financial year. But, by the time IBM India will be spun-off into a separate company with a new name. Hence, you will in effect not get to see the name IBM on the signboards in Kochi,” a source in the know of the things said. The firm already had been using “NewCo” as a placeholder name in their contracts with the external contractors, the source said. However, the transition might be delayed for a few months more, until the end of the calendar year. IBM is already present in Kochi at Centre A Offices, a premium business centre on MG Road, which houses their coordination office in Kerala with less than five people. Recently, the company had listed a huge number of vacancies for Kochi on their website, fuelling speculation that the opening of the Kochi office is imminent. According to sources, British real estate consultancy Cushman & Wakefield had been in the search for a facility for IBM that could accommodate 400 people initially and then expand to 600 to 800 seats in the future. It was two-and-a-half years ago that IBM first started scouting in Kochi for a property that could seat five to six people. Then they came back again eight or nine months ago, leasing a co-working space on MG Road. A search on IBM India’s career page throws back 457 positions in Kochi, on their website. “This is part of the company’s expansion into smaller cities – tier 2 & 3 cities – including Kochi,” another industry source said. Sources hinted that the company will be opening in Infopark. When contacted a senior official with the state government’s technology parks said that IBM might open the office, but there are details yet to be worked out. “IBM’s plans are still up in the air. They have already set up a base outside the park [Infopark], a small place, and it is not hundred percent clear to me what exactly their plans are,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tech-giant-ibm-to-start-office-in-kochi-soon/articleshow/82492011.cms||Shenoy Karun

The anticipated rise in the supply starting from June can also weigh on the prices, the organization has said in its latest report. The average monthly production of NR in India during Feb-April 2021 was 43,000 tonnes, which is expected to go down to 28,000 tonnes in May, but to rise again to 44,000 tonnes in 2021, the report says. Kerala accounts for nearly 80% of India’s overall rubber production. “The second wave of Covid-19 has trimmed the outlook on the demand for NR from India. The daily infected cases in India rose to more than 4,00,000. The country accounted for 46% of the global cases and 25% of the global deaths reported during the last week of April. However, the lower NR demand from India could be offset by the higher consumption expected in China, US, and Europe helped by the rapid economic recovery following the good progress achieved in the vaccination drive,” the report said. The off-season of NR supply, coinciding with the wintering of rubber trees, is expected to end by the second half of May in almost all the rubber-producing countries, with variation across countries and across regions within each country, ANRPC report said. “The world supply is expected to improve beginning from the last week of May on account of the seasonal factor,” it added. However, the increase in supply is expected to be marginal on account of the following factors that include: Disruptions caused by the recent increases in the number of newly-infected Covid-19 cases in Thailand, India, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Sri Lanka; negative impact of the fungal leaf diseases that have affected a total extent of around 0.6 million hectares of mature trees in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, and to a limited extent in Sri Lanka and India; and the Ramzan season affecting production in Indonesia, Malaysia and Southern Thailand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/covid-second-wave-to-affect-global-rubber-price-recovery/articleshow/82492028.cms||Shenoy Karun

But, considering the superstition and misconceptions about the vaccine that had clouded the villagers’ minds, the 100% result is a landmark achievement. When the village council asked those above 45 to submit their Aadhaar cards for a vaccination drive, only five gave it. A bit of probing and prying gave a glimpse into their misconceptions. While some had watched fake videos claiming people had died after taking the jab, others believed that the vaccine had resulted in people being forced to amputate their arms due to infection. Some villagers also had religious reservations, whereas women had their own set of concerns. Camps, sarpanch taking shot erased doubts about vaxThis led to awareness camps, where the doubts of the villagers were addressed with help from health officials from the taluka. “These camps helped bring about a change,” said Sarla Zhalte, who works in the local anganwadi. She added that health officials visited homes to convince the residents. The women started trooping in first; the men followed. On April 27, on the occasion of Hanuman Jayanti, villagers took their first shot of the vaccine on the premises of the local temple. It took a month to convince the village, but it has now become a torchbearer of change, said sarpanch Krushna Gawande, adding that today the villagers feel a sense of pride in this achievement. The village has not reported a single case of Covid since last year, said Gawande. But this had led to complacency, making the villagers feel vaccine was not necessary for them. However, when the sarpanch and helpers in the aaganwadi took their first shots, the others were influenced. “After taking the vaccine, we used to deliberately work at the gram panchayat office for longer duration so that people would see that we were all hale and hearty despite taking the jab,” said Zhalte. Janefal has been following all Covid-appropriate norms. Those who come visiting have to quarantine themselves for at least seven days in a vacant school before going to their houses. Even weddings were held in open fields and only 10 villagers were allowed at the wedding venue at a time to have food. “This village has become a role model for many of the neighbouring villages,” says Dr Satish Sabale, medical officer of the taluka. “People around have now heard about Janefal. We are now getting demands from other villages around to set up vaccination camps for them too.” In Janefal, the village panchayat is making efforts to hold another vaccination camp for the 18-44 age group now that they have been made eligible for it. But this time around, there is a bit of hitch. With online appointment and registeration being mandatory, the residents are having trouble. “Most of our villagers are not too savvy with booking appointments online,” said Gawande. “We hope some assistance is given to us so that we can get all eligible villagers vaccinated soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/maharashtra-village-conquers-hesitancy-all-45-plus-now-vaccinated/articleshow/82492038.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Opposition leader’s post: AICC to seek new MLAs’ views||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Observers appointed by All India Congress Committee (AICC) will be meeting the newly-elected party MLAs individually to know their choice of the opposition leader. With the assembly session expected to begin in the second week of June, the observers are likely to reach the state soon after the lockdown. A decision on whether Ramesh Chennithala should continue as the opposition leader will be made after the meeting. Chennithala has already said he will abide by the committee’s decision. AICC observers Mallikarjun Kharge and M Vaidyalingam will be reaching the state after May 20 to hold discussions with the party leaders and also for the meetings with the MLAs. The observers will also attend a parliamentary party meeting of the newlyelected MLAs. The observers will submit a report to the party high command which will take the final call on Chennithala. The party high command is also likely to consider the opinion of senior party leaders on the issue. The organizational restructuring process, including the appointment of a new KPCC president, is expected to kick off only after the high command makes a decision on it. If Chennithala steps down as the opposition leader, V D Satheesan from the “I” group and Thiruvanchur Radhakrishan from the “A” are likely to be the front runners for the post. Already, there is a growing demand for a generational shift in the parliamentary party as well as in the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC). Hence, chances of more young leaders coming to the fore are likely. The selection of the new parliamentary party chief is crucial since the assembly is expected to convene in June for the budget session. That is one reason why AICC has decided to send the observers this month itself to the state. The KPCC political affairs committee had already decided to go for a total revamp in the state right from the grassroots level to the top. For this, a two meeting of the PAC will be held from May 18. A report of the meeting will be submitted to the AICC observers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/opposition-leaders-post-aicc-to-seek-new-mlas-views/articleshow/82492044.cms||---

Responding to SC's order to constitute the task force, sources said solicitor general Tushar Mehta had emphasised the need for a body of experts to look into oxygen distribution. "It was the government, through SG Tushar Mehta, that suggested the creation of this task force. However, without even knowing such basic facts about the government being open to involving experts to work with it, some people are running their own agendas around such news," a government functionary maintained and added, "The Centre welcomes the decision." "In order to facilitate fresh assessment of the basis for allocation of oxygen, an expert committee may be constituted consisting of persons drawn from public and private healthcare institutions with experience," Mehta submitted in the court on behalf of the Centre, said government sources. The decision affords Centre a way out of the unpleasant situation where it was having to apportion oxygen among states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-oxygen-panel-govt-welcomes-move-says-sg-suggested-it/articleshow/82492050.cms||Akhilesh Singh

Also 50 ventilator beds would be increased at BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur. ICU and ventilator beds are being increased in other hospitals also,” DM Vijyendra Pandiyan said. The southern area of Gorakhpur is densel-populated but has only one 40-bed Covid hospital while Badhalganj tehsil is around 60 km from Gorakhpur headquarters. Many people of the area had been running a campaign on social media demanding a Covid hospital in Badhalganj following which former minister and ex-MLA from Chillupar Rajesh Tripathi talked to CM Yogi on Friday. The CM gave approval for the hospital and gave instruction to district magistrate to turn the homeopathy medical college into 100-bed Covid hospital. Rajesh Tripathi and social worker Satya Charan Lucky, who was leading the campaign, thanked CM Yogi on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-cm-yogi-adityanath-gives-nod-to-turn-homeopathy-medical-college-into-covid-19-hospital/articleshow/82492060.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Covid claims 38 lives, infects 2,170 in 24 hours||LUCKNOW: In yet another deadly strike, the second wave of Covid-19 snuffed out 38 lives and infected 2,170 people on Saturday. With this, the tally of the second wave that started on March 15 zoomed to 1.4 lakh and casualties to 888. Of these, nearly 21,000 infections and 273 fatalities have been reported in the first eight days of May alone. The number of recoveries in the last 24 hours were 4,515, more than new infections for the 16th consecutive day. As a result, patients with active infection status are now 25,478, down from over 28,000 on Friday. In all, 1.2 lakh patients, including 39,625 in May, have recovered in second wave. However, since most of the recoveries were of asymptomatic or mild symptomatic patients, critical care units in hospitals continued to work to the capacity. “Since a serious patient takes time to recover, bed occupancy is for a longer period. So, even if new beds are being added, they get occupied within no time. The situation will be normal when the recovery rate of hospitalised patients will be more than new serious cases,” a KGMU professor said. The pressure on critical care can be gauged from the fact that the new makeshift Atal Bihari Vajpayee Hospital set up by DRDO has 250 beds – 100 oxygen supported and 150 ICUs – and all ICU beds are occupied. At least 93 oxygen supported beds in the makeshift hospital are still vacant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-covid-claims-38-lives-infects-2170-in-24-hours/articleshow/82492067.cms||---

"The cache of weapons included dozens of advanced Russian-made anti-tank guided missiles, thousands of Chinese Type 56 assault rifles, and hundreds of PKM machine guns, sniper rifles and rocket-propelled grenades launchers. Other weapon components included advanced optical sights," the Bahrain-based Fleet said in a statement. It added that the materiel is in US custody awaiting final disposition, while the original source and intended destination of the materiel is under investigation. "After all illicit cargo was removed, the dhow was assessed for seaworthiness, and after questioning, its crew was provided food and water before being released," the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/us-5th-fleet-seizes-weapons-shipment-from-stateless-dhow-in-arabian-sea/articleshow/82492083.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: 10 killed in explosion at quarry in Kadapa district||TIRUPATI: Ten workers were killed in a blast at a barytes quarry near Mamillapalli village under Kalasapadu mandal in Kadapa district of Andhra Pradesh on Saturday. The explosion occurred while workers were unloading gelatin sticks from a vehicle for use in the quarry. Police said though the quarry operator had obtained permission to run the unit, he was allegedly mining outside the prescribed boundaries assigned to him. The impact of the blast was so powerful that the bodies were blown to pieces and lay strewn all over. Police struggled to identify the dead as they were beyond recognition. No one was injured in the blast. As the bodies were strewn all over, police were forced to take the help of the workers’ family members who managed to identify the deceased with the clothes on the bodies. The severed parts were collected and sent to the local government hospital for forensic experts to put together. The blast was heard several kilometres away. People in nearby villages ran out of their homes in fear on hearing the deafening sound. Thick smoke engulfed the area soon after. Confusion prevailed at the blast site as nothing was visible due to dense clouds of smoke triggered by the explosion. Police said a vehicle loaded with gelatin sticks had arrived at the quarry site from Badvel in Kadapa district on Saturday morning. The explosion is believed to have happened while the workers were unloading the explosives. It is also being said that the workers were drilling holes in granite to insert the explosive materials when the blast happened. It is not yet clear what triggered the explosion. A forensic team has collected the material from the site to ascertain the cause. Kadapa SP KKN Anburajan said of the ten workers killed in the blast, six have been identified. “A case has been registered at Kalasapadu police station. We will investigate if the quarry has the necessary licences besides the permission to procure large quantities of explosives,” he said. The deceased have been identified as Prasad, K Prasad, Abdul Vemula, Lakshmi Reddy, Easwaraiah, Venkatesu, Gangireddy, Venkataramana, Bala Gangulu and Subba Reddy, Allegations of over-exploitation of barytes and other mines near Kalasapadu village by the lessee have also surfaced. An RTI reply over various aspects pertaining to mining leases allotted by the mines and geology department of Kadapa went viral in social media soon after the blast on Saturday. The district administration has ordered an inquiry into the blast. Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan and chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy expressed shock over the loss of precious lives in the quarry explosion and extended condolences to the bereaved family members. Former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu expressed condolences and demanded the state government to order a detailed probe into the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradesh-10-killed-in-explosion-at-quarry-in-kadapa-district/articleshow/82492096.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Currently, one lakh individuals are getting jabs every day and the government wants to increase it to 3 lakh so that the entire population of the capital can be vaccinated within three months. Addressing a press conference, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said Delhi has only five days of vaccine stock left and underlined the need for more doses — 85 lakh each month for the next three months. Of Delhi’s two crore population, around one crore fall in the 18-44 age group; 50 lakh are under-18 and 50 lakh are above 45. Delhi needs three crore vaccine doses to vaccinate the 1.5 crore people who are above 18 but has received just 40 lakh doses so far. The CM requested the central government to provide Delhi with the required number of vaccines. “People are visibly happy with the arrangements made by the government,” Kejriwal said. CM: Plan to vaccinate 3L people every day, add 200 jab centresWe have made these arrangements in around 100 schools and are going to increase it about 250-300 schools," Kejriwal said. "Around one lakh vaccines are being administered daily in Delhi and many people from areas neighbouring Delhi — Faridabad, Gurgaon, Sonipat, Ghaziabad, Noida — are coming here to get vaccinated. They have also appreciated the arrangements made in Delhi," Kejriwal said while flagging vaccine scarcity. "To administer 80-85 lakh vaccines every month, we need to administer 3 lakh vaccines daily… We can easily increase our capacity to 3 lakh vaccines per day, there is no problem with this. Now that we have started the arrangements, we know how to proceed and are going to carry this out in the next few days," Kejriwal said. "In fact, more than this will be necessary since people from NCR and other neighbouring areas are coming to Delhi to get vaccinated. So, we will need even more vaccines than what I’ve already mentioned, but the minimum requirement of Delhi must be met with. To protect ourselves from the third wave, being completely vaccinated is imperative," the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-left-with-stock-for-5-days-cm-arvind-kejriwal-asks-for-2-6-crore-doses-for-blanket-coverage/articleshow/82492109.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Vaccination drive slackens with private hospitals yet to get stocks||VISAKHAPATNAM: While private hospitals can directly negotiate and procure Covid-19 vaccines from manufacturers in the third phase vaccination drive which began on May 1, even as of Saturday, May 8, only a few private vaccination sites were administering vaccines in Andhra Pradesh, including only one in Visakhapatnam. The private hospitals claimed that they could not proceed with the vaccination drive due to the demand and supply gap. A representative of a private hospital in Visakhapatnam, which served as a vaccination site in the first and second phases, said that only a few big players could manage to procure the stocks. “But for others, it may take time to avail fresh stocks from the manufacturers. The vaccine manufacturers seem to have earlier committed orders,” he said. Before the rollout of the third phase of the vaccination drive on May 1, the remaining vaccine stocks were taken back from the private vaccination sites. For instance, when the state administered about 6.4 lakh vaccine doses on the last day of Tika Utsav on April 14, hundreds of private vaccination sites served the public. On the other hand, the government vaccination centres are witnessing serpentine queues fuelled by the fears of an ever-increasing caseload. The recipients, who are due for their second dose, have been finding it difficult to locate a vaccination centre that offers the same brand of vaccine that they received for their first shot, particularly Covaxin. When STOI visited several vaccination centres in Visakhapatnam on Saturday, a few said they had exhausted their stocks within a few hours, much to the dismay of the public. S Sarvesh, who came along with his father to get vaccinated at the Swarna Bharathi Indoor Stadium, said that the centre had run out of vaccines by afternoon. “After waiting for hours, my father could not get the vaccine. A huge number of people are coming to the vaccination centres these days,” he said. Nor are the states able to purchase any number of vaccine doses as the Centre is allocating only a certain number of jabs for each state each month. For instance, as per the latest communique, Andhra Pradesh can purchase only 17 lakh vaccine doses on its own from the manufacturers for the entire month of May, while the Centre has allocated 9.2 lakh doses free of cost for the first fortnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradesh-vaccination-drive-slackens-with-private-hospitals-yet-to-get-stocks/articleshow/82492123.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The toll increased to 8,615 as 96 more patients succumbed to the pandemic. This is the highest single-day death count in the last nine months since the state recorded 97 deaths on August 22. As many as 14 patients died due to the novel coronavirus disease in West Godavari, 12 in Visakhapatnam, 10 each in Anantapur and Guntur, nine each in East Godavari and Vizianagaram, seven each in Kurnool and Nellore, six in Chittoor, five in Kadapa, four in Krishna, and three in Srikakulam. As many as 19,272 patients were declared cured, almost equivalent to the cases registered on Saturday. This is the highest number of single-day Covid-19 recoveries in the last several months. There are currently 1.87 lakh active cases with 10,69,432 cumulative recoveries and 8,615 fatalities. The active case load crossed the 20,000-mark in Chittoor and East Godavari. Visakhapatnam reported 2,525 new infections, followed by East Godavari (2,370) and Chittoor (2,269). Chittoor, with 650 cases, was the only district to record triple-digit infections. Andhra Pradesh conducted 1,01,571 Covid-19 tests and detected 20,065 new infections, translating to a case positivity rate of around 20%.

Speaking to the media on Saturday, Singhal said that the state health department has requested the Union government to increase the oxygen allocation further considering the increase in the daily Covid-19 caseload. “The health department supplied about 490 MT oxygen to various Covid-19 hospitals on May 7, Friday. Andhra Pradesh has floated global tenders to procure liquid medical oxygen. The Eastern Naval Command has agreed to transport the oxygen, if any private agency comes forward to provide oxygen to the state,” said Singhal. Singhal said that the Covid-19 vaccination process would be streamlined in the next few days. “The health department is currently giving only the second dose. We would take measures to streamline the vaccination protocol as a huge number of people are turning up at the vaccination centres,” said Singhal. The principal secretary added that the health department may get an idea after a few days about the impact of the ongoing curfew on the disease transmission and daily case numbers. “The disease trend in the next few days would give a primary idea on where we are heading. If the case numbers continue in the same range, we would be comfortably placed in terms of disease management,” said Singhal. Over the next few days, the health department is likely to get an idea of the impact of the ongoing curfew on the disease transmission and daily case numbers, the principal secretary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/centre-increases-oxygen-allocation-for-andhra-pradesh-to-590-mt/articleshow/82492134.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 86 staffers test Covid positive at Saroj hospital, 1 surgeon dead||NEW DELHI: To add to their woes about inadequate oxygen supplies in the past 18 days, Delhi hospitals have struggled with their staff being infected with Covid-19, in the process creating a work overload on the remaining medical teams. At Saroj Super Specialty Hospital in Rohini, surgeon A K Rawat, 58, succumbed to Covid, further burdening the facility that has already had to close its labour, cardiology and neurology departments due to the 86 medical and support staff testing positive. Other hospitals similarly told TOI about doctors and paramedics reaching a stage of utter exhaustion due to heavy workloads caused by truncated staff strengths. At least 317 people, including doctors and paramedic staff, have tested positive for the coronavirus in just four hospitals in the past month. With O2 crisis, hospitals also battle staff crunchOn Saturday, even as it mourned the death of Dr Rawat who served the institution for 27 years, Saroj Hospital rostered its doctors and paramedics into two teams, one that would work while the other isolated at home. “With the loss of Dr Rawat, the staff is apprehensive. And although they will continue to work, the loss of one working member hits us very hard,” pointed out Dr P K Bhardwaj, chief executive director and head of surgery. So far, 86 health workers, among them doctors, nurses, ward boys and other staffers, have tested positive for the coronavirus at Saroj Hospital. And yet they gamely carry on. The hospital said it had increased the number of beds equipped with oxygen from 140 to 150, given the improvement in the oxygen availability in Delhi. The hospital says it will boost the number to 170 beds if oxygen is supplied in time in the coming weeks. At Batra Hospital in south Delhi, the oxygen crisis of the past few days appears to have blown over, but there still are no ICU beds available and there’s a waiting list for admission. At least 20 doctors at Batra have tested positive alongside 15-20 paramedical staff. It may also be recalled that the hospital lost its head of gastroenterology, Dr R K Himthani, 62, on May 1, along with 11 patients when it ran out of oxygen. “The doctors are reaching a phase of total exhaustion because apart from looking after the patients and taking up the slack due to staff shortage, they also have to think about their families and relatives,” said Dr SCL Gupta medical director, Batra Hospital. “Every stressed patient wants to talk to the doctor. The effort required of a doctor in treating a normal patient is very different from that in treating a Covid patient; it is different as ground and sky.” Around 100 doctors and paramedics staff at Indian Spinal Injuries Centre in Vasant Kunj returned positive Covid tests in the last one month and 30 of them are currently in quarantine. “The Covid stress is getting to us,” admitted a doctor there. “It’s been a month and we all are overworked and it appears there will be no relief for some time. Moreover, we have the additional task of filing reports — the government asks for several reports whether it’s to do with use of Remdesivir injections or other Covid-related things. It doesn’t understand that we are facing a staff crunch and it is very difficult for doctors to jot down notes about every patient and then compile several reports every day.” He added that if the person compiling these reports were to contract the infection, things could get pretty hairy at the institution. At Shanti Mukund Hospital in Karkardooma too, 90 health workers have tested positive in the last 10 days. S K Saggar, CEO of the medicare facility, said, “Not many people are aware that the government of India has a compensation scheme in which a healthcare worker who dies of Covid duty while on duty will be granted a compensation of Rs 50 lakh. Little has been done to promote or make people aware about the scheme," he said. Fortunately, to mitigate staff woes, Shanti Mukund has been getting an adequate supply of oxygen in the last couple of days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-86-staffers-test-covid-positive-at-saroj-hospital-1-surgeon-dead/articleshow/82492131.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Second wave hits hotel industry’s revival hopes||VISAKHAPATNAM: The hopes of revival energising the hospitality sector following the crisis last year have been shattered by the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Mini-lockdowns, curfews and surge in cases have led to cancellation of many travel and marriage plans. Currently, hotels in Andhra Pradesh have just 10% occupancy. Many hotels have stopped taking bookings altogether. The cancellation of marriage ceremonies seems to have exacerbated the woes of the industry. With every major hotel seeing bulk cancellations, a cloud of uncertainty prevails over the future of the industry as a whole. “There are more than one lakh marriages scheduled in May. But the increase in number of Covid cases and curfews have led to many cancellations. We expected 70–80% business this month because of marriages. But that was not to be,” said Prasanth, president of AP Star Category Hotels Association. The chief general manager of Dasapalla Hotel, Prasanth further said that his hotel made 25–30% business in November, December and January for the first time since April last year. “There is no hope of revival of the hotel industry in the near future,” he said. Andhra Pradesh has around 5,000 big and small hotels and guesthouses. Of these, nearly 500 big hotels are located in the major cities. A hotel makes between 3 to 5 lakh per marriage ceremony. Every cancellation means a major loss in revenue, said a hotelier adding that every big hotel would lose around 1 crore in revenue this season and between 400 to 500 big hotels will together lose more than 300 crore. K Ramu, another hotelier, said: “Even online food sales have come to a halt. With the second wave of Covid-19, the hotel industry has collapsed. The worst part is that nobody is recognising this as an industry.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradesh-second-wave-hits-hotel-industrys-revival-hopes/articleshow/82492141.cms||---

While Mundhal Khurd and Mundhal Kalan villages, which fall under Bhiwani district have reported 40 deaths in the last one week, including five deaths on Saturday evening. Besides this, Chautala and a couple of nearby villages too have been badly hit by Covid. According to information, around 1,048 persons have been tested positive in the samples collected from CHC Chautala. Majority of those found positive are from Chautala and neighbouring villages. On Saturday, a team of officials from Bhiwani headed by SDM visited the two villages. Bijender Mundhal, sarpanch of Mundhal Khurad, confirmed the deaths while handing out the data of those cremated. Similarly, Soran, a former sarpanch and Priyanka Sharma, panch of Mundhal Kalan, too, confirmed the deaths and elaborated on the measures taken by the village at their level. “We have already cordoned off the boundaries of all three villages and have clamped self imposed lockdown for one week. We have a team, consisting of a manager of a cooperative bank and local youths, who are running the awareness campaign as well,’’ said Soran. Meanwhile, Congress MLA representing Dabwali. Amit Singh, alleged of few mysterious deaths that have gone unreported in his assembly constituency. “It has come to my notice that there have been recent deaths in the villages in my constituency, where the deceased even with mild symptoms like cough or fever, didn’t get tested; health deteriorated and couldn’t survive. With the massive spread of Covid, in most likelihood they were Covid positive,” alleged Singh. This raises a serious concern that with the lack of testing in rural areas, there is a massive silent Covid spread in the villages, which could become a trigger leading to the worsening of this second wave, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/more-sudden-deaths-in-haryana-villages/articleshow/82492152.cms||Manvir Saini

At over 70,898, Goa’s count is almost four times the national average of 15,864, and far higher than other severely-affected places like Delhi and Kerala. However, experts say that even this is possibly an undercount. “Most of the tests being conducted in Goa are rapid antigen tests,” said a health official. “If even these are picking up so many positives, the positivity rate is much higher than reported.” He said that in other states, cases appear to be plateauing, but in Goa, there is large-scale community transmission. “We know how many people are dying at home and being brought dead to hospitals,” he said. Indian Medical Association (IMA), Goa, president Dr Vinayak Buvaji said that Goa is going through a “very bad patch” despite having some of the country’s best healthcare infrastructure. “I am heading the IMA, but I feel totally helpless,” he said. Buvaji said the wave would have been milder if borders were sealed and Covid protocols were observed by the people and enforced by the state. We understand that the government has to balance economy and health, but when they got the first whiff of a second wave, they should have enforced Covid protocols in the most stringent way by doing simple things like restrictions on gatherings, elections, weddings, and casinos. It should also have sealed borders to some extent,” he said. Once this was done, containment zones should have been declared in high risk areas (like last year at Mangor Hill). “Containment zones are very few and their declaration came too late,” he said. Meanwhile, president of the South Goa advocates’ association Antonio Clovis da Costa, who filed a PIL in the high court when the Covid situation went out of hand, told TOI that everybody — people and government included — let their guard down. “The government should have insisted on Covid-negative certificates. Things are falling in place only after we petitioned the court. Who is accountable for this mess? The government should have been stricter with SOPs.” Pathologist and Covid volunteer Dr Anan Jaiswal said that the situation is bad on the ground, with multiple requests in a day for oxygen beds and ventilator beds for young patients. The small state with a high percentage of senior citizens is very vulnerable now. “Entire families are testing positive,” he said, adding that the lockdown came too late. “ The state wanted to protect industry and tourism more than its population. In December, all states were told about the second wave at a parliamentary committee meeting, but no action was taken,” he said. Cases are now reaching Goa’s hinterland, which is worrying, he said. “The most effective strategy would have been to lock down one area at a time and vaccinate everyone there,” he said. “Even educated people were not wearing masks. If the government had been harsh on people not following Covid protocol months ago, things would have been different,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-cases-per-million-more-than-four-times-national-average/articleshow/82492178.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: God sent her back for newborn son||AHMEDABAD: Himangi Siddharth Vyas, 25, knows she got a second lease at life. Where God sent her back into the world only for her newborn son. No wonder she decided to call him ‘Adhyay’, a new chapter. Himangi has literally come back from the dead. She had slipped into a coma after developing acute respiratory distress and was hooked to a ventilator. She was nine months pregnant then. When she came to after four days, she was told she is now mother to a baby boy. “Covid-19 had devastated my body but the nurses and doctors at SVP made sure I fought mentally. They egged me on to fight the disease saying I had to live for my boy,” reminisces Himangi. Himangi is a first-time mother and says she and her husband were ecstatic at having brought their child into the world. However, she developed breathing problems. While her test came negative, her CT scan showed Covid. “We could not find a bed at a private hospital and by the time we reached SVP Hospital, I was on the verge of collapse. The staff had to hook me to oxygen at the doorstep,” says Himangi. It was a downhill journey when Himangi slipped into a coma and was put on a ventilator. “The doctors delivered my son on April 12, as otherwise we both would have lost our lives,” says Himangi. Later, the she fought hard and was discharged on April 23. “God saved me only for my son,” says Himangi. Bhavika Kotadiya is another mother who fought a lifeand-death battle with Covid and feels God saved her for her daughters. “I was six months pregnant with my second child when I got Covid-19 symptoms. I took medicines but did not improve. I guess we delayed going to the hospital as I had become critical when I was admitted,” says Bhavika. Bhavika was put on ventilator support and remained in a coma for seven days. “Doctors had to deliver my daughter prematurely. She was merely 1.4kg when she was born but was virus free. Despite having a low birth weight, she was healthy and did fine,” says Bhavika.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-god-sent-her-back-for-newborn-son/articleshow/82492195.cms||Radha Sharma
---||Goa||Armed with strictures, Goa fights to bend the curve||PANAJI: The lack of trust in the state government’s ability to ensure availability of essential grocery items was clear on Saturday as Goans rushed to stockpile food items. The senseless purchases across the state came despite chief minister and other government officials repeatedly assuring residents that grocery stores will remain open from 7am to 1pm on each day of the 15-day state-wide curfew. Another reason behind the panic was the confusion between the curbs imposed by the state and the lockdowns announced by village panchayats and municipalities. Given that the state government issued the notification regarding the curfew much later on Saturday evening, residents decided not to leave anything to chance and resorted to panic buying. “During the first wave in last year we had to run from pillar to post as government suddenly extended the lockdown. We don’t want to face similar situation hence making provision for at least a week,” said Rajendra Naik, a resident of Khandepar, Ponda. Long queues were seen outside grocery shops, supermarkets and wholesale traders, a clear indication that people do not rely on the government. Hordes were seen at the SGPDA market in Margao prompting personnel from Farorda Police station to shut down the market. Long queues were seen outside the Goa Sahakar Bhandar and at supermarket stores in Taleigao, Caranzalem, Miramar and Merces. Social distancing was maintained at most places with people queuing up patiently. Double masking has also picked up among people. Law commissioner and chairman of Goa’s largest chain of departmental store - Bagayatdar Bazar, Narendra Sawaikar appealed to people not to rush as the stores would remain open daily. Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida and Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte made similar efforts to create awareness in their respective constituencies. In several villages and constituencies, ward representative were seen moving about and urging people to stay indoors, wear masks and maintain social distancing. This also created friction in some villages. In Benaulim a panch member and a store owner got into a verbal spat after the panch member demanded that the store should down its shutters. The store owner pointed out that the government’s directives permit grocery stores to be open and that the panchayat could not supercede the government’s orders. Magsons, which has 11 stores in the state could keep just nine operational as the Varca panchayat has imposed a complete shut down and the store at Caculo Mall has been shut as the mall itself is shut. Borkar’s superstore, which has 14 outlets could only keep five open for similar reasons. In Vasco, people threw caution to the wind and thronged to the narrow vegetable and fruit market fearing scarcity from Sunday onwards. Some people said that while they knew that essential services would be available, the fear of being beaten up by Goa police during the curfew prompted them to stock up for the curfew period. The purchases were record high as by evening the huge Vasco vegetable market was half empty. Milk was also unavailable at many places. Similar scenes played out in Tiswadi, Salcete, Bardez, Canacona, Pernem, Bicholim and Old Goa as people rushed to make last minute purchases. While there were no long queues at most shops in the Calangute-Candolim beach-belt, in Parra, Saligao and Siolim people started rushing to grocery stores and medical stores. In Calangute and Candolim, the village panchayats had announced ‘lockdowns’ much earlier and people had already stocked up on provisions. Down south in Canacona, crowds were witnessed in the commercial hub of Chaudi but the gathering appeared to be primarily due to boredom and curiosity. Many concerned residents who witnessed the rush at Chaudi town, blamed the authorities for allowing crowds to assemble. “When the government has clearly stated that the groceries and other essential supplies will be open from 7am to 1pm, what’s the need for residents to crowd,” asked a retired teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/armed-with-strictures-goa-fights-to-bend-the-curve/articleshow/82492213.cms||---

This comes at a time when Karnataka is reporting around 50,000 positive cases and the case fatality rate in eight districts has crossed 1%. “The idea is to ensure the 18 medical colleges are self-sufficient in oxygen production, and the process is being fast-tracked,” deputy chief minister and State Covid-19 Ministerial Task Force chief CN Ashwath Narayan told STOI. Three of the plants are in Bengaluru. The finance department has given its green signal to the Rs 62.7 crore proposal and tenders have been called. “With this, institutes can generate medical oxygen on their own instead of depending on outside suppliers,” said Ashwath Narayan. Each of these plants will be designed for a flow rate of 1,500 litres per minute and will cater to the needs of 250 persons requiring oxygen support. The much-needed move has been endorsed by public health experts. Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine (Bengaluru chapter) chairman Dr Sunil Karanth said: “It is the need of the hour. It is prudent to make medical institutions self-sufficient in meeting their oxygen needs. This will reduce dependency on oxygenproduction plants, which also have to supply for industrial purposes.” Dr Karanth pointed out how All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi recently succeeded in establishing a plant in record time with DRDO’s assistance. “Setting up a plant is not a cumbersome process. It is a necessary infrastructure for medical institutions and varsities that see a constant stream of patients in need of oxygen. Moreover, oxygen-generation technologies have developed so much that purity of oxygen for medical usage is on expected lines — 93-95%,” he added. Several public health experts feel the government could have minimised the current oxygen crisis had it acted earlier and set up the plants. Subject specialists had alerted the government on the need for ramping up supply in April last year following reports on oxygen shortage in several foreign countries, including the US and Italy. The government was advised to set up liquid oxygen tanks for 150 to 200-bed hospitals instead of depending on cylinders. “But as the severity of the first wave reduced, the government put the proposal on the back burner,” officials said. However, the health department mooted the proposal again in December and announced plans to set up plants in 10 district hospitals and 30 taluk ones at a cost of Rs 38 crore. But after initial discussions, it was not taken forward as the government did not anticipate a second surge of such magnitude, officials added. The next question is: Why can’t smaller private hospitals have their own oxygen-generation plants? Dr Karanth explained: “In a normal situation, production of so much oxygen is too much for a 30-40 bedded hospital, such plants are ideal for hospitals with 150-200 beds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/atmanirbhar-push-18-medical-institutes-to-have-oxygen-plants-in-karnataka/articleshow/82492211.cms||Rakesh Prakash

---||Bengaluru||9 Bengaluru wards are battling high caseload||BENGALURU: Nine city wards, which barely had 100 Covid-19 cases two months ago, are now grappling with up to 3,500 active cases, according to the ward-level data of the past 10 days. The wards are a mix of upscale localities and pockets home to economically weaker sections. Shantalanagar, one of the prime localities in the central business district (CBD), tops the list of hard-hit wards. As of May 5, it had 4,390 active cases. Health officials of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) attributed rising infections in the ward to high mobility. “The area has people who travel in and out of Bengaluru a lot. The spread of infection is linked to such movement,” said an official. The nine other wards with a high active caseload are Bellandur (more than 3,600 infections), Horamavu (3,000), Hagadur (2,500), Rajarajeshwari Nagar (2,500), New Thippasandra (2,450), Varthur (2,300), HSR Layout (2,300), Begur (2,200) and Arakere (2,100). Most of them are outlying areas and fall in the tech corridor, which usually witnesses construction activity. Though there are colonies and slums of migrant labourers in the wards, the second wave of Covid-19 has struck almost every other large apartment complex in the areas, said another civic official. The infection rates in slums are not known. “We are preoccupied with pressing issues such as the hospital bed and oxygen shortages and have not paid attention to the demographic factors at play. Going by the inputs from field officers, it appears that positive cases are occurring in slums, too,” the official said. According to another official, extensive Covid-19 testing is not being undertaken in pockets with economically weaker sections. “Initially, testing camps were conducted in apartment complexes,” the official added. Public health experts say BBMP should increase testing in slums to effectively contain the spread. “We should be testing all categories of people, be it drivers, house helps or delivery boys,” a doctor said. BBMP reduced testing from 1 lakh tests per day to around 60,000. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta told STOI that the positivity rate in Bengaluru had remained the same for the past 10 days. The curfew perhaps helped prevent an increase. “I believe that the cases are going to drop in the next few days, once the new lockdown comes into force,” he added. Some wards that were declared as infection clusters during the first wave are reporting fewer cases this time. Padarayanapura and DJ Halli are among them. Meanwhile, Bengaluru reported 21,534 fresh cases on Saturday. For the seventh consecutive day, the tech capital has recorded so many cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/9-bengaluru-wards-are-battling-high-caseload/articleshow/82492250.cms||Kiran Parashar

Stalin made the request during his telephonic conversation with Modi. “He sought cooperation of the Centre for the efforts taken by the new government to prevent Covid spread,” a government release said. The release said Modi assured to consider the request immediately. “The Prime Minister said more tests should be carried out in TN to contain the virus and that efforts should focus on keeping patients with mild symptoms in home isolation. The chief minister assured action on this,” the release said. In a letter to Modi on Friday, Stalin had said the state’s daily consumption of medical oxygen was around 440T and projected that it could increase by another 400T in two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/m-k-stalin-urges-pm-modi-to-get-tamil-nadu-500t-oxygen/articleshow/82492257.cms||---

The policy, applicable for both public and private health facilities dedicated for Covid-19, also said that no patient will be refused services on any account, including oxygen and essential drugs, even if the patient belongs to a different city. "This patient-centric measure aims to ensure prompt, effective and comprehensive treatment of patients suffering from Covid-19," the ministry said. Hospitals under the central government, state governments and Union territory administration, including private hospitals managing Covid-19 patients, shall ensure that requirement of a positive test for Covid-19 virus is not mandatory for admission to a Covid health facility. "A suspect case shall be admitted to the suspect ward of Covid Care Centre (CCC), Dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC) of dedicated Covid hospital (DHC) as the case may be," the directive to all the states and UTs said. "No patient shall be refused admission on the ground that he/she is not able to produce a valid identity card that does not belong to the city where the hospital is located," it said. The ministry also said that admissions to hospital must be "based on need". "It should be ensured that beds are not occupied by persons who do not need hospitalisation. Further, the discharge should be strictly in accordance with the revised discharge policy," it said. The ministry has advised the chief secretaries of states to issue necessary orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-report-not-must-for-hospital-admission-govt/articleshow/82492265.cms||---

The 241 deaths – highest so far – the state reported on Saturday pushed the toll tally beyond 15,000 and the cumulative case tally breached 13 lakh. Since March 2020, the state has reported 13.51 lakh cases and 15,412 deaths. Positivity rate, which was below 8% in the second week of April, increased to 12.7% last week and is now more than 15%, according to data from the directorate of public health. Nasal and throat swabs were drawn from 1.48 lakh for RTPCR tests on Saturday and the sampels were sent to 241 labs in the state. All 37 districts in the state reported more than 100 cases each, hotspot Chennai, which has a positivity rate of nearly 22%, reported 6,846 new cases and 72 deaths. After Chennai, Chengalpet (2,458) and Coimbatore (2,117) reported the highest number of new cases. Tuticorin, which has the highest positivity rate (22.7%) in the state, reported 853 new cases. Tirunelveli (21%) reported 674 new cases on Saturday. While it took nearly 112 days for TN to add one lakh cases from 9 lakh cases it reported until December 2020, the state added another one lakh cases in less than a fortnight on April 19. Eight days later, the case tally moved to11 lakh. Five days ago, there were 12 lakh cases and on Saturday, it crossed13 lakh cases. “The infection is growing too fast, overwhelming the health care system,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “With increase in cases there has been a steep increase in deaths,” he said. "People must stay indoors. If they must come out, they should wear a mask, preferably a double mask and maintain physical distance," he said. The state which reported 12,000 deaths on December 22 took 115 days to add another thousand deaths. But in the next 21 days, the cumulative toll tally has crossed 15,000. On Saturday, 31 districts reported deaths. After Chennai, Tiruvallur reported 17 deaths followed by 14 deaths in Kancheepuram and 12 deaths in Trichy. While Tirupattur reported 11 deaths, Chengalpet and Salem reported 10 deaths each.

Lakshmanan died in the early hours of Friday after his family frantically criss-crossed the city looking for an ICU bed. Despite securing a bed, Jacob (name changed) succumbed in an ambulance outside a north Bengaluru hospital on Thursday night because a BBMP staffer denied him admission saying the 65-year-old did not make a helpline booking. Lakshmanan lived with his teacher-wife and their two children in a rented home near the Bethal Public School in Dooravaninagar, Vijinapura. An electrical supervisor with a top medical equipment manufacturing unit in Whitefield, the 48-year-old was working onsite till he fell sick on April 26. “On April 30, he tested positive for Covid and remained in home isolation. His condition deteriorated early Thursday and needed hospitalisation,” said a relative. Helplines were of no help, say kin Unable to find an ambulance, Lakshmanan’s wife and 14-year-old son took him in an auto to at least six hospitals to find a bed. “He had severe breathlessness,” said a relative who made nearly 50 futile calls to the Covid helpline 1912. “Finally, we admitted him to Satya Sai Hospital in Bhattarahalli, where he was given an oxygen bed,” said the relative. But his oxygen levels kept falling. His condition worsened by Thursday night, and the hospital suggested the family move Lakshmanan to a facility with an ICU bed. “We kept calling 1912 but there was no response. We then took him to the Government Hospital in KR Puram hoping it would be of some help,” said a friend. Lakshmanan died there on Friday. Cox Town resident Jacob had tested positive for Covid a few days ago, and by Thursday, his oxygen level dropped. When his condition began to worsen, the family rushed him to a hospital in Hebbal. According to a doctorrelative, a BBMP staffer stopped the family from admitting him. “They insisted the patient should be routed via the helpline, which is hardly responsive” said the relative. “We lost crucial time, and Jacob passed away in the ambulance outside the hospital,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-helpline-remains-elusive-as-two-more-die-in-search-of-icu-beds/articleshow/82492299.cms||Petlee Peter
---||World||Scottish government sets stage for another independence vote||LONDON: The Scottish National Party won its fourth straight parliamentary election on Saturday and insisted it will push on with another referendum on Scotland's independence from the UK even though it failed by one seat to secure a majority. Final results of Thursday's election showed the SNP winning 64 of the 129 seats in the Edinburgh-based Scottish Parliament. The result extends the party's dominance of Scottish politics since it first won power in 2007. Other results from Super Thursday's array of elections across Britain emerged Saturday, including the Labour Party's victory in the Welsh parliamentary election. Labour's Sadiq Khan was also widely expected to be reelected mayor of London. The election with the biggest implications was the Scottish election, as it could pave the way to the break-up of the United Kingdom. The devolved government has an array of powers but many economic and security matters remain within the orbit of the British government in London. Though the SNP won the vast majority of constituencies, it failed to get the 65 seats it would need to have a majority as Scotland allocates some by a form of proportional representation. Though falling short, the SNP will be easily able to govern for the five-year parliamentary term with the eight members of the Scottish Greens, who also back Scottish independence. SNP leader and Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said her immediate priority would be steering Scotland through the coronavirus pandemic and that the legitimacy of an independence referendum remains, SNP majority or not. “This is now a matter of fundamental democratic principle,” Sturgeon said. “It is the will of the country.” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the leader of the Conservative Party, would have the ultimate authority whether or not to permit another referendum on Scotland gaining independence. Johnson appears intent on resisting another vote, setting up the possibility of renewed tensions between his government and Sturgeon's devolved administration. The prime minister wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper published Saturday that another referendum would be “irresponsible and reckless” in the “current context” as Britain emerges from the pandemic. He has consistently argued that the issue was settled in a September 2014 referendum, when 55% of Scottish voters favored remaining part of the UK Proponents of another vote say the situation has changed fundamentally because of Brexit, with Scotland taken out of the European Union against its will. In the 2016 Brexit referendum, 52% of the UK voted to leave the EU while 62% of Scots voted to remain. Sturgeon said it would be wrong for Johnson to stand in the way of a referendum and that the timing is a matter for the Scottish Parliament. There's been growing talk that the whole issue may end up going to court, but Sturgeon said the “outrageous nature” of any attempt by the British government to thwart the democratic will of Scotland would only fuel the desire for independence. “I couldn't think of a more powerful argument for independence than that,” she said. The Scotland results have been the main focus since an array of local and regional elections took place Thursday across Britain, in which around 50 million voters were eligible to vote. In Wales, the concluded vote count showed Labour doing better than expected as it extended its 22 years in control of the Welsh government despite also falling one seat short of a majority. Mark Drakeford, who will remain first minister, said the party will be “radical” and “ambitious.” Ballots continue to be counted from local elections in England, which already have been particularly good for Johnson's Conservative Party, notably its victory in a special election in the post-industrial town of Hartlepool for a parliamentary seat that Labour had held since 1974. That win extended the party's grip on parts of England that had been Labour strongholds for decades, if not a century. Many seats that have flipped from red to blue voted heavily for Brexit. The speedy rollout of coronavirus vaccines also appears to have given the Conservatives a boost even though the U.K. has recorded Europe's highest COVID-related death toll at 127,500. For Labour's new leader, Keir Starmer, the Hartlepool result was a huge disappointment and has led to another bout of soul-searching in a party that in 2019 suffered its worst general election performance since 1935. Starmer said he would soon set out a strategy of how it can reconnect with traditional voters. He hasn't given details though is thought to be considering a rejig of his top team, starting off with removing his deputy, Angela Rayner, from her roles of party chair and campaign coordinator. Though Labour is clearly losing ground in its traditional heartlands, its support held up in other parts of England, such as the big cities. The party also won other mayoral races, including Steve Rotherham in the Liverpool City Region, Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester and Dan Norris in the West of England region, which includes the city of Bristol. In London, Sadiq Khan is also expected to win a second term as mayor. The Conservatives' Andy Street, meanwhile, was reelected as mayor of the West Midlands, which includes the city of Birmingham.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/scottish-government-sets-stage-for-another-independence-vote/articleshow/82492345.cms||---

The writer said he has been restricted from posting, liking, commenting and sharing posts but can view his as well as others’ accounts and posts. He has also been restricted from using the “live” option for 30 days. Satchidanandan said there was nothing abusive about the video and that it was a “humorous” take on BJP’s performance in the assembly polls. “I did not post anything abusive. I received it on WhatsApp. It showed Adolf Hitler scolding his Nazi followers in his final days but the audio that accompanied it suggested that Amit Shah was lashing out at BJP leaders in Kerala in Malayalam over the party’s failure,” he said Satchidanandan said FB had warned him of restrictive actions earlier on April 21 after he tried to share a post that criticized PM Narendra Modi. He alleged that the central government is suppressing freedom of expression on social media. “Earlier, when I shared a post calling for Modi’s resignation, I got a message from FB which said that the post was abusive and so it is removing it. It also warned me to restrain from such actions. It is clear that there is an understanding between the central government/BJP and Facebook to remove contents criticizing the former. I think they have increased surveillance over the social media activities of social critics and writers, which is quite unfortunate,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fb-limits-services-for-satchidanandan-over-post-targeting-bjp/articleshow/82492403.cms||---
---||Chennai||This Covid-19 hospital was set up by chance||The Omandurar multi super speciality hospital and medical college, which is playing a stellar role in the ongoing war on Covid, came into being as part of one-upmanship between J Jayalalithaa of the AIADMK and M Karunanidhi of the DMK. He built it as the new seat of government — a legislature-cum-secretariat complex. She turned it into a hospital.Their disagreement on the issue started when Jayalalithaa wanted to build a new government headquarters overlooking the Bay of Bengal after razing Queen Mary’s College. The DMK opposed this and there was a public outcry. So she got the Anna University to hand over land at Kotturpuram for a new secretariat. When the DMK came to power in 2006, it returned the land.Karunanidhi as chief minister built a new legislative assembly-cum-secretariat complex at the Omandurar government estate and moved the assembly there from Fort St George. When Jayalalithaa returned to power in 2011, she took the government back to Fort St George. She converted the new complex at Omandurar into the present super-speciality hospital and medical college.Both the titans have since passed from the scene. Now M K Stalin has been elected chief minister and he has a 550-bed Covid hospital in the heart of the city that he can improve on. This is Stalin’s chance to chart his own path without being weighed down by old antagonisms.According to DMK party sources, the state government has not made any decision to reconvert it as an assembly and secretariat complex. "There is absolutely no discussion about it at the moment," a source said.Medical experts and bureaucrats feel it is better not only to retain the hospital there, but also to expand it in view of the pandemic. Experts said the previous government spent more than `100 crore on converting the assembly complex into a super-speciality hospital. "Converting this again into a secretariat complex will result in huge loss to the public exchequer," said Dr Edwin Joe, former director of medical education.The Omandurar hospital has high-end equipment for cancer treatment. It is the only hospital in the state to have a nuclear medicine department."Though a majority of the beneficiaries have been poor, middle-class and upper middle-class also are frequenting to the hospital due to the new building and facilities available here," Dr Joe said.Dr G R Ravindranath, general secretary of Doctors Association for Social Equality, said the building was not originally meant for a hospital and medical college. "To prevent waste of public money, it should be allowed to function as a hospital," he said.On expanding the facilities, Indian Medical Association national president Dr J A Jayalal said, "The hospital can be expanded to have all super-specialities under one roof. They can also add infrastructure for pandemic-related research."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/this-covid-19-hospital-was-set-up-by-chance/articleshow/82492455.cms||---

The virus has resulted in some form of loss — tangible or intangible — for everyone. While there is the mourning over death, there is also a collective loss of normalcy and anxiety about the future, which counsellors say can trigger reactions associated with loss and grief.

---||Chennai||Helping children cope with corona||CHENNAI: On Friday, the sun shone bright into 10-year-old Aaraw’s room, as he read his favourite Percy Jackson novel, with Delhi musician Amira Gill joining him on his iPad screen. In some way, this is the sunniest his life has been in about three weeks since both his parents — Chennai-based Bharatanatyam dancer Narmadha Janarthan and her husband — tested positive for Covid-19, and went into quarantine. "We’re not in a position to coordinate other classes for him, or monitor what he’s doing on his tablet all day. Also, we’ve been pretty drained since we fell sick," says Narmadha. Amira is one of the 20 volunteers from across the globe brought together by Akhila Krishnamurthy, founder of the performing arts company Aalaap, to make life easier for kids who have tested positive for Covid-19, or those whose parents are in quarantine. Like Akhila, parents who are artists, teachers and storytellers are coming to the rescue of kids who have been forced into isolation due to the pandemic and struggling due to lack of physical and social interaction for days on end. "I first heard this happen with a friend’s sister. She was on a ventilator, her husband was in the ICU, and their 10-year-old was alone at home with their house help. It made me think about the trauma these young kids were enduring," she says. The programmes are offered free of cost, with volunteers holding detailed interactions with parents to assess the interests of the child in order to customise sessions they can enjoy. They use therapy, storytelling, drawing, art and craft, and music; teach them prayers, or the basics of chess. "When we learned that a four-year-old girl we were working with loved dogs, our volunteer brought her dog to the session, and the child, who until then was too shy to speak, broke into a smile and started asking questions about the dog," says Akhila. Some days ago, Toronto-based Vidya Thathamangalam, a commercial adviser with a nuclear technologies company, started a similar initiative called ‘Bring a Smile’. Vidya, who is a Rotarian, is supported by fellow Rotarians in her hometown, Coimbatore, to run this programme. They send Google forms for parents to fill out, elaborating on their condition and the interests of the child. Following this, 45-minute sessions are scheduled with the child every day. "When we started, we were focusing on kids aged between five and 13, who had either tested positive or had parents in quarantine. But less than five days after we announced the programme, we were contacted by the mother of a six-year-old boy, who had just lost her spouse to Covid-19, and desperately needed someone to engage with her son as she grieved," says Vidya. "It was then that we realised the enormity of this work." Since then, Vidya and her team have done sessions for a foster home in Mysore with around eight Covid positive children, and are in talks with a Coimbatore hospital to work with an entire Covid ward of asymptomatic children. "Something we like to reiterate to everyone is the context we’re working in," says Akhila. "It is important to remember that this isn’t a summer camp. Most of our volunteers are parents themselves, and this is an attempt to empathise with the child and ensure that while we engage with them, parents get the much-needed opportunity to rest," says Akhila.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/helping-children-cope-with-corona/articleshow/82492471.cms||Saranya Chakrapani

This comes a day after a TOI report about the neglect of the library in the past 10 years as it was inaugurated by the previous DMK government. Following the report, the minister inspected the library on Saturday.“Chief minister M K Stalin directed us to inspect projects launched by the previous DMK government and make a list of all the projects that were not properly maintained. My first inspection was Anna Centenary Library which was founded by DMK leader and former chief minister M Karunanidhi,” he told reporters after inspecting the library.DMK youth wing secretary and Chepauk-Triplicane MLA Udhayanidhi Stalin also visited the library with the minister. “We are saddened that the previous government had even politicised the new library. They removed Karunanidhi’s and Anna’s picture from the library. There is no proper maintenance inside the library and I found water leaking at many places. We will take the report to the CM and revive the library to its original state,” he said.The minister said he had asked the officials to prepare a report after the inspection on the maintenance work that needs to be carried out at the library. “We want to focus on things that need to be done to bring back the library to life instead of finding fault in what happened in the past 10 years,” he said.To a query, the minister said the department will form a committee to take steps for conducting the Class XII exams after the pandemic. The committee will also decide on the modalities for awarding marks to Class X students. Earlier, the state government cancelled the Class X exams while postponing the Class XII board exams due to the pandemic. A meeting has been convened on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/anna-library-will-be-revived-edu-minister/articleshow/82492474.cms||---

At present, 50% of of the 1,760 semi-wholesale shops in the vegetable section are operating on a rotational basis at the market complex. These apart, 200 wholesale shops are operating on a daily basis. The market would be shut as usual on Sunday as part of the weekly closure. Official sources with the housing and urban development department said a government order is awaited in this regard that would give a clearer picture regarding the semi-wholesale vegetable shops at Koyambedu. “If we go by the government's announcement, semi-wholesale shops would be prohibited. But, so far, no order has been issued to change the existing arrangement for allowing the semi-wholesale shops,” an official with the housing and urban development department said. On Saturday, the market received 380 trucks ferrying vegetables to Koyambedu. S S Muthukumar, president of Koyambedu Semi Wholesale Vegetable Traders Association said the market management committee that maintains the KWMC has informed them that semi-wholesale shops will not be impacted due to the new restrictions. “We will work as usual on Monday,” he said. S Chandran, secretary of Federation of Wholesale Vegetable Market Association, said the issue was in discussion. We are not aware about any final decision,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/confusion-reigns-on-operation-of-shops-at-koyambedu-market/articleshow/82492475.cms||---

But the situation did not go out of control as people now have the experience of living through lockdowns and realised that supply of essentials will not be affected during complete lockdown. While the state government has allowed functioning of all shops till 9pm on Sunday, from Monday, provision stores, fish and meat stalls will be allowed to function until noon everyday with 50% capacity. “With the rise in cases during the second wave, a complete lockdown seems to be the only way forward, and unlike last year public were given a couple of days’ time,” said S Karthikeyan, an IT professional and a resident of Nanganallur.  Last April, when the government announced a four-day complete lockdown, only a nine-hour window was available and it led to hordes of people thronging markets. On Saturday, crowds were mostly seen at markets such as Koyambedu, Thiruvanmiyur, Royapettah, Royapuram. “We want to stock up as many items and groceries as we can ahead of the lockdown because we do not want to step out, given the severity of the issue,” said T Rajendran, a resident of Mogappair East. Sushma Reddy, a resident of Ashok Nagar said, “I live with my parents, both of whom are above 80 years old. I do not want to risk going out and contracting the virus. I have bought supplies for the rest of the month today, including vegetables.” A senior corporation official said though people largely did not resort to panic buying, mask discipline is yet to attain desired level. “Essential services, as per the government guidelines, will be available during the lockdown. The public needs to remain indoors to break the chain,” the official said. As a sign of things to come, police were flagging down cars to check if the occupants were wearing masks. They also took time out to explain the situation. “Please maintain social distancing. If one among you is carrying the virus, it can spread upto 40 people from him and then to another 400,” a policeman was seen addressing a crowd at MGR Nagar. With inter-district travel set to be disallowed from Monday, several residents set out to travel to their native towns on Saturday as employees of IT companies can work from home. “The e-pass system will come into place from Monday. It is better to make travel arrangements before that,” said K Kathir from Coimbatore who lives in Perungudi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dj-vu-hits-as-city-prepares-for-15-day-complete-lockdown/articleshow/82492477.cms||Srikkanth D
---||Chennai||Saturday Tasmac revenue likely to be Rs 300cr||Chennai: Soon after the Tamil Nadu government announced a complete lockdown to control the rise in the number of Covid cases, serpentine queues were formed in front of the state-owned wine shops to stock up alcohol for the next fortnight as all liquor outlets will remain shut for a fortnight from May 10. Tasmac shops across Tamil Nadu are expected to earn a revenue of Rs 300 crore on Saturday, twice the usual sales recorded on Saturdays. But, the revenue comes at the cost of physical distancing, which was not adhered to in the liquor outlets. A large number of people had lined up outside several stores including a Tasmac outlet at Mogappair. The situation was similar in Ashok Nagar, Kodambakkam, K K Nagar, T Nagar and West Mambalam. Many wanted to finish shopping for the month on Saturday ahead of the complete lockdown. When contacted, a Tasmac official said the crowd gathered in huge numbers around 11am under the impression that the shops will be shut by noon on Saturday. “Later, the working hours of Tasmac wine shops was extended till 6pm on Saturday and they will operate on Sunday as well. This resulted in considerable reduction of crowds later,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/saturday-tasmac-revenue-likely-to-be-rs-300cr/articleshow/82492487.cms||---

Sreenath Vishnu, chairman, CII-Kerala said, “The governance record and manifesto moored to welfarism and development has helped LDF to retain the power in Kerala.” It said that the previous government had taken a series of proactive measures to improve the investment climate in the state. The government had put in dedicated efforts to ease the process of doing business in the state. Emphasis of the ‘ease of doing business’ initiatives were laid on simplification and rationalization of the existing rules and introduction of IT to make governance more efficient, effective, transparent and user-friendly. “Initiatives such as dedicated toll-free number for investors to provide information on investment-related queries, investment facilitation centre in KSIDC, Kerala single window interface for fast and transparent clearance (KSWIFT) are some of the good initiatives which the previous LDF government had started,” Vishnu added. CII would work closely with the new government on a focused agenda. CII’s efforts in the areas of promoting Kerala as preferred destination for medical tourism and ayurveda, initiatives towards promoting Kerala’s prominent sectors such as food processing, ITES, financial services, value-added spices, hospitality, MSMEs and education will continue under the new government, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cii-kerala-will-work-closely-with-new-government-on-focused-agenda/articleshow/82492454.cms||---

The shooting took place just before 5:00 pm local time (9:00 pm GMT), at the intersection of 7th Avenue and 44th Street, a NYPD spokesperson told AFP. The three victims were a four-year-old child in a stroller, who was hit in the leg while her family was buying toys, a 46-year-old woman hit in the foot, and a 23-year-old tourist from Rhode Island hit in the leg. They were hospitalized in Manhattan, and their lives were not in danger, said New York police commissioner Dermot Shea, at a press briefing. Shea said the three bystanders -- who did not appear to know each other -- stumbled into an argument between two to four men, at least one of whom fired a gun. No arrests had been made by early evening. Police issued an appeal for witnesses and released surveillance camera footage of a wanted man. Times Square, one of New York's tourist hotspots before the pandemic, has changed since theaters all closed in March 2020. According to a recent report by the Times Square Alliance, the neighborhood business association, the area recorded 25 violent crimes in the first quarter of 2021, up from 17 in the same period of 2020. At the end of March, a video of an assault on an older woman of Asian descent shocked the neighborhood. A man with a criminal record, who lived in a hotel near Times Square that had become a reception center for the homeless, was arrested and charged. Neighborhood theaters are set to start reopening on September 14, however, and the mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, recently announced a major campaign to revive tourism from June. Shootings in New York have sharply increased since the summer of 2020 and the protests against the police violence that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, official data show. Crime in general was up 30 percent over the same period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-york-times-square-shooting-leaves-three-injured-including-a-child/articleshow/82492495.cms||---

---||Kochi||Excess bill: Covid patient files plaint||KOCHI: A Covid patient has lodged a police complaint against a private hospital in Aluva alleging that the hospital charged excess amount for treatment. The incident took place last month when a Vaduthala native, Sabeena Saju, sought treatment at the private hospital. Sabeena got admitted to the hospital on April 18 and she got discharged the next day itself and sought treatment in another hospital. The hospital gave her a bill of Rs 24,760 as treatment cost. The amount includes Rs 10,416 for PPE kits and Rs 1,380 for food. She filed a complaint with Aluva police this month and the police in turn forwarded it to Aluva tahsildar since it falls under Disaster Management Act. Meanwhile, the hospital sources justified the bill amount. “She had demanded double bedroom and more facilities and we provided them. When we provided gruel for dinner, she refused to take it. She demanded fruits and we arranged it but again she wanted more facilities. “The next day she left her room without a PPE kit and tried to enter the OP and got engaged in a war of words with others. As she demanded more facilities, we asked her to approach another hospital and offered her ambulance facility. But she hired an online taxi and left the hospital on her own. As she left the room without wearing a PPE kit, we had to disinfect the entire area and had to provide additional PPE kit to our staff. “Hence the high amount for PPE kit. We returned Rs 25 000 as the balance amount of the advance of Rs 50,000 she had paid,” said the private hospital authorities. Meanwhile, the tahsildar said he could respond only after the health authorities conduct an inquiry into the complaint. Sources in the private hospital sector said the amount in the bill was high.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/excess-bill-covid-patient-files-plaint/articleshow/82492571.cms||---

While no private hospitals will be allowed to administer the dose, a detailed plan for the process will be announced by the health department on Sunday. The health department will facilitate the process at government centres on Monday and vaccinations will take off properly from Tuesday. However, residents in this age group who have started registering themselves for the jab, are yet to get slots. Neeraj Tyagi, in-charge of vaccination in GB Nagar, said that the health department held a special meeting on Saturday to plan out the next phase. “The process is the same, people will have to get themselves registered on the government website and they will be given a slot. All minute details for this next phase will be made public by Sunday. The arrangements will be completed by Monday and the centres will be made functional,” he said, adding that vaccines will only be available at 32 government medical facilities across the district.

Singh was Covid-positive and was admitted in Hardik Hospital in Vikas Nagar. However, on Thursday morning, his oxygen levels started dipping and fell below 40. In a last desperate attempt to save his life, his family members approached advocates Manoj Gahlaut and Varun Jain to file a petition which sought an ICU bed with a ventilator on an emergency basis. Prior to this, the two lawyers had handled multiple such pleas from people seeking hospital beds urgently. Cabbie moved court after failing to get bedIn an order passed around 4:30 pm, Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli stated that Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees the most basic of fundamental rights — the right to life and liberty — and directed that all Delhi residents suffering from Covid-19 should be provided with a facility for treatment. “We are sworn to protect the fundamental rights of people. Therefore, we are bound to issue a writ to provide the infrastructure to even the petitioner to undergo the treatment that is required to save his life. If he eventually requires an ICU, ideally speaking, the same should be made available to him,” Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli had said. The bench had, however, clarified that only because he had approached the court, it didn’t give him an advantage over others suffering from Covid-19. By around 6 pm, Singh’s condition worsened, and his lawyers said that despite approaching the authorities in Delhi, he was unable to find a bed. “Around 6-6:30 pm, he passed away. He was a cab driver and worked for a cab aggregator in Delhi. He was on duty and like everyone else, got caught in the second wave,” said Jain. Jain says Singh lived in Vikas Nagar in Hastsal village and is survived by his wife and two sons. “His elder son was the one who approached us and had been trying to find a bed for his father. His family would rely on his daily income to a large extent,” he said. Jain said Singh’s family had approached them for filing a petition in court after they tried getting a bed at several government and private hospitals but failed. “We filed the petition around 2 pm when Singh was still conscious. The plea was taken up the same day, but his vitals started dipping in the evening and there was no way to stabilize that,” said Jain. He said a 52-year-old woman, Kavita, had also approached them on the same day, seeking a bed, and also died of Covid-19. “Before the order was pronounced that day, we had received around seven to eight such pleas and the authorities were able to arrange a bed but we could not get beds for these two patients on time. This highlights the need to set up a centralised system where people can approach the government,” said Jain, who says they plan to file a contempt petition in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cab-driver-who-went-to-delhi-hc-for-icu-bed-dead/articleshow/82492599.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: 2,100 private university seats under government quota||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Andhra Pradesh cabinet recently approved an amendment to the Andhra Pradesh Private Universities (Establishment and Regulation) Act, 2016. The amendment would pave the way for reservation of 35% seats under the state government quota in private universities. According to state officials, the fee for these seats, which would be nominal, will be determined by the Andhra Pradesh Higher Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission. A state education official informed that currently, there are five recognised private universities in Andhra Pradesh with a total intake of 5,937 seats. “As the amendment stipulates 35% reservation of seats, nearly 2,100 seats would be available the students of the state. The reserved seats would be filled on the basis of merit through a common entrance test, either conducted by the government or its instrumentalities as prescribed in the rules,” said the official. Meanwhile, the state cabinet also accorded permission to establish ‘brownfield’ universities in the state. The existing colleges or higher institutions can submit a proposal to be convert themselves into private brownfield universities. The government would examine each proposal and give permission to those which fulfill all the requirements under the Act and in accordance with the rules therein. The decision was taken in line with the provision of the National Education Policy 2020 that directs colleges to strive towards becoming autonomous and eventually transform into universities. According to this proposed new insertion in Andhra Pradesh Private Universities (Establishment and Regulation) Act 2016, the college/institution, which intends to be upgraded as a brownfield university, shall be located in a geographically contiguous area to an extent of at least 50 acres. The institute shall be willing to invest at least 250 crore in the existing college in three years. The institute shall possess NAAC/NBA accreditation with a CGPA of 3.2 or above for two cycles. These institutes should also be willing to allot 35% of the seats under government quota at subsidised rates to benefit poor students of the state as directed by the state government. In 2016, the erstwhile state government had enacted the Private Universities (Establishment and Regulation) Act. It was then estimated that the approved proposals of private universities would bring in investments worth 15,000 crore and 1.5 lakh students over a period of 10 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradesh-2100-private-university-seats-under-government-quota/articleshow/82492606.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Around 12 children admitted to the paediatric ward and a staff nurse there had tested positive for Covid-19 on May1. Six children were shifted to SAT, two to medical college and four asymptomatic kids were transferred to home for room isolation. There were 36 kids admitted to paediatric ward of RCC. Two kids had shown symptoms on May 1 which prompted the authorities to go for Covid testing. Their results came out positive. Soon all the remaining children were also screened and10 tested positive. The authorities had said that they would take all steps to ensure that cancer treatment for children went uninterrupted at RCC. However, parents of a few children who are on high-dose therapy said that the dates of admission have been cancelled. “We were supposed to take the dose within 15 days. My kid was to be admitted in the first week of May, however, now we are being told to report at the OP counter by the middle of May. We are really concerned about the condition of our child. We fear there would be relapse due to the delay in administering high dose chemotherapy,” said a parent. “If the high-dose chemotherapy is delayed, the risk increases for these kids. The chances of relapse are much more. Last year at the time of Covid outbreak, high-dose chemotherapy was stopped and it badly affected some of the children. We were hoping that it doesn’t happen this year. Although we have been asked to report at the OP counter, there is no certainty about continuing the therapy,” another parent said. The parents have appealed to the office of chief minister and health minister for immediate intervention. RCC authorities said that the hospital has put in effect triaging on non-emergency cases due to the present situation. “Admissions for emergency cases are not withheld. Admissions for chemo and radiation are going on as planned. But some triaging of non-emergency cases is being done to overcome the current situation,” RCC authorities said. “The kids’ lives are at stake here,” a parent said. “Now, there are only six kids in the paediatric ward. They can be isolated and new admissions can be taken, we don’t understand why we are being asked to wait.” Meanwhile, a parent of one of the children remaining in the ward tested positive on Saturday. The children who were earlier shifted to SAT have been discharged without any issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/parents-worried-over-halting-rcc-admission/articleshow/82492595.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The ‘auto ambulances’ are a joint initiative of two city-based charities, Reva Foundation and Sai Seva Foundation. All five autos that were launched on Saturday are equipped with 45-litre oxygen cylinders, kits and masks, and can also be availed of by any patient in need of oxygen at home. Sunil Rao of Reva foundation said, “The auto drivers have been trained in giving oxygen support to patients.” He added that patients who are in home isolation and need oxygen can call them and avail of their services for free. “If someone’s oxygen levels are low, they can call us and use the oxygen cylinder for up to four or five hours until their condition improves,” said Rao. Else, people can also use these autos as ambulances to go to a hospital in case of an emergency. Drivers of O 2 autos must wear PPE kitsThough the service was started with five autorickshaws, the organisations will monitor demand and expand the number of ‘auto ambulances’. The drivers of the autos are required to wear PPE kits at all times as well as face shields, masks and gloves. “We have instructed them to regularly sanitise their hands and autos for their safety,” said Rao. Vikas Sharma (27), one of the auto drivers volunteering for the initiative, said: “I understand that there are risks. But if everyone starts thinking like that, who will help the ones in need,’ asked Sharma. He hopes that he can help save some lives by offering his services. Similarly, Dinesh Yadav (32) will also be driving an ‘auto ambulance’. He said he got motivated by seeing other people extending help in these times. “There are so many people doing great work to help Covid patients. This service is something that I can do in my capacity,” said Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/o2-autos-roll-out-in-gurugram-to-double-as-ambulance/articleshow/82492699.cms||Shubhra Pant

As the number of active cases have crossed one lakh mark, the occupancy of ICU beds is about 90% number. The situation is not that bad as it was a fortnight ago, said experts who are following the events. There are about 900 ICU beds in the state.

This is equivalent to around 900 ICU beds available all over the state. Compared to the previous figures when the number of active cases had crossed 40,000 mark in mid-April, the condition is not that deplorable despite the fact that now there are more than 1 lakh active cases, said sources. A source associated with a private hospital which has been contracted by the government said, “The system was totally unprepared that time, now we are increasing our oxygen support beds by spreading the pipeline supply to other normal beds too”. Oxygen supplies have also improved compared to the previous time, this is also coming to rescue, definitely there is a slow decline in number of new cases, but at the same time the recovery rate has once again started to increase, though slowly, thus the work on capacity enhancement needs to be carried forward with more vigour, said sources. Among the major towns, it is basically Indore and Bhopal which are home to most of the active patients and it is in these cities that the infrastructure is stressed up, like in Indore there are only 15 ICU beds available as on May 8, as per the state government data, said sources. But there are adequate oxygen supported beds available, sources said. If the number of patients discharged per day or recovered per day doesn’t improve, despite the fact that less new cases are reported, things could be again troublesome, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/900-icu-beds-available-across-madhya-pradesh-even-as-covid-cases-soar-to-new-high/articleshow/82492792.cms||Amarjeet Singh

TOI was the first to report about the plan (‘BBMP mulls triage to cut hospital waiting time’, May 1).

The goal is to ensure that bed turnaround time is reduced. This is done by ensuring that no person with mild symptoms is admitted to hospital, a severely ill persons is discharged within ten days and a person with moderate illness is shifted to CCCs within five days,” he said.

It’s also expected to provide timely, accurate information relating to masking and physical distancing, symptoms, testing, home isolation while waiting for test results, contact tracing and triaging (identifying home isolation or admission to stabilisation centres or hospitalisation and access to hospital beds with/ without oxygen/ventilators). “The goal is to ensure community triage is set up in each ward so that admission of deserving Covid patients is not delayed. Those who require oxygen should find support within two hours,” said Prasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-adopts-mumbai-model-to-reduce-delay-in-treatment/articleshow/82492859.cms||---

Officials in Beijing had said there was little risk from the freefalling segment of the Long March-5B rocket, which had launched the first module of China's new space station into Earth orbit on April 29. "After monitoring and analysis, at 10:24 (0224 GMT) on May 9, 2021, the last-stage wreckage of the Long March 5B Yao-2 launch vehicle has reentered the atmosphere," the China Manned Space Engineering Office said in a statement, providing coordinates for a point in the Indian Ocean near the Maldives. It added that most of the segment disintegrated and was destroyed during re-entry. Monitoring service Space-Track, which uses US military data, also confirmed the re-entry. "Everyone else following the #LongMarch5B re-entry can relax. The rocket is down," it tweeted. The segment's descent matched predictions by some experts that any debris would have splashed down into the ocean, given that 70 percent of the planet is covered by water. But the uncontrolled re-entry of such a large object had sparked concerns about possible damage and casualties, despite there being a low statistical chance. American and European space authorities were among those tracking its orbits and trying to determine when and where it may come down. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had said the US military had no plans to shoot it down, but suggested that China had been negligent in letting it fall out of orbit. Last year, debris from another Long March rocket fell on villages in the Ivory Coast, causing structural damage but no injuries or deaths. "An ocean reentry was always statistically the most likely," Harvard-based astronomer Jonathan McDowell tweeted. "It appears China won its gamble (unless we get news of debris in the Maldives). But it was still reckless." McDowell had said earlier that China should redesign the Long March-5B to avoid such scenarios.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/chinese-rocket-segment-long-march-5b-yao-2-disintegrates-over-indian-ocean-state-tv/articleshow/82492863.cms||---

The bombing on Saturday evening shook the city's Shi'ite Muslim neighbourhood of Dasht-e-Barchi. The community, a religious minority in Afghanistan, has been targeted in the past by Islamic State militants, a Sunni militant group. An eyewitness told Reuters all but seven or eight of the victims were schoolgirls going home after finishing studies. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Saturday blamed the attack on Taliban insurgents but a spokesman for the Taliban denied involvement, saying the group condemns any attacks on Afghan civilians. Families of the victims blamed the Afghan government and Western powers for failing to put an end to violence and the ongoing war. Bodies were still being collected from morgues as the first burials were conducted in the west of the city. Some families were still searching for missing relatives on Sunday, gathering outside hospitals to read names posted on the walls, and checking morgues. "The entire night we carried bodies of young girls and boys to a graveyard and prayed for everyone wounded in the attack," said Mohammed Reza Ali, who has been helping families of the victims at a private hospital. "Why not just kill all of us to put and end to this war?" he said. The violence comes a week after remaining U.S. and NATO troops began exiting Afghanistan, with a mission to complete the drawdown by September 11, which will mark the end of America's longest war. But the foreign troop withdrawal has led a surge in fighting between Afghan security forces and Taliban insurgents with both sides trying to retain control over strategic centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghan-school-blast-toll-rises-to-58-families-bury-victims/articleshow/82492880.cms||---
---||India||Google Doodle commemorates Mother's Day 2021: Why is Mother's Day celebrated and why its founder wanted to rescind it||NEW DELHI: Google Doodle on Sunday commemorated Mother's Day with a pop card wishing all the mothers around the world on the occasion. The stop-motion artwork from Olivia When doodlelizes the two 'O' alphabets in Google with one bigger than the other. While the yellow and small 'O', seemingly the kid 'O', pops up the heart with a smile, the bigger and red 'O', seemingly the mother 'O' receives them with glee and pops up her heart as well. The rest of the letters in the word 'Google', written the way a child would write them, hang in the background with a tape. Why is Mother's Day celebrated?Mother's Day as we know it today was first celebrated on the second Sunday of May 1908 in the United States of America (USA). The day was founded by Anna Jarvis in memory of her mother Ann Reeves Jarvis, an activist. As historians explain, Ann wanted a day to be commemorated to celebrating mothers "for the matchless service she renders to humanity in every field of life. She is entitled to it." Ann had started running 'Mothers' Day Work Clubs' to combat high infant and child mortality rates. At the work clubs, the mothers learned about hygiene, sanitation and were also provided medicine for the sick in the families. As per historians, Ann had lost nine children, including five during the American Civil War (1861-1865) who most likely died due to disease. Anna passed away in 1905 survived by four children. Why is it Mother's Day and not Mothers' Day?One of Anna's children, Anna Jarvis decided to fulfil her mother's dream and took it upon her to commemorate Ann by celebrating her passing as Mother's Day. However, while Anna's vision was to recognize the contribution of mothers across the world, Ann's approach to the day was from the perspective of a daughter celebrating her mother, hence the singular apostrophe. Why Mother's Day is celebrated on the second Sunday of May?Three years after Ann's death, the first Mother's Day was celebrated in the Andrews Methodist Church in Grafton, West Virginia. Anna chose the second Sunday in May because it would always be close to May 9, the day her mother had died. Anna handed out hundreds of white carnations, her mother's favourite flower, to the mothers who attended. The popularity of the celebration grew. In 1910 Mother's Day became a West Virginia state holiday and in 1914 it was designated a national holiday by President Woodrow Wilson. Why Anna wanted Mother's Day rescinded?One of the major reasons for the success of Mother's Day was its commercial appeal. However, Anna was against it. She fought hard to make her point that the original idea behind Mother's Day had a sentimental value that should not be commercially exploited. Anna urged people not to buy carnations, the prices of which would sky-rocket on Mother's Day. In addition to the flower industry, the card and candy industries were major benefactors of Mother's Day. And that is not how Anna envisioned it. Even before it became a national holiday, Anna had claimed copyright on the phrase "Second Sunday in May, Mother's Day", and threatened to sue anyone who marketed it without permission. Even in old age, Anna went door-to-door in Philadelphia asking for signatures to back an appeal for Mother's Day to be rescinded.

In April, around 5,200 units were apparently delivered by Kalra and team whereas 1,858 units were sold in the first three-four days of May. "We are still going through the documents, but most of these concentrators, it seems clear, were bought at a rate of Rs 14,000-18,000. There are twothree consignments which came for around Rs 23,000-24,000 each,” a senior police officer told TOI. DCP (South) Atul Thakur said invoices showing the concentrators having been sold for Rs 70,000 and more have been seized. Police seizing O2 concentrators during a raid at Khan Chacha.

The cops are in the process of questioning the employees of this firm as well. Matrix, whose CEO and vice-president have been arrested in the case, has claimed that the transactions were legitimate and payments accepted digitally. The police has filed an FIR under IPC sections pertaining to cheating, violating public order and criminal conspiracy apart from sections of Epidemic Diseases Act and Essential Commodities Act. The cops are now conducting raids at five-six places to nab Kalra and his associates. The crime branch has taken over the probe, as first reported byTOIon Saturday, and an SIT has been formed to interrogate the arrested men. Meanwhile, continuing its crackdown on hoarders of concentrators and blackmarketers, Delhi Police has arrested three people and seized 19 imported machines in west Delhi. According to Urvija Goel DCP (West), these concentrators cost Rs 30,000 each but were sold for Rs 1.3 lakh by the gang. The accused have been identified as Bharat Aggarwal, Ishant Gosain and Ranbir Singh. Three cars and Rs 7.8 lakh in cash has also been recovered. The police conducted a raid after receiving a tip-off from an informer. A case under the Epidemic Act and for cheating has been registered. While district deputy commissioners of police enlisted the actions taken on these fronts, the police chief told them to obtain orders from courts as early as possible for release of the seized stuff so that they could be put to use for needy patients.Shrivastava also asked them to intensify action against Covid online fraudsters in coordination with the cyber cell and crime branch for inter-state investigation as most of the calls were originating from Jharkhand, Bihar, West Bengal, MP and Mewat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-7500-concentrators-imported-by-navneet-kalra/articleshow/82492893.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Chennai||Chennai: This Covid-19 hospital was set up by chance||The Omandurar multi super speciality hospital and medical college, which is playing a stellar role in the ongoing war on Covid, came into being as part of one-upmanship between J Jayalalithaa of the AIADMK and M Karunanidhi of the DMK.  He built it as the new seat of government — a legislaturecum-secretariat complex. She turned it into a hospital. Their disagreement on the issue started when Jayalalithaa wanted to build a new government headquarters overlooking the Bay of Bengal after razing Queen Mary’s College. The DMK opposed this and there was a public outcry. So she got the Anna University to hand over land at Kotturpuram for a new secretariat. When the DMK came to power in 2006, it returned the land. Karunanidhi as chief minister built a new legislative assembly-cum-secretariat complex at the Omandurar government estate and moved the assembly there from Fort St George. When Jayalalithaa returned to power in 2011, she took the government back to Fort St George. She converted the new complex at Omandurar into the present super-speciality hospital and medical college. Both the titans have since passed from the scene. Now M K Stalin has been elected chief minister and he has a 550-bed Covid hospital in the heart of the city that he can improve on. This is Stalin’s chance to chart his own path without being weighed down by old antagonisms. According to DMK party sources, the state government has not made any decision to reconvert it as an assembly and secretariat complex. “There is absolutely no discussion about it at the moment,” a source said. Medical experts and bureaucrats feel it is better not only to retain the hospital there, but also to expand it in view of the pandemic. Experts said the previous government spent more than ?100 crore on converting the assembly complex into a super-speciality hospital. “Converting this again into a secretariat complex will result in huge loss to the public exchequer,” said Dr Edwin Joe, former director of medical education. The Omandurar hospital has high-end equipment for cancer treatment. It is the only hospital in the state to have a nuclear medicine department. “Though a majority of the beneficiaries have been poor, middle-class and upper middleclass also are frequenting to the hospital due to the new building and facilities available here,” Dr Joe said. Dr G R Ravindranath, general secretary of Doctors Association for Social Equality, said the building was not originally meant for a hospital and medical college. “To prevent waste of public money, it should be allowed to function as a hospital,” he said. On expanding the facilities, Indian Medical Association national president Dr J A Jayalal said, “The hospital can be expanded to have all superspecialities under one roof. They can also add infrastructure for pandemic-related research.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-this-covid-19-hospital-was-set-up-by-chance/articleshow/82492933.cms||A Ragu Raman

Referring to the dictum of the Supreme Court in the Shivaraj case, the bench noted the top court has clearly held that a tractor could lawfully accommodate only one person, namely, the driver, and that the insurer was not liable to indemnify the tractor owner for liability of a passenger travelling in it. It added the liability of a person working either on ploughing or crushing machines attached to the tractor and who is travelling on the mudguard is not required to be covered by the statutory insurance under section 147(1). Regarding another referred question, the full bench said a ploughing or a crushing machine attached to a tractor is not a trailer. “Every instrument, including ploughing or crushing machine, attached to a tractor will not necessarily be a trailer. At most, it can be a semi-trailer. Even assuming that the said two categories of equipment are semi-trailers, they are not the motor vehicle covered by section 2 (28) of MV Act. Since a semi-trailer is not a motor vehicle, provisions of section 147 will not apply to it,” the bench observed while disposing of the reference made by a single bench. While disposing of a miscellaneous first appeal, cross objections and appeals, the single judge was of the view that since there are conflicting decisions rendered by co-ordinate benches,the questions are required to be referred to a larger bench. Now, in view of these findings, all pending appeals and cross-objections arising out of this group of appeals will have to be placed before the benches concerned having roster for consideration and disposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-insurance-cover-for-person-sitting-on-tractors-wheels-says-karnataka-hc/articleshow/82492960.cms||---

---||World||Australia's most populous state extends Covid restrictions in hunt for outbreak source||SYDNEY: Australia's most populous state recorded no new Covid-19 infections for a third straight day on Sunday but extended raised social distancing and mask-wearing rules by a week as the authorities hunted for the source of a small outbreak. After a Sydney couple tested positive to the coronavirus last week, ending a long run without community transmission, the authorities reinstated some social distancing measures until May 10, and a campaign to get more people tested, as they scrambled to determine the source of infection. On Sunday, the authorities reported a third straight day without a new case, easing concerns about a wider outbreak in the city, but cited the mystery cause of infection as a reason for extending the measures. "As the 'missing link' case hasn't been identified we're keen to prevent a super-spreading event," said New South Wales state premier Gladys Berejiklian in a tweet. "All safeguards/restrictions will be in place for an extra week, except for shoppers in retail who will no longer be required to wear a mask." That means the more than five million people living in and around Sydney must wear masks on public transport and in most public venues, while households are limited to 20 guests at any one time until May 17. Australia has largely eliminated the virus, with 79 days in 2021 without a locally acquired case, according to the government, as a result of a strategy of closing international and domestic borders, as well as social distancing measures. As the country awaits vaccine shipments and watches infection spikes in other countries, top lawmakers have said borders now appear likely to reopen in 2022, not 2021 as previously envisaged. In an interview with News Corp newspapers published on Sunday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was unlikely Australia would reopen its borders soon, although he did not offer a timeline. "I don't see an appetite for that at the moment," he said, referring to border reopening. "What we're seeing at the moment is the appreciation of the people that the pandemic isn't going anywhere. We have to be careful not to exchange that way of life for what everyone else has."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/australias-most-populous-state-extends-covid-restrictions-in-hunt-for-outbreak-source/articleshow/82492982.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Leopard enters kitchen, trapped after 3-hour operation||CHITRADURGA: A leopard that entered a house in Muddappur village of Chitradurga taluk on Saturday morning created panic for a considerable time. Forest officials rescued the big cat, much to the relief of villagers, after a three-hour operation. The leopard is said to have come from a nearby hilly area. Drama unfolded after it was spotted at the house of S Chidanand, who works as a business correspondent at Karnataka Grameen Vikas Bank (Chitradurga). Chidanand said his wife Netravati woke up to the horror of seeing the big cat entering their house from the back door around 6.30am. “Her scream alerted others. By the time I jumped out of bed, it had entered the kitchen,” he said, adding he latched the front and back doors from outside. Villagers who had gathered near the house informed forest officers about the incident. “On reaching the house, officials caught the leopard. We are lucky to have escaped unhurt,” Chidanand said. Chitradurga RFO Sandeep Nayak said after being alerted, they rushed to the spot around 7am with a cage and net. “We covered the front door with the net and placed the cage at the back door. We had a tough time driving the leopard out of the kitchen. When it did, we opened both the doors, and it got entrapped in the cage,” he explained. The RFO said this was the first incident of a leopard entering a house in their limits. “There are hilly areas like Malapanahalli, Guddadranganahalli, Bidarakeri, Sibar, Tamatakallu in the 10km radius of Muddapur. The leopard must have come from one of them. We had also received complaints from villagers about leopard menace three days ago. Animals from forest and hilly areas keep straying into villages in search of prey. This one must have come for the same reason,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-leopard-enters-kitchen-trapped-after-3-hour-operation/articleshow/82492996.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: There’s no end in sight to EPS-OPS tussle for opposition leader post||CHENNAI: After the rout in the assembly elections, the AIADMK is faced with the challenge of selecting the leader of the opposition. Former chief minister and party joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami has an upper hand in this fight with party coordinator O Panneerselvam as he has the support of a majority of the AIADMK MLAs who have won from western Tamil Nadu. A bigger challenge, however, is that the party must decide on the leader of the opposition by May 11 night. The assembly secretariat on Saturday announced its decision to hold the election for the assembly speaker on May 12.Convention has it that the speaker is officially taken to the chair by the chief minister and the leader of the opposition. Despite a three-hour meeting of senior leaders to thrash out the issue, neither EPS nor OPS showed signs of relenting. If the AIADMK retained 32 out of 54 seats in the west, a EPS bastion, down south the party could win only 16 of the 60 seats. OPS was the only AIADMK leader to win in Theni, his home district. A party source gave TOI a sample of the squabble: “While Palaniswami was keen on taking a decision on the leader of the opposition immediately and announce it at the meeting of MLAs seated on the first floor of the party headquarters, OPS suggested a meeting of party headquarters office-bearers and the district secretaries, where he enjoys a better clout, to decide the issue. Supporters of OPS and EPS raised slogans in support of their respective leaders at Jayalalithaa memorial on Friday night. One could hear a shrieking voice telling OPS “don’t give up” (the fight). Panneerselvam left for Theni on Friday night. Earlier, in the party headquarters, the EPS camp pointed to the party’s poor performance in the southern districts and OPS cited the contentious vanniyar quota as the reason for the poor show. The cold war isn’t new; it began in August last year when Palaniswami paraded half of his cabinet to OPS’s residence, seeking to anoint him as the chief ministerial candidate. Panneerselvam yielded then. But now, OPS and other thevar leaders in the party feel EPS’s eleventhhour gesture of exclusive quota to vanniyars dented their fortunes in the elections. OPS’s lone supporter, a nadar representative and a minority, P H Manoj Pandian, could make it from Alangulam seat. In many segments, people belonging to denotified communities contested against thevar ministers in the AIADMK government. Party functionaries in the southern districts feel the prospects would have been better had Palaniswami re-inducted Sasikala and AMMK leader TTV Dhinakaran into the party. OPS supporters don't want to give up the fight this time. “Only OPS, an experienced and able administrator, who filled the shoes of Amma thrice, can steer the opposition,” said AIADMK spokesman V Pugazhendi. The party is yet to officially announce its decision on whether its two Rajya Sabha members – K P Munusamy and R Vaithilingam – who won assembly seats this time, would relinquish their Parliament seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-theres-no-end-in-sight-to-eps-ops-tussle-for-opposition-leader-post/articleshow/82492979.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||World||Myanmar junta brands ousted lawmakers 'terrorists'||BANGKOK: Myanmar's junta has labeled a shadow government of lawmakers and politicians ousted in a February coup and a people's defense force that is being set up to confront security forces as terrorist groups. The government of national unity was established by elected legislators who were barred from taking their seats when the military seized power and detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and others. The junta has previously accused them of treason, and the announcement on state TV Saturday said they were being branded terrorists because of their participation in a civil disobedience movement - a popular revolt against the military takeover that has seen people taking to the streets daily despite the lethal use of force by authorities. More than 700 protesters and bystanders have been killed by security forces since the Feb. 1 coup, according to several detailed estimates. The junta has said the death toll is about one-third of that, and that the use of lethal force was justified to end what it called rioting. Last week, the shadow government announced the formation of ``People's Defense Force,'' which would serve as a precursor to a "Federal Union Army'' of democratic forces including ethnic minorities. The National Unity Government has the backing of several major ethnic minority groups who for decades have been seeking greater autonomy and who maintain their own guerrilla forces. The two most important are the Kachin in the north and the Karen in the east, both of which are actively engaged in combat with the government's military forces. Since the coup and crackdown on opponents, students and factory workers have fled to territory controlled by the ethnic guerrilla forces to take military training.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/myanmar-junta-brands-ousted-lawmakers-terrorists/articleshow/82493023.cms||---
---||India||Variant accelerating India's Covid explosion: Top WHO scientist||GENEVA: A Covid-19 variant spreading in India is more contagious and may be dodging vaccine protections, contributing to the country's explosive outbreak, the World Health Organization's chief scientist said Saturday. In an interview with AFP, Soumya Swaminathan warned that "the epidemiological features that we see in India today do indicate that it's an extremely rapidly spreading variant".  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); India on Saturday for the first time registered more than 4,000 Covid-19 deaths in just 24 hours, and more than 400,000 new infections. New Delhi has struggled to contain the outbreak, which has overwhelmed its healthcare system, and many experts suspect the official death and case numbers are a gross underestimate. Swaminathan, an Indian paediatrician and clinical scientist, said the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19, which was first detected in India last October, was clearly a contributing factor to the catastrophe unfolding in her homeland. "There have been many accelerators that are fed into this," the 62-year-old said, stressing that "a more rapidly spreading virus is one of them". The WHO recently listed B.1.617 — which counts several sub-lineages with slightly different mutations and characteristics — as a "variant of interest".  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); But so far it has stopped short of adding it to its short list of "variant of concern" — a label indicating it is more dangerous than the original version of the virus by being more transmissible, deadly or able to get past vaccine protections. Several national health authorities, including in the United States and Britain, have meanwhile said they consider B.1.617 a variant of concern, and Swaminathan said she expected the WHO to soon follow suit. "B 1.617 is likely to be a variant of concern because it has some mutations which increase transmission, and which also potentially could make (it) resistant to antibodies that are generated by vaccination or by natural infection," she said. But she insisted that the variant alone could not be blamed for the dramatic surge in cases and deaths seen in India, lamenting that the country appeared to have let down its guard down, with "huge social mixing and large gatherings". Mass election rallies held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other politicians have for instance partly been blamed for the staggering rise in infections. But even as many in India felt the crisis was over, dropping mask-wearing and other protection measures, the virus was quietly spreading. "In a large country like India, you could have transmission at low levels, which is what happened for many months," Swaminathan said. "It was endemic (and) probably gradually increasing," she said, decrying that "those early signs were missed until it reached the point at which it was taking off vertically." "At that point it's very hard to suppress, because it's then involving tens of thousands of people and it's multiplying at a rate at which it's very difficult to stop." While India is now trying to scale up vaccination to rein in the outbreak, Swaminathan warned that the jabs alone would not be enough to gain control of the situation. She pointed out that India, the world's largest vaccine-making nation, had only fully vaccinated around two percent of the 1.3 billion-plus population. "It's going to take many months if not years to get to the point of 70 to 80 percent coverage," she said. With that prospect, Swaminathan stressed that "for the foreseeable future, we need to depend on our tried and tested public health and social measures" to bring down transmission. The surge in India is frightening not only due to the horrifying number of people who are sick and dying there, but also because the exploding infection numbers dramatically increase the chances of new and more dangerous variants emerging. "The more the virus is replicating and spreading and transmitting, the more chances are that... mutations will develop and adapt," Swaminathan said. "Variants which accumulate a lot of mutations may ultimately become resistant to the current vaccines that we have," she warned. "That's going to be a problem for the whole world."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/variant-accelerating-indias-covid-explosion-who-top-scientist/articleshow/82493068.cms||---

This is because Twitter handle of the chief minister’s office (@CMOTamilNadu) has been suspended temporarily. On Friday, this handle was changed to Office Of EPS with a description stating that it belonged to Edappadi K Palaniswami, former chief minister of Tamil Nadu. An AIADMK IT wing official said this was done by the former chief minister’s personal team, but that they were working on handing it back to the new CM. Later, another twitter user, to demonstrate its vulnerability, took over the @CMOTamil-Nadu account. After this, the handle was suspended. A similar error has been made in converting the official Facebook page of the chief minister’s office to Office of EPS. The Instagram account of the chief minister continues to bear Palaniswami’s photograph, name and other details. A BJP office-bearer S G Suryah on twitter pointed out that this was a mistake. “Wrong advice given to EPS in transferring institutional twitter handle of the chief minister. Handing over the account to current chief minister and archiving tweets is the right practice,” he tweeted. Suryah also recalled a similar instance involving former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s media advisor Pankaj Pachauri where Twitter had to intervene and hand it back. An office-bearer of the DMK IT wing said they were aware of the issue and working towards retrieving all social media accounts of the chief minister’s office. “This is the first time a government has changed in TN after the arrival of Twitter. The change in social media handles will reflect in a day or two,” the officebearer said. Palaniswami also maintains a personal account which like Stalin’s, is verified by twitter. Politicians make a significant distinction of tweeting only government information through their official handle and political information through personal handle. Though Twitter has guidelines on labelling government accounts, those in India are not yet covered, according to information on its website. The company did not give an officialcomment atthetimeof going to press.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-eps-team-hijacks-cm-m-k-stalins-official-twitter-handle/articleshow/82493069.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

Having anticipated the crowd, police intensified checking and seized vehicles of those roaming without valid reason. As Covid-19 cases continue to surge in the state, patients and their families need to visit hospitals and medical shops. Police assured they will not stop movement of people over health-related issues during the upcoming lockdown. Director general and inspector general of police Praveen Sood told TOI: “We never disturb people moving around for health-related issues or medical emergencies. We are concerned about those on the road without valid reason.” He added: “Like previous days, we request the public to carry medical records when they go out.” Asked about those heading to a clinic or hospital for the first time and without any documents, Sood replied: “All they need to do is give a proper explanation to police when stopped.” Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant said: “All these days, we have allowed movement of many people who cited health concerns and furnished relevant documents. But there were cases of some carrying irrelevant medical records and roaming for personal work. In such instances, we will act sternly. People need to understand that police are on the road for public welfare. Cops are getting infected largely due to their interactions with the public at checkpoints or during mask drives.” While many establishments were shut on Saturday, shops selling essentials like milk, pharmacies and fuel stations continued to operate. Asked about the increase in checks, a senior cop from Bengaluru said they had expected the rush. “Though the government has allowed purchasing of essentials and grocery items between 6am and 10am during the upcoming lockdown, we had anticipated a sudden rush on Saturday and Sunday. We were right. More people turned up to buy items on Saturday. We found some roaming around without valid reason and seized their vehicles,” he said. Similar scenes prevailed in other parts of Karnataka too, with people visiting their nearest markets to purchase essentials. A superintendent of police from a district said they have received orders from the higher-ups to strictly check unwanted movement. “Sometimes, deciding if the reason cited by the traveller is genuine or not can be tough. However, we will not prevent patients or their family members from travelling on roads. Many patients from Bengaluru — those with Covid symptoms in particular, are heading to other districts in search of hospitals. Many have got admitted in hospitals of Chikkamagaluru, Hassan, Manipal, Udupi and Dharwad. Most of them travel in private vehicles and we never stop them. In fact, there have been instances where police at check-points have helped patients by getting them shifted to the nearest hospital,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-markets-witness-rush-ahead-of-lockdown-police-intensify-vigil/articleshow/82493106.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Duo posing as sales tax officials robs bizman of 180 oximeters, Rs 40,000||BENGALURU: Two miscreants pretending to be sales tax officials robbed a 37-year-old businessman of 180 oximeters and Rs 40,000 cash at VV Puram on Wednesday. Dinesh Kumar, a resident of Prakashnagar and who runs Srivari Distributors, received an order to supply 200 oximeters to a company in Koramangala. So, he procured 180 oximeters from Chennai on Tuesday. Meanwhile, an unknown person contacted Kumar over the phone and enquired about oximeters. Police said Kumar informed the caller that there was no stock of oximeters. Kumar received another call from the same person the next morning. Kumar told the caller he was on his way to Koramangala to deliver oximeters. The caller expressed his intention to have a look at the oximeters. Kumar agreed and asked the caller to meet him at VV Puram. Two unknown persons approached Kumar on a scooter and posed as sales tax officials. The miscreant-duo asked Kumar to accompany them to their office. “The duo demanded cash from Kumar. They forced him to withdraw Rs 40,000 from a nearby ATM kiosk. The two fled the spot with cash and 180 oximeters worth Rs 18,0000 from Kumar,” a police officer said. Kumar later told police that one of the miscreants appeared to be about 45 years old and another around 35, and both communicated with him in Urdu. VV Puram police have taken up a case of robbery and efforts are on to nab the suspects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-duo-posing-as-sales-tax-officials-robs-bizman-of-180-oximeters-rs-40000/articleshow/82493122.cms||Santosh kumar.B

---||World||Beefed-up Israel police clash with Palestinians in Jerusalem||JERUSALEM: Israeli police on Saturday clashed with Palestinian protesters outside Jerusalem's Old City during the holiest night of Ramadan in a show of force that threatened to deepen the holy city's worst religious unrest in several years. Earlier, police blocked busloads of pilgrims headed to Jerusalem for prayer at Islam's third holiest site. Police defended their actions as security moves, but these were seen as provocations by Muslims who accuse Israel of threatening their freedom of worship. Competing claims to east Jerusalem, home to major shrines of Judaism, Islam and Christianity, lie at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and have triggered serious violence in the past. The unrest came a day after violence in which Palestinian medics said more than 200 Palestinians were wounded in clashes at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound and elsewhere in Jerusalem. Friday's violence drew condemnations from Israel's Arab allies and calls for calm from the United States and Europe and the United Nations. The Arab League scheduled an emergency meeting on Monday. Early Sunday, the Israeli military said Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip fired a rocket at the country's south that fell in an open area. In response, aircraft struck a military post for Hamas, the militant group ruling the territory. There were no reports of casualties in either attack. Police chief Koby Shabtai said he had deployed more police in Jerusalem following Friday night's clashes, which left 18 police officers wounded. After weeks of nightly violence, Israelis and Palestinians were bracing for more conflict in the coming days. ``The right to demonstrate will be respected but public disturbances will be met with force and zero tolerance. I call on everyone to act responsibly and with restraint,'' Shabtai said. Saturday night was "Laylat al-Qadr'' or the ``Night of Destiny,'' the most sacred in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Islamic authorities estimated 90,000 people gathered for nighttime prayers at Al-Aqsa, the third-holiest site in Islam. A large crowd of protesters chanted ``God is great'' outside the Old City's Damascus Gate, and some pelted police with rocks and water bottles. Police patrols fired stun grenades as they moved through the area, and a police truck periodically fired a water cannon. Palestinian medics said 64 Palestinians were wounded, mostly by rubber bullets, stun grenades or beatings, among them a woman whose face was bloodied. Eleven people were hospitalized, medics said. One man with a small boy yelled at the police as they marched by. ``You should be ashamed!`` he said. Earlier, police reported clashes in the Old City, near Al-Aqsa, and in the nearby east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where dozens of Palestinians are fighting attempts by Israeli settlers to evict them from their homes. Police reported several arrests, and said one officer was struck in the face with a rock. Earlier Saturday, police stopped a convoy of buses that were filled with Arab citizens on the main highway heading to Jerusalem for Ramadan prayers. Israel's public broadcaster Kan said police stopped the buses for a security check. Muslims fast from dawn to dusk during Ramadan, and travelers, upset that they were stopped without explanation on a hot day, exited the buses and blocked the highway in protest. Kan showed footage of the protesters praying, chanting slogans and marching along the highway toward Jerusalem. The road was reopened several hours later. Ibtasam Maraana, an Arab member of parliament, accused police of a "terrible attack'' on freedom of religion. "Police: Remember that they are citizens, not enemies,'' she wrote on Twitter. The current wave of protests broke out at the beginning of Ramadan three weeks ago when Israel restricted gatherings at a popular meeting spot outside Jerusalem's Old City. Israel removed the restrictions, briefly calming the situation, but protests have reignited in recent days over the threatened evictions in east Jerusalem, which is claimed by both sides in their decades-old conflict. Other recent developments also contributed to the tense atmosphere, including the postponement of Palestinian elections, deadly violence in which a Palestinian teenager, two Palestinian gunmen and a young Israeli man were killed in separate incidents in the West Bank, and the election to Israel's parliament of a far-right Jewish nationalist party. One right-wing lawmaker, Itamar Ben-Gvir, briefly set up an outdoor ``office'' in Sheikh Jarrah, near the homes of residents facing eviction. On Sunday evening, Jewish Israelis begin marking ``Jerusalem Day,'' a national holiday in which Israel celebrates its annexation of east Jerusalem and religious nationalists hold parades and other celebrations in the city. On Monday, an Israeli court is expected to issue a verdict on the planned evictions in Sheikh Jarrah. Israel captured east Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza - territories the Palestinians want for their future state - in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally, and views the entire city as its capital. The Palestinians view east Jerusalem - which includes major holy sites for Jews, Christians and Muslims - as their capital, and its fate is one of the most sensitive issues in the conflict. The Al-Aqsa mosque compound is the third holiest site in Islam. It is also the holiest site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount because it was the location of the biblical temples. It has long been a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In recent days, protests have grown over Israel's threatened eviction in Sheikh Jarrah of dozens of Palestinians embroiled in a long legal battle with Israeli settlers trying to acquire property in the neighborhood. The United States said it was ``deeply concerned'' about both the violence and the threatened evictions. The so-called Quartet of Mideast peace makers, which includes the U.S., European Union, Russia and United Nations, also expressed concern. Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, condemned Israel's actions, as did the Gulf countries of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, two of the four Arab countries that signed U.S.-brokered normalization agreements with Israel last year. The UAE expressed ``strong condemnation'' of Israel's storming of Al-Aqsa. In a call to Palestine TV late Friday, President Mahmoud Abbas praised the ``courageous stand'' of the protesters and said Israel bore full responsibility for the violence. Abbas last week postponed planned parliamentary elections, citing Israeli restrictions in east Jerusalem for the delay. Israel's Foreign Ministry had earlier accused the Palestinians of seizing on the threatened evictions, which it described as a ``real-estate dispute between private parties,'' in order to incite violence. Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip and opposes Israel's existence, has called for a new intifada, or uprising. Late Saturday, several dozen protesters gathered along Gaza's volatile frontier with Israel, burning tires and throwing small explosives. Israeli forces fired tear gas at the crowd. No injuries were immediately reported. In an interview with a Hamas-run TV station, the group's top leader Ismail Haniyeh warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to ``play with fire'' in Jerusalem. ``Neither you, nor your army and police, can win this battle,'' he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/beefed-up-israel-police-clash-with-palestinians-in-jerusalem/articleshow/82493135.cms||---
---||Bhopal||MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan visits Covid centre in Budhni||BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that in view of the rising cases of Covid-19, centres will be set up in rural areas with all the necessary arrangements for patients. Chouhan on Saturday took stock of the 300-bed Covid care centre on the Eklavya Residential School campus at Budhni in Sehore district. Divisional Commissioner Kavindra Kiyawat, Kartikeya Singh Chouhan and senior officials including IG and DIG were present. Chouhan said that this “state-of-the-art” Covid care centre will be started soon with 300 beds. Patients will be admitted soon by the Rapid Response Team. Local patients will not have to go to other cities for treatment. The CM was briefed by engineers and senior officials and got information about the lay-out plan of the centre. ITC officials said that the hospital will be built in three phases. In the first phase, 144 oxygen beds will be ready by May 20. The second and third phases will be rolled out in next 15 days. Chouhan told the officials to ensure quality of work. Earlier, the CM also visited the Covid care centre in Eklavya Residential Complex and spoke to the admitted patients. He told officials to ensure physicians be provided “state-of-the-art” resources. During the review, Dr. Ankush Sharma in-charge told the chief minister Chouhan that at present a 72-bed Covid care centre has been constructed in 36 rooms of Block-A, B and C of Eklavya Residential Complex. Fifty oxygen beds have been set up and 23 patients are under treatment. So far, 62 corona patients have been treated and discharged. Chouhan has said that the state government is making all possible efforts to deal with the pandemic. The CM made a surprise inspection of the Shahganj Covid Care Centre in Sehore and reviewed the arrangements there. A 16-bed Covid care centre has been set up at Shahganj. Four oxygen cylinders and two concentrator machines are also available. Chouhan also inspected the 40-bed Covid Care Center running in the tribal girls hostel of Nasrullaganj. During the inspection, he spoke to the patients admitted at the centre and told them not to panic, keep up their spirits and assured them that all will recover from Corona infection. He sought a detailed information regarding the arrangements at the centre from the authorities concerned . He instructed to ensure continuous availability of medicines, oxygen and other basic facilities at the centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan-visits-covid-centre-in-budhni/articleshow/82493138.cms||---

Essentially, the full vaccination of healthcare and frontline workers and citizens aged above 45, who have taken the first dose, is being prioritised. A circular in this regard was sent to officials on May 7 and displayed at all government-run health centres on Saturday. The directive implies that the 45-plus who have not taken the first dose may not get slots. On Friday, the Union health ministry had asked states to use supply of vaccines through government channels in 70:30 ratio for the second and first doses, respectively. As of May 7, 65.2 lakh beneficiaries in Karnataka were yet to take the vaccine second dose. These include 2.4 lakh healthcare workers, 2.7 lakh frontline personnel, 26.8 lakh senior citizens and 33.2 lakh citizens aged between 45 and 60 years. A communication from Dr Arundhathi Chandrashekar, mission director, National Health Mission, to all districts on May 7 stated that only 60 per cent of the frontline personnel and 72 per cent of the healthcare workers had taken the second vaccine dose. The government has directed the districts to focus on fully vaccinating healthcare and frontline workers and citizens aged 45 and above. Experts working with the government agree with this strategy, but several clinicians told STOI that the drive to give the first dose to citizens in the 18-plus age group should proceed. Epidemiologist Dr Giridhara R Babu, a member of the state technical advisory committee on Covid-19, said that the focus should be on completing vaccination coverage of the 45-plus. “The next highest priority should be for persons of any age with comorbidities,” he said. Committee chairperson Dr MK Sudarshan shared a similar view: “That is to offer good protection against severe disease and prevent deaths in the vulnerable group.” Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Mehta, a member of the BBMP expert committee on Covid-19, said the question now was “all for some or some or all”. The UK followed the some-for-all strategy. “I subscribe to this approach. There is a strong chance that even one dose takes the edge off moderate to severe disease. Since the aim is to stop deaths, it makes sense to provide vaccination to all,” he said. He added that a delayed second dose was fine as far as Covishield was concerned. Currently, only four hospitals in Bengaluru administer shots to the 18-44 age group. The response has been huge, according to Dr Yatheesh Govindaiah, unit head at Apollo Hospitals, Jayanagar. “We are able to provide online slots for 200 people, and the slots get booked in a couple of minutes. The government has to vaccinate vulnerable persons in commercial hubs like the city market. People who are mobile need to be vaccinated, so do all those who sell groceries and vegetables,” he said, adding that the severity of the second wave had led to vaccine eagerness. Oncology surgeon Dr Pramukh N, who has been treating Covid patients through a virtual mode, said that the need of the hour was to inoculate residents of densely populated areas, including slums. Oncologist Dr US Vishal Rao, a member of the expert committee, believes delaying the second dose of Covishied to up to three months enhances the vaccine benefit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/karnataka-govt-vax-centres-to-focus-on-45-plus-due-for-2nd-shot/articleshow/82493362.cms||Sunitha Rao R

All small drains have been cleared and cleaned. Work is underway on medium-sized drains. Big drains that rise to dangerous levels in monsoon fury, would be cleared of encroachments in the coming days,” said BMC official. The large drains require use of heavy machinery. There are about 800 large drains in the city. Many of these were inundated to their capacity in 2016. It leads to unprecedented flooding in low-lying areas. Before the monsoon, BMC undertakes removal of encroachments from drains. If not, it leads to flooding and blocks natural sewage. Removal dirt, soil and debris from surfaces that came were swamped with flood water is being taken up, he added. About 80% of sewerage water mixes with storm-water drains in the state capital, leaving more than 30 locations in Bhopal vulnerable to floods or flood-like situation in case of heavy downpour, according to Bhopal Smart City Development Corporation Limited (BSCDCL) report prepared in 2018. However, number of areas may go up, owing to illegal concrete structures coming up on storm-water drains||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-civic-body-cleans-up-clogged-drains/articleshow/82493159.cms||---

In a fresh complaint lodged, the company has alleged that mining mafia is troubling them at the behest of a minister and his nephew for extorting money with support from the local TI. No one was said to be injured in the firing incident. Company’s director Sambaji Rao Awad said that a gang started firing on their staff that was escorting a truck loaded with sand. Several empty cartridges of 12 bore and 315 were recovered from the spot. They have named three people Manish Panda, Lalo Gurjar and Banti Gurjar in the complaint. “When our staff saw them loading five tractors of sand from our mine and stopped them, they opened fire. Thankfully no one was injured. It has created panic in the surrounding villages as well,” he said. “We are finding it very difficult to operate. If the government can’t help us operate the legal mines they shouldn’t have floated the tender. A hundred crore is no small money,” he said. “It’s not the mafia we are scared of; the problem is the police cover they are getting,” he added. Last month also the same company had lodged a complaint alleging interference of policemen from Datia for extortion. The Datia police had been harassing them by manhandling their employees and taking away their machines crossing their jurisdiction, said a complaint to the director general of police (DGP) Vivek Johri by MP Sales Corporation, which had won Rs 100cr tender for sand mining in Gwalior.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bullets-fired-at-sand-contractors-in-gwalior-no-one-hurt/articleshow/82493195.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Life rolls on for railway line ‘warriors’||BHOPAL: Even as the pandemic rages across the country, the employees of Bhopal Railway division are working tirelessly minus the recognition of ‘Covid Warriors’. Even when the passenger trains were not running last year, the railway employees were maintaining the tracks. This hard work comes even as the virus claimed 31 members of the division till now. Praising the employees, DRM Bhopal, Uday Borwanker said they have proved that they can deliver their best even during the pandemic. “Employees and officers of Bhopal Railway division have been working all the time even in dire times like the ongoing pandemic. It is just because of their efforts we have been able to deliver services like during normal times,” said Borwanker, adding that the maintenance staff had a major role in keeping the show going. “Drivers, guards and other staff are the bare minimum requirement on a running train. They are at the front end. However, the maintenance guys, on the services side, also play a key role,” said Borwanker. “Track is the most vulnerable aspect in railways as it is always open under the sun. It has become even more vulnerable when the climate is hostile. In Bhopal division, climate is extreme and we need to regularly check the tracks, OHE lines and other related works.” Laxity even for a day can hinder train movement, he added. In order to keep the staff motivated, Borwanker assures them he’s only a call away. “I am available 24X7. I have directed other officers also to keep in touch with employees so that their motivation could be maintained,” said Borwanker. Around 3347 Eicher tractors have been sent by Bhopal Division, including 598 tractors exported to Bangladesh during the pandemic. Even Union railway minister, Piyush Goyal had praised Bhopal division for the achievement. Railway had earned around Rs 2.58 crore profit from this. Besides, Bhopal division runs an average of 180 trains (mail, parcel, summer special) trains in April 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-life-rolls-on-for-railway-line-warriors/articleshow/82493228.cms||Ramendra Singh

Interestingly, it was just 58 new infections in an hour in April, which reported as many as 42,000 new coronavirus cases. The records of the CMHO office showed that in first week of May, the district reported 12,481 new cases. Dr Anil Dongre, district contact tracing officer in-charge said, “The new cases have risen in Indore district in the first week of May because of the massive spread of the virus in last weeks of April, which was before the imposition of the total lockdown.” “But since the lockdown was imposed in the district and two weeks have passed, there are good chances of the viral infection fading away gradually”, said Dr Dongre. MGM dean Dr Sanjay Dixit said, “The cases were showing an increase in the first week of May because of the last leg of the cyclic peak leading to surge in cases in the second wave.” “But, because of the two weeks of lockdown, it is possibly going to decrease in upcoming days,” said Dr Dixit. People, however, have to remain very cautious because the virus is still around and proper precautions, including masking and social distancing norms should be followed,” said Dr Dixit. “People also must get themselves vaccinated”, he added. The records also suggest that fatality rate has also increased with seven deaths per day in the first week of May, which stood at six in April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/74-tested-positive-every-hour-in-indore-in-the-1st-week-of-may/articleshow/82493267.cms||Pravin Barnale

Nath said fuel prices remained unchanged for 18 days during the assembly polls in four states and one Union territory and now that the results are out, the rates have started increasing again. “Opportunities in an emergency,” the former chief minister said on the social media platform. “Because of the elections, there was no change in the prices of petrol-diesel for 18 days and now after the poll results, there has been a continuous increase in the prices of petrol-diesel. Petrol crossed Rs100 in Anuppur and it’s close to Rs100 in Bhopal,” Nath said. In Bhopal, petrol price was Rs99.35 on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/petrol-price-on-rise-because-polls-are-over-says-pcc-chief-kamal-nath/articleshow/82493283.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Transfer of Damoh collector, SP after BJP’s defeat shocking: Nath||BHOPAL: PCC chief Kamal Nath on Saturday questioned the Madhya Pradesh government’s decision to remove the district collector and SP of Damoh, five days after the BJP’s defeat in the bypoll there. In a statement, the former chief minister said that he found the transfer of administrative officers after the ruling party candidate’s defeat “sudden and shocking”. “The decision by the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government raises one question – did BJP give the district collector and SP the responsibility to win the bypoll there?” Nath asked. On Friday, while state BJP served a showcause notice to former finance minister Jayant Malaiya for ‘anti-party activities’, the government also removed Damoh collector Tarun Rathi and SP Hemant Chouhan. “Will the government punish the Damoh district collector and SP for fulfilling their duties and maintaining the dignity of their uniform by conducting a free and fair election?” Nath asked. “It is clear that BJP wanted to misuse the administrative machinery to win the Damoh bypoll. After its unsuccessful attempt, the saffron party is trying to terrorise administrative officials by transferring the collector and SP,” Nath said. Incidentally, Malaiya’s son Siddharth has been suspended from the primary membership of BJP. Nath said that BJP’s other victims are Jayant and Siddharth Malaiya. The senior Congress leader argued that for two months, the ruling party’s entire government, including 22 ministers, many MLAs, MPs and its money power were utilised in the Damoh bypoll. “Even after that, if the Malaiya family could give the Congress candidate a victory by 17,000 votes, then looking at his political acumen and influence, BJP should immediately make him the chief minister”, Nath said. “This defeat of BJP is the failure of that leader who was in Damoh for two months and yet could not secure victory. This defeat is because of the unethical politics of CM Chouhan, which has been defamed for purchasing power. This is the defeat of those who consider themselves above democracy and the Constitution,” Nath added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/transfer-of-damoh-collector-sp-after-bjps-defeat-shocking-nath/articleshow/82493296.cms||---
---||Shimla||Increase testing facilities: HC to Himachal Pradesh||SHIMLA: Hearing a petition on the lack of medical facilities in state medical colleges and hospitals, the Himachal Pradesh high court has directed the state government to increase the number of authorised laboratories, clinics and hospitals to increase Covd-19 testing. The court also asked the state government to consider sending fully equipped ‘mobile vans’ also to increase testing and prevent the spread of Covid-19. The court directed the state to increase the number of dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and consider the feasibility of establishing temporary hospitals with the help of any other central agency, so a sufficient number of beds equipped with oxygen and ventilators were available. The division bench comprising Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Justice Chander Bhusan Barowalia, while hearing a petition on Thursday, directed the state to resort to the use of other testing kits, besides rapid antigen or RT PCR tests.Court asked the state to increase the number of ICUs in hospitals, as the second strain was said to be directly affecting lungs of the patient. It also directed the state to consider purchasing additional CT scan machines to detect the second strain of Covid-19 virus. During the hearing of petition, petitioner counsel Senior Advocate B N Misra argued that there was an acute medical crisis in the state due to sudden surge and spread of Covid-19, which had engulfed urban areas and villages too. He said many deaths had been reported during the past few days from acoss the state due to acute shortage of oxygen. He said there was a shortage of lifesaving drugs, more particularly, Remdesiver, Tocilizumab and Favipiravir. He said dedicated Covid hospitals had been established in major towns like Shimla, Dharamshala, Mandi, Nahan and Chamba, but there were hardly such hospitals in other district headquarters, leave alone the tehsil headquarters, resulting in critical patients being rushed to the five hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/increase-testing-facilities-hc-to-himachal-pradesh/articleshow/82493289.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bed blocking scam hits north Karnataka hospitals too||BAGALKOT: In the middle of a brutal second wave, some private hospitals in north Karnataka are refusing to admit Covid-19 patients after claiming full bed occupancy or a shortage of oxygen and drugs like Remdesivir, allege activists. The real-time data on the government website for bed management shows that the hospitals have vacant beds and adequate medical resources. “A few private hospitals say they don’t have free beds, especially oxygenated ones, or sufficient oxygen. When patients insist on admission, they demand a huge amount of money. It’s like black marketeering of beds,” an activist alleged. Such complaints are coming mainly from Bagalkot district, about 475km from Bengaluru. STOI did a reality check by enquiring about bed availability at some facilities. “Right now, we do not have oxygen for patients,” said Dr Priyadarshini S Ugalawat, a coordinator at Venkateshwara Hospital in Badami. When STOI pointed to the data posted by the district administration, which showed the hospital had a buffer oxygen stock and one ICU bed and six oxygenated ones, Dr Priyadarshini said the website might be displaying old figures. Dr Prabhudev Andabi of Sharan Hospital in Mahalingpur said that it had no oxygenated beds. But the government website data contradicted this. It was the same in the case of Ashirwad Hospital, Dr Malaji hospital and SNM Kumareshwar Medical College. Only the government-run, 350-bed Bagalkot district hospital was fully occupied. Bagalkot district deputy commissioner K Rajendra said that he had no information on the issue and asked STOI to contact the district health officer. The health officer did not respond to repeated calls. An official in the deputy commissioner’s office claimed that many private hospitals were denying admission to the general public because influential figures, including MLAs, had blocked beds. A senior IAS officer from north Karnataka alleged that private facilities were indulging in malpractice and suggested that the district administration should deploy nodal officers there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bed-blocking-scam-hits-north-karnataka-hospitals-too/articleshow/82493343.cms||---
