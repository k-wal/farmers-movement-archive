There is no chairperson heading the DRT appellate tribunal. The HC bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and Justice MS Karnik passed the order in petitions filed by Bank of Bahrain and Kuwait vs Union of India and MSTC Ltd versus Standard Chartered Bank against recovery proceedings. The bench said its endeavour has been to ensure that appointment of the chairperson of the DRAT(Mumbai) is expedited by the Centre without wasting any time. It said without going into merits of the petition filed by a government of India undertaking MSTC Limited against recovery proceedings it was “only as an ad-interim measure,” directing protection of the rights of both parties till further orders. The HC said, “a fervent appeal of ASG Anil Singh that any order of restraint, if passed, would adversely affect the recovery processes, has not impressed us.” The bench said, “We are conscious that stalling of recovery processes would affect the economy of the nation, but at the same time, we cannot overlook that the dates of demitting offices by the respective Chairpersons of the DRATs having been known to the relevant department from the respective dates they took charge, the process to appoint Chairpersons ought to have commenced much prior to July 4, 2021.” The high court said, "allowing recovery processes to continue without providing an effective remedy of appeal, particularly when the SARFAESI Act empowers secured creditors to take possession of secured assets without orders of Court, would result in desecration of the legal system." The HC said, “We, accordingly, direct that if any party is desirous of challenging an order passed by any DRT situated in the State of Maharashtra before the DRAT(M), he/she/it shall be at liberty to present an appeal before the DRAT(M) together with the requisite fees irrespective of whether the period of limitation has expired or not; however, after the appeal is preferred (together with application for condonation of delay, if any, or any other application including an application for stay), the order under challenge would remain stayed from the time the appellant makes a pre-deposit of at least 25% of the debt due from him/her/it, as claimed by the secured creditors or determined by the DRT, whichever is less. Once such pre-deposit is made, any secured creditor or party in whose favour an order has been passed by the DRT for effecting recovery shall remain injuncted from taking any action adverse to the interest of the appellant. Such pre- deposit shall be without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties in the appeal before the DRAT(M). This arrangement shall continue till January 4, 2022 for the present.” For MSTC , the HC directed that the proceedings before the recovery officer shall remain stayed unconditionally till Tuesday next (December 7, 2021); if by that date, MSTC Limited deposits 25% of the debt due from it to the respondent in the HC Prothonotary office., the order of stay of proceedings before the recovery officer shall also continue to be operative till January 4, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-invokes-suo-motu-power-to-protect-interest-of-litigants-before-drat/articleshow/88056053.cms||Swati Deshpande

Such people will be unable as of now to book their booster dose on the NHS as it does not recognise the Indian vaccine Covaxin or the Covishield vaccine produced under licence in India. However, work is ongoing to expand the range of vaccinations that can be recorded in the English vaccination system. Their booster jab will get recorded immediately on their vaccine files and in the NHS app, but whether the first two jabs (taken in India) are recorded in the app is all dependent on a new solution being developed by NHS Digital, according to a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson. "Individuals can access a booster at a walk-in centre without needing their record to be updated in advance", the spokesperson said on Thursday. The spokesperson added that a "booking service solution" was being developed to enable people with overseas vaccinations to contact the NHS and book appointments to "review the evidence of their vaccination and have their record updated". "This is expected to be live shortly," the spokesperson said. Noida-born IT consultant Nimit Shishodia (42), an Indian citizen working in London, flew back to the UK from India last Sunday with his mother, Rajnee Shisodia (65). She got stuck in India during the lockdown so had her two doses of Covishield in Uttar Pradesh. After flying back, Nimit tried to register her for a booster dose online but the NHS site would not allow it, saying she had not yet had the first or second jab. He then phoned her doctor to explain but the GP said Indian vaccines were not accepted by the NHS and refused to change his mother’s record. "I can’t let my mother get the virus. I need her to get the booster jab," he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/people-who-had-2-covaxin-or-covishield-doses-in-india-can-get-booster-in-uk-only-at-walk-in-centres-for-now/articleshow/88058976.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Semmie Lee Williams, 39, was arrested Wednesday in Miami on first-degree murder charges for the November 15 slaying of Ryan Rogers, whose body was found alongside an Interstate 95 overpass the next day, said Palm Beach Gardens Chief Clinton Shannon. The high school freshman and avid soccer player had gone out for an early evening bike ride and never returned home.  Court records show Rogers was stabbed numerous times in the head. The records say Williams' DNA was found on a pair of headphones at the scene and that Rogers' blood was found on a bandana Williams had in his backpack when he was located. Investigators say Williams also matches the description of a man videotaped by a security camera walking toward the area where the body was found about 10 minutes before the boy's cell phone stopped moving.  Williams denied ever encountering Rogers, the records show. Williams made his first court appearance Thursday and was ordered held without bond.  Shannon said Williams has no known ties to Palm Beach County and it is unknown why he would have been in the area, which is about 80 miles (129 km) north of Miami. No one else is believed to be involved in the slaying.  "This appears to be a completely random act. We do not have a motive," Shannon said. "I would best describe it as an innocent child victim having a chance encounter with a very violent criminal."  Williams pleaded guilty three years ago in Atlanta to aggravated assault-strangulation and battery on a person 65 or older for a random 2014 attack, court records show. Court procedures were delayed for four years because Williams was found mentally incompetent to assist in his defence.  A man was walking down the street when Williams jumped out from behind a wall, ran up behind him, put him in a tight chokehold and beat him on the head, transcripts of WIlliams' 2018 court hearing show.  The victim testified that he could not breathe during the attack and was about to pass out when passersby intervened. Williams threw the victim into a ravine, leaving him with a permanent arm injury, and ran away. Williams was arrested after a short search of the area.  The victim said that he asked Williams during the attack if he wanted money.  "He said no. He knows my kind and he is going to finish me," the victim told Judge Thomas A. Cox Jr. "I'm lucky to be alive. The intent was to kill me."  Williams had served four years in jail and a mental hospital. Prosecutors wanted an additional year, but Cox said that since Williams had no prior felony convictions, he would be sentenced to time served and released that day. Cox ordered Williams to leave Georgia immediately upon release and travel by bus to central Florida to live with his mother, who had agreed to care for him. He was to serve five years probation in Florida.  The Atlanta victim did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The Associated Press is not naming him to protect his privacy.  Williams also has arrests in the mid-2000s in central Florida for various misdemeanor charges, including domestic violence, resisting arrest without violence, petty theft and carrying a concealed electronic weapon. His mother, during that period, took out a restraining order against him.  His mother did not return a call seeking comment.  The Palm Beach County Public Defender's Office declined comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/homeless-man-fatally-stabbed-teen-without-motive-in-florida/articleshow/88058979.cms||---

IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said Mohammad Amin Rather, alias Asrar Amin, of Bemina in Srinagar and Ajaz Ahmad Dar of Pampore in Pulwama district were arrested on the basis of a complaint filed by Shabnam Kamili, mission director of Integrated Child Protection Services (ICPS) in J&K. The official decided to act after she learnt that the racket was thriving on social media. Based on a continuing investigation by an officer of the rank of deputy SP, the office of an NGO that calls itself Global Welfare Charitable Trust was sealed for alleged trafficking of Covid victims' kids. Amin has been identified as the founder of the organisation. The police are investigating another NGO, Noble Foundation, that was started by Dar as an alleged cover for sale of kids who lost their father, mother or both parents to Covid. Kamili told TOI that she saw an advertisement last October about children orphaned by Covid being put up for adoption. She suspected something was amiss because there was a passing mention of some of these orphans being from J&K. "My fears were confirmed this week when the same advertisement reappeared on a social media platform. I immediately informed the police," she said. Social welfare secretary Sheetal Nanda took up the issue with IGP Kumar, who instituted an inquiry. According to Kamili, around 635 kids who lost one of their parents to Covid were registered with her department. Another 15 children orphaned by the virus are currently staying with their legal guardians and ICPS is monitoring their well-being, she said. Kamili said the department had uploaded information about all these children on the stipulated central government portals and submitted a report to the women and child welfare ministry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fake-charities-put-up-covid-orphans-in-jk-for-sale-2-held/articleshow/88058987.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Ahmadis flee Peshawar for safer abodes||ISLAMABAD: The majority of Ahmadi families living in Peshawar have sold their properties and fled to safer places to escape the constant threat to their lives from the public in general in Pakistan’s northwest. An estimated four million Ahmadis live in Pakistan, a country of 220 million, and they face threats of death and intimidation. A sustained hate campaign has been on against them for decades. Members of Pakistan’s Ahmadi community do not reveal or speak about their faith in public. They consider themselves Muslim but are constitutionally barred from declaring and propagating their faith publicly, thus barring them from projecting themselves, directly or indirectly, as Muslims. While violent attacks against the community’s members and their place of worship have been occurring in most parts of Pakkstan, their lives have been threatened by extremist elements in the Pashtun-dominated northwestern belt of the country. A number of them were killed on allegations of blasphemy. An old man, believed by his community to be insane, was gunned down earlier inside a courtroom in Peshawar while proceedings were underway. This part of Pakistan, adjacent to Afghanistan, has been home to scores of radical madrasas representing their own interpretation of Islam for decades. Though Pakistan’s different Islamic sects and groups have serious differences among them on a number of religious matters, they all are one on the issue of the Ahmadi faith, considered heretical by many conservative groups who want Ahmadis publicly punished. The resentment against them is so intense that members of the community, accused of blasphemy, have been killed before the dispensation of justice by courts. The unending killing spree has forced most Ahmadis, living in Peshawar and it’s nearby Achini area, to dispose of their properties and shift to new places to hide their identities. "We no longer feel safe here as people who know about our faith treat us as aliens. Our faith and community are frequently condemned and denounced in religious sermons and speeches in mosques and seminaries," said Asghar Ahmad, a community member who has shifted his family from Peshawar to Punjab. He refused to reveal the name of the city or town where he has shifted his family. "We don’t feel safe even in our new homes but people, at least in new places, are unaware of our identities," Ahmad added. Most of the properties of Ahmadis in Achni locality were bought by a local builder known locally as "Doctor". While many locals could not afford to buy their lands, some affluent people were reluctant to purchase them. According to witnesses, the builder who bought the properties much cheaper than the market price, had also bribed local clerics to stay calm to ensure the safe shifting of families from their ancestral homes for their new abodes. The group, however, blames radical Islamic leaders for often publicly denouncing Ahmadis and promising their killing earns the killer a place in heaven. Human Rights Watch says that Pakistani authorities also routinely arrest, jail and charge Ahmadis for blasphemy and other offences because of their religious beliefs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/ahmadis-flee-peshawar-for-safer-abodes/articleshow/88059016.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The nationwide survey released on Thursday showed that "EV charging infrastructure was a key priority, with 57 per cent keen to invest in the coming 12 months and 21% in 1-3 years." The survey was conducted with a set of questionnaires for resident welfare associations (RWAs) to understand the pulse of gated communities towards EV charging infrastructure facilities, solar power and rainwater harvesting. "Of the three, EVs are clearly a priority area, with solar not far behind and on the other hand, nearly one in three communities had already set up rainwater harvesting facilities," the survey mentioned. Nearly 800 RWAs participated in the survey out of which 160 were from Mumbai. As many as 71% of respondents indicated that they intend on installing solar energy infrastructure within three years. "Nearly 51% of communities are looking at a 0-12 month timeline while 20% plan to do it in 1-3 years when it comes to investment in solar power infrastructure in housing societies," the survey stated. When it comes to rain water harvesting facilities in gated communities, though 31% of communities had already set this up, there are 32% other respondents who said they were planning investment in rainwater harvesting in the next 12 months. Around 18% indicated that they would get it done in 1-3 years and the remaining 19% said they will get it done in 3-5 years, according to the survey. MyGate COO Abhishek Kumar said, "It is encouraging to learn of the scale at which gated communities are looking to invest in and adopt green infrastructure. Respondents to the survey represent gated communities across Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune, and overall results showed that the eagerness to go green was a "national phenomenon", the survey stated.  "73.3% of gated communities across the country expressed an intent to install one of the three major green infrastructure facilities in the near term (0-3 years) while 0.6% of the communities nationwide surveyed had all three installed," it said. Across India, 75.4% of gated communities were looking to install EV charging units within the next three years. Similarly, the number of nationwide respondents who said they were keen on setting up solar energy in the next three years was 75.2%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/78-city-respondents-from-gated-communities-want-ev-infra-in-three-years-survey/articleshow/88059007.cms||Somit Sen
---||World||US will resume Trump-era migration policy, asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico||SAN DIEGO: Migrants seeking to enter the United States will again have to stay in Mexico as they await immigration hearings, as the Biden administration reluctantly announced plans Thursday to comply with a court order and accept conditions set out by Mexico for resuming the Trump-era policy.  Mexico's foreign relations secretary said Mexico will allow returns, beginning next week, in light of the US concessions "for humanitarian reasons and for temporary stays".  Revival of the "Remain in Mexico" policy comes under a court order even as the Biden administration manoeuvres to end it in a way that survives legal scrutiny. President Joe Biden scrapped the policy, but a lawsuit by Texas and Missouri has forced him to put it back into effect, subject to Mexico's acceptance.  About 70,000 asylum-seekers have been subject to the policy, which former president Donald Trump introduced in January 2019 and which Biden suspended on his first day in office.  Illegal border crossings fell sharply after Mexico, facing Trump's threat of higher tariffs, acquiesced in 2019 to the policy's rapid expansion. Asylum-seekers were victims of major violence while waiting in Mexico and faced a slew of legal obstacles, such as access to attorneys and case information.  Migrants are expected to be returned starting Monday at one border city and soon after in three others, U.S. officials said. They are San Diego and Texas crossings in El Paso, Laredo and Brownsville. The sequence has yet to be determined.  The Department of Homeland Security said Thursday that it was acting to comply with a court order but that Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas believes the policy "has endemic flaws, imposed unjustifiable human costs, pulled resources and personnel away from other priority efforts, and failed to address the root causes of irregular migration".  The dual announcements follow intense discussions between the U.S. and Mexico after U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee in Amarillo, Texas, ordered the policy be reinstated, subject to Mexico's participation.  The policy's new iteration, outlined for reporters by Biden administration officials who spoke on the condition that they not be named, includes major additions and changes that Mexico demanded.  All migrants subject to the policy will be vaccinated against Covid-19. Adults will get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which requires only one shot. Children who are eligible under U.S. guidelines will get the Pfizer shot, with second shots when they come to the U.S. for their first hearings.  The US will try to complete cases within 180 days, a response to Mexico's concerns that they will languish. The Justice Department is assigning 22 immigration judges to work on these cases exclusively.  U.S. authorities will ask migrants if they fear being returned to Mexico instead of relying on them to raise concerns unprompted. If the migrants express fear, they will be screened and have 24 hours to find an attorney or representative.  The Biden administration is working to ensure migrants' safety when they travel to and from court, including within Mexico. Migrants returned from Laredo and Brownsville, where Mexican border cities are especially dangerous, will be moved to locations further inside Mexico.  Migrants from Western Hemisphere countries will be eligible. U.S. officials haven't said how many will be processed daily. The administration has kept in place another Trump-era policy that allows it to return Central Americans to Mexico on the grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19.  Migrants will have an opportunity to meet with attorneys before each hearing. The State Department is working with Mexico on locations for video and phone access to attorneys in the U.S.  The changes mirror many conditions that Mexico laid out in a press release last week. Mexico also said "vulnerable" people should be exempt, including unaccompanied children, pregnant women, physically or mentally ill people, older people, indigenous people and members of the LGBTQ community.  "The Mexican government reaffirms its commitment to migrant rights as well as to safe, orderly, regulated migration," Mexico's foreign relations secretary said in a statement confirming that the country accepted the Biden administration's changes and additions.  Mexico is also seeking money from the U.S. for shelters and other organizations to substantially increase support for migrants waiting in Mexico.  Many U.S.-based legal aid groups that have represented asylum-seekers waiting in Mexico say they will no longer take such cases, raising questions about how the U.S. can satisfy Mexico's insistence on better access to counsel. Administration officials say they believe there are enough other lawyers who will represent asylum-seekers sent back to Mexico.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-will-resume-trump-era-migration-policy-asylum-seekers-to-wait-in-mexico/articleshow/88059168.cms||---

The SIT has handed over the list of the names of the accused to the government. The accused will be arrested as soon as the order is received. To recall, 127 Sikhs were killed in the 1984 riots in Kanpur. During that time, 40 cases were registered in Kanpur Nagar, under sections like murder, robbery and dacoity. The police had submitted the final report in 29 of these cases. Earlier, the SIT had recorded statements and searched the records by meeting the people of the victims’ families living in different states. SIT SP, Balendu Bhushan Singh, said that 20 cases with the final report were considered worthy of advance consideration and investigation was started, out of which the investigation of 11 has been completed. “In these cases, 146 rioters were marked, but 79 of them have already died. In such a situation, the number of rioters who survived has been reduced to 67. Although, of these, 20-22 accused are those who are more than 75 years of age or are suffering from serious diseases,” he added. On the question of arrest, he said that he has given a report to the government. As soon as permission will be given, the process of arrest of the remaining 45 accused will be started. The state government had set up SIT on February 5, 2019, to inquire into the circumstances leading to the deadly riots. The team was set up after the apex court issued notice to the state government in August 2017, on a petition seeking SIT probe into the riots. The four-member SIT is headed by retired UP DGP Atul. The other members are retired district judge Subhash Chandra Agarwal, and retired additional director (prosecution) Yogeshwar Krishna Srivastava. SP Balendu Bhushan Singh is its member-secretary. Recently, the tenure of the SIT has been extended by six months. The SIT had written a letter to the state government to extend the tenure. The SIT has now been given time to complete the investigation and make arrests by May 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/sit-identifies-67-accused-of-1984-riots-in-kanpur/articleshow/88059225.cms||---

---||Allahabad||We won’t stop chanting Jai Shri Ram, Jai Shri Krishna: Keshav Prasad Maurya||PRAYAGRAJ: Raising BJP’s Hindutva pitch ahead of the high-decibel Uttar Pradesh assembly elections due next year, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya on Thursday said “we won’t stop chanting ‘Jai Shri Ram and ‘Jai Shri Krishna and if opposition leaders have an issue, they should get a medical treatment”. “We will continue to chant Jai Shri Ram, Jai Shri Krishna and worship Lord Shiva and will never stop doing this... If anybody feels the pain, he should get medicines,” Maurya said during ‘Karyakarta Sambad’ in his hometown in Kaushambi. On Wednesday, Maurya stirred political cauldron, saying BJP is preparing to build a temple in Mathura as construction of temples in Ayodhya and Kashi is underway. “Ayodhya Kashi bhavya mandir nirmaan jaari hai, Mathura ki tyaari hai,” Maurya tweeted in Hindi. Sanguine about 2022 outcome, he said even if all rival camps like Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Samajwadi Party (SP), Congress and other ‘vote katwa’ parties come together to fight the elections, they won’t be able to stop the lotus from blooming one again in UP. “BJP will win more than 300 seats in the forthcoming state assembly polls... The party will script success in the 2022 assembly polls as it did in 2014 and 2019 parliamentary polls and 2017 state assembly elections,” he asserted. Maurya said, BJP has strengthened its booth management and booth-level workers are currently busy in drafting ‘panna pramukh’. Reacting to the statement of senior Samajwadi Party leader Indrajeet Saroj advising Maurya not to contest the election, Maurya said he must advice SP president Akhilesh Yadav as he (Saroj) played a key role in his party’s alliance with BSP in the 2019 parliamentary polls the result of which is known to everyone. About BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra’s claim that BJP was doing “ghisi-pitti” politics, Maurya said it’s time for BSP to think about its survival and needn’t worry for the saffron party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/we-wont-stop-chanting-jai-shri-ram-jai-shri-krishna-keshav-prasad-maurya/articleshow/88058569.cms||Kapil Dixit

---||India||Centre must treat people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh equally: Omar||JAMMU: National Conference leader Omar Abdullah on Thursday accused the BJP-led Centre of treating the people of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir "differently" over protection of their land and reservation in jobs and scholarships, and demanded equal treatment. The former chief minister also said that NC leaders and its workers were killed in bomb blasts and attacks because they were not ready to deceive and raise their voice against their country and support gun culture. "We don't demand anything, except justice with us (people of Jammu and Kashmir). When we were told that the aim of abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, is that there will be one order (system) across the country. Why are there two separate orders for one state," he told a public rally in Ramban district. Abdullah questioned the denial of rights of children of J&K at par with that of Ladakh and said that there are two separate set of state subject laws for both the union territories. "Have our children no such rights as given to children in Ladakh. If there is reservation of jobs for children of Ladakh as per the state subject laws -- If the lands of Kargil people are protected through state subject laws --If their scholarships and voting rights have been protected as per the erstwhile state subject laws of Article 370, why have we no such laws here?" he said. Abdullah said the only reality is that two union territories were formed on August 5, 2019, out of Jammu and Kashmir. "Contracts of works goes to outside people -- mineral extractions goes to outsiders-- land purchase rights given to outsiders and outsiders have been given rights to apply for jobs here (J-K). We don't demand anything. We demand justice with us", he said. Rebutting claims of the BJP of widespread development and progress in Jammu and Kashmir post August 2019, he said the promised dawn of development, jobs for youth and much touted investment remains to be a distant dream. “Far from putting the region on a path of development, the ruling dispensation has liquidated the hard-earned dividends of previous NC-led governments in bridging the gulf between the people and the government. We are fighting to bridge that gulf by fighting for the restoration of their abridged constitutional rights," he said. The former chief minister alleged that the ruling dispensation at the Centre is looking at Muslims of the country and Jammu and Kashmir with profound mistrust. Taking a dig, he said people of Jammu and Kashmir, particularly the NC cadre, have been consistent in their faith in the Constitution. "We have our bond with the country and the party has given supreme sacrifices to defend it. We in NC have shouldered the bodies of our colleagues, and workers who gave their lives in protecting this bond," he said. Abdullah said instead of this, “we are mocked and ridiculed as anti-nationals”. He said the NC gave huge sacrifices for the bond of J&K with India. "The relations made possible due to the promises to Jammu and Kashmir and later given constitutional cover. Under Article 370, it needed to be protected. What wrong are we talking about? What are we deceiving? We did not take that benefit, but the people of Jammu and Kashmir benefited from it, whether it is land to tillers, rehbari-e-taleem, Roshni (schemes)," Abdullah said. He said that NC will not stop in its fight against divisive politics and for right to employment and peace. "We will not stop fighting your battle. We will never get tired. Whether it is a matter of employment of your children or brotherhood or peace or for progress in this area. With this hope we will meet very soon again", he said. He said that it is not an easy battle (for restoration of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. "To get right is always not an easy thing. We want people to support us in this fight. Some people do not suit this. We have not much hope from them,” he said. “For we have hopes from some big parties that they will support us. Article 370 is not the treasure of Jammu and Kashmir. 370 is not the property of NC. If it is a property -it is property of first prime minister of India Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru", he said seeking support from the Congress. He said that NC hopes that right thinking people and parties of Jammu and Kashmir will support the NC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-must-treat-people-of-jammu-and-kashmir-and-ladakh-equally-omar/articleshow/88059274.cms||---

---||India||Covid-19: South African traveller, Bengaluru doctor are India’s first Omicron patients||BENGALURU/NEW DELHI: India’s first two Omicron-infected Covid-19 patients have been detected in Karnataka. One of them is a 66-year-old man who travelled from South Africa while the other is a 46-year-old anaesthetist based in Bengaluru, the health ministry said on Thursday. Their contacts have also been traced, it added. Fear of the new variant is high, given the concerns over its transmissibility and its ability to evade vaccine-induced immunity. “We are tracing three types of contacts — primary, secondary and tertiary. We have already traced the remotest contacts of these two cases,” said Sujeet Kumar Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The anaesthetist tested positive on November 22 and five of his contacts tested positive between November 22 and 25, Karnataka health officials said in a statement. The samples of the contacts have been sent for genome sequencing. Officials point out that an absence of travel history for the doctor suggests the presence of the virus in the community. The doctor and his contacts are in hospital isolation. Thirteen of the man’s primary contacts and 205 secondary ones have been traced so far.

Asked to self-isolate at a city hotel, he left on November 27 for Dubai before authorities got the results of his genome sequencing. The two Omicron patients showed only mild symptoms. Both were double-vaccinated. The new Omicron variant of SARS-CoV2 — first reported by South Africa — is spreading rapidly in many countries and appears to be outcompeting other variants in transmissibility. “The new variant is possibly around 500% more competitively infectious,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry. Read AlsoOmicron variant: Search on for 30 ‘missing’ foreign returnees in Andhra PradeshVISAKHAPATNAM: The Andhra Pradesh administration is searching for 30 of the 60 foreign returnees for conducting RT-PCR tests to rule out Omicron, the new variant of novel coronavirus. Around 60 international passengers, including nine from Africa, who landed at various airports came to VisakhapatnamOmicron is “heavily mutated” with 45-52 amino acid changes across the whole genome and 26-32 changes in the spike protein — the part that attaches to human cells — Agarwal said, underlining that the variant is considered to be highly transmissible, and has improved binding affinity. However, on the upside, all Omicron patients are found to have mild symptoms so far. The government said the situation is being closely examined and all issues including a ban on international flights is under discussion within the technical and scientific circles. “Let us not fear or panic, let us all be responsible. It is an unfolding situation and we are all learning,” said VK Paul, member health, NITI Aayog. Officials emphasised that the tools to combat even the new variant remain the same. While full vaccination was underlined as a must to protect against severe disease, officials also stressed on the need to wear masks properly and adhere to other Covid-appropriate behaviour like avoiding crowd and hand sanitisation. “Even after this new challenge of Omicron, vaccination is the most critical tool that we have to use and we are fortunate that we have that tool in plenty,” Paul said. The Bengaluru municipal corporation has traced 264 persons in contact with the man from South Africa and none of them tested positive. In the anaesthetist’s case, a total of 218 contacts have been traced and five of them have tested positive, including three primary contacts and two secondary ones. Following the detection of these two cases of Omicron, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai will chair a meeting of health department authorities, the health minister and Covid technical advisory committee members on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-south-african-traveller-bengaluru-doctor-are-indias-first-omicron-patients/articleshow/88059353.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||India||‘Fascistic mindset’, says Congress after Mamata’s ‘what UPA?’ remark||NEW DELHI: A day after TMC chief Mamata Banerjee declared that UPA was dead and Congress was not fighting BJP with Rahul Gandhi often going abroad, a virtual war of words broke out with the grand old party accusing her of having a “fascistic mindset” and narrating her long history of alliance with BJP. Congress’ stinging attack came even as Mamata’s advisor Prashant Kishor said that a leadership role was not the “divine right” of Congress alone. In response, Congress MP and communications chief Randeep Surjewala said, “There is a difference between political opportunism and an ideological fight. You swap sides and then tell us about principles? This is the same Mamata who was part of the NDA with Vajpayee. After 2001, she allied with Congress for assembly elections. In 2003, she again fell out with Congress and said, in her own words, that BJP is her natural ally. In 2004, she fought with BJP again. And, again, in 2009 she returned to UPA. Mamata quit UPA in 2012. Who is she to comment on UPA? Rahul Gandhi, on the other hand, is fighting an ideological battle against not just Modi, but BJP and RSS.” Read AlsoMamata Banerjee meets Sharad Pawar, says ‘no UPA now’West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee targeted the Congress on Wednesday saying “what is UPA, there is no UPA now” amid signs that her party is opposed to a Congress-led opposition front to take on the NDA. Banerjee also took a swipe at the Congress leadership saying politics requiredThe aggressive riposte came as Kishor said that after having lost 90% of the elections in the last 10 years, Congress cannot claim to have a divine right to claim the leadership role of an anti-BJP alliance. Trinamool Congress defended the party chief’s “there is no UPA now” remark ” by saying she was factually correct as UPA was formed under the leadership of Congress to form government and lasted 10 years from 2004 to 2014, when the constituent parties were in office at the Centre. Read AlsoTMC defends Mamata's 'UPA' remark, says alliance was created for governanceNEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress party on Thursday defended the party chief’s remarks that “there is no UPA now” by saying that she is factually correct in saying what she did in Mumbai on Wednesday since the UPA (united Progressive Alliance) was formed when“UPA was created in May 2004 with a clear purpose which was for governance, almost the same set of parties came back to office in 2009 and UPA continued. But since May 2014, another alliance came to office for governance, so UPA does not exist. If you go by numbers, many of those parties have a diminished strength in the House… but numbers do not matter as they are not in government," TMC’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien said. Surjewala was unsparing in his attack on Mamata. “BJP is destroying India’s democratic systems. And we must ask whether Mamata isn’t doing the same thing that Modi does. She is also buying MLAs and breaking parties. Somehow, she has endorsed and adopted the same fascistic thought process she is pretending to fight.” He added, “In August, she said everyone must come together to fight BJP. She needs to introspect as to whether she is fighting Congress or BJP with a consultant to support her.” The provocation appeared to be Kishor’s tweet who amplified Mamata by saying “The IDEA and SPACE that Congress represents is vital for a strong opposition. But Congress’ leadership is not the DIVINE RIGHT of an individual especially, when the party has lost more than 90% elections in last 10 years. Let opposition leadership be decided Democratically.” TMC also emphasized its credentials saying it is very much part of the united opposition in Parliament this session, with most parties supporting each other on the common issues that they have decided to take up with the government. O’Brien said, “We are saying 12 of our opposition members have been suspended from Rajya Sabha and they are sitting on a dharna to protest against it. It is not a TMC dharna, all the opposition party leaders are going there and showing their solidarity with the suspended MPs from TMC, Congress, Shiv Sena, CPM and CPI.” On repeated questions on why Mamata has been targeting Congress, O’Brien said, “Mamata didi is here for a cause, for the fight, she is here through struggle and the struggle was not against CPM, she had to struggle with her own party Congress to fight against the Left Front government in Bengal… she had to form her own party.” Elaborating on TMC’s expansion into states beyond Bengal where the party has been inducting members from Congress, he said the party was being “pragmatic” in its moves and “accepting the ground reality” in politics. “The focus for TMC is to defeat or throw out BJP. Hence the party is going into states where BJP is strong and the opponent is looking weak,” he said. The to and fro, triggered by Mamata’s comment on Congress after her meeting with NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Shiv Sena leaders, suggests escalating confrontation within the opposition camp over the leadership issue. Mamata’s aggression has followed her victory in the West Bengal elections, which made her believe that she can use her triumph over BJP for a national role. It is now to be seen how NCP, Shiv Sena, JMM and DMK react to Mamata’s efforts to marginalise Congress. CPM said neither TMC nor Congress will succeed in their efforts to lead a united opposition against BJP. In the latest edition of the party mouthpiece, People’s Democracy, it said the success of the farmers’ struggle shows what a united and sustained fight can achieve. It said unity will be issue-based, like it is in the case of MPs’ suspension, and that “no omnibus unity” at the all-India level with a “leader” is going to work. “The broadest unity can be forged through the united actions of different sections of the working people. This should be accompanied by the projection of alternative policies and politics to the Hindutva authoritarian regime, around which all democratic and secular forces can rally around,” it said.

Satyanarayana left from the home on his bike and didn’t return to home. Vizianagaram police solved missing man murder mystery after five years The police solved the mystery of the missing man after they chanced upon a two-wheeler which disappeared along with Satyanarayana. DSP, Vizianagaram, P Anil said that the sub-inspector of Two-Town police station Sagar Babu was on a routine vehicular checkup on Wednesday, and he found one motorist G Ramakrishna ( a scooter mechanic) was riding a Honda Activa Scooter without valid papers and a fake registration number. On questioning, Ramakrishna revealed that he purchased the scooter from K Rajasekhar for Rs 10,000. The police investigation revealed that the missing man’s son K Yungandhar in his report mentioned the vehicle in his complaint. The police picked up Rajasekhar and after questioning he admitted to killing the missing man Satyanarayana, who was not seen since November 16, 2016, along with his Honda Activa scooter. The investigation further revealed that Rajasekhar took a loan of Rs 70,000 from Satyanarayana and when Satyanarayana insisted on repayment, Rajasekhar decided to get rid of him. Rajasekhar along with his friends IV Akhil Kumar, M Akhil, and M Perlu lured Satyanarayana to visit the cremation ground where they forced him to take a soft drink which was laced with sedatives. When he fell unconscious, they smashed his head with iron rods and later set him ablaze. The police arrested all four and recovered gold ornaments which they took away from the victim after killing him. The police arrested Rajasekhar and his friends in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizianagaram-police-solved-missing-man-murder-mystery-after-five-years/articleshow/88059385.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||World||Biden's winter plan: Push for Covid-19 boosters but no new restrictions||BETHESDA: With rising numbers of Covid-19 cases predicted this winter, President Joe Biden on Thursday appealed to the Americans to get their boosters and get behind his plan to tackle the new Omicron variant through wider availability of vaccines and shots, but without new major restrictions on daily life. Biden wants to require private insurers to cover the cost of at-home Covid-19 tests and he is tightening testing requirements for people entering the United States, regardless of their vaccination status. While some other countries are closing their borders or reinstituting lockdowns, the president said he would not at this time impose additional clampdowns beyond his recommendation that Americans wear masks indoors in public settings. ``Experts say the Covid-19 cases will continue to rise in the weeks ahead this winter, so we need to be ready,'' Biden said during a visit to the National Institutes of Health in suburban Maryland after a briefing with scientific advisers. He said his new strategy ``doesn't include shutdowns and lockdowns," and he hoped for bipartisan backing. ``My plan I'm announcing today pulls no punches in the fight against the Covid-19, and it's a plan that I think should unite us,'' he Biden said. Legal challenges have held up Biden's vaccination-or-testing requirement for workers at larger employers, and that's led the president to urge businesses to impose their own mandates so companies can stay open without outbreaks. His administration has come to view widespread adoption of booster shots as its most effective tool for combating Covid-19 this winter. Medical experts say boosters provide enhanced and more enduring protection, including against new variants. Much remains unknown about the omicron variant, such as whether it is more contagious, makes people more seriously ill and can thwart the vaccines. Officials said Thursday that a second case of the variant had been confirmed in the United States. About 100 million Americans are eligible for boosters under current U.S. policy, with more becoming eligible every day. Officials believe that persuading the vaccinated to get another dose will be easier than vaccinating the roughly 43 million adult Americans who haven't gotten a shot. ``Go get your booster now,'' Biden said. Seniors are in the population most vulnerable to the virus, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will send a notice to all 63 million Medicare beneficiaries encouraging them to get booster doses, the White House said. The AARP will work with the administration on education campaigns for seniors. So far about 42 million Americans, about half of them seniors, have received a booster dose. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week broadened its booster dose recommendation to cover all Americans at least age 18, starting six months after their second dose of the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer or Moderna. Biden said the CDC is developing new guidance for schools in an effort to reduce or eliminate current quarantine requirements for those not fully vaccinated and exposed to the virus. That could include ``test-to-stay'' policies, in which those considered close contacts can continue to go to school but wear masks and undergo serial testing, in an effort to minimize learning loss and disruption. The rule that private insurers cover at-home testing is being drafted, and details remain to be worked out, officials said. People insured by Medicare and Medicaid would not be eligible, but the White House said as many as 150 million people with private insurance would see easier and cheaper access to the at-home tests. The administration said it is making 50 million Covid-19 tests free for older people and other vulnerable groups for pickup at senior centers and community sites. Beginning next week, Biden said, all travelers to the U.S., regardless of nationality or vaccination status, will need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test within one day of boarding flights. That compares with three days now for those who have been vaccinated. The White House has shelved tougher options such as requiring post-arrival testing or requiring quarantines upon arrival in the U.S. The White House has not yet acted to require domestic U.S. travelers to be vaccinated or get tested. Officials believe such a requirement would be mired in litigation. ``We base our decisions on the advice of the health and medical experts, what's going to be most effective and what we can implement,`` press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday. Biden is extending his directive requiring masks on airplanes and other public transit, which had been set to expire in January, through at least the middle of March, the White House said. The administration is informing states that it has more than 60 teams available to help them or their municipalities address surges in cases and public health shortages heading into the winter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/bidens-winter-plan-push-for-covid-19-boosters-but-no-new-restrictions-on-daily-life/articleshow/88059499.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Cannot get carried away sans legal proof says Bombay HC; acquits man sentenced to death in rape and murder case||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court set aside a death sentence and the conviction of a man ordered to be sent to the gallows by a Thane Sessions court in May 2017, for an almost decade old gangrape and murder case. There were two victims. They were friends and were rag pickers. It was a “sordid story of two poor, helpless and hapless victims who had not only been raped but one of them had been brutally murdered,’’ said the HC as it gave the man a benefit of doubt based on the evidence on record. “Merely because the crime is heinous and brutal, it would not be just to get carried away sans any legal proof required to substantiate the charge of murder and rape. The standard of proof is not in consonance with the gravity of the offences,’’ said the HC bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and Prithviraj Chavan. The testimony of an injured eye-witness, the survivor was also found wanting by the HC. “Merely because, she is an injured eye witness, her evidence cannot be mechanically accepted though her testimony holds more credence,’’ said the Judgment authored by Justice Chavan. The HC observed that there were “discrepancies, lacunae and blatant illegalities’’ which it said “ would definitely indicate that the prosecution has utterly failed in connecting the dots and bringing home the guilt of the accused.’’ “This can, at the most, be a case of strong suspicious and no more. From the evidence, it is also apparent that the murder was neither perplanned nor premeditated. The evidence is neither clear, cogent nor credible. There is absolutely no question of awarding death sentence to the accused, rather, it is the case wherein the accused must be given a benefit of doubt, nay, it would be a travesty of justice,’’ the judgment read. The HC said, “The most important question is as to whether the testimony of survivor who herself is an injured witness can be fully accepted as a truthful version of the entire episode sans corroboration, which is significant in light of the fact that it has been held by catena of decisions that corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of a prosecutrix is not a matter of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances.’’ The judgment pronounced on November 25 was made available on Wednesday. There were two accused in the case. The second accused was in 2019 held by the HC to be a juvenile-in-conflict-with-law. He claimed in 2012 he was less than 17 years old. He was sent to the Juvenile Justice Board. The two accused had approached the women with an offer to arrange a job for them and two thus accompanied the men in an autorickshaw, to a place below a bridge where they were offered liquor and raped. When the women resisted, the men assaulted them with a “hacksaw” and while one escaped their clutches and fled the other succumbed to the injuries and died on the spot, said the HC. The crime occurred on May 9, 2012 and the same day one rickshaw driver noticed the injured survivor lying unconscious and informed the police. The HC noted that rag picking was the victims’ only source of livelihood. The survivor was aged about 18 to 19 years, while the one who was killed, was about 28 years and was married. The survivor was roofless and hence, the railway platform of a suburban station near Mumbai was her night abode.  The HC also noted that the trial was “conducted in a casual manner’’ without checking whether legal aid provided to the accused was competent. ‘The quality and credibility of the evidence adduced is not even upto the mark,’’ said the HC dismissing the death confirmation reference and directing the immediate release of the accused, Rahimuddin Shaikh as the prosecution had “miserably failed’’ to bring home the guilt.

---||India||India slams UN rights body for Jammu and Kashmir statement||NEW DELHI: India slammed the UN high commissioner for human rights office on Thursday for making "baseless and unfounded" allegations against Indian forces in J&K, asking it to develop a better understanding of the negative impact of terrorism on human rights. The government said that the statement by the spokesperson of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) "betrayed a complete lack of understanding" on the part of the UN body of the security challenges faced by India from cross-border terrorism and its impact on the "most fundamental human right, the right to life, of our citizens, including in Jammu & Kashmir". Referring to proscribed terrorist organisations as armed groups demonstrated a clear bias on the part of the OHCHR, the foreign ministry said. "We have seen the statement made by the spokesperson of the OHCHR on specific incidents in Jammu & Kashmir," foreign ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said. "The statement makes baseless and unfounded allegations against law enforcement authorities and security forces of India," he added. As a democratic country, with an abiding commitment to promote and protect the human rights of its citizens, India takes all necessary steps to counter cross-border terrorism, said the government. Bagchi's comments came in response to a statement made by the OHCHR on the arrest of Kashmiri rights activist Khurram Parvez. "National security legislations, like the UAPA, were enacted by Parliament to protect the sovereignty of India and ensure security of its citizens," said Bagchi, adding the arrest and subsequent detention of the individual referred to in the statement was done entirely as per provisions of law. "Authorities in India act against violations of law and not against legitimate exercise of rights. All such actions are strictly in accordance with the law," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-slams-un-rights-body-for-jammu-and-kashmir-statement/articleshow/88059507.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Omicron variant in India: Patient No. 1 fled country before confirmation||BENGALURU: One of two Covid-19 Omicron cases in Bengaluru, a 66-year-old traveller from South Africa who was the first to test positive (on November 21, though the variant had not been determined then), discreetly left Bengaluru on a flight to Dubai a few days ago. The patient, a representative of a Johannesburg-based pharmaceutical company, left in the early hours of November 27, before his genomic sequencing results arrived. The 24 primary and 240 secondary contacts of the traveller from South Africa have been traced, tested and found negative. Declining to elaborate, state health minister K Sudhakar told TOI: “We would like to believe he was negative because all his contacts are negative. We cannot say much about it.” The patient had allegedly got in touch with a private lab on November 23 and received a negative Covid-19 test report. The other patient with Omicron, a doctor, had tested positive on November 22 and his sample had then been sent for genomic sequencing. Asked where the Omicron-positive patients were housed, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) commissioner Gaurav Gupta said the details cannot be disclosed. It appears the city corporation was in two minds about whether or not to disclose that the patient had already left the country. It initially posted on its WhatsApp group for media the entire sequence of the patient arriving, testing, and then leaving, but later changed its mind and deleted the post. As this news had spread by then, the state health minister later admitted to TOI that the man had left the country. The man in question arrived in Bengaluru from South Africa on November 20 with a Covid-negative report and was tested at the city’s Kempegowda International Airport. “That was the time when fears about Omicron had not intensified here,” a source said. The man checked into a star hotel in Vasanthnagar in central Bengaluru. His test report for Covid came positive on November 21. Following this, health officials went to the hotel and directed him to self-isolate in the room. He was asymptomatic, though. On November 22, his samples were collected again and sent for genomic sequencing. On November 27, when BBMP officials went to the hotel, they learnt he had checked out. Further inquiries revealed that he had left the country. “It’s surprising how he got the negative reports considering he had not stepped out of the hotel nor had anyone taken his swab sample again. So we checked CCTV footage but it didn’t reveal anything,” said a puzzled senior BBMP health official. The man checked out of the hotel at 12.34 am and took a cab to the airport from where he flew to Dubai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/omicron-variant-in-india-patient-no-1-fled-country-before-confirmation/articleshow/88059662.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||World||Omicron Covid-19 variant found in three US states||WASHINGTON: Three US states have found cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant -- California, Colorado and Minnesota -- among patients who were fully vaccinated and developed mild symptoms, health officials said on Thursday. The Minnesota patient is the first known US case of community transmission of the Omicron variant, found in a fully vaccinated man who had recently traveled to New York City and attended a conference. To combat the spread of Omicron, President Joe Biden on Thursday announced new testing requirements for international travelers and promised in the coming weeks that Americans would have access to free, rapid at-home Covid-19 testing. Colorado health officials on Thursday said a woman with the Omicron variant had recently returned from a trip to southern Africa. California on Wednesday reported the first US case of the variant in a fully vaccinated traveler who had been in South Africa. The new variant was first detected in southern Africa last month. After determining the Minnesota case had a New York connection - the man attended an anime convention at New York City's Javits Center from Nov. 19-21 - health officials immediately activated the "Test and Trace Corps" to contact conference attendees in an effort to contain the spread, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said. “We are aware of a case of the Omicron variant identified in Minnesota that is associated with travel to a conference in New York City, and we should assume there is community spread of the variant in our city," the mayor said in a statement. Dr. Leana Wen, a public health professor at George Washington University and former Baltimore health commissioner, said it was only a matter of time before more Omicron cases are detected in the United States. The Minnesota case "means that there is spread in the United States. There will be many more cases to come," Wen said on Twitter. Scientists are investigating Omicron, which has been labeled as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization, to see if it is more transmissible than the Delta variant that is now prevalent and if it causes more severe disease. They are also studying how well current vaccines work against it. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said the news of the case in the state was "concerning, but it is not a surprise," adding that "We know that this virus is highly infectious and moves quickly throughout the world." Walz urged residents to get vaccinated and wear masks indoors. The best response to the new variant is the same as it's been throughout the pandemic: get a Covid-19 shot, he said. About 60% of the total US population, or 196 million people, have been fully vaccinated, one of the lowest rates among wealthy nations. More than 786,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the United States, including 37,000 in November alone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-announces-another-case-of-covid-omicron-variant/articleshow/88059688.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: A wide range of vaccines act as booster to AstraZeneca, Pfizer shots, says study||NEW DELHI: Up to six different Covid-19 boosters were found to be safe, and provoked strong immune responses in people who have previously received a two-dose course of the Oxford-AstraZeneca-developed Covishield, or Pfizer-BioNTech’s BNT162b2, the first randomised phase 2 trial of boosters given after two doses of either vaccine, published in The Lancet shows. The study assumes significance as most countries, particularly the ones with high vaccination coverage, including India, are now mulling over the need for an additional dose in the wake of the new Omicron variant. The WHO will also deliberate on the issue of booster doses on December 7. Apart from the two jabs, NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax), Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen), Moderna, VLA2001 (Valneva ), and CVnCov (Curevac) were also studied. All of them boosted spike protein immunogenicity when given 10-12 weeks after two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. In the case of Pfizer-BioNTech, except for Valneva all the others boosted spike protein immunogenicity, the findings show. “It’s really encouraging that a wide range of vaccines, using different technologies, show benefits as a third dose to either AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech. That gives confidence and flexibility in developing booster programmes here in the UK and globally, with other factors like supply chain and logistics also in play”, said Saul Faust, trial lead and director of the NIHR Clinical Research Facility, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust. However, the study found large variations in antibody and cellular immune responses between vaccines and suggested that this should be considered along with availability and what level of boost is sufficient for national disease control objectives while taking policy decisions on boosters. The study had also used a shorter interval between the second and the third dose than between the first two doses, which might have resulted in lower immunity boost than if longer intervals were used.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-a-wide-range-of-vaccines-act-as-booster-to-astrazeneca-pfizer-shots-says-study/articleshow/88059696.cms||Sushmi Dey

Around 60 international passengers, including nine from Africa, who landed at various airports came to Visakhapatnam in the last 10 days. While 30 of them are staying in Visakhapatnam, the remaining 30 have left for various places in the state. Some of them are allegedly not responding to telephone calls and officials fear they are ‘missing’. The Visakhapatnam district administration has alerted the collectors of other districts in the state to trace the 30 foreign returnees who left the port city in the last 10 days. Three passengers from South Africa and six from Botswana came to the city and officials have traced six of them. The remaining three — two from Botswana and one from South Africa — have reportedly left for their respective villages in Krishna district. Search is on to trace them. The state is on a high alert in view of the Omicron threat. It has intensified screening of passengers at airports. While tracing the contact details of the foreign returnees who arrived in the port city in the last 10 days, officials noticed that nine people had come from Africa. Many of them did not land directly in Visakhapatnam. They came here after alighting at various international airports, where they may have undergone RT-PCR tests for Covid-19. But the district administration wants to be doubly sure by conducting another RT-PCR test to rule out any Omicron cases among the returnees. Visakhapatnam district joint collector Arun Babu told TOI that no foreigner has tested positive so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/omicron-variant-search-on-for-30-missing-foreign-returnees-in-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/88059730.cms||Siva G

In the October-December quarter, 12 states had reported double-digit urban joblessness rates. The combined Union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh had an unemployment rate of 17.6% in this quarter, a shade lower than the 17.8% recorded in the previous October-December quarter but above the 10.8% figure for the March quarter of 2020, according to the quarterly bulletin of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) released on Tuesday. It was followed by Uttarakhand, Kerala, Odisha, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Gujarat had the lowest urban unemployment rate at 3.8% in the March 2021 quarter, followed by West Bengal with 4.8%. At least 13 states recorded double-digit urban unemployment rates for females in all age categories, while 11 states logged the same for males. The overall unemployment rate in urban areas in the January-March quarter of 2020-21 was at 9.4%, lower than the 10.3% in the previous October-December quarter. The rate has cooled after being in double digits for the past three quarters, the PLFS data had shown. Youth unemployment appeared high across states in the January-March quarter continuing a trend that has been visible since the January-March quarter of 2020 in the 15-29 years age group. “The problem of unemployment has persisted in the 15-29 years age group due to several factors. First, the labour market has been tight and the experienced and older persons are preferred than those who would need training,” said Pronab Sen, former chief statistician of the country. He said Covid-19 had prompted many to move back to farming which also distorted the overall picture. While some manage to find work in the farm sector and others remain jobless. “The big worry is that movement of labour out of agriculture to manufacturing and skilled jobs has not happened to that extent,” said Sen. The PLFS was launched by the National Statistical Office (NSO) to estimate the employment and unemployment indicators (worker population ratio, labour force participation rate, unemployment rate) in the short time interval of three months for urban areas only in the current weekly status (CWS). Under CWS, a person is considered as unemployed in a week if he/she did not work even for one hour on any day during the reference week but sought or was available for work at least for one hour on any day during the reference week, according to the PLFS. The annual PLFS report covers both rural and urban areas whereas the quarterly bulletin is for urban centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/jobless-rate-11-states-hit-double-digits-in-january-march/articleshow/88059788.cms||Surojit Gupta

However, around 12 crore beneficiaries are still due for their second dose despite the government’s vaccination push. In a meeting with states on Thursday, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan asked states to ensure all available vaccine doses are jabbed timely and no dose expires in both government and private facility. The Centre also asked states to devise targeted plans, in the context of doses administered in August and September this year, to ensure coverage of all beneficiaries due for their second dose by exponentially increasing the pace of vaccination. Seven states (Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh & West Bengal) in which ZyCoV-D will be used initially were asked to identify districts with high number of pending first dose beneficaries for introduction of the vaccine. Since national training for ZyCoV-D has been completed, these states should now plan sessions based on pharmajet injector and identify vaccinators to be trained for using it for administering doses. Overall, around 125 crore doses have been administered across the country so far. While 84% of the adult population has received at least first dose of Covid vaccine, 49% have been covered with both doses. While Uttar Pradesh witnessed the maximum (8.7%) progress in first dose coverage as a result of the ‘Dastak’ campaign, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Telangana also witnessed above 7.5% increase in coverage of first dose after the launch of the campaign till November 30, the assessment shows. Himachal Pradesh witnessed a major jump of 28.7% in second dose coverage after the campaign, followed closely by Madhya Pradesh where it rose by 25.1%. Many other states including Andaman & Nicobar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, J&K, Assam and Uttarakhand also saw a rise in coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-vaccination-coverage-of-1st-dose-up-by-5-9-second-shot-by-11-7/articleshow/88059895.cms||Sushmi Dey

The remark by MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi was in response to a question on whether or not the US was likely to impose the dreaded CAATSA sanctions on India for acquiring the missile defence system. He reiterated that India and the US have a comprehensive strategic partnership and India has a special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia. His remarks came ahead of President Vladimir Putin’s visit next week for the annual summit. The government said the 21st India-Russia summit in Delhi on December 6 will offer an opportunity to the two leaders to exchange views on regional, multilateral and international issues of mutual interests. Giving details of the engagements between the two sides on December 6, Bagchi said defence minister Rajnath Singh will hold a meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergey Shoygu India-Russia under the framework of the India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military-Technical Cooperation. Separately, external affairs minister S Jaishankar will hold talks with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. Following the two meetings, the foreign and defence ministers of the two countries will hold the inaugural ‘2+2’ ministerial dialogue that is expected to discuss bilateral, regional and international issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-national-interest-india-defends-s-400-buy-as-curbs-loom/articleshow/88059959.cms||---

This is my appeal to the entire House,” said Naidu, as the proceedings began on Thursday morning. But with the opposition not relenting, Rajya Sabha was adjourned for around 50 minutes. On resumption of proceedings, the question hour took place after some initial disruptions followed by a walkout by Congress, Trinamool and other opposition parties. Earlier, expressing “deep pain” that the suspended MPs have categorically refused to express regret for their “misconduct” till now, Naidu said, “It is human to err and it is also human to make amendments. One cannot refuse to amend and insist on glossing over the wrongdoings.” Some leaders and Rajya Sabha members have chosen to describe the suspension as “undemocratic” in their wisdom. “While calling this suspension as undemocratic, both within and outside the House, not even a word is being said about the reasons given for the suspension, the disdainful conduct of some members during the last session, which I have categorically called as ‘acts of sacrilege’ on the last day of last session,” Naidu said. But opposition members continued their vociferous protests, with some even entering the well and others demanding leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge be allowed to speak. Naidu, however, did not agree, saying Kharge has already spoken on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/naidu-defends-rajya-sabha-action-asks-govt-opposition-to-resolve-logjam/articleshow/88060042.cms||---
---||India||Yogi Adityanath cites 2014, ’17 & ’19 polls, writes off SP alliance efforts||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath on Thursday dismissed as ‘inconsequential’ the alliance of smaller parties being cobbled up by Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav for the 2022 assembly elections. Speaking to Times Now Navbharat, the CM said UP had rejected all kinds of alliances by the opposition in the past three elections and there was no reason to believe that another one would do well. “In 2017, two boys came together and were rejected. In 2014, the brother and sister were rejected, in 2019 the mahagathbandhan was rejected. Now, there is no alliance in UP.” Yogi was referring to the UP campaign by Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the alliance between Akhilesh and Rahul in the 2017 assembly polls and the SP-BSP pact in the 2019 LS polls. The CM said BJP will perform extremely well in the 2022 polls even in places like west UP, which were being considered by some as a weak spot for the party. “Before 2017, west UP was facing a major security issue. More than 300 riots took place in UP between 2012 and 2017, most of which were in west UP. We have ensured good law and order. There have been no riots and all festivals have been celebrated peacefully. With SP in power, there were riots in Muzaffarnagar, Bareilly, Kosi Kalan, Saharanpur and Bijnor,” he said, adding that nobody could forget what led to the Muzaffarnagar riots and the then government’s role. When asked to comment on the controversy over the tweet by his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya that preparations were on for construction of the Krishna Janmabhoomi temple in Mathura, Yogi said that he had not had the chance to speak to the former. At the same time, he said: “If anyone is asked, they would say that Lord Krishna is worshipped in Mathura. Ram is worshipped in Ayodhya, Radha Rani in Barsana and Krishna in Mathura. I think this is above political agenda. Our priority is to respect faith. Puja is a question of faith and there is no question of creating or destroying anything.” Defending Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to repeal the farm laws, the CM said that farmers actually got relief only after Modi came to power and a new procurement policy was brought in 2017. He said after the farm laws were passed, BKU leaders had met him to thank BJP. However, later BKU leader Rakesh Tikait got together with farm leaders of Haryana and Punjab and started the protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/yogi-adityanath-cites-2014-17-19-polls-writes-off-sp-alliance-efforts/articleshow/88060113.cms||---
---||India||Amit Shah set to visit Jaipur amid differences within BJP ranks||NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah’s day-long visit to Jaipur on December 5 to address a group of elected representatives from “panchayat to Parliament” is being viewed with interest given the growing differences among state leaders, mainly former CM Vasundhara Raje and state chief Satish Punia. Even as Punia and his followers have been unhappy over Raje’s political activities without taking the state leadership on board, the party high command is keeping a close watch on affairs in the state. The Punia faction has been demanding action against Raje and her supporters, party top brass has conveyed unambiguously that all should work in tandem and bury the hatchet at the earliest. “A message has already been conveyed that BJP leadership will not approve faction fighting and all leaders will have to sort out their differences,” said a senior party leader on condition of anonymity. Sources said, Shah will certainly take up the matter with the state leaders and ask them to follow the party line and that “indiscipline” will not be tolerated at all. Sources said that the party leadership is concerned over the ongoing oneupmanship among Raje and Punia factions, which has created confusion among the party cadres and is taking a toll on the party's position in the state. The party’s poor performance in the recent bypolls was also seen as a fallout of the faction fighting among two groups. Party sources said that the party top brass has taken a dim view of the ongoing public display of oneupmanship from both the factions. Seniors were unhappy not only with the Raje loyalists for chanting slogans like “Punia bhagoa, BJP bachao” but also with Punia supporters for shouting slogans like “Hamara CM kaisa ho, Satish Punia Jaisa Ho.” “There is no denying the fact that Vaundhara Raje is our senior leader and a popular leader too. But Punia is the party president and all leaders irrespective of their seniority and experience will have to give him the due respect,” said a senior leader. Party sources also said that the top brass will not “budge” to the pressure tactics of the state leaders unlike previous occasions. In 2013, the central leadership had decided not to announce the CM candidate and Gulab Chand Kataria was the state president. However, just before state polls, Raje not only became the CM candidate but also replaced Kataria as state president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amit-shah-set-to-visit-jaipur-amid-differences-within-bjp-ranks/articleshow/88060139.cms||Akhilesh Singh
---||India||BJD lauds Covid steps, Shiv Sena accuses govt of ‘favouritism’||NEW DELHI: On the day when India reported two confirmed cases of new Corona variant Omicron, Lok Sabha on Thursday took up debate on the Covid situation in the country with most speakers suggesting that the country should not lower the guard at this juncture. BJP’s Ratan Lal Kataria said as a new variant has emerged, there is a need to be more cautious and follow all protocols properly. “It is not the time to sit comfortably, we have to be vigilant,” Kataria suggested. Initiating the debate, Shiv Sena leader Vinayak Raut lamented that Parliament was discussing the issue 21 months after the outbreak of the disease and at a time when cases were on the decline. Referring to the Omicron variant, he demanded close co-ordination among state governments and the Centre. While criticising the Centre’s handling of the pandemic and recent decisions on disinvestment, he however supported the sale of Air India to the Tata group. Raut accused the Centre of allocating vaccine doses to BJP-ruled states in excess and at the cost of others. “Till date, only 38% of the population has received both the doses of vaccines. We cannot launch premature celebrations for 100 crore doses,” Raut said. BJD MP Bhratruhari Mahtab hailed the government’s handling of the pandemic saying that the country got appreciation world over for its vaccination drive and Cowin App. He said even European countries appreciated the country the way it responded to the crisis. BJP’s Rita Bahuguna said the country suffered badly during the two waves of the Corona outbreak during which PM Narendra Modi performed as a true leader and has empowered the country to fight with any health crisis in future. Accusing Rahul Gandhi of creating vaccine hesitancy in the country, BJP MP Tejaswi Surya asked the Congress leader to explain why he had not shared details of his vaccination. “He hasn’t even tweeted asking people to go for vaccination,” Surya said. Congress’s Gaurav Gogoi charged the government with ignoring various warnings leading to shortage of bed, oxygen and ventilators during the second wave. TMC MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar suggested that the government consider bringing back the Indian Medical Service so that trained manpower can be provided for timely delivery of medical services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjd-lauds-covid-steps-shiv-sena-accuses-govt-of-favouritism/articleshow/88060211.cms||---
---||India||After protests, Rajya Sabha clears dam bill, Lok Sabha sees 117% productivity||NEW DELHI: Despite protests and some disruptions, Parliament reflected a semblance of normalcy on Thursday with the Lok Sabha discussing the Covid situation and the Rajya Sabha passing the Dam Safety Bill, 2019, with DMK forcing a division over an amendment, even though several other opposition parties were not present in the House. After disruptions for a couple of days, the Lok Sabha on Wednesday witnessed 117% productivity as 109 members spoke during Zero Hour and a total of 140 members spoke during the day that included an exhaustive discussion under Rule 193 on the Covid situation and its fallout. Discussion under Rule 193 does not involve a formal motion before the House. Speaker Om Birla held several rounds of informal discussions with floor leaders and assured he will give ample time for discussion on issues by extending time for the Zero Hour. “Even the TRS members (who have been in the well of the House demanding a law on MSP for farm produce) were urged by the Speaker to stop protests and raise the issues for which they were given time,” said a senior leader. The Rajya Sabha passed the Dam Safety Bill, 2019, after jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat rejected the Opposition’s charge that it was “unconstitutional” and “anti-federal” in that it encroached upon the states’ legislative domain. He clarified the Bill is not intended to encroach upon states’ rights on their waters, dam ownership or maintenance, or even resources like power, but only seeks to ensure safety norms and prevent dam-related disasters that result in great loss to life and property. An amendment moved by DMK member Tiruchi Siva to send the Bill, passed by the Lok Sabha in 2019, to a select committee was negated with 80 ‘Noes’ against 28 ‘Ayes’. The Bill provides for surveillance, inspection, operation and maintenance of the specified dams for prevention of disasters caused by dam failure and creation of an institutional mechanism to ensure their safe functioning. During the four-hour debate, MPs from the opposition benches were united in slamming it as unconstitutional, arguing that Entry 17 of List 1 of the Constitution gives states exclusive rights to regulate water supplies and embankments, and even Entry 56 did not mention dam safety among the exceptions to Entry 17. Congress MP Shakti Sinh Gohil said when his party brought a Bill in 2010 citing Article 252, the preamble mentioned that only if two or more states made a request, such a Bill on dam safety could be brought by the Centre. Incidentally, both West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh assemblies have earlier passed resolutions stating Centre should not legislate on dam safety and related regulations. Replying to the debate, Shekhawat tried to allay apprehensions about the Bill being ‘unconstitutional’, saying that the standing committee that had cleared the Bill had observed that the Centre could bring a legislation on dam safety regulations in public interest. This view was further endorsed by Solicitor General.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-protests-rajya-sabha-clears-dam-bill-lok-sabha-sees-117-productivity/articleshow/88060257.cms||---

Now, inter-state domestic travellers who are fully vaccinated will not require an RTPCR report. But those who have taken a single dose or remain unvaccinated will have to produce a negative RT-PCR report with a validity of 72 hours. And instead of the mandatory seven-day institutional quarantine being applicable to passengers from the 12 ‘at risk’ countries, the state has whittled down the list to travellers from three – South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe . “Except for the seven-day institutional quarantine for passengers from the high risk countries, all other guidelines are now in line with the Centre’s norms,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-rolls-back-stringent-travel-curbs-in-wake-of-omicron/articleshow/88060417.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Business||Wall Street ends higher in robust rebound from Omicron-driven sell-off||NEW YORK: A broad rally sent Wall Street to a sharply higher close on Thursday, recovering ground lost over recent sessions as market participants snapped up bargains while digesting the implications of a shifting pandemic. All three U.S. indexes advanced, with investors favoring value over growth, and economically sensitive smallcaps and transports outperforming the broader market. Of the three, the Dow gained the most with Boeing Co providing the biggest lift to the blue-chip industrial average. "We went 29 days in a row in the S&P 500 without a 1% change, up or down, but boom - Omicron hits and five days we’ve had this blast of volatility," said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. "After the worst two-day drop in more than a year, we’re finally seeing a bit of a bounce," Detrick added. "Buyers are starting to nibble after the recent weakness and pushed stocks higher, but the uncertainty of Omicron is still out there." As world governments scramble to determine how to respond to the emergent COVID-19 Omicron variant, the United States is set to require private health insurance companies to provide at-home tests, a policy expected to go into effect on Jan. 15. The Omicron variant has spooked markets for about a week, hitting travel-related stocks particularly hard as a patchwork of new restrictions were enacted around the globe, but those companies were bouncing back in Thursday's session. The S&P 1500 Airlines and Hotel and Restaurants indexes ended the session sharply higher. Jobless claims and planned layoffs data provided further evidence that employers are increasingly disinclined to hand out pink slips amid a tight labor market, the result of booming demand colliding with worker scarcity and low labor market participation. Labor scarcity, combined with stubbornly persistent supply chain constraints, has helped erase the word "transitory" from the Federal Reserve's inflation vocabulary as wages and prices continue to rise, and could very well translate into rate hikes coming sooner and faster than many had hoped. Market participants now train their gaze on the Labor Department's hotly anticipated November employment report, expected on Friday. "We're optimistic we’ll have another strong number, suggesting the economy continues to be on very firm footing," Detrick added. "We’re watching wage growth for any hints of potential inflationary worries." According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 63.46 points, or 1.41%, to end at 4,576.50 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 128.78 points, or 0.84%, to 15,382.83. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 622.37 points, or 1.83%, to 34,644.41. All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 closed in positive territory. Boeing shares surged after China's aviation authority gave its seal of approval the planemaker's 737 MAX aircraft. Grocery retailer Kroger Co raised its full-year sales and profit forecasts, sending the stock sharply higher. Consumer credit companies Visa Inc, Mastercard Inc and American Express Co all posted robust gains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/wall-street-ends-higher-in-robust-rebound-from-omicron-driven-sell-off/articleshow/88060437.cms||---

The FTC said the proposed vertical deal would give one of the largest chip companies control over computing technology and designs that competitors rely on to develop their own competing chips. Arm, Britain's most important tech company that was sold to Japan's SoftBank in 2016, licenses its blueprints to major chipmakers such as Apple, Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics, underpinning the global smartphone ecosystem. Nvidia said "as we move into this next step in the FTC process, we will continue to work to demonstrate that this transaction will benefit the industry and promote competition."

---||Business||Car prices to rise on higher input costs||NEW DELHI: Cars will get dearer from the new year as companies, ranging from Maruti, Tata Motors to Mercedes and Audi, will increase prices due to higher input costs. The fresh increments will be part of a series of hikes that customers have faced over the past year with hardening of commodity prices and shortage of semiconductors, as well as expensive shipping tariffs. And, heavy waiting lists (ranging up to six months) across models due to the semiconductor crunch are adding to woes as customers may have to shell out more at the time of delivery against what they had booked the vehicle for. “Over the past year, the cost of the company’s vehicles continues to be adversely impacted due to increase in various input costs. Therefore, it has become imperative for the company to pass on some impact of the above additional costs to customers through a price hike,” Maruti said. This year, the company hiked vehicle prices on three occasions — by 1.4% in January, 1.6% in April, and 1.9% in September, taking the total quantum to 4.9%. The company said it was not able to fully pass on the higher costs as it would have impacted demand. Hyundai and Tata Motors are also planning to hike prices. Sources in Hyundai said that a price hike in January is “unavoidable” and added that “work is on to identify the models and variants where revisions will be made.” Shailesh Chandra, president of passenger vehicles division at Tata Motors, said: “Prices of commodities, raw material and other input costs continue to rise. An appropriate price hike to at least partially offset this increase in costs seems inevitable in the near-to short-term.” Mercedes-Benz India MD Martin Schwenk said the company has been “absorbing a significant part of the input cost increase” while passing on a “minor portion” to the consumers to offset rising operational costs. The company said while prices go up from January, those buying this month will get a “full price protection” against revisions. Audi’s vehicles will see 3% hike. “To offset rising input and operational costs, a price correction is necessary,” Audi India head Balbir Singh Dhillon said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/car-prices-to-rise-on-higher-input-costs/articleshow/88060590.cms||Pankaj Doval

Such an approach is expected to get faster results and better value for the banks that are owed money from the SREI companies. Last month RBI had superseded the board of Srei Infrastructure Finance Limited (SIFL) and Srei Equipment Finance Limited (SEFL). As per initial estimates, top ten lenders Canara Bank, PNB, UBI, SBI, BoB, Indian Bank, P&S Bank, Central Bank and BOI – together represent over Rs 20,000 crore of a consolidated loan of Rs 31,527 crore between SREI and SEFL. This would give them 65% voting rights if claims are consolidated. According to the note, there would not be much of a variation in the voting rights of the top 10 lenders if a group approach is taken. Bankers said that various investments in connected entities and their further investee companies viz. Bharat Road Network, Trinity, Power Trust (which may have equity value in future) are housed in SIFL whereas exposure to such entities is partly through SEFL; thus, disentangling the two entities would hamper the objective of maximisation of value if the resolution applicants are not allowed access to synergies between different group companies. Incidentally, before the board was superseded the promoters of Srei had sought to consolidate both the businesses by transferring the business of Srei Equipment to Srei Infra through a business transfer arrangement. However, the proposal was rejected by the lenders. The administrator has however pointed out in his note that a group resolution is different from the business transfer plan proposed by the promoters as rights of individual creditors on their secured assets would be retained. Also, the committee of creditors, who have exposure to both companies, will have a say in the distribution of assets and can ensure that the rights of those who hold specific security are protected. Incidentally, EY, which was appointed by the company to help in the consolidation, continues to assist the administrator-led company in taking the group approach. The group resolution is found useful in a situation where the liabilities are with one company while the value lies in other businesses. A similar group resolution approach was successfully adopted in IL&FS where a significant portion of the liability was with the parent and other holding companies where the assets were across 300 companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lenders-of-sreis-two-finance-companies-look-for-group-resolution/articleshow/88060600.cms||Mayur Shetty

On Thursday sensex added 777 points, to add to its 620-point rally on Wednesday despite rising global fears about the impact of the Omicron variant of Covid virus and chances of US Fed ending its easy money policy in the next few months, ahead of its earlier schedule of the second half of 2022. The sensex started the session on a relatively flat note with a gain of about 300 points at 57,781 but gained through the session to an intra-day high at 58,514 and closed the session at 58,461, up 1.4%. On the NSE too, the Nifty ended at 17,401 points, up 235 points or 1.4%. The gains in the sensex came on the back of strong GDP growth numbers for the July-September quarter and gross GST collection of Rs 1.32 lakh crore, second highest in history, during November, market players said. In the last two sessions while foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) net sold stocks worth nearly Rs 8,000 crore while domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 4,840 crore, data from BSE and CDSL showed. And in the last five days, FPIs were net sellers at Rs 16,250 crore while DIIs were net buyers at nearly Rs 17,100 crore. According to S Ranganathan, Head of Research, LKP Securities, bulls held the upper hand on Thursday with IT stocks leading the charge. “As the volatility index cooled off (during the day’s session), we witnessed stock-specific action across sectors in the broader markets buoyed by GDP and GST data, together with cooling energy prices,” he wrote in a note to investors. The strong rally of the past two days also added about Rs 5.3 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalization now at Rs 265.5 lakh crore, official data showed. With the Dow Jones index up nearly 2% in the US market in mid-session on Thursday, the rally in the domestic market is expected to continue on Friday as well, market players said. Technically too there are indications that the current rally would continue. “Nifty has formed a bullish candle on the daily scale and has been making higher lows from the last three sessions. Now it needs to continue to hold above (the) 17,350 zone for an up move towards 17,500 and 17,777 zone whereas support can be seen at 17,150 and 17,000 zones,” a note from Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-up-1400-points-in-2-days-as-desi-funds-step-up-buying/articleshow/88060620.cms||---
---||Business||Only 79% of Star Health’s IPO bought||CHENNAI: The IPO for Star Health & Allied Insurance, backed by billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, was undersold on the last day of the offer with only 79% of the total number of shares subscribed by investors. Coming on the heels of muted response to the PayTM (One 97 Communication) IPO and its disastrous listing in mid-November, investors’ lack of interest in Star Health’s Rs 7,249-crore offer is sure to force several other IPO-bound companies to have a rethink on their plans, market players said. Since it is an offer for sale, existing investors will retain the unsold 21% of shares. According to the management, one of its key promoters Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, with a 17.5% stake, is not selling his stake through this offer. Overall, the promoters will dilute a 4.8% stake. Investors applied for about 3.56 crore shares against 4.49 crore shares on offer, translating to 79% of the offer. During the bidding that closed Thursday, the subscription was led by retail investors, followed by institutional investors. While the retail portion was subscribed 1.1 times, the institutional part was subscribed just a bit more than the number of shares which were offered under this category, data on BSE showed. Interestingly, there was hardly any interest in the portion reserved for non-institutional investors (also called HNIs) which received just 19% subscription. Also just about 10% of the shares in the employee quota was subscribed. As it happens in issues that receive muted response during the bidding process, the shares are expected to be offered at the lower end of the Rs 870-900 price band. The under-subscription will also lead to existing shareholders who were selling their shares in the offer to reduce the number of shares on offer. Accordingly, shares worth nearly Rs 3,727 crore would be offered by existing shareholders, compared to Rs 5,249 crore worth of shares which were on offer initially. The company had also raised a little over Rs 3,217 crore from anchor investors ahead of its IPO. The Monetary Authority of Singapore, Government of Singapore, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Morgan Stanley Asia (Singapore) Pte, Goldman Sachs (Singapore) Pte, BNP Paribas Arbitrage and Societe Generale were among the anchor investors. At the upper price band, the company is valued at Rs 51,000 crore, or $7 billion. Among the listed non-life insurance companies, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, the largest private insurer, is valued at Rs 73,050 crore, while the largest non-life company New India Insurance is valued at Rs 25,453 crore. As of FY21, Star Health holds a market cap of 31.4% under the privately owned insurance. Other than the Star Health offer, the IPO for Anand Rathi Wealth was fully subscribed on Day 1 itself with retail and high networth investors (HNIs) leading the subscription figures. The retail part was subscribed two-and-half times while the HNI part was subscribed nearly two times, taking the total subscription figure to 1.6 times, BSE data showed. Another offer, for Tega Industries, was subscribed nearly 14 times on Day 2 of the offer, again with HNIs and retail investors leading from the front. The HNI portion was subscribed 20.5 times, the retail portion 17 times while the institutional investor part was subscribed 3.4 times. Usually, most of the institutional and HNI applications in IPOs come on the last day of the offer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/only-79-of-star-healths-ipo-bought/articleshow/88060664.cms||---

The suspect, Salman Khan, a resident of Varthur, was beaten so badly that doctors had to amputate his right arm to ensure his survival on November 6. According to sources, cops from Vathur police station picked up Khan near his residence on October 27.  He reportedly confessed to his involvement in three cases of car battery theft and police recovered the goods based on his information from buyers. The situation went wrong after policemen started harassing him to admit to involvement in other theft cases unsolved in their station. Doctors suggested amputationPolice allegedly kept him under illegal detention for five days till October 31. Cops allegedly beat him till his condition worsened. They let him go home with his mother on October 31 but by that time his right arm had swollen to twice the normal size. It worsened by the day and doctors suggested he had to amputate his arm for survival. According to sources, Khan’s collarbone has developed some problem and nerves at the spot were infected. The incident came to light recently after Khan’s friends posted the matter on social media. D Devaraj, deputy commissioner of police (Whitefield), ordered an inquiry and Whitefield ACP prima facie found the allegations to be true. Based on the inquiry report, Devaraj suspended head constable Nagabhushana Gowda and constables BN Nagaraj and H Shivaraj, pending inquiry. National Confederation of Human Rights Organisations Karnataka, All-India Lawyers Association for Justice and the Campaign Against Hate Speech jointly formed a fact-finding committee on alleged police brutality and released its report on Thursday. The report alleged that Salman was in illegal custody of Varthur police and lost his right arm due to police brutality. NCHRO’s state president S Balan called the incident ‘Bengaluru’s Jai Bhim’ and demanded Rs 1 crore as compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-loses-arm-in-custody-3-constables-suspended/articleshow/88060683.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru doctor with no travel history infected with Omicron, his 5 contacts test Covid-19 positive||BENGALURU: A 46-year-old doctor from Bengaluru without travel history has been infected with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, raising concerns about its presence in the community. The doctor’s five contacts — including two family members and a colleague — have also tested positive for Covid, and their samples have been sent for genomic sequencing to confirm the variant. The doctor, a Bommanahalli resident working at a hospital on Bannerghatta Road, tested positive on November 22. He volunteered for testing after developing Covid symptoms like cold and bodyache. On testing positive, the hospital where he worked sent his swab sample for genomic sequencing as his CT value was less than 25. The Omicron variant was detected in his sample on Thursday. The doctor, fully vaccinated, does not have severe symptoms and was in home isolation earlier. “He has now been shifted to a designated hospital. His 13 primary contacts and 205 secondary contacts have been tested. Of them, two primacy contacts and one secondary contact were positive. Their samples have been sent for genomic sequencing,” said BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta. The doctor’s wife, also a doctor, and 13-year-old-daughter have tested positive but his 6-year-old son is negative. The boy will now undergo a retest, said sources. The doctor’s colleague tested positive and his secondary contacts, including his wife and father-in-law are also positive for Covid. “Five had been found positive through one case. However, we need to wait for genomic sequencing results to confirm what variant they are infected with,” health department officers said. “In the hospital, 250 staffers have been tested as contacts of the five doctors. The hospital is not seen as a cluster. Hospital authorities have taken precautions to sanitise the operation theatres where he worked and they were closed for a day. Six patients with whom the doctor had come in contact were tested and found negative,” said the officers.

The other doctor’s genomic sequencing report is awaited,” said BBMP sources.

Around 60 international passengers, including nine from Africa, who landed at various airports came to VisakhapatnamThe doctor’s wife, who has tested positive, had stopped going to work when her husband tested positive and hence none in her hospital, including staffers and patients, are seen as primary contacts, said authorities. The Omicron-infected doctor did not visit the OT after November 19. Asked whether Omicron was already in the community, Dr CN Manjunath, nodal officer for Covid testing and member of the state’s technical advisory committee, said variants need not always be imported. “Omicron has been seen in multiple countries.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka govt looks at ways to use Covid-19 vaccine stock in private hospitals||BENGALURU: With the Centre mulling over administering the third dose of Covid vaccine amid the emergence of the Omicron variant, the demand for the jab is set to increase and the state government plans to tap unused stock in private hospitals. Anil Kumar TK, principal secretary, health and family welfare, said the government is meeting with representatives of private hospitals on Friday to figure out ways to utilise unused doses. One option for the government is to buy back doses or pay hospitals so that they can provide vaccines to people free of cost. “We’re going with an open mind as we want to explore all options available. Let’s hear from private hospitals and assess how many doses are available with them,” he said. The demand for vaccine dwindled after July-August when the second wave started receding and few people preferred paid jabs while government centres were administering it free. According to one estimate, around 8.2 lakh doses are unused in private hospitals across Karnataka. While most doses were procured before June and set to expire by November, manufacturers were allowed to extend expiry date by another six months. But, this didn’t help hospitals clear inventories. With the Centre now expected to give its nod to administer booster dose and a drive to inoculate children below 18 years is on the cards, the demand for doses is expected to increase. ‘Hope stocks will be used’“We hope vaccine stocks will be exhausted before the expiry date considering the latest developments. We see two possibilities — one is people who took the first and second doses at private hospitals may come back to the same centres for the third dose and the other is government intervention,” said Dr Prasanna, president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA). Prasanna said National Health Mission has collected data from PHANA about available stock. Sources said the government is likely to ask hospitals to administer vaccines to people free and reimburse them. In this case, the government has to spend Rs 780 per dose of Covishield, and Rs 1,410 and Rs 1,145 for Covaxin and Sputnik V respectively. “In the present situation, the available doses with private hospitals are considered a valuable resource and we should not allow them to go waste. The government should frame a policy to utilise them properly,” said DR MK Sudarshan, chairman, Covid-19 technical advisory committee. Senior officials said the government has about 85 lakh doses and it is willing to add doses from private hospitals to its stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-looks-at-ways-to-use-vax-stock-in-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/88060685.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: International tourism expo slated for February shelved||BENGALURU: In September, the government had announced that Karnataka will host the state tourism international expo in February 2022. This was after it assessed that international flights would resume normal operations by November 15. However, now with the onset of Omicron, Karnataka has been forced to postpone the mega event, which was aimed at reviving the struggling tourism industry. “The Karnataka International Travellers Expo (KITE), scheduled to be held from February 23 to 25, 2022 has been postponed to April,” said tourism secretary Pankaj Kumar Pandey. Pandey, however, said the government had taken a call to postpone the event two to three weeks prior to the news of the fast-spreading Omicron strain as normal operations of international flights weren’t resuming anytime soon. “We had made a guesstimate of normal flights not resuming soon and thus took a call to postpone the event...,” said Pandey. Sources, however, suggested that KITE could be postponed beyond April too as resumption of international flights looks unlikely before March/April next year. Though ranked eighth on India’s list of states dependent on international travellers, Karnataka has a high footfall of foreign tourists. KIA, as per state government data, was ranked fifth in footfall between January 2019-January 2020. “Though foreign tourism is next to nil, revival of domestic tourism has helped the industry experience a semblance of recovery as many people who were cooped up in their homes for over a year are suddenly out and travelling,” said tourism director Sindhu B Rupesh. “With Karnataka recording the first cases of the new variant, we worry if the situation will once again deteriorate,” said a department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/intl-tourism-expo-slated-for-feb-shelved/articleshow/88060686.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

The death toll in the accident has risen to three, police said, adding that the car driver was drunk. Two women Gali Honnamma, 68, and Bindu M, 28, residents of nearby Varasandra village, had been declared brought dead to a hospital where all the women were taken after the accident. The seven women had spread ragi for drying during the day on the unused stretch, filled them back into 10 gunny bags after dusk set in and were having dinner when the accident happened. Cops identified the accused driver as Prem Kumar, 24, a resident of Mallasandra in Bagalgunte. Son of an electrical contractor and jobless, Prem had attended a friend’s birthday party at RR Nagar and was heading to Madavara on Tumakuru Road when the accident happened. An alcometer test showed Kumar had consumed 145mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood, way above the permitted 30 mg. Cops sent his blood samples to the Forensic Science Lab to ascertain whether he had consumed drugs. Driver booked for culpable homicidePolice said they booked Kumar under non-bailable IPC section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). Kumar is being treated at a hospital for minor injuries and will be produced before court once he gets discharged, police said. Cops are looking for Kumar’s friend Gagan, who was sitting next to him when the accident occurred. Gagan fled from the spot. “Kumar was to drive towards Tumakuru Road after entering NICE Road from Hosakerehalli junction. Gagan is said to have misled Kumar about the route. They reached Sompura gate and were roamings aimlessly when the accident took place. There is a speed-breaker on the unused stretch and Kumar’s car ran on it. He lost control of the car, rammed a motorbike parked near the ragi sacks and then ploughed into the group of women,” an investigating officer said. The other injured women Sushma, Saraswatamma, Bhagyalakshmi and Rajamma are undergoing treatment at a private hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/car-driver-who-ploughed-into-7-women-was-drunk-police/articleshow/88060689.cms||---

He is already enrolled in Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) course at Sri Jagadguru Murugarajendra Dental College and Hospital, Chitradurga, under private quota. P Prajwal from Bengaluru contended that many students less meritorious than him were allowed to participate in the mop-up round. However, a division bench headed by Justice Alok Aradhe said the petitioner had participated in counselling, been allotted a seat and even paid admission fee. “He has no right to seek a government seat after having taken admission in the first round under private quota,” the bench observed. It said Prajwal had neither furnished details of the “less meritorious” candidates nor impleaded them in the writ petition. Prajwal appeared for NEET 2020 and secured an all-India rank of 2,14,774. He participated in counselling and was allotted a private quota seat. He paid the fee and joined the college in Chitradurga. However, Prajwal claimed he learnt through an RTI plea that many candidates less meritorious than him were allotted government seats in the course during the mop-up round. He subsequently approached the court seeking a direction to consider his candidature for a government seat and adjust the excess fee paid. ‘Deadline over’Counsel for the government and Karnataka Examinations Authority said the petitioner was allotted a seat in the first round of counselling under private quota and the last date for admission to the course was now over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-rejects-students-plea-for-govt-seat/articleshow/88060694.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Attendance up 12% in Bidar as schoolkids get eggs in midday meals||BENGALURU: The initiative of providing eggs in midday meals, rolled out on Wednesday, has been received well by students, the department of public instruction (DPI) said. According to officials, there was a 12% increase in attendance at schools in Bidar on Thursday. “The education officer in Bidar said attendance improved by 12% after eggs were added. On a review of the programme, every BEO said it was like a celebration in their schools,” said Vishal R, commissioner of DPI. On December 1, Karnataka began providing eggs to children in seven northern districts — Bidar, Ballari, Kalaburagi, Koppal, Vijayapura, Raichur, and Yadgir — where malnutrition is rampant. Students who do not eat eggs will get bananas. DPI said the programme was rolled out on Wednesday without hindrance. Some Lingayat organisations in Bidar had opposed the scheme, taking out a procession and submitting a memorandum to the government to roll it back. However, educationists and health experts urged the government to stick to its decision. In a letter to the education minister, a group of civil society stakeholders, including 17 organisations and 57 individuals, asked the government to extend the programme to all districts. According to experts, egg is important because it is low-cost, easy-to-cook and a locally available food item with high protein component. It is also a good source of all vitamins except C. While the government is now providing fortified rice, experts said that has “little scientific basis or economic validity”. “Considering that the rate of stunting and weight deficiency in children under five is more in Karnataka, the possibility of multiple nutritional deficiencies is also high... BJP governments in Goa and the northeast are supporting the rights of communities that eat meat. The BJP government in Karnataka should not let our children down, especially those from the weaker sections of society,” read the letter. Experts suggest eggs should be mandatorily provided daily to children in all 31 districts and the contract for egg supply given to local self-help groups or women’s groups as a form of community support. School-based kitchens should be set up and all centralised contracts should be cancelled immediately, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/attendance-up-12-in-bidar-as-schoolkids-get-eggs/articleshow/88060695.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Three of the accused were identified as Mohammed Sahil, Faisal and Fazal, all in their early 30s and residents of JP Nagar VI Stage. They are from Kerala. The fourth accused, Abdul Manas, was arrested on Wednesday. Police recovered 2,656 cash deposit receipts from the quartet. Preliminary investigation revealed the accused would accept cash from merchants and traders from Kerala and deposit it into different bank accounts through CDM. DCP (south) Harish Pandey said prime accused Sahil was arrested on November 21 when he was found behaving in a suspicious manner outside an ATM kiosk at Puttenahalli. Sahil was inside the kiosk for more than 30 minutes, depositing huge sums of money. When a man asked him why he was taking so much time, Sahil tried to give him some cash. The man alerted others and sensing trouble, Sahil threatened them with a machete. Passersby caught hold of Sahil and handed him to police. “Salil and his aides would get details of bank accounts and amounts to be deposited on WhatsApp. The cash was handed over to them by merchants visiting them at their JP Nagar residence. Accordingly, they would deposit the cash through different CDMs in the city. For this, each was paid Rs 60,000 every month,” Pandey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/4-from-kerala-arrested-for-laundering-31-5-crore/articleshow/88060697.cms||---

He put forth the demand during a meeting with Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Shekhawat in Delhi. Tamil Nadu has been opposing the Mekedatu balancing reservoir and drinking water project, claiming it will affect the natural flow of Cauvery river into the state, reducing its share of water. Bommai also urged the Centre not to give permission for preparation of a DPR on the Krishna-Cauvery-Godavari river linking project without hearing Karnataka’s concerns. The state has filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking an injunction to prevent the water resources ministry from granting permission for the Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar link project. BJP-JD(S) council poll alliance yet to be decidedThe CM said there are diverse views on forging a pre-poll alliance between BJP and JD(S) for the December 10 legislative council elections, and a final call will be taken by former chief ministers BS Yediyurappa and HD Kumaraswamy in consultation with central party functionaries. On November 30, JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and discussed the council polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cm-dont-greenlight-tns-river-project-till-mekedatu-is-cleared/articleshow/88060698.cms||---

Those LIC policyholders who do not have a demat account yet could open one and link PAN to their policies under this facility to apply in the IPO under this category. The government is eyeing around Rs 1 lakh crore by divesting part of its stake in the life insurance major through the IPO, expected in the next few months. This is sure to be the largest IPO in India, far ahead of the recently closed PayTM offer that was worth about Rs 18,300 crore, official data showed. Earlier this year, the government amended the LIC Act, 1956 to allow the company to offer shares to its policyholders when it goes for an IPO. Through an advertisement, LIC also informed its policyholders how they could link their policies with their PAN.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/link-pan-to-lic-policies-for-ipo-quota/articleshow/88060701.cms||---

The duo’s foray into green hydrogen follows moves by Reliance Industries (RIL), Adani Group and the Tatas. L&T and Renew, which is backed by Goldman Sachs, sees $2 billion worth of business opportunity from green hydrogen in two years. Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water molecules with renewable power such as solar and wind. Spearheaded by Sumant Sinha, Renew is a significant player in solar and wind energy in the country. Demand for green hydrogen from hard-to-abate industries like refineries, steel, fertilisers and city gas grids is predicted to be two million metric tonnes annually by 2030, requiring investments of $60 billion. RIL plans to bring the production cost of green hydrogen to $1 per kg by the end of this decade. L&T CEO S N Subrahmanyan pointed out that the partnership with Renew is a step towards building a green energy portfolio.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lt-renew-tie-up-for-green-hydrogen/articleshow/88060714.cms||---

After a march from the Press Club gates, the PCI office bearers handed over a memorandum on behalf of the journalist fraternity to Speaker Om Birla in person and to the office of Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu. In an open letter to all political parties, the PCI pointed out that curbs imposed in markets, cinemas, restaurants and other public spaces at the peak of the pandemic had been lifted while the restrictions on reporting in Parliament remained in place. “We are concerned that there is a depressing trend emerging to isolate Parliament and parliamentarians from media gaze,” the letter said, adding that the “trend augurs ill of parliamentary democracy and [is] much against the spirit of our parliamentary democracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/media-outfits-protest-curbs-on-parliament-coverage/articleshow/88060757.cms||---

In addition, 12 more nuclear reactors with a capacity for 9000 MW have been accorded administrative approval and financial sanction, minister of state in the PMO Jitendra Singh said. On progressive completion of the projects, the present nuclear power capacity of 6780 MW will increase to 22480 MW by 2031. Replying in the Question Hour, Singh said nuclear energy would soon emerge as one of the most important sources of alternative or clean energy for the increasing power demand in the country. Asked whether the government is thinking of phasing out nuclear power plants on account of safety, the minister said, “We have not only increased the number but are also trying to make a pan-India generation project”. As far as the cost is concerned, Singh said it comes to about Rs 3 per unit on an average. But in the times to come, the cost would reduce with more plants, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nuclear-reactor-close-to-delhi-among-9-new-ones-by-2024-govt-to-rs/articleshow/88060770.cms||---

Almost two decades later, the Indian legend virtually walked down the red carpet at the World Athletics Awards 2021 to receive the Woman of the Year Award.“Even in those days, it was a grand function (IAAF world athletics gala), and I used to dream of winning the award. I couldn’t win it as an athlete but I’m glad that I won the honour as a mentor,” the former long jumper told TOI while taking a short break from her mentoring session with dozens of young kids in her community.“At the Anju Bobby Sports Foundation, we have 13 athletes in the high-performance category as we are working with SAI support. This will go up to 20 in the coming months once our facility is fully operational,” Anju said.With Anju as mentor and Robert Bobby George as coach, the Foundation made its mark at the international level when Shaili Singh won the silver medal at the World Athletics U-20 Championships in Nairobi in August. “This award is in recognition of the overall contribution to athletics. From mentoring to women empowerment to gender equality,” said Anju, who is the senior vice-president of Athletics Federation of India.‘AGREAT INSPIRATION’Anju said the prestigious honour would spur the Foundation to work towards producing Olympic medallists. “We will continue our work and this award from the world body will inspire us to work hard towards our ultimate aim -- Olympic medals.“All the coaching is done by Bobby and my role is to mentor. Together, we are aiming for a medal at the 2028 Olympics and that’s a realistic target. There is only an outside chance at the 2024 Games,” the 44-year-old said.“I used to tell the kids at the Academy that we are starting from where we stopped. I stopped with a World Championships medal and Shaili (Singh) is starting from there. We are glad that we are slowly reaching our destination,” Anju added.Anju won a bronze medal at the 2003 Worlds in Paris. In 2005, she won the gold at the IAAF World Athletics Finals in Monaco. At the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, she won the gold. Her best show at the Olympics was the fifth-place finish in Athens (2004).Other awards: World Athletes of the year: Men: Karsten Warholm (Nor).

The court directed the duo to submit a written application on December 8. Rizwan Ahmed (24) and Mohsin Sayyed (33) have been in jail since their arrest in 2016. So far, they have not assigned any reason for their decision, their former lawyers said. Once an accused pleads guilty, he forfeits his right to a trial. In May, the NIA court had rejected Ahmed’s bail plea. He then moved the Bombay HC for bail. The plea has been reserved for orders. So far, 39 prosecution witnesses have been examined. The NIA took over the investigations in March 2016. The chargesheet was subsequently submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/is-propaganda-case-maharashtra-duo-to-plead-guilty/articleshow/88060775.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Yadlapalli, 22, who has had to battle injuries these last few years, making tennis a start-stop affair, came through 6-3, 6-3 against Yubarani Banerjee. Yadlapalli, whose right shoulder was taped, complained of tightness following her match, saying it affected her serving, especially in the second set. The Hyderabad pro, working to get her ranking of 782 back to where it was a couple of summers ago at No. 265 and higher, was stuck in Australia for 14 months during the pandemic. She had gone there for rehab, having injured her lower back, when Covid-19 hit international travel. Yadlapalli will play three more ITF Futures in India, work on her fitness and play at the Rohan Bopanna Tennis Academy, before hitting the road again in January. Wednesday’s shock winner — qualifier Shrivalli Rashmikaa Bhamidipaty — who had earlier put out the second-seeded Zeel Desai, was ruthless in her 6-2, 6-1 victory over fellow qualifier Prathiba Narayan Prasad. Bhamidipaty, days short of her 20th birthday, outplayed Prasad, driving strongly off both flanks and opening up the court. She went ahead with early breaks in both sets to set up a last-eight meeting with Akanksha Dileep Nitture, who ousted eighth seed Sathwika Sama 6-4, 2-6, 6-2. Results: Singles (pre-quarterfinals, Indians unless mentioned): Vaidehi Chaudhari bt Sai Samhitha Chamarthi 6-3, 6-2; Sowjanya Bavisetti bt Soha Sadiq 6-2, 6-2; Rutuja Bhosale bt Reshma Maruri 6-3, 6-3; So-Ra Lee (Kor) bt Zlata Yankovskaya (Rus) 6-2, 6-0; Shrivalli Rashmikaa Bhamidipaty bt Pratibha Narayan Prasad 6-2, 6-1; Akanksha Dileep Nitture bt Sathwika Sama 6-4, 2-6, 6-2; Prathyusha Rachapudi bt Jagmeet Kaur Grewal 2-6, 6-2, 6-4; Pranjala Yadapalli bt Yubarani Banerjee 6-3, 6-3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rutuja-and-sowjanya-storm-into-quarterfinals/articleshow/88060776.cms||---

While whispers about an audit looking into their skill sets, projects they are associated with, their age and other details have scientists and engineers worried, DoS top brass say the committee is only carrying out a periodic exercise as mandated by the DoS secretariat.Minister of state in PMO Jitendra Singh told the Loksabha on Wednesday that recruitments will be made once the audit is completed as it will help recruit the right set of personnel. “With the space sector reforms being implemented, greater emphasis is being laid on R&D activities, technology demonstration missions, science & exploration missions, missions of national importance, human space programme & strategic missions realisation by Isro. In line with this, a detailed exercise is being carried out to ensure optimal allocation and redeployment of the existing resources to various centres and units,” Singh said.Multiple scientists and engineers TOI has been speaking with said they fear that with Isro’s role set to significantly shift towards R&D, and away from production, which at present is intertwined in each centre, there could be rationale for staff reduction. “The fears are unfounded. The terms of the committee are not to reduce existing staff and there will be no reductions. The exercise is aimed at ensuring there’s optimal availability of manpower for all of our future needs. We have multiple big-ticket missions, several futuristic projects, all of which will have requirements. This is only a periodic exercise to determine these needs so that the DoS can put up its demand before the government. Such exercises have been carried out in the past too,” said K Sivan, secretary, DoS.Another senior member of the DoS, while reiterating that the existing 17,000-plus workforce won’t be reduced, said that the committee will do its assessment based on inputs from various centres. But Isro staffers argued that the lack of clarity on the exercise is affecting their morale especially in the post-pandemic economic environment. “We have several questions. Will some of us be merged with newer organisations being created under DoS like NSIL, what will be the role of IN-SPACe and how will that affect us and so on, which have not been answered adequately. There is also the issue of a recruitment freeze,” a senior scientist who has been with Isro for 25 years, said.The DoS member said that based on the assessment, there could be some redeployment of staff. “...But that is natural. For instance, when the Gaganyaan mission was announced, there was redeployment of staff and also fresh hiring. Similarly, in the future, there could be a situation where one centre or unit of DoS has less workload compared to another meriting some redeployment of resources. The overall aim of the exercise is to assess such requirements,” the scientist said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dept-of-space-allays-fears-over-manpower-audit-at-isro/articleshow/88060778.cms||Hasti Doshi

The service is first being launched in India, and Lucknow will be the first city to experience it.Nandini Maheshwari, senior director of business development in Uber Asia Pacific, said, “We want to make it as easy as possible for all Indians to take an Uber trip, and to do that we need to meet them on platforms they are comfortable with. We are thrilled at this global-first integration for Uber, and look forward to rolling it out across India.” Ther service is built on WhatsApp Business Platform. Abhijit Bose, head of WhatsApp India, said the WhatsApp Business Platform has been an important lever for businesses that want to build a direct connect with their consumers. “The Uber experience on WhatsApp is simple, familiar, and relatable for users and has the potential to accelerate adoption of Uber with a new category of riders in India,” he said.With this integration, riders will no longer need to download or use the Uber app. From user registration to booking a ride, and getting a trip receipt will be managed within the WhatsApp chat interface. WhatsApp users can book a ride through three simple ways: messaging to Uber’s business account number; scanning a QR code; or clicking a link directly to open an Uber WhatsApp chat. They will then be asked to provide pickup and drop off locations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/now-you-can-whatsapp-to-book-an-uber-in-india/articleshow/88060780.cms||---

By 2025, it expects another at least 250 “scale-ups,” as they have been called, to be added.The most number of scale-ups are in Bengaluru, Delhi-NCR and Mumbai. Among sectors, the concentration is in fintech and retailtech. Other significant areas are enterprise tech, healthtech, and supply chain management & logistics. Emerging areas like D2C (direct to consumer), edtech, logistics, automotive, real estate, travel & hospitality are expected to add 30-40% of new scaleups by 2025.While it previously took around five years to scale, faster funding and larger ticket size rounds will accelerate future growth and valuations are set to increase this pace, the report said.. The report, launched at the ongoing Nasscom Product Conclave, analysed around 100 startups, including unicorns and those with revenue over $15 million, paying attention to how they scale their business. It says scaling up requires enhanced product development based on customer feedback; starting with a ‘digital first’ approach and then expanding to a robust sales team; building a marketing strategy that spans across credibility, reach and brand; pricing that is flexible to market and business changes; pivoting early if the business is not giving desired results; keeping technology up to date; looking to attract funding; and focusing on process maturity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/indian-startups-scaling-up-rapidly-nasscom-report/articleshow/88060786.cms||Kruthikaa Lakshman

He said an all-party meeting would soon be held in this regard. On Thursday, Tejashwi, accompanied by some other opposition leaders called on the CM to request him to start the process of holding the state’s caste census, as the Centre had now clarified in the Lok Sabha that no general caste census other than that of the scheduled caste (SC) and scheduled tribe (ST) sections will be conducted. “The Centre has rejected our demand. In this case, the CM has given assurance on our demand of conducting the caste census with state’s own funds. An all-party meeting will soon be held in this regard,” Tejashwi said. Asked if the CM would comply with the opposition’s request, he said, “It is his commitment as he has also talked about it in the past. The state assembly and legislative council have also adopted resolutions in this regard.” Those who accompanied Tejashwi to the CM’s chamber included Ajeet Sharma from the Congress, Mahboob Alam from the CPI(ML), Ajay Kumar from the CPM and Ram Ratan Singh from the CPI, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/all-party-meet-on-caste-census-soon-tejashwi-after-meeting-nitish/articleshow/88058698.cms||Abhay Singh

Kolkata’s doctors on Thursday brought out a comprehensive advisory to avoid imminent health hazards on the occasion of national pollution control day. Organised by SwitchON Foundation in association with Doctors for Clean Air (DFCA) forum, the advisory provides ways in which citizens can prevent impact from air pollution. Senior oncologist Suman Mallik from NH Narayana Superspeciality Hospital said, “We all need to do our part to keep everyone healthy. The health impact of air pollution has been underestimated. However, tackling it could be the greatest health opportunity for the Government Health Reform Programme, as well as providing direct co-benefit to human health for an entire generation to come.” Consultant pulmonologist, Woodlands Multispeciality Hospitals, Arup Halder said, “Although in other countries COPD is known as a disease of the smokers, in Kolkata we see a majority of ‘non-smoking COPD’ cases. In our country, the major risk factors for COPD are ambient air pollution, household air pollution and occupational air pollution.” “Each of us must act in our own way to combat pollution. I speak to people burning biomass and try to make them understand its lethal impact. There is no better antidote of pollution than awareness,” said Sanjukta Dutta, emergency medicine head of Fortis. Surendri Bannerjee, resident, radiation oncology, IPGMER & SSKM Hospital, Kolkata, said, “Smoking, both active and passive, must be avoided on a regular basis. Our focus on lung well-being is not just to reduce the incidence of allergic and inflammatory conditions leading to respiratory distress, but also to eliminate the bigger killer, lung cancer, which has a markedly poor prognosis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/la-nina-on-horizon-city-doctors-bring-out-pollution-advisory/articleshow/88058849.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Patna||Silt deposit in riverbeds a major issue in state: Bihar minister||PATNA: State water resources department minister Sanjay Kumar Jha on Thursday said in the legislative council that waterlogging in fields caused by silt deposit in the riverbeds was a major issue in Bihar. Jha said the state government had requested the Centre to formulate a national silt policy to address the issue. He said a committee had also been set up in January 2020 to devise ways to overcome the problems of siltation and waterlogging because of Farakka barrage. The minister was replying to a short notice question raised by BJP MLC Survesh Kumar, who pointed out that farmers have to suffer huge losses in the state because of waterlogging in fields. Replying to Kumar, Jha said Bihar has a geographical area of 94.16 lakh hectares and 68.80 lakh hectares or 73.06% of the state’s total geographical area are flood-affected. He said of 400 lakh hectares of flood-affected area in the country, 17.2% is in Bihar. Jha said when rivers enter Bihar from Nepal, their surface remains flat unlike in the upper region of Nepal and this leads to deposition of silt in the riverbeds. Jha said the state government had made the Prime Minister and the Centre aware of this issue in 2016 and 2017 and Aviral Ganga Summit was also organised in 2017 in Delhi and Patna to get recommendations from experts. While replying to a starred question raised by MLC Dhanshyam Thakur regarding flood in Madhubani district, Jha said CM Nitish Kumar would inaugurate the construction work of a barrage on Kamla river this month. To a call attention raised by Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra regarding geographical indication (GI) tag of makhana as Mithila Makhana, agriculture minister Amrendra Pratap Singh said it would soon be done. Mishra said makhana was the identity of Mithila region and its GI tagging should be done accordingly. Singh said several steps had been taken to promote production of makhana, including formulation of Makhana Vikas Yojana in 2019-20. He said the production of makhana has increased from 16 quintal per hectare to 28 quintal per hectare. ‘Govt to check illegal entry of goods from Nepal’: Deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad on Thursday said in the legislative council that a meeting would be held after the winter session of the state legislature to check the entry of goods illegally from neighbouring Nepal and other states to Bihar. RJD MLC Ram Chandra Purbey raised this issue through a starred question and said bricks and garments were being brought from Nepal and sold in Saharsa, Purnia and Katihar illegally, causing huge losses to brick kilns and garment traders. “Even sales of Bhagalpuri shawls have dropped because of this,” Purbey added. The deputy CM said the government would do the needful to address the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/silt-deposit-in-riverbeds-a-major-issue-in-state-bihar-minister/articleshow/88058799.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Anirudh Kumar, joint secretary of All India Bank Employees’ Association (AIBEA) and general secretary of Bihar Provincial Bank Employees’ Association, said all the nationalized banks would remain shut across the state on December 16 and 17 and the bankers will hit the streets to protest privatisation of the two PSBs. “AIBEA held a meeting with all the bank branches on November 30 to discuss the further course of action as the Centre will pass the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021 in the winter session of Parliament. We are against the tabling of the proposed amendment in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The protest is in the interest of the public as well as the bank employees,” Anirudh said. He added bank employees would demonstrate in the state capital on Saturday (December 4) and in all the districts on December 7 and 8. “We will continuously hold demonstrations till December 15,” Anirudh said. According sources, at least 1,200 bank branches will remain shut for two days across the state, as some 40,000 bank employees and officers will go on strike, including 10,000 in Patna. A state member of Bank Employees’ Confederation of India (BEFI) said all banking services, including cash transactions, cheque clearance and loans would be affected. “The ATMs will not be refilled with cash during the two-day strike,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/2-day-bank-strike-from-december-16/articleshow/88058717.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Business||Link PAN to LIC policies for IPO quota||Mumbai: Insurance giant LIC has asked its policyholders who have a demat account to link their income tax PAN with their policies so that they can apply in its IPO under the reserved category. Those LIC policyholders who do not have a demat account yet could open one and link PAN to their policies under this facility to apply in the IPO under this category. The government is eyeing around Rs 1 lakh crore by divesting part of its stake in the life insurance major through the IPO, expected in the next few months. This is sure to be the largest IPO in India, far ahead of the recently closed Paytm offer that was worth about Rs 18,300 crore, official data showed. Earlier this year, the government amended the LIC Act, 1956 to allow it to offer shares to its policyholders when it goes for an IPO. Through an advertisement, LIC also informed policyholders how they could link their policies with their PAN.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/link-pan-to-lic-policies-for-ipo-quota/articleshow/88059410.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Lenders of Srei’s 2 fin cos look for group resolution||Mumbai: Creditors to the two finance companies in the Srei Group that are facing bankruptcy action are considering a group approach to the insolvency resolution. Such an approach is expected to get faster results and better value for the banks that are owed money from the Srei companies. Last month, the RBI had superseded the board of Srei Infrastructure Finance (SIFL) and Srei Equipment Finance (SEFL). According to initial estimates, the top 10 lenders — Canara Bank, PNB, UBI, SBI, BoB, Indian Bank, P&S Bank, Central Bank, Uco Bank and BOI — together represent over Rs 20,000 crore of a consolidated loan of Rs 31,527 crore between Srei and SEFL. This would give them 65% voting rights if claims are consolidated. According to the note, there would not be much of a variation in the voting rights of the top 10 lenders if a group approach is taken. Bankers said that various investments in connected entities and their further investee companies — viz, Bharat Road Network, Trinity, Power Trust (which may have equity value in future) — are housed in SIFL, whereas exposure to such entities is partly through SEFL. Thus, disentangling the two entities would hamper the objective of maximisation of value if the resolution applicants are not allowed access to synergies between different group companies Incidentally, before the board was superseded, the promoters of Srei had sought to consolidate both the businesses by transferring the business of Srei Equipment to Srei Infra through a transfer arrangement. However, the proposal was rejected by the lenders. The administrator has, however, pointed out in his note that a group resolution is different from the business transfer plan proposed by the promoters as rights of individual creditors on their secured assets would be retained. Also, the committee of creditors, who have exposure to both companies, will have a say in the distribution of assets and can ensure that the rights of those who hold specific security are protected. Incidentally, EY, which was appointed by the company to help in the consolidation, continues to assist the administrator-led company in taking the group approach. The group resolution is found useful in a situation where the liabilities are with one company while the value lies in other businesses. A similar group resolution approach was successfully adopted in IL&FS where a significant portion of the liability was with the parent and other holding companies where the assets were across 300 companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lenders-of-sreis-2-fin-cos-look-for-group-resolution/articleshow/88059403.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||Only 79% of Star Health’s IPO bought||Mumbai: The IPO for Star Health & Allied Insurance, backed by billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, was undersold on the last day of the offer with only 79% of the total number of shares subscribed by investors. Coming on the heels of a muted response to the Paytm (One97 Communications) IPO and its disastrous listing in mid-November, investors’ lack of interest in Star Health’s Rs 7,249-crore offer is sure to force several other market-bound companies to rethink their plans, traders said. Since it is an offer for sale (OFS), existing investors will retain the unsold 21% shares. According to the management, Jhunjhunwala — one of its key promoters with 17.5% — is not selling his stake through this offer. Overall, the promoters will dilute a 4.8% stake. Other than the Star Health offer, the IPO for Anand Rathi Wealth was fully subscribed on day 1 itself with retail and high net worth investors (HNIs) leading the subscription figures. The retail part was subscribed two-and-half times while the HNI part was subscribed nearly two times, taking the total subscription figure to 1.6 times, BSE data showed. Another offer, for Tega Industries, was subscribed nearly 14 times on day 2 of the offer, again with HNIs and retail investors leading from the front. The HNI portion was subscribed 20.5 times, the retail portion 17 times while the institutional investor part was subscribed 3.4 times. Usually, most of the institutional and HNI applications in IPOs come on the last day of the offer. In the Star Health IPO, investors applied for about 3.56 crore shares against 4.49 crore on offer, translating into 79%. During the bidding that closed on Thursday, the subscription was led by retail investors, followed by institutional investors. While the retail portion was subscribed 1.1 times, the institutional part was subscribed just a bit more than the number of shares that were offered under this category, data on BSE showed. Interestingly, there was hardly any interest in the portion reserved for non-institutional investors (also called HNIs), which received just 19% subscription. Also, just about 10% of the shares in the employee quota was subscribed.As it happens in issues that receive muted response during the bidding process, the shares are expected to be offered at the lower end of the Rs 870-900 price band. The under-subscription will also lead to existing shareholders who were selling their shares in the offer to reduce the number. Accordingly, shares worth nearly Rs 3,727 crore would be offered by existing shareholders, compared to Rs 5,249 crore worth initially. The company had also raised a little over Rs 3,217 crore from anchor investors ahead of its IPO. The Monetary Authority of Singapore, government of Singapore, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Morgan Stanley Asia (Singapore), Goldman Sachs (Singapore), BNP Paribas Arbitrage and Societe Generale were among the anchor investors. At the upper price band, the company is valued at Rs 51,000 crore, or $7 billion. Among the listed non-life insurance companies, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, the largest private insurer, is valued at Rs 73,050 crore, while the largest non-life company New India Insurance is valued at Rs 25,453 crore. As of FY21, Star Health holds a market share of 31.4% under the privately owned insurance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/only-79-of-star-healths-ipo-bought/articleshow/88059429.cms||---

The surge came even as some strong selling was recorded by foreign funds. On Thursday, the sensex added 777 points, on top of its 620-point rally on Wednesday, despite rising global fears about the impact of the Omicron variant of the Covid virus and chances of the US Fed ending its easy money policy in the next few months, ahead of its earlier schedule of the second half of 2022. The sensex started the session on a relatively flat note with a gain of about 300 points at 57,781, but rallied through the session to an intra-day high of 58,514 before it ended at 58,461 — up 1.4%. On the NSE too, the Nifty ended at 17,401 points, up 235 points or 1.4%. The gains in the sensex came on the back of strong GDP growth numbers for the July-September quarter and gross GST collection of over Rs 1.3 lakh crore — the second-highest in history — during November, market players said. In the last two sessions, while foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) net sold stocks worth nearly Rs 8,000 crore, domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 4,840 crore, data from the BSE and CDSL showed. And in the last five days, FPIs were net sellers at Rs 16,250 crore, while domestic institutional investors were net buyers at nearly Rs 17,100 crore. According to LKP Securities head (research) S Ranganathan, bulls held the upper hand on Thursday with IT stocks leading the charge. “As the volatility index cooled off (during the day’s session), we witnessed stock-specific action across sectors in the broader markets buoyed by GDP and GST data, together with cooling energy prices,” he wrote in a note to investors. The strong rally of the past two days also added about Rs 5.3 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 265.5 lakh crore, official data showed. With the Dow Jones index up nearly 2% in the US market in mid-session on Thursday, the rally in the domestic market is expected to continue on Friday as well, market players said. Technically too there are indications that the current rally would continue. “Nifty has formed a bullish candle on the daily scale and has been making higher lows from the last three sessions. Now it needs to continue to hold above the 17,350 zone for an up-move towards 17,500 and 17,777 zone, whereas support can be seen at 17,150 and 17,000 zones,” a note from Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-up-1-4k-pts-in-2-days-as-desi-funds-step-up-buying/articleshow/88059442.cms||---

The duo’s foray into green hydrogen follows moves by Reliance Industries (RIL), Adani Group and the Tatas. L&T and Renew, which is backed by Goldman Sachs, sees $2 billion worth of business opportunity from green hydrogen in two years. Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water molecules with renewable power such as solar and wind. Spearheaded by Sumant Sinha, Renew is a significant player in solar and wind energy in the country. Demand for green hydrogen from hard-to-abate industries like refineries, steel, fertilisers and city gas grids is predicted to be two million metric tonnes annually by 2030, requiring investments of $60 billion. RIL plans to bring the production cost of green hydrogen to $1 per kg by the end of this decade. L&T CEO S N Subrahmanyan pointed out that the partnership with Renew is a step towards building a green energy portfolio. The engineering giant is separately pursuing other aspects of green hydrogen like grid batteries and electrolysers. A promising clean fuel, green hydrogen will reduce the dependence on fossil fuels for India, whose energy import bill has rocketed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lt-renew-tie-up-for-green-hydrogen/articleshow/88059366.cms||---

The move comes two days after the central bank superseded RCap’s board of directors, citing defaults and serious governance issues. The RBI said, in a statement issued here, that in terms of the insolvency rules, an interim moratorium shall commence on and from the date of filing of the application till its admission or rejection.

The RBI has allowed banks to increase customer charges to Rs 21 per transaction — up from the earlier cap of Rs 20. This would only be applicable on transactions beyond those allowed for free — three transactions in metro centres and five in non-metro centres. The increase in charges were allowed to make good the general escalation in costs for banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/non-free-atm-use-to-cost-more/articleshow/88059477.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Mild Covid? No payment, says insurer in Gujarat's Patan||AHMEDABAD: Three persons from Patan in north Gujarat sued an insurance company after they were denied reimbursement for their Covid-19 treatment despite having taken special insurance for the infection. The insurer rejected their claim citing they had very mild Covid symptoms and could have been treated at home. The Patan District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission ordered the insurer, Future Generali Insurance Co Ltd, to pay the full amount insured of Rs 1 lakh to each of them with 8% interest and Rs 3,000 extra as compensation for mental harassment and legal expenditure. The commission said, “The applicant had obtained insurance cover for Covid treatment and if the insurer refuses to reimburse expenses on Covid treatment, it is really sad. During Covid times, patients did not get proper treatment and hospitals also overcharged for medicines. In such circumstances, the complainant is liable to get the entire amount back.” The cases before the consumer commission were filed by three persons — Rasik Solanki (41), Punamchand Solanki (26) and Nilesh Prajapati (27) — saying that they had bought the Corona Rakshak policy offered specially for Covid treatment. During the term of the policy, they tested positive for Covid-19 in the third week of October 2020. All three were hospitalised for four days and discharged with advice to remain under home isolation for a few more days. They sought reimbursement for their treatment, but the company refused to pay. When the consumer commission sought a reply, the insurer explained that during its scrutiny, it was found that these complainants did not show any major symptoms requiring hospitalisation. They were hospitalised with mild symptoms. The government’s guidelines state that for mild Covid-19, oral treatment is required and there was no need for hospitalisation. For Solanki, the company said, “The complainant was hospitalized mainly for isolation/observation/investigation/evaluation purposes only, which could easily have been managed on a domiciliary basis.” In response to Solanki’s complaint, the company replied, “…in the present case, it is evident that the insured got himself hospitalized only to fraudulently benefit under the policy. It is not the case that the insured’s health had deteriorated to a point that it required hospitalization. Moreover, the fact that the complainant was discharged merely in four days also points to the malafide intention of the complainant to benefit under the policy.” For Prajapati, the insurer said, “..the clinical examination and investigations did not reveal any severe Covid infection, which required hospitalization for management…”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mild-covid-no-payment-says-insurer/articleshow/88058932.cms||Saeed Khan
---||Patna||Waste management plant was set up in Patna without NOC: BSPCB||PATNA: The Patna high court on Thursday allowed the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) to file its reply stating whether its prior clearance was needed for Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) to set up the legacy waste management plant at Sampatchak Bairiya in Patna or not. A division bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah was hearing a PIL filed by one Suresh Prasad Yadav and four others, urging the court to direct the authorities concerned to take necessary action as the plant was causing environmental pollution and health hazard to the people living in the area. All the petitioners are residents of Bairiya and they had also urged the court to ask the officials concerned to relocate the plant. Over 80-acre land was acquired by the state government in 2009 for setting up a legacy waste management plant at Sampatchak. Over 10-lakh tonne waste is lying there. The PMC has targeted to remove the waste in nine months. The BSPCB had earlier informed the court that the plant was supposed to be set up with a no-objection certificate issued by it, but no such clearance was taken by the PMC. Following this, the corporation filed told the court that no such clearance or permission was required to run the plant at Bairiya. During Thursday’s hearing, the PMC informed the court about official written communications between Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change and Union ministry of housing and urban affairs on the issue and said no such prior clearance was required from the pollution board to set up the plant at Bairiya. The corporation also brought on record before the court via its reply that there were no water body and forests nearby the land on which the plant was set up. However, the BSPCB once again contended that the PMC was required to seek its permission and it would file a reply on the matter. Following this, the court granted time to the board to file its reply. The bench adjourned the matter for hearing till next month. Counsels Prasoon Sinha appeared for the PMC, Shivendra Kishore for the BSPCB and Shri Prakash Srivastava for the petitioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/waste-management-plant-was-set-up-in-patna-without-noc-bspcb/articleshow/88058514.cms||Debashish Karmakar

On November 18 this year, a week’s time was granted to the DGP-cum-departmental promotion committee chairman by a bench of justice P B Bajanthri for filing a detailed affidavit detailing whether petitioner Rama Kant Ram, who was promoted to the rank of inspector from sub-inspector with effect from September 23, 1998, was eligible for promotion with effect from September 26, 1995 or not. The high court had also directed the DGP to reply in the same affidavit that if the petitioner was not promoted from the date as contested by him, what was the reason for it. The petitioner had opted for Jharkhand cadre after bifurcation of Bihar and become an officer of Jharkhand police afterwards. He had filed a writ petition in the Patna high court on December 11, 1998 that he was eligible for promotion with effect from September 26, 1995, the date from when his juniors were promoted, under reserved category of scheduled caste, but he was given promotion after a delay of three years. Counsel Jagannath Singh represented the petitioner. Appearing for the state government, additional advocate general S D Yadav prayed for four weeks’ additional time for filing the affidavit which irked the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-imposes-rs-10k-cost-on-bihar-govt-for-delay-in-reply/articleshow/88058908.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Patna: ‘Switch to carpooling, use public transport to control air pollution’||PATNA: As the city’s air quality index (AQI) continues to remain in the ‘very poor’ category, environmentalists have expressed concern over the blatant violation of pollution control measures both by the government departments and the people. Talking to this reporter on National Pollution Control Day on Thursday, Ashok Kumar Ghosh, the chairman of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), said contractors, engineers as well as government officials hardly followed the correct procedure while engaging in construction activities and generated huge quantities of dust. “The BSPCB has written several letters to the urban development, building construction and road construction departments, asking them to use screens in repair and construction works, but they don’t do so. It is natural that the AQI of the city will increase,” Ghosh said and asked all the stakeholders to cooperate in the implementation of environmental laws to keep the city clean. He added, “Vehicular emissions also lead to air pollution. People do not switch off the engine of their vehicles while waiting for traffic clearance. This generates toxic gases.” Atul Aditya Pandey, the chairman of the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority, claimed that the geographical location of the city was such that the generation of dust, particularly in winters, could not be checked completely. He continued, “Screen covers should be used during construction works and water sprinkled on the roads. Uncertain changes in temperature due to climate change are also causing air pollution.” Dilip Kumar Paul, the coordinator of environmental science course in Patna University, pleaded for developing a sound system of solid waste management in the city to ensure a clean environment. “With a view to minimizing the level of pollution due to vehicular emissions, people should use public transport or switch to carpooling. In the winter season, they should stop burning wood, coal, and even garbage for warmth and comfort,” he advised. Mehta Nagendra Singh, an environmentalist, pointed out that stubble burning was an important factor that contributed to rising air pollution in the areas surrounding the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/switch-to-carpooling-use-public-transport-to-control-air-pollution/articleshow/88058530.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Met: Cyclone Jawad may cause drizzles in east Bihar on Sunday||PATNA: Cyclone Jawad is unlikely to have much impact on the weather system in Bihar. Weathermen at Patna Meteorological Centre said only drizzle would occur at a few places in the state on December 5. Cyclone Jawad had emerged as a low-pressure area over south Thailand on November 30 and moved to the Andaman Sea later. A special bulletin issued by India Meteorological Department on Thursday evening stated that the low-pressure area over central parts of Andaman Sea moved west- northwestwards and became a well-marked low-pressure area over southeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining Andaman Sea in the early morning on Thursday. It is likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm over the central parts of the Bay of Bengal on Friday and cross the coasts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha by Saturday morning. An official at Patna Meteorological Centre said the impact of the cyclonic storm would be minimal in Bihar. “One or two places in east Bihar are likely to witness drizzles on Sunday. Till then, partly cloudy skies are likely to be witnessed over most places in the state. Hazy skies were witnessed at some places on Thursday as well,” he said. The official added that both night and day temperatures would rise slightly due to the cloud cover. “The night temperature may surge comparatively higher. The temperature would again start falling once the cloud cover clears,” he said. Aarti Gupta, another official at Patna Meteorological Centre, said in a bulletin issued on Thursday afternoon that marginal rise was observed in both maximum and minimum temperatures in the last 24 hours. Gaya recorded the lowest minimum temperature in the state at 10.3 degrees C on Thursday. “The minimum temperature was recorded in the range of 12-14 degrees C in south Bihar and 14-16 degrees C in northern parts of the state,” she said. Gupta added partly cloudy skies would be witnessed across the state owing to easterly and north-easterly winds. “Slight rise in night temperature may be witnessed,” she said. As per a bulletin issued by the local met centre, the minimum temperature is likely to be in the range of 14-18 degrees C in northern parts of the state and 12-16 degrees C in the southern parts till December 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/met-cyclone-jawad-may-cause-drizzles-in-east-bihar-on-sunday/articleshow/88058882.cms||---

Altogether 65 operations were performed by the doctors of Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital at Juran Chappra during a free eye check-up and surgery camp for poor people on November 22. At least 15 of them lost their vision after developing post-surgical complications. The eyes of 11 of them were removed at the SKMCH and those of four others at Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital. Sanjay Kumar Singh, the special secretary of the health department, told this newspaper on Thursday that 10 patients would be shifted to the IGIMS on Friday for better treatment. “Of the 65 people, who had been operated upon, 26 hail from Muzaffarpur and the remaining patients belong to Motihari, Sheohar, Bettiah and Sitamarhi,” he added. A four-member committee was formed by civil surgeon, Dr Vinay Kumar Sharma, after the matter came to light. Dr Rajiv Kumar Singh, the head of the eye department at the SKMCH and one of the members of the committee, said, “As many as 21 patients, who had undergone cataract surgery at Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital, developed complications and were admitted here. While the eyes of 11 of them were removed through evisceration because of panophthalmitis, 10 others are on the verge of losing their vision.” Muzaffarpur’s district magistrate, Pranav Kumar, claimed that all the patients, who underwent cataract surgery on November 22, had been contacted. “None of them has experienced any problem yet. They will, however, be sent to hospitals in Patna for proper consultation and monitored for the next few days,” he said. Opposition raises issue in council: The legislators of the RJD and the Congress staged a protest outside the state legislative council on Thursday against the alleged botched-up cataract surgeries at a private hospital in Muzaffarpur, resulting in removal of the eyes of several patients. They demanded strict action against the doctor and his team. They also asked the government to provide monetary help to the victims and jobs to their family members. Former chief minister, Rabri Devi, demanded the resignation of health minister, Mangal Pandey, and said, “I want the government to give adequate compensation and jobs to the family members of the victims.” Congress MLC, Prem Chandra Mishra, also raised the issue in the Upper House. Condemning the incident, he said, “It is not a political issue, but a crime against humanity. Strict action should be taken against Dr N D Sahu and his team.” The acting chairperson of the council, Awadhesh Narain Singh, accepted that the matter was quite serious. “Every sensitive person will agree that it is a serious issue,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/10-more-facing-vision-loss-threat-will-be-shifted-to-igims-bihar-health-minister/articleshow/88058675.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Vijayawada||AP: Vizianagaram cops solve murder mystery after five years||VISAKHAPATNAM: Police cracked a five-year-old murder case and arrested four persons who were allegedly involved in the killing of K Satyanarayana from Vizianagaram town, who went missing on November 16, 2016 after leaving home on his scooter. The case was solved after police chanced upon the scooter which too had disappeared along with Satyanarayana. Vizianagaram DSP P Anil said that Two Town police station SI Sagar Babu, during a routine vehicular check-up on Wednesday, stopped G Ramakrishna, a bike mechanic who was riding a scooter without valid papers and a fake registration number. Ramakrishna told cops he purchased the scooter from one K Rajasekhar for Rs 10,000. Police picked up Rajasekhar who confessed during interrogation that he had killed Satyanarayana, and later sold his scooter to Ramakrishna. Rajasekhar said he had borrowed Rs 70,000 from Satyanarayana and when the latter insisted on repayment, he decided to get rid of him. On November 16, 2016, Rajasekhar along with his friends Akhil Kumar, M Akhil and M Perlu asked Satyanarayana to meet them near the cremation ground where they smashed his head with iron rods and later set him ablaze.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vzm-cops-solve-murder-mystery-after-five-years/articleshow/88058929.cms||---

South Bengal districts like West and East Midnapore, South and North 24 Parganas and Jhargram could start receiving showers on Friday and could be lashed by very heavy rain on Saturday and Sunday after the cyclone makes landfall. The rain could intensify on Sunday in Kolkata and the rest of south Bengal. Extensive damage to crops and property is being feared across coastal Bengal, said the RMC on Thursday. NDRF personnel have been deputed in seven districts, including Kolkata. CM Mamata Banerjee held a meeting at Nabanna with DMs of South 24 Parganas and has called for relief material and disaster management teams to be kept ready. The system, which formed as a low-pressure area on November 30, hovered over central parts of Andaman Sea and its neighbourhood on Thursday. It lay over southeast Bay of Bengal with the associated cyclonic circulation extending up to mid tropospheric levels on Thursday afternoon. It is likely to move west-northwestwards and concentrate into a depression over southeast adjoining east-central Bay of Bengal during the next 12 hours, said an RMC bulletin. It may move north-westwards and intensify into a cyclonic storm over central parts of Bay of Bengal in the next 24 hours, it said. Jawad may reach west-central Bay of Bengal the morning of December 4. Then it may move north-northeastwards. “A warning has been issued to farmers across the coastal areas to take precautions. Farms and crops across both Midnapore and South 24 Parganas could be affected. Sea condition will be very rough from the morning of December 4 and may continue to be dangerous for fishermen for the next 12 hours,” said deputy director-general of meteorology Sanjib Bandopadhyay. The West Midnapore district administration has asked farmers to remove paddy from fields. Two NDRF teams will be sent. Paddy and potato farmers have started chopping crops. An alert has been sounded for tourists and residents in and around Digha. “Equipment and manpower have been distributed,” said West Midnapore DM Purnendu Maji. Many trains have been cancelled by East Coast Railway.

---||Kolkata||Accused known in 91% child sexual abuse cases in West Bengal, says report||KOLKATA: In 91% cases in Bengal, it was a known person who had sexually abused children, the NCRB 2020 data revealed. In India, this rate is around 96%. In states like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, almost 100% of all accused arrested or named in FIRs in POCSO cases were known to the child. Days after TOI reported how a city court sentenced a 39-year-old driver for sexually assaulting his 15-year-old stepdaughter for three years, psychiatrists and child activists said it is time to fight the demons around rather than brush them under the carpet. In 1,399 of the 1,541 cases reported in 2020 in Bengal, where a minor was sexually abused, 109 turned out to be direct family members. A neighbour, relative or an authority figure known to the child was found involved in 1,139 cases. In142 cases, the accused was unknown. In Kolkata, of the 486 crimes against women in 2020, 198 were found to be related to POCSO sections. Three others were found to be murders, 51 missing children were deemed to have been kidnapped and six children became victims of trafficking. In most cases under these subheads, known people were involved. “In cases where both parents go out for work, the child is usually left with a neighbour or someone known. The child falls victim to someone with ill intentions,” said an officer. “While reporting of sexual crimes has gone up due to awareness, there is usually an attempt to underplay their enormity because in most cases, the accused is a relative, a neighbour or a person known to the child. A large number of children counselled by NGOs and cops last year did not report the harassment until the abuse was discovered by the parents,” said a prosecution lawyer of a city POCSO court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/accused-known-in-91-child-sexual-abuse-cases-in-state/articleshow/88058832.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

People close to Shubhanand said he was angry with the way senior Congress leaders in Delhi and Patna “ignored” his father when he was under medical treatment. They said CM Nitish Kumar, on the other hand, provided all necessary help to the family during Sadanand’s treatment in Delhi and Patna, including arranging air ambulance him. Shubhanand told this newspaper on Thursday that Nitish was like a father figure to him. “When the leadership of my father’s own party provided only lip service during his treatment, the CM stood with us like a rock. Nitish ‘chacha’ is striving hard for the welfare of people of the state and it will be a pleasure for me to work for the betterment of citizens under his leadership,” he added. AICC member Shambhu Singh Patel too said Shubhanand would soon join the JD(U) soon. Patel alleged that Congress leaders ill-treated Sadanand, who remained loyal to the party even during its worst periods. JD(U) district president Pancham Srivastava said the party would become strong with the joining of Shubhnand as his father was a well-known political leader and had personal rapport with people in the region. Sadanand had declined to contest the 2020 assembly election in the state citing his poor health. The Congress had then fielded his engineer son Subhanand from Kahalgaon. However, Shubhanand had lost to BJP’s Pawan Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sadanands-son-likely-to-join-ruling-jdu-soon/articleshow/88058888.cms||Kumar Rajesh

The Magh Mela authorities have also drafted a blue print to promote the use of biodegradable products of kulhad and dona patal among hundreds of religious, social organisations and individuals, who would set up their camps from January 14. District Magistrate (Magh Mela), Shesh Mani Pandey, told TOI, “We have decided to promote the use of kulhar and dona-pattal at thousands of camps to be set up on mela campus in the forthcoming Magh Mela. Authorities have chalked out an elaborate plan to promote the earthen tableware and for that, we would be holding interactive sessions with the heads of various akhara, religious, social and cultural organisations.” Pandey further added that these measures will surely help to create mass awareness about protecting the environment among lakhs of visitors who would be arriving to take a holy dip on the pious month of Magh. Seers and saints associated with Kinnar Akhara have already given a thumbs up to the idea and agreed to promote the use of kulhar and dona-pattal during mela period. MahamandleshwarSwami Kalyani Nand Giri of Kinnar Akhara said, “It’s a responsibility of each and every individual to protect the environment and by using kulhar and dona pattal, we would be able to do our bit, particularly at the banks of Ganga, where millions of devotees would be arriving at the 47 days long Magh Mela to take holy dips and seeking salvation.” Interestingly, authorities of various religious, and social organisations would be too bringing dona pattal from Jewaniya and adjoining village in trans-Ganga, wherein around 200 families are preparing bowls and plates made from leaves, for use. Authorities of religious organisations have too agreed to promote biodegradable containers like those made of leaves or clay, for food and beverages. Among things, the ‘dona’ and ‘pattal’ made of leaves of Sal andBanyan tress will be used to distribute prasad among devotees. In olden era, bowls and plates made up of Sal or Banyan tree leaves were used in majority of ashrams, social and religious spots, to serve food items and prasad, among devotees. Pujya Guru Ji of Om Namay Shivya organisation, said that major section of pilgrims and devotees, who arrive from far flung states, are very environment friendly and usually prefer biodegradable products to have food and beverages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/magh-mela-to-promote-environmental-awareness-distribute-prasad-beverages-in-kulhar-dona-pattal/articleshow/88058070.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Farmers get only Rs 67cr from PM crop insurance||Aurangabad: Farmers in the district — against a total of Rs 264 crore contributed for Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana crop insurance — have so far received a meagre amount of Rs 67 crore towards compensation for crop damages, while a sum of Rs 20 crore will be disbursed in another few days. Officials from the agriculture department said the actual compensation received by the farmers in the district will be calculated only after yield estimation for maize and cotton is done. As per data, around 22% of the sowing area in the district is covered with maize, while 60% area is under cotton. A total of 5.69 lakh farmers from the district had opted for covering 2.50 lakh hectare of their farm under this crop insurance scheme. Between July 23 and August 15, there were no rainfall and this was followed by excessive rains in the following months.  As a result, the agriculture department received 2.68 lakh complaints, out of which 1.80 lakh were found to be legitimate. Considering the complaints, we invoked the mid-season adversity clause due to which Rs 47 crore has been sanctioned and Rs 24.35 crore has been received as compensation by the farmers. Agriculture superintendent Tukaram Mote said, “Farmers have contributed Rs 26.23 crore towards payment of premium, while the state and the central governments contributed the remaining amount, making the total contribution to Rs 264 crore. So far, this year, the farmers have received a total compensation of Rs 67 crore while another Rs 20 crore will be released soon.” Claims for black gram and green gram crops have been forwarded and farmers are expected to get compensation of about Rs 20 crore in another month’s time. Authorities said considering the number of weather-related events, there has been considerable crop loss in the district. Agriculture supervisor Balasaheb Joshi said difference between threshold yield and actual yield will be calculated to find out average yield before crop insurance claims are finalised for the two major crops — maize and cotton.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/farmers-get-only-rs-67cr-from-pm-crop-insurance/articleshow/88058065.cms||Mohammed Akhef

As per common practice, the bail application is moved before the district court first, and in case of its rejection, it is challenged before the high court with a request to release the applicant on bail. Significantly, along with bail plea, the students have also moved an application seeking transfer of trial of their case from Agra to Mathura on the plea that “the entire bar of Agra judgeship is not ready to appear before the court on their behalf and defend the case.” The three Kashmiri students — Arsheed Yusuf, Inayat Altaf Sheikh and Showkat Ahmed Ganai — all studying at an engineering college in Agra, were arrested on October 27, 2021 by Agra Police. They were booked under 124A (sedition), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups) and 505 (1)(B) (with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and 66-F of the Information Technology Act for allegedly sending WhatsApp messages “against the country” after the match. Seeking transfer of the case, an application filed by them also takes the plea that “if the instant case of the applicant is not transferred to Mathura district court, the accused/applicants cannot contest their case and also cannot take proper legal assistance and in absence of that they would remain behind the bars for an unlimited period”. In their petition, they have also claimed that they are being given constant threat to their lives, if they try to contact any member of the Agra Bar Association. Their application will be taken up by the court shortly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/3-jk-students-booked-on-seditioncharge-directly-move-hc-for-bail/articleshow/88058073.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

Hamilton said it was extraordinary to see many laurels brought by students during the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic. “Universities shed light on truth. They offer insight, spread the light of understanding by opening up new perspectives and cultures. Every day they punch holes through the darkness of ignorance,” said Hamilton, while addressing hundreds of students at Amaravati during the first convocation of SRM university’s Andhra Pradesh campus. Hamilton said people are living in an atmosphere where a rigorous debate has lost its ground to the comfort of listening to those who agree. But only universities provide some respite in shedding light on truth and nurture skilled and principled professionals, he added. Director of National Science Foundation, USA, Dr Sethuraman Panchanathan, presented his mantra of success for every student, which includes honour, respect and the courage to stay positive. “Lastly, compassion is the factor to bind all these together,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/higher-edu-in-covid-era-is-critical-need-of-hour-nyu-prez/articleshow/88058982.cms||---

Police are investigating the case. The SP said Champa Devi got married to Lacharam Jat six years ago. The husband works at a hotel in Pachpadra and he was at Pachpadra at the time of incident while her in-laws were working in the field.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/woman-poisons-2-kids-self-in-barmer-dist/articleshow/88059579.cms||---

Currently it has an installed capacity of 0.2 million tonnes per annum and is adding another 0.2 mt capacity to add new products to its portfolio. “The plan is to further increase the installed capacity to 1 mt per annum by 2025. We may further invest Rs 75-100 crore to expand capacity. We have one plant in Medak district. We will focus on the existing plant rather than expanding to new locations in the near term,” he said. Currently, with the enhanced capacity of 0.4 mt per annum, the company is looking at increasing its market share to 7 to 8% from the current level of 3 to 4%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/radha-smelters-eyes-rs-1000-cr-turnover-in-fy22/articleshow/88058986.cms||---

Anish Khan Pathan was booked by the crime branch for raping a 12-year-old girl in the city in 2018. She became pregnant and delivered a baby girl. Pathan had fled to Uttar Pradesh but the cops arrested him after some days.  “Pathan, a rickshaw driver, used to ferry the girl to her school. He took advantage of the minor girl and raped her once at her home when she was alone. He even then threatened her with dire consequences if she revealed it to her parents,” said public prosecutor Narendra Makwana.  “Pathan later took the rape survivor to a hotel and raped her again. Her parents learnt about the sexual assault when the girl became pregnant,” Makwana added. Pathan was booked under IPC section 376 for rape and under the POCSO Act too. The court observed that if Pathan is given light punishment, it may encourage him to commit such crimes,” Makwana added.  The court sentenced Pathan to life imprisonment under section 5 (J) (2) and 5 (L) of the POCSO Act along with Rs one lakh fine. If Pathan doesn’t pay the fine, his sentence would be increased by five more years. The court also sentenced Pathan to 20 years of imprisonment and Rs 50,000 fine under section 376 of IPC. Pathan was also sentenced to two years of imprisonment for criminal intimidation along with 20 years of imprisonment under section 3 (A) of POCSO Act. “All the sentences will run concurrently, and if Pathan deposits the fines imposed on him in the court, it will be given to the rape survivor as compensation. Also, the court has ordered to give Rs seven lakh compensation to the girl under Gujarat Victim Compensation Scheme 2019 and POCSO Act,” Makwana said.

Neither did it ask the top court to linger on the proceedings. “That is the government's only contribution," he said, adding that the temple work will be completed by December 2023. “Generous donations for the temple have been received from all sections of the society and from all religious institutions. The VHP will not be surprised if the amount is around Rs 1,000 crore,” he said. Rai, who was in Haridwar to take the seers' blessings and brief them about the progress in the temple's construction, gave a detailed history of the Ram temple movement which led to the Supreme Court's final unanimous verdict on November 9, 2019, in favour of the temple.  "A grand temple is coming up in Ayodhya with funds provided by over 11 crore donors from across the country representing all sections of the society. The best engineering brains in the country are involved in the work being done by Larsen Toubro and Tata Consultant Engineers (TEC). It will be a marvel of engineering when the work is completed," Rai said, adding that Ram Lala will be there in the grand temple's sanctum sanctorum by the end of 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/funds-for-ram-temple-construction-will-exceed-rs-1k-cr-says-ram-janmabhoomi-trust-secy/articleshow/88080024.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

Similarly, the cyclists, who had violated the rules at the crossing, were asked to attend a 20-minute audio-visual demonstration comprising unedited CCTV grabs that showed the faults of some cyclists, who met with accidents in the city. At Parama Island, cops asked bus drivers to halt at designated stops, follow signal lines and take bus bays. Those, who obeyed the norms, were given chocolates while the flouters were not only fined but also asked to man the crossing along with traffic cops on the next day. The first two days of the two-month long traffic safety awareness drive during winter turned the spotlight on the errant cyclists, pedestrians and bus drivers on the Bypass. The police action came after 18 people had been killed in accidents in November — seven of them met with bus accidents while the rest died after being hit by cars and three-wheelers. “We have started a regular road safety awareness drive since December and January are accident-prone months in the city. All the 25 traffic guards will have to organise awareness campaigns twice a week in these two months. Our drive has started with the Bypass where the number of vehicles has gone up these days. The violators are being spotted and roped in for traffic management so that they can understand their mistakes and will follow traffic rules henceforth,” said DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha. At the Beliaghata Traffic Guard office near Mathpukur, Sonai Naskar, a cyclist, said that he had no idea about how a stop-line violation could lead one to a fatal accident. “The video footage gave me a clear view on this while the repeated announcements in the past two weeks at the Chingrighata crossing did not make me realise anything. From now on, I shall be careful,” said Naskar, a resident of Sukanta Nagar. He was caught for flouting traffic rules while rising a cycle with four jars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/learn-as-you-teach-module-for-traffic-violators-at-chingrighata/articleshow/88059006.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kolkata||ER applies for CRS nod to Tallah ROB’s girder-launch||Kolkata: Eastern Railway (ER) has applied to the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) for inspection and subsequent approval of Tallah bridge’s girder launching. The Rs 350-crore bridge reconstruction project can meet its April 2022 deadline only after the CRS clears launching of the spans over railway tracks. CRS, the autonomous body under the ministry of civil aviation, approves any new railway project in India. The new Tallah bridge is actually a road overbridge (ROB) under Eastern Railway’s ambit. A 240m section of the 750m bridge will stand over the Tallah railway tracks operated by ER. The old Tallah bridgewas razed in April last year because it had worn beyond repair. In May, contractors L&T started construction work for the bowstring-arch steel four-lane bridge. The state public works department, the implementing agency, is chasing an April 2022 deadline to complete the project. On Thursday, PWD minister Moloy Ghatak, PWD principal secretary, Onkar Singh Meena, and his team of officials, railway engineers and other agencies inspected the site to review the work progress. A senior PWD official said, “We did a thorough inspection of the site. All issues have been resolved. The formalities required to apply for CRS clearance have been completed. The railways have submitted the application to the CRS.” TOI on November 22 reported that IIT-Madras has given its seal of approval to the design and scheme of girder-launching over railway tracks. “After vetting and certificate from IIT-Madras, ER sent the CRS application, paving the way for the crucial girder-launching across the railway tracks,” the PWD official said. Last month, Ghatak had in the state Assembly promised the bridge’s commissioning by April 2022. “We are now in the last phase of construction . The CRS inspection and clearance may come any time now, the steel girder-launching will start soon after,” a PWD engineer said. The new bridge will rest on six piers each on the Shyambazar and the Dunlop end and another six in the middle that will support the 240m deck slab over the railway tracks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/er-applies-for-crs-nod-to-tallah-robs-girder-launch/articleshow/88059015.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

According to SP (Rural) Anil Kayal, a minor girl from village Aasarlai under Dechu police station in Jodhpur, a student of class 9, petitioned in his office that her parents have been preparing to marry her off on December 13. She stated that she is just 15 years old and her family members were marrying her off against her wish. “I am studying in class 9 and I do not want to get married. Kindly arrange for my stay at a women’s shelter home,” she prayed in her petition to SP Kayal. Immediately after receiving her complaint, Kayal ordered the SHO (Dechu) Rajesh Bishnoi to investigate the matter. He obtained the documents from her school to ascertain her age and found her to be born on May 1, 2006. After the confirmation that the girl was a minor, police issued notices to her family members and bound them against the marriage. Moreover, granting the wish of the girl, police informed the Child Welfare Committee and arranged to get her accommodated at the women’s shelter home. Kayal appreciated the girl for her courage to take a stand against a social evil and to have complained to the police. “The entire action was accomplished by the police in just 5 hours of her complaint,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/15-year-old-girl-writes-to-sp-against-kin-marrying-her-off-rescued/articleshow/88059610.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Accessible Ahmedabad? Not quite, say activists||Ahmedabad: In December 2015, the Accessible India campaign was launched to ensure that the persons with disabilities (PwDs) don’t have to face barriers – either physical or in cyberspace. The new rules came into place and government offices were asked to lead by example. The next year, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act was launched, making accessibility a right and not charity towards PwDs. Six years after Accessible India and five years after the RPwD Act, what’s the status of accessibility? City-based activists are not satisfied. Samir Kakkad, founder of Akhil Hindustani Vikalang Sangathan, said there’s not much of a change. “I have been writing an average of two emails a month to the authorities to make facilities accessible. While the RTOs and police offices are often found not following the rules, the apathy towards access was observed when a department – directly associated with welfare of the PwDs – was found to have converted a toilet for the disabled into a storage space,” he said. Darshita Shah, a national award winning disability rights activist, said she had to cancel her admission at a city college as the classroom was on the third floor and there was no elevator. “What kind of accessibility are we talking about when we have ramps as high as a mountain built only to show inclusivity? One rarely finds tactile tiles or railings for the visually impaired,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/accessible-ahmedabad-not-quite-say-activists/articleshow/88067004.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Kolkata||HC asks state to file report on health of Maidan horses||Kolkata: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), an NGO, has moved the Calcutta High Court, seeking a ban on horse-drawn carriages around Victoria Memorial after their survey revealed that most of the horses were bruised, ill and did not have proper food. PETA has also urged the court to allow it to treat the ailing horses and foals. The HC has asked the state for a detailed report by January 18 on the health of the horses and whether the horse-carriage drivers have licences. A division bench of Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj is expected to hear the matter after that. PETA said that for a month from July 14, 2021, a four-member team of experts examined 80 horses at the Brigade Parade Grounds and those below the Nivedita Setu flyover. They found most of the horses had injuries from traffic accidents. The expert team found that among the 80 horses examined, 65 had “sore” body conditions and were thin. The report also revealed that 80% of these horses had below-normal red blood cell count and blood haemoglobin level. Most of them were anaemic. The PETA petition said that the horse-drawn carriages weighed 1,000-kg each while the driver and the passengers added further to the weight. The petition mentioned that horses got injured while dragging this weight. The horses are left to feed on grass and kept in cold, damp places amid their own urine and faeces without any shed, said the petition. It also cited a 2013 study, which said around 60% of the horses in the Victoria Memorial area were suffering from lameness for being forced to walk on hard surface roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hc-asks-state-to-file-report-on-health-of-maidan-horses/articleshow/88059039.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Mangaluru||Mangaluru buses to get electronic ticket issuing machines||MANGALURU: Dakshina Kannada Bus Owners Association (DKBOA), which introduced ‘Chalo’ prepaid cards for passengers in the city, will introduce electronic ticket issuing machines (ETIM) that allow passengers to get tickets by tapping the prepaid cards. Daily commuters may tap the card on the machine, at the door of the bus, to avail tickets. Machines have already been installed in three city buses on Route number 27, between State Bank and Mangaladevi, which are owned by former president of DKBOA, Dilraj Alva. Alva told TOI that the association has plans to introduce ETIMs in all city buses, in a phased manner. “We have introduced ETIMs on a pilot basis in three buses. Passengers need to just tap their Chalo Cards, a pre-paid card introduced for city bus passengers by the association a year ago, on the machine. In the ETIM, passengers need not ask for a ticket from conductors, as the machines are fixed at the doors. Currently, the machines are installed in the State Bank- Mangaladevi route buses that have only one stage, with a fare of Rs 12. We are working on the prototype to introduce more stages in the ETIMs, so that it can be used in all the buses,” Alva said. Amrith Mayya, Chalo Card operation manager, said the Chalo Card was introduced in association with a bank. “The card is used as a wallet to travel in the city buses. After obtaining a Chalo card by giving KYC to the bank, passengers may recharge the wallet for cashless travel in the city. At present, conductors are using a hand-held device to issue tickets through a Chalo Card. With the ETIMs, passengers can tap the card and avail tickets by themselves, without the conductor’s help,” he said. “To introduce more stages in the ETIMs, GPS technology may be used, so that the machine will issue tickets and deduct the amount, based on the entry and exit location,” he said. Jayasheela Adyanthaya, president of the DKBOA, said that the initial response to the ETIM technology was good. “The technology will be introduced in more buses in future,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/city-buses-to-get-electronic-ticket-issuing-machines/articleshow/88058123.cms||Vinobha K T
---||Mumbai||Unlock food truck funds for other freebies: Corporators to BMC||MUMBAI: With the BMC yet to come out with a food truck policy for the city, corporators want the BMC to allow them to divert the Rs 12 crore earmarked for food trucks to purchase other freebies, like sewing machines and tablet computers, for distribution ahead of the civic elections early next year. Civic officials said that of the Rs 12 crore, Rs 3 crore was utilised for buying food trucks in Byculla for Shiv Sena corporator Yashwant Jadhav, who also heads the civic standing committee, and around Rs 9 crore still remains in the kitty. TimesViewThe BMC has stopped distribution of food trucks due to lack of a uniform policy. Now corporators want funds to be spent on other kinds of freebies to appease voters on the eve of the civic elections. At a time when the BMC is facing a cash crunch, it is surprising to see it go on a spending spree, using public funds to splurge on handouts ranging from computers and jute bags to food trucks and tablet PCs. It must at least ensure that the distribution is monitored by a transparent method so that beneficiaries are those genuinely in need.“Many corporators have sought permission to let them divert the food truck procurement funds to buy other freebies, like sewing machines, for distribution before the civic election code of conduct kicks in. If this is not done, then the funds will lapse,” said a senior civic official. “A proposal in this regard has been moved,” the offical added. Additional municipal commissioner (city) Sanjeev Kumar said the proposal was still “under process”. “It has not been finally decided yet,” he Kumar said. In October, in a setback to a chunk of Shiv Sena corporators, the BMC had stayed the distribution of food trucks as freebies by corporators. The BMC’s planning department had issued a circular directing all wards to not distribute any food trucks bought from civic funds, citing lack of a comprehensive policy for food trucks in the city. With the Sena miffed at the circular to stop distribution of food trucks, BMC chief Iqbal Chahal had held a meeting with civic officials and traffic police on drafting a food truck policy for Mumbai. The plan was to place food trucks, that have no-objection certificates from traffic police and transport department, at 50 locations in the city. The policy is still awaited. “The BMC must not let the money earmarked for food trucks lapse; it must be utilised for other items,” said Samajwadi Party corporator Rais Shaikh. “If there was no policy, the BMC should not have made any provision for food trucks. This just shows that they are making budgetary provisions without application of mind.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-unlock-food-truck-funds-for-other-freebies-corporators/articleshow/88060567.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

To take the 2.1km stretch, cyclists will need to walk down the culvert over Moila Khal and then the pavement between Captain Bheri and Chingrighata via Majherpara. At a time when the entire stretch of EM Bypass has found a mention on the list of 71 roads, where cycling is completely or partially banned, cops said they have extended a temporary relief to hundreds of cyclists from the Tangra and Topsia side, who find it difficult to reach Chingrighata and cross over towards Salt Lake. “For a temporary solution, a bicycle lane has been carved out of the service road. We have put up notice boards to inform cyclists about the lane. The installation of barricades for safety is almost over to ensure that motorists don’t face any problem due to the movement of cycles,” said an officer from Beliaghata traffic guard. Cops hope that the temporary cycle track will bring in discipline on the stretch, for which CM Mamata Banerjee had pulled up both Kolkata Police and Bidhannagar Police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cycle-track-carved-out-on-bypass-stretch/articleshow/88059047.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

An assistant PSI of the same police station, who had accepted Rs70,000 on behalf of the female officer, allegedly pushed an ACB official and drove away with the amount on a motorcycle. An officer from the ACB said that a woman has filed an application against the complainant in the bribery case and alleged sexual assault by him. “The application was being probed by the woman PSI. She had demanded Rs1 lakh from the complainant for not registering a case under section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against him,” the officer said. He said that the ACB on November 25 and November 26 had verified the demand. At that time, the assistant PSI had demanded the money on behalf of the woman PSI and later agreed on Rs70,000. “We laid a trap in Sangvi on Thursday. When the assistant PSI found that he had been caught red-handed accepting the bribe, he pushed our officer and drove away in a reckless manner,” said the ACB officer, adding, “We have arrested the woman PSI.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Trees cut, hills ruined along Vihar lake for cycling track||Mumbai: Massive dumping of debris, earth and stones has been carried out within less than 100 metres of Vihar lake, one of the two lakes within the city supplying drinking water. There has also been massive cutting of trees and hills close to the lake even as a new concrete road is being laid with storm water drains, a concrete wall on the lakeside and a Gabian wall lining the hills that have been cut. The road, which is being developed, is part of environment minister Aditya Thackeray's ambitious 39km cycling track from Mulund to Wadala along the Tansa water pipeline. When TOI visited the site, work was underway on the Tulsi water mains but not on the road. The Bombay high court has ordered a stay on the cycling track. Large mounds of debris, earth and stones can be seen at different places close to the lake as also huge boulders, clearly indicating that hills have been cut. The area is visibly a forest as there are a large number of trees on the hills. The hills slope down towards the lake. Monsoon streams flowing down the hills fill the lake. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal forwarded TOI’s queries on the activities (and whether the BMC had requisite permissions) to hydraulic engineer Ajay Rathore, who in turn forwarded the queries to the assistant engineer in charge of Vihar lake. While TOI was promised the BMC would revert after a site inspection, there has been no response yet. G Mallikarjuna, chief conservator of forests, Sanjay Gandhi National Park, said the area is not part of the forest department’s land. “The Forest Conservation Act is very stringent. No part of the work is being carried out on forest land,” he said. To reach this road, if coming through Aarey Colony, one has to reach Saki Vihar road and turn left just where the Tulsi water main goes over the road. Entry to the road is from Kailash Nagar, a slum to the rear of Hotel Renaissance. The road runs close to Powai lake for a short distance and then between Pipeline Road and the back of IIT, and further up along Vihar lake going towards Tembipada in Bhandup. To the rear of Hotel Renaissance, the road branches off into a deer park. This arm is still incomplete. The new road is for around 2.5km. At a couple of places iron grills with a cyclist motif have been put up as also an arch across the road. “The hills have been cut to create the new road adjacent to an existing rail track used by the water supply department to attend to leakages on the trunk mains. The hills have been cut in step form so that seeing from the road one does not realise the actual height of the hills,” said Amrita Bhattacharjee of the Aarey Conservation Group which is opposed to the cycling track. Environmentalist Debi Goenka said the area is certainly part of the eco-sensitive zone. He said cutting trees and demolishing parts of hills will only increase siltation in the lake. He said constructing a road along the city’s drinking water lake is a bad idea. “It will eventually lead to the destruction of the lake and the city will need a second desalination plant,” he said. TIMES VIEW: Promoting cycling to work or for leisure has become a worldwide phenomenon and it is certainly good for the environment. To introduce a cycling track by destroying the environment, which will impact the city adversely, is not a fine idea. One at the cost of the other is never a good proposition. Discussion and debate help push forth sustainable ideas. The area around Vihar lake must be restored and conserved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-trees-cut-hills-ruined-along-vihar-lake-for-cycling-track/articleshow/88046923.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Nashik||Aurangabad: Three builders booked for cheating, forgery||Aurangabad: Three leading builders have been booked by city police on charges of cheating and forgery after they allegedly forged maps and submitted them in different government offices for obtaining favourable orders and opinions. As per complaint lodged by 40-year-old contractor Bhagwan Gorde, the cheating was aimed at usurping prime land situated in Satara area of the city. Police are also wondering what prevented the government departments like CIDCO and Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), who have allegedly been duped by the trio, to not lodge a complaint. Gorde, in his complaint, has stated that the trio allegedly hatched a conspiracy and forged a map of gat number 220. The same map was submitted to the CIDCO and AMC. The complaint states that the suspects misled the land record officials by systematically submitting the map and obtained a favourable decision, and used the same for selling the land to three other accomplices. The contractor has stated that all the suspects, including those who purchased the land, were aware of the fact that the maps were forged. To substantiate his complaint, Gorde has cited the documents, including maps, submitted by the suspects in all the three offices in the month of September 2020. The complaint stated that the suspects allegedly cheated the government departments by preparing and submitting forged documents. Satara police inspector Surendra Malale said prima facie it appears to be a case of cheating committed in four months between September and December 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/aurangabad-three-builders-booked-for-cheating-forgery/articleshow/88059050.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The project was sanctioned in September, and will be held within the next three months at Pilikula’s Urban Haat. Aflah Hasan VP, handicrafts promotion officer, told TOI that the government has agreed to sanction funds to the Pilikula Development Authority for conducting Gandhi Shilp Bazaar and other activities at Pilikula Urban Haat. The events were expected to be conducted by December, but got delayed because Pilikula Park was upgraded to Pilikula Development Authority recently, and certain formalities are pending. “We are now confident of holding Gandhi Shilp Bazaar in the next three months, as the project has been sanctioned for this financial year. The last time a similar event was held, was in 2016,” he said. The government has also sanctioned a craft bazaar and an exhibition, which will be held within the next three months. Aflah Hasan said that handicrafts have a huge potential, as they hold the key for sustaining not only the existing set of millions of artisans, but also for the increasingly large number of new entrants in craft activities. Gandhi Shilp Bazaars are organised based on an annual roster, based on important fairs, festivals, prominent cities, historical and tourist places. These bazaars will be organised at least once a year in the same location, at a fixed time. India has immense market potential for handicraft products. Marketing events, held across the country, provide a direct marketing platform to handicraft artisans, self-help groups and entrepreneurs. These platforms assist artisans to sell their products directly to the buyers, and also help them to establish market linkages for long-term business. The duration of Gandhi Shilp Bazaars are seven to 10 days, and they accommodate 50-100 stalls. The Handicrafts Service Centre in the city looks after 10 districts of the state, and conducts various activities and training programmes for the promotion of handicrafts. An approximate 8,000 artisans have registered themselves, and currently a two-month training programme on embroidery craft is being held at Chitradurga. The state is lagging behind in terms of support given to artisans and handicrafts, when compared to Kerala and Tamil Nadu, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/gandhi-shilp-bazaar-to-be-held-at-pilikula-urban-haat/articleshow/88058176.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

While last year's November peak was 3,769 MW, the figure stood at 3,631 MW for the month the previous year. Similarly, the city's peak power demand this October, at 5,388 MW, was higher than the previous two years - it was 4,769 MW in October 2020 and 4,553 in 2019. Officials of power distribution companies have already warned that Delhi's peak power demand this winter season could surpass that of 2019 (5,021 MW) and 2020 (5,343 MW) and go up to 5,400 MW. A BSES spokesperson said power distribution companies are geared up to ensure supply remains uninterrupted for about 46 lakh consumers during the winter and are putting in place adequate arrangements, accurate forecast and a robust distribution network. "In case of any unforeseeable contingency, BSES discoms will buy short-term power from the exchange, which is available at economical rates," said the spokesperson. BSES has made long-term agreements with including hydro- and gas-based power generating stations. It is also receiving more than 440 MW of solar power from Solar Energy Corporation of India, 250 MW of wind power from a plant and 25 MW from another waste-to-energy set-up.

The tournament involving India, Thailand, Gabon and Nepal was scheduled to kick-off from December 12 in Kochi, but with rising fears over the new Omicron Covid-19 variant, nobody wants to take a chance. “The tournament won’t happen in December,” a senior AIFF official told TOI on Friday. “It’s not a good idea to have the tournament at this time with fears everywhere and changing scenarios. Teams like Thailand and Gabon are also very concerned, so we decided it was best to put off the tournament. If in the next 10-12 days things stay calm, we may have the tournament in January.” India are preparing for the AFC Women's Asian Cup 2022 at home, starting January 20 in Mumbai. The team coached by Thomas Dennerby has played nine friendlies in the last couple of months, including three games in Brazil against the hosts, Chile and Venezuela. They were now scheduled to play three more games in the four-nation tournament in Kerala, but have had to change plans. “Everyone was keen on this tournament, including the (Kerala) state government. We have time till the first week of January to organise this, but a lot will depend on how things shape up. If teams come here and they have to undergo institutional quarantine, that will not be ideal. Besides, if they come here and get stuck, it will be problematic,” said the official. The AIFF is now putting together a 20-member All-Star team which will be picked from the ongoing national championships in Kerala for friendlies against the Asian Cup 2022 probables. The women’s team is expected to arrive from Brazil on Saturday and will head to Kerala. “We are looking at an All-Star team from the nationals. Our scouts are already there, watching the games, while Dennerby will be there for semi-finals and final. He was keen to watch the players. This gives everyone a chance to prove themselves and possibly win a place (in the team),” said the official. India are already hampered with the absence of star striker Bala Devi and midfielder Sangita Basfore, both of whom have had surgeries for ACL. Dennerby has said the doors of his team will remain open till they submit the final list of 23 players to AFC, latest by January 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/covid-19-plays-spoilsport-as-aiff-puts-off-four-nation-womens-tournament-in-kerala/articleshow/88080077.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Earlier, the police had arrested the woman’s brother on the charges of the murder. According to the police, on November 26, a youth, Shabeer, was shot dead by the suspect, Aleem, after he had opened fire from a country-made pistol. "The woman identified as Waleema was not willing to return to her in-law's house due to some dispute. On November 26, a village panchayat was hearing the matter and ordered Waleema and her family to return to her in-law's house. However, her brother and Waleema were unwilling to return. Thus, when both were returning home, a man identified as Shabeer, who was in the crowd stopped them. In the jostling, Aleem opened fire in which Shabeer was killed. We had arrested Aleem on the same day," said a senior police official at Kaman police station. The family lodged a murder case in which they accused Aleem and his sister Waleema of murder and its conspiracy. The official said, "She is part of the criminal conspiracy of murder, thus she has been arrested under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal code."

---||Mumbai||Omicron suspects in Maharashtra now 28; most from Mumbai seem safe||MUMBAI: The count of Omicron suspects in Maharashtra on Thursday went up to 28, including 10 from Mumbai. Their samples have been sent for genome sequencing to check for the mutated virus. The results should be available next week. BMC officials are hopeful because the basic RT-PCR test on six of the 10 city suspects found the S gene (in an indirect way, ruling out Omicron which doesn’t have the S gene); results of the remaining will be available soon. Covid task force member Dr Rahul Pandit said the detection of two cases in Bengaluru doesn’t mean the Covid situation would change overnight. “There is a lot of vigil and testing going on right now. It could take a month or two for the variant to spread widely,'' he said. Maharashtra is carrying out dual surveillance: screening travellers at the airport since midnight of November 30 and tracing and testing all those who have returned from overseas since November 1. As on Thursday, 861 travellers were subjected to RT-PCR test in the state, with 28 coming positive. Of these, 25 are international travellers and three are their contacts. Most are from Mumbai, Pune and Thane. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said 12 of the 28 positive samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune and the rest to BMC’s Kasturba Hospital laboratory at Chinchpokli. “All are asymptomatic, the majority are quarantined at home,” he said. Most are fully vaccinated, he added. In Mumbai, five new suspects were found on Thursday, taking Mumbai’s list to 10. Of these 10, nine are travellers and one is a contact of the patient who arrived from South Africa. BMC officials said five of the nine returnees had travelled from London, while the remaining four came from South Africa, Portugal, Mauritius and Germany. Four of them were in the process of getting admitted to Seven Hills Hospital, Andheri. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “The patients don’t have any symptoms. We detected S gene target failure in six, but we will wait for genome sequencing results to be sure,” he said. The five new suspect cases in the city include a 45-year-old returnee from London and a 38-year-old travelling from Germany. The others include a 66-year-old man who arrived from London on November 17, a 69-year-old who arrived from Portugal on November 25 and a 34-year-old man who came from London on November 13. The Bureau of Immigration has given a list of over 2,800 travellers who have arrived in the city from 40 countries. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer said 485 from the list have been tested with RT-PCR so far. Kakani said with the detection of two confirmed cases in Karnataka, home quarantine measures will be strictly enforced. The BMC had to send the sample of one of the new Mumbai suspects to NIV, Pune for sequencing as its fifth gene sequencing exercise has already begun. Kakani said the sample couldn't have been kept back for the next round.  “We should have our fifth genome sequencing results on Sunday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-omicron-suspects-in-state-now-28-most-from-city-seem-safe/articleshow/88059660.cms||Malathy Iyer

The viral disease is extremely contagious and can infect and even kill large parts of herds of animals like sheep and goats. This is the first time that a PPR case has been reported in the Dahod district. Officials said that the infected goat belonged to a man who rears animals for meat. The man got alarmed after one of his goats died after suffering from cough and cold for a couple of days along with loose motions. The man insisted that a test should be conducted to identify the ailment. The tests revealed that the goat was suffering from PPR. Animal husbandry officer Kamleshgiri Gosai said that the man whose goat had died was asked to keep his remaining goats in the shed itself and not take them out for grazing. “This has been done to ensure that if more goats are infected, they do not spread it to other goats outside,” he said. Gosai said that the remaining 26 goats in the shed were not showing any symptoms of PPR. He added that there was no need to press panic triggers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/1st-case-of-ppr-in-dahod-goat-dies-of-viral-disease/articleshow/88058517.cms||---

Sriramoju Haragopal, a heritage expert, said: “The mushroom rock at UoH, Kankan Banda (rock) at Basar and Hastalpur Gundu in Siddipet district should be preserved at all costs.” He said Kankan Banda in Basar stands on a well-stretched granite bedrock, which is like a cornerstone. In Hastalpur, the rock is a good example of a balancing stone. There are several such unexplored rocks in Mahbubnagar and other districts. There are several similarities between these rocks found in Telangana and those in Finland,” he explained. He said rocks take 160 million to 250 million years to form. “There is a greater need for scientific studies and preservation of these rocks,” he said. Supporting preservation of these rocks, former deputy director general of Geological Survey of India Chakilam Venugopal Rao said: “They should be declared as national or local geo heritage sites.

They have surely lost a couple of years as they could not attend school. As we received many queries about anger issues, frustration of parents and their inability to send children to schools, we decided to train parents to be teachers and share their learnings with others,” she said, adding that the initiative reached thousands of parents through social media. Dr Madhu Singh, director of BM Institute of Mental Health, said about 15% to 20% of children have stopped coming to school after the start of the pandemic. “Some have surely come back but their learning loss will have to be covered by the school and experts.

The Rapid RT-PCR facility commenced on August 18, and has tested 30,344 passengers as of November 29. Meanwhile, about four travellers arrived at MIA from specified at-risk countries, and they tested negative for the new Omicron variant as well as other variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Rapid RT-PCR is a mandatory test required by the UAE to enter the country. Dr Ashok H, district nodal officer for Covid-19, said that all those who tested positive during the rapid RT-PCR test were carrying with them a Covid-negative RT-PCR certificate, conducted 48 hours before they could board the flight. These travellers hail from Kodagu, Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Uttara Kannada, Kasaragod and Palakkad in Kerala. Out of 48 cases, more than half of the cases are from Dakshina Kannada (27 cases), followed by Kasaragod (9), Udupi (5), Uttara Kannada (4), Kodagu (2) and Palakkad (1). Ashok said that 2% of international passengers from non-high-risk countries would undergo the RT-PCR test after arrival at random at the airport, whereas passengers from countries at risk will undergo the rapid RT-PCR test after the immigration check at MIA. They will have to wait at the airport terminal till the results are out, which takes about 30 minutes. “So far, we have had four passengers in the last 14 days landing at MIA from high-risk countries. They have tested negative. For example if a passenger arrives from countries at risk to Mumbai and later to MIA being the final destination, the immigration department at Mumbai intimates the MIA authorities about the traveller. The test is conducted as per the ministry of health and family welfare directives issued recently.

---||Aurangabad||Sant Peeth finds more takers than its intake capacity||Aurangabad: The much-awaited Sant Peeth — started under the aegis of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada (Bamu) — has evoked good response from aspirants. The unique institute, aimed at imparting spiritual and cultural education among other knowledge, has received 132 applications against an intake capacity of 100. The university, however, has decided to accommodate all the applicants. The formal activities of the institute was rolled out on Thursday in the form of an interactive session between teachers and students enrolled for different courses. Bamu vice-chancellor Pramod Yeole said the institute was offering five certificate courses with an intake capacity of around 20 each. “The state government has cleared funds worth Rs 23 crore for the institute besides fund-flow of Rs 1 crore from the DPDC. We hope that the institute flourishes further and emerges as a movement in Maharashtra,” he said. “Sant Peeth, which is around 50-km from here in the historical town of Paithan, will soon get a library and a computer lab. We will not wait for any official funding and ensure that the desired facilities come at the expense of the university. Organized efforts would be taken for all possible growth of the institute,” he said, appealing teachers of the institute to take extra efforts during the formative years of Sant Peeth. Conceptualized around three decades ago, Sant Peeth remained on paper for years before the ruling the MVA government decided to set up the institute on a war-footing. The setting up of the facility witnessed further momentum after uproar by different stakeholders over shifting of the venue of the sports university from Aurangabad to Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sant-peeth-finds-more-takers-than-its-intake-capacity/articleshow/88059083.cms||---
---||Goa||Bottom-placed FC Goa look to open account against winless NorthEast United||Panaji: Is that really FC Goa at the bottom? It has been an unbelievable start for FC Goa in the Indian Super League (ISL). The most consistent side in the league with a record unbeaten run last season have tasted heavy defeats in their first two matches. After defeats against Mumbai City (3-0) and Jamshedpur FC (3-1), Goa will hope their struggles end as they face NorthEast United FC at Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Saturday. Goa are at the bottom of the standings with no points. If losing the opening game to defending champions Mumbai stunned Goa, their loss against Jamshedpur FC must have hurt Juan Ferrando’s side dearly. The Spanish coach, though, remains positive and hopes the seven-day break has helped his side rejuvenate. “It is a difficult game because you know we started the league without good results. It is important to control emotions,” Ferrando told TOI during an online interaction on Friday. NorthEast are also eyeing their first win of the season after defeats against Bengaluru FC and Chennaiyin FC. But Khalid Jamil, the only Indian head coach in the league, secured a point from their goalless draw against Kerala Blasters FC. NorthEast made it to the semi-finals last season and Ferrando knows they are no pushovers. “Hope his (Jamil) team trusts in his plans. I hope they are thinking of the best plan for us and then step by step, minute by minute, we will have more confidence on the pitch and not be scared about anything,” said Ferrando. Brandon Fernandes’ unavailability has left a big void in Goa’s midfield that has lacked ideas, even as Alberto Noguera has tried his best along with Glan Martins and captain Edu Bedia. Goa will have to continue in the same spirit until Brandon recovers. Airam Cabrera scored the team’s lone goal so far in the last game but Ferrando knows the Spanish striker needs time and can do better after joining the team late in pre-season. The move from their training ground in Salvador do Mundo to the Sesa FA ground in Sirsaim hasn’t helped the team. “This is an external problem,” said Ferrando. “Our energy is to prepare against NorthEast. I am very upset with what happened, because it was our centre of training. All the age group teams are working, and it is difficult for football and it is difficult for them. But we don’t lose any energy because it is not possible to do anything in our case.” NorthEast have been hit with a big blow as Uruguayan midfielder Federico Gallego has been ruled out of the season due to a knee injury suffered in the last game against Chennaiyin. Hernan Santana, though, is available while Jamil said he will have to take a closer look at Deshorn Brown who has returned to training. “The preparation was good. We are thinking positively. We are playing a stronger team. They (Goa) are also a well organised team and we have to be careful,” said Jamil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bottom-placed-fc-goa-look-to-open-account-against-winless-northeast-united/articleshow/88080130.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

Various communities gathered to celebrate the traditional festival marking the homecoming oflegendary warrior Madho Singh Bhandari exactly a month after Diwali. “The occasion marks the victory of Madho Singh Bhadari over Tibetan tribes,” said Surat Singh Rawat, a resident of Kharak village of Jaunpur block.  “As the festival coincides with the completion of winter harvest, the farming community enjoys Mangsir Bagwal to the fullest,” added Kundan Panwar, a resident of Pab village in Jaunpur. The celebrations commenced with women preparing traditional cuisines made of barnyard millet, with villagers performing dance forms such as “Raso” and “Tandi” amid beats of drums. Delicacies on the platter, during the festival, are swana, made of wheat and filled with horse gram, pakoras and chuda.  “The second day of the festival is called “Pakodiya”. Villagers first use ropes to bundle wood and then dance with the burning bundles,” Rawat said. “On the third and the fourth day, known as “Bhilundi” and “Bhaand” walnuts are distributed as prasad,” Panwar added.  “During “Bhaand” celebrations, a long rope is prepared using local bawai grass and kept in the courtyard like a coiled snake. It is worshipped as an incarnation of Nag Devta by the unmarried women and girls. Later the rope is used for a tug-of-war, in which men and women actively participate amidst drumbeats,” Rawat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/traditional-start-to-mangsir-bagwal-festival/articleshow/88080125.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Ahmedabad||PRL scientist studies ocean’s carbon sink potential||Bengaluru/Ahmedabad: Tropical rainforests are referred to as Earth’s lungs, absorbing massive amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and releasing oxygen in return. However, it turns out that our oceans have far bigger potential to store carbon dioxide or act as a carbon sink. A scientist from the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) is working on ways to store large amounts of carbon dioxide in the oceans as a way to tackle global climate change. The Earth’s oceans are the most important global carbon dioxide storage depot on the planet, absorbing more carbon dioxide than all of the rainforests combined, according to the Ocean Frontier Institute. They have taken in approximately a quarter of the CO2 released since the Industrial Revolution. Most of this is absorbed by phytoplankton, algae and bacteria-based microorganisms that absorb more carbon than all the plants on land. Arvind Singh, associate professor with PRL’s ocean science geo-science division, is examining the impact on the delicate ocean ecology if one enhances ocean alkalinity by adding minerals artificially to sequester atmospheric CO2 in the ocean. This is primarily done by adding widely available minerals like olivine, in a sustained way, so that the atmospheric CO2 reacts and settles on ocean surfaces as bicarbonates and carbonates. Singh said his research will examine the impact of enhanced ocean alkalinity on delicately interdependent carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient cycles of the ocean, which no one has investigated till date. “It will also study the effect of increased alkalinity on phytoplankton and other microorganisms,” he said. Singh, a physicist by training and biogeochemist by profession, won the Swarnajayanti fellowship instituted by the department of science and technology (DST) recently. “Singh has highlighted that we will need reservoirs that can store up to trillions of tonnes of CO2 emitted from industrial and other man-made emissions in the coming years,” a DST statement reads. Singh, according to DST, uses stable isotopes to understand elemental cycling in the ocean. His work blends stable isotopes, in-situ and satellite observations, microbiology, and statistical modelling to make quantitative estimates of carbon and nitrogen fluxes in the ocean.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/prl-scientist-studies-oceans-carbon-sink-potential/articleshow/88067114.cms||---

Jadhav had been suffering from an illness and had been undergoing treatment at a Hyderabad-based hospital, where he passed away. Not many were aware of his health challenges and, therefore, his demise came as a shock. He had been representing the Kolhapur city seat in the state assembly since 2019. From owning a small tool-making factory at Y P Powar Nagar in Kolhapur city to an industry with over 1,000 workers producing spare parts for many companies in India and abroad, to becoming a patron of football and finally an MLA, Jadhav’s progress has been phonomenal. Fondly known as ‘Anna’, Jadhav had contracted Covid twice and had survived. “His demise is not just a loss for the Congress, but the entire city. I spoke to him a few days ago and I was confident that he would recover. He has left a big void,” said Kolhapur guardian minister Satej Patil after paying respects to the mortal remains of the deceased MLA at the Congress Committee office.  The procession of his mortal remains passed through the streets of the city. Hundreds of citizens gathered alongside the roads to pay their respects. Leaders cutting across party lines attended the funeral procession. BJP state president Chandrakant Patil delivered his condolence message through video. “As soon as I landed at the Nagpur airport, I heard the news of Chandrakant Jadhav passing away. He will be remembered for his contribution to football. He thought about Kolhapur city’s development and used to run from pillar to post for the cause despite being a successful industrialist,” said Patil.  Uddhav, Ajit Pawar offer condolences  In a condolence message, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray remembered Chandrakant Jadhav as a politician with sportsman spirit. “Being a sportsperson himself, he lived with sportsmanship all his life. He balanced his roles as an industrialist and a politician. I am deeply in pain due to the loss,” said Thackeray.  Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar remembered him as a person with a close bond with the people of the city and said Jadhav’s demise is the loss for the MVA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mla-chandrakant-jadhav-57-passes-away-in-hyderabad/articleshow/88059095.cms||---

The city saw a steady drizzle throughout the day along with occasional heavy showers. There was nip in the air as the temperature dropped to 18 degree celsius by evening due to winds. Weather officials said that the city may receive light showers on Friday too. The low pressure in Arabian sea has led to unseasonal rains in central and south Gujarat over the last two days. While the urbanites are enjoying the showers by going out on long drives and savouring their favourite bhajiyas, farmers are worried a lot. Cotton sown on thousands of hectares in Vadodara and majority of other crops have suffered damage due to the unexpected rains. The farmer community is also staring at vegetable crop loss and expecting compensation from the government. Many in the city areas, though, headed towards Pavagadh – a popular tourist destination – to trek amid the misty weather. As the temperatures dipped, the Tibetan market on Kala Bhavan Ground witnessed a huge swell in the number of customers as people thronged the place to buy winter wear. If the weather remains overcast on the weekend, Barodians may head towards the nearby resorts to enjoy the cool climate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/rain-brings-chill-in-vadodara-air/articleshow/88058524.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||After 14 years of proven service, city doctor patents jaw prosthesis||Nagpur: It took 14 long years for city-based microvascular and plastic surgeon Dr Suresh Chaware to get his invention of temporo-mandibular joint prosthesis patented. Dr Chawre, who invented the prosthesis in 2007 for one of his patients, has been taking continuous follow-up with the patient for the last 14 years, and applied for a patent in 2019. Now a 26-year-old grown-up girl, the patient was just 11-year-old and could not open her mouth at all in 2007. This was because her temporo-mandibular joint, which enables humans to open their mouth and chew food, had got damaged. “She had been on a liquid diet for more than five years when her parents brought her to me,” recalled Dr Chawre. “The jaw joint is a small but very important one in our body. When this joint gets diseased because of ankylosis (bone formation at joint and fusion) or arthritis or trauma, the movement of the jaw gets restricted and the mouth does not open at all. The speech also gets affected. As the patient has to be on liquid diet, there are chances of malnourishment too. Total joint replacement is the only solution,” Dr Chawre explained. For big joints like knee and hip, joint replacement is a well-established treatment but when it comes to small joints like the temporo-mandibular joint, no satisfactory prosthesis or artificial joint was available in 2007. “Made in India prosthesis was not available. We had some imported options but they were not suitable for our people,” said Dr Chawre. Finally, he teamed up with VNIT professor Dr Abhay Kuthe, and orthopaedic surgeon Dr Vaibhav Bagaria. Together, they designed and manufactured the all new joint prosthesis. The patient had been diagnosed with bony ankylosis of the left temporo-mandibular joint, and the joint was totally damaged. Dr Chawre decided to undertake a total replacement of the joint with an Indian prosthesis designed by him. “I have been in continuous follow-up of the patient. Her mouth opening has maintained throughout these 14 years and she is pain free. The prosthesis is working finely, and it is nicely in its place,” said Dr Chawre. He is happy that his effort has finally got patented. Dr Chawre told TOI that it’s India’s first indigenously designed and manufactured prosthesis. Besides being cost effective, it fits the Indian jaws better. It has unique features of interlocking, which make its fixation rock solid and provides more stability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-14-years-of-proven-service-city-doctor-patents-jaw-prosthesis/articleshow/88059099.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Patna||CAG report flags Bihar’s rising debt||PATNA: The outstanding public debt of Bihar which mounted to Rs 1.93 lakh crore in 2019-20 has put strains on the state’s finances as it has led to debt repayment “burden” and the shrinkage in capital expenditure that is otherwise made to create assets as part of the infrastructure development, according to Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report for the 2019-20 fiscal tabled in the state assembly on Thursday. According to the report, the outstanding public debt of the state had increased from Rs 1.16 lakh crore in 2015-16 to Rs 1.38 lakh crore in the next fiscal, followed by Rs 1.56 lakh crore in 2017-18, Rs 1.68 lakh crore in 2018-19 and Rs 1.93 lakh crore in 2019-20. The growth rate of the outstanding public debt was in the range of 17.69% in 2015-16, 18.99% in 2016-17, 13.02% in 2017-18, 7.75% in 2018-19 and 14.48% in 2019-20, the report added. The growth rate of the state’s gross state domestic product (GSDP) in the corresponding financial years was 8.35%, 13.31%, 11.33%, 13.15% and 15.36%. “The growth rate of public debt is higher than the growth rate of GSDP during the year, which is not a good fiscal indicator,” the report noted. In what could increase the anxiety of the stakeholders, the volume of capital expenditure also showed decreasing trend during 2018-19 and 2019-20. The capital expenditure was Rs 23,966 crore in 2015-16, Rs 27,208 crore in 2016-17 and Rs 28,907 crore in 2017-18, and then began to show falling trend in the subsequent two fiscals –Rs 21,058 crore in 2018-19 and Rs 12,304 crore in 2019-20. Implicitly, the state had been spending less on the creation of assets. “The rate of growth of state public debt shows an increasing trend, but the growth rate of capital expenditure shows a negative trend for the last three years. This implies that the state’s public debt is not being utilized for capital creation,” the report said. Incidentally, even as the revenue receipts of the state increased from Rs 96,123 crore in 2015-16 to Rs 1.24 lakh crore in 2019-20, the rates of the revenue growth during the five fiscals were in the range of 22.58% in 2015-16, 9.84% in 2016-17, 11.23% in 2017-18, 12.22% in 2018-19 and (-) 5.74% in 2019-20. The CAG report noted the symptoms of the inbuilt downturn in the state’s economy as it noted, “The ratio of capital expenditure to capital receipts was showing a decreasing trend during the last three years, which had an impact on overall economic downturn.” The CAG report also noted that the state’s debt has become unsustainable in the backdrop of the “revenue deficit for the first time since 2008-09 and this has been compensated from public debt”. In between, the debt repayments went on increasing – Rs 38,508 crore in 2015-16, Rs 50,701.29 crore in 2016-17, Rs 41,357.18 crore in 2017-18, Rs 61,666.46 crore in 2018-19 and Rs 69,732.59 crore in 2019-20. The amount spent on interest repayment has also shown a similar trend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cag-report-flags-bihars-rising-debt/articleshow/88058945.cms||Abhay Singh

According to the India Meteorological Department bulletin, the maximum temperature was 11.4 degrees lower than normal temperature. At 16.9°C, the minimum temperature was 2.5 degrees higher than the normal. IMD forecast mentioned that there could be partially cloudy weather on Friday. However, with the impact of the trough created due to a cyclonic circulation in Arabian Sea weakening, the state may record drastic reduction in rainfall from Friday onwards. “It is the kind of weather where people fall sick. I have pulled my sweaters and jackets out of my closet. The drizzle and strong winds worsened the situation,” said Aakriti Parikh, a resident of Vejalpur. “Already, the city is plagued by dengue and chikungunya. Now, this kind of weather is likely to cause a spike in several seasonal ailments. It’s the second time this year that rains have returned after monsoon is officially over.” According to the state government, out of 252 talukas, 93 received at least 1mm rainfall. Dabhoi in Vadodara got the maximum 42mm rainfall, followed by 31mm in Bodeli in Chhota Udepur, 29mm in Tilakwada in Narmada, 21mm in Mangrol in Surat, and 19mm in Garudeshwar in Narmada. Around Ahmedabad, Daskroi received 6mm rainfall, Bavla 2mm and Dholera 1mm rains. “The rainfall will reduce gradually, and cloudy weather will give way to clearer skies in a day’s time. The temperature during the day is likely to increase and night temperature will decrease with change in wind direction,” said a Met department official. The officials are keeping an eye on another system forming in Bay of Bengal. However, they added that it may take some time before its projected route can be ascertained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/at-19-3c-its-sweater-weather-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/88059109.cms||---

The Nashik city police started taking various initiatives to ensure that bikers compulsorily wear helmets. From August 15, the city police implemented the no helmet no pertrol rule at petrol pumps. The data from the traffic department, however, shows that there were 18 road fatalities each in September and in October, which are among the highest deaths per month this year. The only month when road fatalities were more that these two months was in March when 22 people were killed. Between August 15 and October 31, there were 23 fatal accidents in which 21 people including four women were driving without helmet and died in the accidents. Taking this into account, the city police have now decided to start 12 counselling units in the city. The process of setting up these counselling units would start from December 1, said CP Deepak Pandey in his order issued on November 30. As per the order, the biker without helmet will undergo a two-hour counselling session. The police would keep the two-wheeler of the biker, and make him/her attend the counselling session. This will also have a 10 mark test involving questions related to importance of using helmet and general traffic rules. If the biker fails in the test, he or she would have to undergo the counselling for another two hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/nashik-city-helmet-compulsion-fails-to-check-road-accident-fatalities/articleshow/88059116.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said the BJP’s love for Mumbai was “fake” and it stayed mum when the International Financial Centre (IFC) was moved from Mumbai to Gujarat. Responding to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s statement that there was no UPA, Raut said there was no NDA either. Raut said while he didn’t know if Congress MP Rahul Gandhi was abroad or not, he said it was due to Covid-19 that the foreign trips of Prime Minister Narendra Modi had stopped. Raut also took a dig at the BJP over the visit of Gujarat chief minister Bhupendra Patel to Mumbai to promote the Vibrant Gujarat summit.  Raut tweeted: “When West Bengal CM met industrialists in Mumbai, BJP’s stomach got upset and alleged that she is here to rob industries from Maharashtra. Today, Gujarat CM is meeting the industrialists with half of his cabinet and organising a roadshow in Mumbai. Vibrant Gujarat by scraping Mumbai?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-slams-bjp-over-its-business-to-wb-comment/articleshow/88060619.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Dehradun||Dance of Democracy: U’khand polls curtain raiser||Dehradun: Since Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000, the Himalayan state has witnessed four elections – 2002, 2007, 2012 and 2017 – with the Congress and the BJP winning on two occasions each.  However, no party has been successful in forming successive governments in the state. While the first four elections were a direct fight between the BJP and the Congress, 2022 is set to be a triangular battle with AAP throwing its hat into the ring.  Employment, migration, health, education and poor facilities in the hills have remained the key issues, which will be dominant in the forthcoming polls with issues like Devasthanam Board also gaining traction in seats in Garhwal and farmers’ agitation in seats in Udham Singh Nagar. With 26.91 % votes, Congress got 36 seats in 2002 – the first election of Uttarakhand. The move of giving two CMs in a span of less than two years in the interim government backfired on the BJP. ND Tiwari went on to complete the five-year term in office and to date remains the only CM in Uttarakhand to complete a full term. Five years later, the BJP got 31.90 % votes and formed the government headed by Major General BC Khanduri (retd). Things moved in the direction of the Congress in 2012 as the party got 33.79 % votes to come to power. In its five-year term, Congress gave two CMs in the form of Vijay Bahuguna and Harish Rawat. Riding high on the Narendra Modi wave, the BJP registered the most emphatic win in 2017 by getting 46.5 % votes, winning 57 out of the 70 assembly seats of Uttarakhand. This time, the situation appears to be different. In its five-year term, the BJP has given three CMs to the state and in the wake of massive protests, had to withdraw decisions like the Gairsain commissionerate and Char Dham Devasthanam Board Act. The farmers’ protests, too. are likely to have a strong impact in districts of Udham Singh Nagar and Haridwar. Another key issue, which is being highlighted by the opposition, is the changes made by the Trivendra Singh Rawat-led BJP government in the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950. The Congress has alleged that the change has granted permission to people of other states to purchase desired size of land in the Himalayan state. During the ND Tiwari government, a limit of 500m was set for people of other states to purchase land and during the 2007-12 tenure of the BJP, it was brought down further to 250m. According to observers, the entry of AAP in political battlefield will also be interesting to watch. The Arvind Kejriwal-led party has made a strong pitch for the 2022 polls. Kejriwal, who has been visiting the state every month, has already announced, 300-unit free power supply if voted to power, government jobs for unemployed and a free pilgrimage scheme. By making an ex-serviceman a CM face in form of Col Ajay Kothiyal (retd), AAP has reached out to a high percentage of voters in a state that has a large number of serving and retired defence personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dance-of-democracy-ukhand-polls-curtain-raiser/articleshow/88058286.cms||Kautilya Singh

The main attraction of the event would be laser shows, which are themed around ‘Netru Indru, Naalai’, at Valankulam lake in the evenings. On Thursday, the organizing committee of vizha conducted a prelaunch event at Valanakulam bridge in the presence of district collector G S Sameeran and corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara. The committee is led by Young Indians, which has been organizing the event annually since its launch in 2009. While the vizha was held virtually last year because of the pandemic situation, various events have been planned for this year, as the Covid-19 cases have come down. Organizers said the events would be held mostly in open spaces by following all Covid-19 protocols. The vizha would feature marathon, cyclothon, sports events for disabled people, an event related to agriculture to promote organic farming, vertical farming and agriculture entrepreneurship, musical festival involving college bands, event to encourage startups and innovations, a cooking competition for homemakers and treasure hunt for electric vehicle owners. Corporation commissioner appreciated the organizers and said events like these were important to bring the city to limelight in the national arena. “Bigger cities such as Mumbai and Bengaluru have done similar events earlier to put themselves on the map. The events proposed by the organizers will make the city livelier.” Collector Sameeran said the event would help create an identity for the city. “It is laudable that the people of Coimbatore have been celebrating the event without any funding from the government for the past 14 years. The district administration and corporation will provide all possible support to make the event a grand success.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/laser-show-to-add-grandeur-to-coimbatore-vizha-in-jan/articleshow/88059723.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||65-yr-old latest casualty to leopard attack in Pauri||Dehradun: Just like previous year, there has been an increase in loss of human life due to leopard attacks this year too, with more than 20 people losing their lives. The latest to fall prey to a leopard attack was 65-year-old Jayanti Kandwal from Bhedgaon village of Duggada in Lansdowne forest division of Pauri. Frontline forest team said that the elderly woman was going to meet her grandson in Kotdwar on Wednesday evening. But couldn’t reach her destination. Worried family members started making frantic calls to the woman, but there was no response. Eventually, a search operation by pradhan and villagers was undertaken, fearing that she must have been attacked by a wild animal. The area is famous for its rich elephant and leopard population. And, it was barely 2km away from Jua village where her half-devoured body was found, barely 200m inside the forest. “We have alerted the villagers to stay away from the forest and no one can venture into the dense forest road in the evening. The woman was brutally attacked by the feline,” said Sandeep Singh, administration, Kotdwar. In another incident that took place on Thursday morning in Chanoda area of Someshwar, Almora, a 60-year-old woman, Kala Devi, was attacked by a leopard and left seriously injured. She had gone to collect chir pine needles in the fringe forest when the leopard attacked her. The victim was referred to a higher centre for treatment by the medical authorities of Almora as she required advanced treatment. Incidentally, just a few days ago, a child was being carried away by a leopard and it was only after the relatives raised the alarm, the child was saved. Senior forest officials of Uttarakhand have raised concern over rising human-wildlife conflicts, owing to lack of awareness among villagers. And, also due to the laidback attitude of the system to implement the measures listed by scientists and wildlife experts that would help in lowering the conflicts. Every year, at least 50 people are killed in wildlife attack in Uttarakhand. This year too, the death toll has touched the mark of 48 till now as per the data of forest department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/65-yr-old-latest-casualty-to-leopard-attack-in-pauri/articleshow/88058291.cms||Shivani Azad

Agitated over the state government’s inaction against the construction of a bungalow in the heritage precinct of Old Goa, a group of citizens decided to start a hunger strike from November 24 onwards 8am till 6pm near the Basilica of Bom Jesus at Old Goa. Following which, functionaries from political organisations also joined in and started their own hunger strike demanding the demolition of the illegal structure. Though the state government revoked the permission granted to the controversial project and issued orders to stop construction work immediately, the protesters have demanded that proper buffer zones be demarcated around Old Goa heritage sites. The Save Old Goa action committee has said that they will not back out from the hunger strike until they see the building physically razed to the ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/save-old-goa-panel-continues-with-hunger-stir/articleshow/88059728.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Now, 45% adults in Maharashtra, 74% in Mumbai fully vaxxed||MUMBAI: With vaccination picking up pace, the state has managed to cover 45% of its adult population with both doses of the vaccine against Covid-19. The state’s full vaccination proportion, though, is lower than the national average of 49%. Among districts, Mumbai is ahead of all in Maharashtra, having vaccinated nearly 74% with both shots. Union health ministry officials on Thursday said more than 125 crore doses have been administered in the country to cover 49% of the adult population with both shots and 84.3% with at least one. They said the single dose coverage increased by nearly 6% in the country due to the Har Ghar Dastak campaign while in Maharashtra it rose by 6.8%. The second dose coverage too rose by 11.7% in the country since the door-to-door campaign started on November 3. In the past three days, the state has clocked nearly 10 lakh vaccinations every day. Besides the Har Ghar Dastak campaign, which has been extended till December end, fear of a surge due to the Omicron variant is also a likely reason for the increased jabs. While listing best practices of different states, joint secretary of union health ministry Luv Agrawal said in Maharashtra, the committee of sarpanches, gram sevak, ASHA and teachers, were successfully used for mobilisation.  The state has administered 11,61,57,412 doses of the vaccine, fully immunising 4.1 crore people and giving at least one shot to 7.5 crore people. The acceleration in daily vaccination has given the state hope that it would cover its entire eligible population of 9.1 crore by the end of the year. As of now, 1.6 crore people haven't taken their first shots. Dr Sachin Desai, the state's immunisation head, said the share of second dose vaccination is more than the first at present. The state has more than 95 lakh people eligible for their second shot, which is growing each day as more people are finishing their 84-day gap. Dr Desai said people should come forward as more than 1.3 crore doses are available.  While Maharashtra doesn’t have a single district with less than 60% single dose coverage, more than 20 are below state average in full vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-now-45-adults-in-state-74-in-city-fully-vaxxed/articleshow/88059726.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Prior to this, it had recorded 100mm of rain in a single day in December 1965. This season’s post-monsoon average rainfall (from October 1 onwards) is 500mm till December 2 against the normal value of 193mm, working out a 160% surplus. Parts of Goa received 10cm of rainfall in 24 hours on Thursday after thunderstorms and lightning were reported at isolated places. While the rain gauge stations at Margao and Panaji recorded 10cm each, Ela at Old Goa recorded 9cm. This was up to 1pm on Thursday. The influence of the weather system — a trough in the Arabian Sea — bringing this rain over Goa is likely to decrease in the coming days. Rainfall intensity and its spatial distribution is likely to reduce from Friday, the India meteorological department (IMD) said in its forecast. Owing to the weather phenomenon, citizens have been advised by the IMD to avoid open areas and fields. They have also been advised against taking shelter under tall trees or structures during thunderstorms. “Clouding and rainfall activity may affect sowing or agriculture land preparation during this period. Fishermen are advised not to venture along and off south Maharashtra-Goa coast till December 3,” the IMD warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-record-for-dec-as-panaji-logs-highest-ever-single-day-showers/articleshow/88059722.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Ahmedabad||‘Will examine effect on nutrient cycles’||Ahmedabad: To study the effects of greater alkalinity on ocean nutrient cycles, a team of PRL scientists will cruise down to special zones called upwelling regions to collect nutrient-rich water samples. Wind driven forces brings deep, nutrient rich cold water to the ocean surface. “These upwelling regions are found off Peru and Namibia, and strong monsoonal winds result from upwelling regions in the Arabian Sea. The PRL team plans to conduct on board experiments on these research cruises using at least 100 litres of water samples. The experiments will study the effect of alkalinity products (such as high carbonate and iron nutrients) on nutrient cycles — carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus — and on the microscopic ocean life,” said associate professor Arvind Singh. The alkaline product mix will amplify photosynthetic organisms’ fixing of additional carbon dioxide as more carbonates and bicarbonates will be available at the surface. “Nature is complex. For instance, the effect of enhanced alkalinity on nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient cycles may enhance more phytoplankton or microorganism growth which in turn may lead to more fish production that may further lead to more oxygen consumption. Any tinkering will require a retrospective study,” adds Singh. The scientists also said that a mesocosm experiment, where at least 10,000 litres of ocean water will be used to conduct experiments on land, will be conducted to study the effects of enhanced alkalinity on ocean nutrient cycles. Singh says, “The oceans already have 38,000 gigatons of carbon and can definitely absorb 250 gigatons of atmospheric carbon that industrial activities have produced in the last 150 years; and enhancing ocean alkalinity offers one of that ways to do it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/will-examine-effect-on-nutrient-cycles/articleshow/88067224.cms||---

Speaking at a public rally after laying the foundation stone, Shah said, "There was a time when not just riots occurred here, our daughters had to be sent to other states for studies as there was no security. Today, no daughter in western UP has to go outside for studies. Nobody dares to misbehave with them. They step out of home without any fear now.” Spread over 50.4 acres, the university – named after goddess Shakumbari Devi, whose temple is in Behat and is revered in western UP -- will be built at a cost of Rs 92 crore. Targeting former CM Akhilesh Yadav for his recent remarks over crime in UP, Shah said, “Akhilesh ji, during your regime, there was mafia rule in Uttar Pradesh, but today the rule of law prevails.” He added: “Incidents of loot by armed men has gone down by 69%, cases of murder dipped by 30% and dacoity cases have gone down by 70% during Yogi Adityanath's government. Dowry deaths have fallen by 22.5%. Akhilesh ji, go home and check the data before speaking.” The home minister quipped: "Where have you got your spectacles from? You are unable to see the true picture." Shah claimed the former CM used to say that he would build the Ram temple in Ayodhya but could never mention the date. “Akhilesh ji, the temple construction has started now,” said Shah. “Earlier, people used to migrate from Saharanpur due to crime but now those who do crime are moving out,” added the Union home minister. CM Yogi said before 2017, it used to take 6-7 hours to reach Saharanpur from Delhi but now it takes barely 3 hours. This is the kind of development that the BJP government has brought to the state, the CM said, claiming the government has cleared all sugarcane dues. Saharanpur has seven Assembly constituencies, and BJP currently holds four. Two are held by Congress and one is with SP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/daughters-step-out-of-home-without-fear-in-up-now-shah/articleshow/88058315.cms||---

There are only a handful of test kits that target ‘S’ gene. “If a person tests positive using such an RT-PCR kit, we can take his or her sample for whole genomic sequencing on priority. The chances of the variant detection rise manifold.

Pushpraj Singh, a junior engineer with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited in Shahibaugh, told Chandkheda police that he received a call from an unknown number on July 21. The 36-year-old from Koteshwar locality told police, “A person claiming to be from the Customs department in Delhi said that a parcel had arrived in my name. He said I would have to pay Rs 25,000 to receive the parcel. When I said that I hadn’t ordered anything and refused to pay the money, he said that the customs department would initiate action against me. Scared, I paid the money into the account number given by the person.” Later, the man allegedly called him again, claiming there was $20,000 inside the parcel. “He said that I would face a case of money laundering and told me to pay Rs 56,000 as spot penalty to avoid legal action. I paid up. Later, the man called me again and said that I needed to pay Rs 50,000 to convert the dollars into rupees. I paid this amount and, within minutes, the man went incommunicado,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fake-customs-officer-cheats-bsnl-staffer/articleshow/88059148.cms||---
---||Kochi||Abattoir at Kaloor still functions flouting norms||Kochi: The Kochi corporation, Kerala State Pollution Control Board (PCB) and the contractor who runs the slaughterhouse at Kaloor on behalf of the local body continue to befool the public. The abattoir functioning without adhering to any of the norms is yet to be closed down. Though the PCB issued notice to the corporation authorities a fortnight ago asking them to shift the animals from the abattoir within seven days, authorities haven’t done anything in this regard. While issuing notice to the corporation, the PCB had made it clear that it would give directive to the KSEB to disconnect power supply to the slaughterhouse after a week. But no such instruction has been given so far. On October 29, the PCB had asked the local body to close down the slaughterhouse which functions without following hygiene norms. The contractor had moved the high court seeking stay on the procedures by the PCB and Kochi corporation. But, in its order issued on November 22, the high court dismissed the contractor’s plea. “Now, the corporation authorities and the PCB should take measures to close down the slaughterhouse. If the authorities fail to take action, we will start agitation with the support of the masses,” said N S Unnithan, general secretary, Anti-corruption People’s Movement, an NGO. At the same time, the corporation authorities still buy time for acting on the PCB notice. “We have prepared plans for closing down the slaughterhouse. We will come up with action in a few days,” said corporation health standing committee chairman T K Asharaf. The local body authorities also failed to take measures to arrange alternative measures once the abattoir is closed. The slaughterhouse at Kaloor is the only authorized facility in Kochi. Once the slaughterhouse is closed, it will lead to unauthorized culling of animals. The slaughterhouse has been functioning without an effluent treatment plant for the past several years. Blood from the slaughterhouse is being drained out to Thevara-Perandoor Canal. Moreover, the animals are being culled in an unscientific manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/abattoir-at-kaloor-still-functions-flouting-norms/articleshow/88059145.cms||---

Across the state, 83% primary schools reopened in rural areas from December 1. However, only 48% students attended. In urban areas, while 50% schools reopened for class 1-7, only 21% attendance was reported. In Mumbai, BMC has decided to wait till December 15. Schools, however, have begun noticing more students in virtual classrooms than the physical ones. “Attendance in physical classes was picking up post Diwali vacations but once again there is a drop,” said the principal of a school in Santacruz. Dr Kavita Nagpal, principal at Orchids The International School, Masjid Bunder, said physical attendance of class 10 students has dropped from 82% to 60%. When the hybrid mode began from October 4, schools were strict on attendance. “We had ensured that those attending physical classes could not wake up and attend the virtual classroom. But now more than half of the students who were attending offline have moved online,” said the principal of aschool in Dahisar. In the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, only rural Palghar reopened schools for primary students.

Its last attempt to do so in 2010 had failed after a disastrous start. Boating was a regular affair in the pond till 1993. But it was stopped after a tragedy when a boat capsized killing 21 persons. In 2010, when the service was formally kicked off, two corporators fell in the pond accidentally as a boat tilted and they lost balance. While the boating started for a few days, it had to be stopped in the name of maintenance. The service never started again. Sources said that the pond was raising a stink at that time and material was getting stuck in the boats. The VMC has come up with another proposal for the service and is has placed it before the standing committee. The committee will decide on the matter on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/another-bid-to-resume-boating-in-sursagar/articleshow/88058538.cms||---

However, three years later, a proper road is yet to be built in the area. “There were 58 people on board the bus. Among them, 48 died when the bus fell into a gorge near Dhumakot. The vehicle was on its way to Nainital when the accident took place. It was one of the most horrible road accident tragedies in the state. The then chief minister, Trivendra Singh Rawat, announced an ex-gratia for the bereaved families and assured people that road infrastructure will be made better in the area. Three years on, we are yet to see any development on the front,” said Deepak Kandhari, Tandoli village head. Pauri residents claim that the 25-kilometre-long Dhumakot-Pipli-Bhaun road connecting their villages to bigger towns like Dhumakot has been in shambles for over 12 years now despite the route being used by state public transport buses. “We have raised the issue with our elected representatives but all our concerns have fallen on deaf years,” said Ishu Bisht, Umroli village head. Villagers claim that they are not able to access basic facilities due to poor road connectivity. “Contrary to the state government's claim on pothole-free roads, we don't even have a single proper metalled road. Due to poor connectivity, several posts remain vacant in hospitals and schools here,” said a resident of Pauri's Chainpur village. Meanwhile, civic officials claim infrastructure is being improved in the area. “The first eight-kilometre of the stretch is smooth and work is ongoing to make the road pothole-free till the 10-km mark. The remaining stretch will be repaired as soon as we get the renewal permits,” said Vivek Semwal, executive engineer, public works department (PWD). He added that the road in question was under a different department earlier and only came under the purview of the PWD in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-40-villages-in-garhwal-suffer-because-of-lack-of-proper-road-connectivity/articleshow/88058347.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

Locals had seized three trucks when they carried garbage from Kerala to dump it on a private land at Semanampathy in April this year. Following this, officials found a large quantity of waste dumped in the private land measuring around half acre. While the garbage was suspected to have been brought to Coimbatore from Thrissur and Palakkad districts, the Kerala government denied the charge. Meanwhile, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) took up the issue suo moto and conducted an inquiry. With the next hearing scheduled on December 8, the TNPCB team lifted soil samples and sent them to the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) for testing. The testing is being done to ascertain the damages the illegal garbage dumping has caused to the soil. An official said an earthmover was used to dig the illegal dumping site. Foul smell emanated from the place due to the formation of leachate from the garbage dumping. Samples were collected in the presence of revenue inspector, police personnel from Anamalai station and assistant block development officer. The results of the tests will be submitted to the NGT. The results will help to identify the level of pollution caused by the illegal dumping and fixing the tune of compensation to be collected from people responsible for the act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tnpcb-team-collects-soil-samples-from-illegal-garbage-dumping-site/articleshow/88059775.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Even those who tested negative should remain under home quarantine for seven days, he added.There will be nodal officers in each airport to monitor the movement of the passengers both from high risk and non-risk countries.Random tests will be conducted on those coming from non-risk countries.The minister said the RT-PCR fees of Rs 700 will be borne by the government for poor labourers and those belonging to economically weaker sections coming from these countries.Responding to questions on possible curbs as the Omicron variant was detected in Bengaluru, Subramanian asked people not to panic as the health infrastructure in the state is well-equipped to handle the new variant.While more than 78% of the eligible population is vaccinated with the first dose in the state, 44% are fully vaccinated. While there are about 88 lakh people who are eligible for their second dose, the state has a stock of 1.13 crore vaccines. People should come forward to get themselves vaccinated, the minister said.Stating that the respective collectors will take a decision on imposing curbs based on the spread and vaccination coverage in the district, the minister urged people to wear mask and maintain social distancing in public places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/no-case-of-omicron-detected-in-tn-so-far-health-minister/articleshow/88059772.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Coimbatore||Construction waste on median a concern||Coimbatore: Unscrupulous elements are dumping construction and demolition waste on the median strip below the second level of the Gandhipuram flyover, creating an eyesore and a health hazard.S Vinoba, a regular commuter, said dumping on the median has been taking place for a long time. “When construction waste was first dumped here two months ago, the city corporation took no action and as a result, it has become rampant. While most of the medians under flyovers in the city are maintained well, this one is an exception. Waste should be removed at once and people in the area should be sensitized,” he told TOI.Ornamental plants should be planted on the median to beautify the place, said Shakthi Priya, another commuter. “A fence should be installed to keep waste dumpers away. Also, posters and bills of political parties and educational institutions should be removed from the pillars of the flyover,” she said. Some enterprising people in the area are also using the space to store construction materials and display equipment such as floor polishing machines. While the civic body keeps removing waste from the median, people continue to dump, an official said. “As it is impossible to always keep an eye on the area, we plan to create awareness among locals,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/construction-waste-on-median-a-concern/articleshow/88059780.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Massive ‘SBI call centre’ fraud busted, 14 nabbed||HYDERABAD: Cyberabad police busted a major gang of cyber fraudsters operating a call centre from Delhi posing as ‘SBI telecallers’ and duping thousands of people of hundreds of crores of rupees. Fourteen accused have been arrested. In October this year, a man (who has two SBI credit cards) approached police alleging that he was conned by fraudsters posing as the SBI telecallers to the tune of Rs 1.64 lakh. While working on simliar complaints where SBI customers were duped by fraudsters posing as bank’s telecallers promising to renew the credit card or increase the credit limit or redeem the reward points, police went to Uttam Nagar in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar and apprehended the 14 fraudsters, including main accused Nikhil Madaan, a graduate from Uttam Nagar. Terming it as one of the biggest Cyber frauds in the country, Cyberabad commissioner of police M Stephen Ravindra said the gang members made 33,000 calls to customers in the past one year alone. It is estimated that 3,000 to 5,000 cases would be registered against the conmen across the country for causing hundreds of crores of rupees loss. The gang members’ modus operandi is simple. They obtain customer credit card data from third parties, while staff at their call centre make calls to each customer offering various services. To make the customers believe that the call is made from SBI toll-free number, the gang uses a call spoofing application supplied by one of the accused, Farmaan Hussain. After convincing the customer that they are ‘genuine callers’ from SBI call centre, the accused collect CVV number, card number, card expiry date and OTP to make transactions on property rental/purchase portals. The amount gets credited into the bank accounts linked to the property rental portals. “For this purpose, another accused Vikas has opened 49 bank accounts for the gang,” Ravindra said. The transferred amount will be withdrawn from various ATM centres immediately by the associates of the gang members. To run the business, Nikhil opened a call centre a year ago in Uttam Nagar by employing 10 staffers. Nikhil obtained the call spoofing application from Farmaan, a native of Bihar, through an associate Mursheed. While three of the gang members make calls to the customers, rest of the gang members work on executing the fraudulent money transactions simultaneously, the CP said. A Cyberabad police team had been on the trail of the gang members for three months before busting them. So far, 209 cases have been registered against the gang across the country, including 14 in Cyberabad. “We will seek a forensic audit of their operation to understand the quantum of loss and to recover the amount,” Ravindra said. Police have recovered 30 cellphones, three laptops, motorbikes and cars from the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/massive-sbi-call-centrefraud-busted-14-nabbed/articleshow/88059160.cms||Mahesh Buddi

The degree was given to him earlier this year. However, AMU authorities have denied the allegations, saying that the student, Danish Rahim, was inadvertently issued a degree in the “wrong subject” and no politics was involved in the matter. University spokesperson Shafey Kidwai said, “Due to a typographical error and oversight, Rahim was erroneously issued a Ph.D degree in Linguistics instead of LAMM (Language for Advertising, Marketing and Media).” He completed his post-graduation in LAMM and is not eligible for a Ph.D in Linguistics, added Kidwai. The LAMM course is also run under the linguistics department. The university has on record his admission card, which Rahim had filled under his own signature and thumb impression, he added. Rahim has moved to Allahabad high court and written a letter to PM Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath for their intervention in the matter on December 7. Talking with TOI, Rahim admitted that the university administration had asked him to return the Ph.D degree in “linguistics” so that he could be issued another degree in “LAMM course”. “When I had applied for the post of guest faculty at AMU, my application was not accepted because I have a Ph.D in LAMM,” he said, adding that when the university is not accepting his degree why would other institute accept his candidature. Rahim claimed that after he praised the PM last year, the chairman of the department of linguistics had called him and said he should not have given such a statement to the media. “When I received a letter from the controller that there was an error in the degree, I realised why they did this to me,” he alleged. Prof. M J Warsi, chairman, department of linguistics, denied meeting Rahim, and said, “he is trying to divert attention” and the allegations levelled by him are a figment of his imagination with mala fide intentions. He added that he is taking a legal opinion in the matter. Giving details, Rahim said, “I had taken admission in post-graduation in August 2013, when LAMM was declared a degree course. Earlier, it was a diploma course.” But after two semesters, the students were informed that the department did not have experts in this field, so it would not continue as a degree course. When the students who were pursuing MA in LAMM asked how they would pursue research in this field, the VC had allowed four students — two each from 2013-14 and 2014-15 batch – to join the Ph.D programme in the department of Linguistics. Rahim was one of them. He had taken admission for a Ph.D programme in LAMM in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/amu-mistake-on-degree-to-target-me-for-praising-pm-says-scholar/articleshow/88058345.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||Back in severe zone, Delhi air worst in country||NEW DELHI: With an AQI of 429, Delhi was the most polluted city in the country on Thursday, ahead of Faridabad (428) and Manesar (413). A day earlier, the AQI had been 370, but local pollutants accumulated without any scope for dispersion leading to a sharp deterioration in air quality. Track the pollution level in your cityAir monitors at Dwarka, Lodhi Road, Jawaharlal Stadium, Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, Najafgarh, Nehru Nagar, Punjabi Bagh, Pusa, Patparganj, RK Puram, Rohini, Shadipur and Siri Fort, among others, all recorded readings in the severe category. With stubble burning having declined, Delhi only had its local pollution sources to blame for the dismal situation. The pollution monitoring agencies and weather analysts expect air quality to improve noticeably only after December 6 when the winds pick up. Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet, said, “The city saw drizzling or light rain that increased the moisture in the air, thus stopping pollutants from being flushed away. The winds were calm throughout the day too.” According to the Union earth sciences ministry’s Decision Support System for Air Quality Management, vehicular emissions constituted around 20% of PM2.5. Other major sources included industries (4-9%), construction (2%) and dust (1%). Experts said strong pollution preventive steps would help provided they were implemented round the year, not only when the city’s air quality dipped due to meteorological conditions. “Banning construction or prohibiting trucks from entering Delhi work only as emergency measures, like a band-aid for temporary relief. What Delhi needs is a stronger plan that works round the year,” said Shambhavi Shukla, deputy programme officer (air pollution), Centre for Science and Environment. “Strengthen the public transport system. It is entirely wrong to blame the people for using their personal vehicles.” She also pointed out the need for better infrastructure for e-vehicles such as fast charging hubs, better parking policies that also addressed problems like illegal parking, and a better organised end-mile connectivity network for Delhi Metro and buses. Tanushree Ganguli, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, added that local emissions had to be looked at. “Locally, transport, dust and waste burning are the leading contributors to Delhi's pollution. On Thursday evening, these were responsible for at least 20% of the PM2.5 pollutants. While school closure and banning entry of non-electric trucks into the city might reduce vehicular emissions to some extent, more aggressive measures to restrict vehicular traffic are needed,” she said. Meanwhile, monitoring agencies expect deterioration in the air quality. “For the next three days, the winds are likely to be calm, reducing ventilation and causing a deterioration in air quality. From December 6 onwards, the winds are expected to increase. They will then disperse the pollutants, but the AQI is likely to remain in the ‘very poor’ category. A partly cloudy sky and low mixing layer height are preventing efficient dispersion of pollutants,” said a SAFAR statement on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/back-in-severe-zone-delhi-air-worst-in-country/articleshow/88059791.cms||Kushagra Dixit

He wanted the high court to call for the records pertaining to this enforcement case information report (ECIR) and urged it to quash the case because it was contrary to law and violated his fundamental rights. He also urged the court to stay the proceedings before the principal sessions judge court in Chennai. Justice B Vijaysen Reddy adjourned the case to December 7 for hearing. According to the ED, Best and Crompton Engineering Projects Limited duped the banks to the tune of Rs 364 crore and linked the company with Sujana group of companies. Citing the statements given by some of the directors of certain fictitious companies who named Sujana Chowdary as the key man behind the companies and the financial transactions carried out in their name, the ED named Sujana Chowdary as accused in its prosecution complaint filed before the Chennai ED court. The MP challenged the action of the ED on the grounds that he has no connection with Best and Crompton company and the alleged fictitious companies. “Even according to Best and Crompton case, the cause of action arose more in Hyderabad than in Chennai and hence it is illegal to file the case in a Chennai court,” he said. Stating that both CBI and ED had already investigated the case and that their FIR and ECIR did not make him an accused, the MP found fault with the ED for naming him in its prosecution complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sujana-moves-hc-wants-ed-money-laundering-case-quashed/articleshow/88059785.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Heartbreak for many as donated organs go waste||Nagpur: Less than a fortnight after heart and lungs of an 18-year-old from Nagpur, who died of brain stroke, could not be utilized for a needy patient due to logistics problems, another healthy heart and a pair of lungs went unutilized in Vidarbha, despite the family members giving consent to retrieve and transplant the vital organs of a 42-year-old brain dead man. This time also, the reason was logistics problem. Vishal Madhukarrao Nawalkar from Achalpur in Amravati district had a traumatic head injury after epileptic attack on December 1. He was admitted to Bhansali Multispeciality Hospital in Paratwada where he died on December 2. Overcoming the grief, his 32-year-old wife Sneha, parents and young daughter decided to donate the organs to save life of needy patients. They gave consent to donate both kidneys, liver, heart, lungs and pair of corneas. As Amravati comes under the Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre (ZTCC) Nagpur, liver, kidneys and corneas were allocated to patients as per the waiting list. As ZTCC Nagpur has no patient waiting for heart and lungs, the allocation of these organs was left to the National Organ Transplant Coordination Organization. “Vishal’s heart was allocated for a 52-year-old man in Chennai while his lungs were allotted to a 48-year-old woman of Ukraine nationality admitted in Chennai. However, in the absence of logistics facility to transport the organs to Chennai, these could not be utilized. It is a big loss,” said Dr Vibhavari Dani, president of ZTCC Nagpur. “Yet another wastage of valuable organs due logistics problem is painful. This is certainly a time for framing policies for easy and quick transport of extremely valuable lifesaving organs. Secondly, it is really high time to enrol recipients for heart and lungs with ZTCC Nagpur to avoid such wastage,” she added. TOI had raised this issue on November 21 and experts had suggested possible solutions too.“Logistics caused heartburn again,” said ZTCC general secretary Dr Sanjay Kolte. “There are very few places in India, where all organ utilizing centres are available within city limits or in approachable distances. Sending organs outside by various modes of transport is a necessity and will remain a norm that will stay for years to come. Along with recipient hospitals, even the donor hospitals have to be more accommodative in adjusting timelines which will suit hospitals in far away destinations,” he said.

---||Madurai||Stone inscription in mosque cites prayer calendar starting from 1st of Thai month||Madurai: Amidst speculation that the DMK government may declare Pongal day or the first day of the month of Thai as Tamil New year, an archaeology enthusiast has cited a 300-year-old stone inscription at the Keelakarai mosque in Ramanathapuram which refers to a Muslim prayer calendar that starts with the first day of the Thai month.U Vijayaramu, 67, from Keelakarai, says he found the inscription two years ago at the Grand Jumma Masjid which was built by renowned philanthropist Vallal Seethakkathi, a minister in the cabinet of Ramanathapuram king Kilavan Sethupathy (1670 to 1708 AD). An outstanding example of Islamic-Dravidian architectural excellence, the mosque has a stone inscription to specify the timings of the day for offering worship. It is in this inscription that it is marked that the first day of the month of Thai is the first day of the year. ``Hence, it could be either January 14 or 15, whichever date the first day of Thai falls,’’ says Vijayaramu.The DMK government had on January 29, 2008 passed an order declaring the first day of Thai as the ``Tamil New Year’’. While debates continued, the AIADMK government on August 23, 2011 declared that the first day of Chittirai would be Tamil New Year.  Dr A M M Kader Buksh Husain, traditional kazi of the grand mosque, confirms the presence of the stone inscription there. ``It has been inscribed to specify the timings for worship beginning with the month of Thai. So it would mean that the year begins with the first day of the month of Thai,’’ he said. ``Another inscription mentioning this is also seen in a smaller Olakarai mosque in Keelakarai,’’ he said. An official of the state archaeology department who visited the mosque said it is a time table which has been drawn up for Asar prayer time in mosques. “If it mentions Thai, it is based on the movement of the sun in astrological terms,’’ he said. “It was after the advent of the Gregorian calendar that we have been naming months. Otherwise, the Tamil days were based on the movement of the lunar cycle and not the solar cycle,’’ he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/stone-inscription-in-mosque-cites-prayer-calendar-starting-from-1st-of-thai-month/articleshow/88059166.cms||---

---||Agra||Aligarh: Mistaken for Muslim, man buried by cops exhumed and cremated after week||AGRA: The body of a 55-year-old man -- buried by police in Aligarh last week after assuming it to be of a Muslim as no one came forward to identify it -- was exhumed and cremated according to Hindu rites on Wednesday after the family identified him in a video circulated on social media. Police claimed the body was mistakenly presumed to be that of a Muslim man as he was wearing a skull cap and sporting a beard. Brahmajeet Singh worked with the agriculture department in Aligarh and was a resident of Kawarsi nearby. He had left his house on November 22 but did not return. His body was found in the basement of a local market on Ramghat road on November 23. The postmortem report revealed that the cause of death was chronic lung and liver disease, said police. When no one came forward to claim the body within the mandated 72 hours, police contacted an NGO, Manav Upkar, to bury the remains as per Muslim rituals because the body appeared to be that of a man belonging to that faith. Singh’s son Guarav Kumar lodged a missing complaint at Kawarsi police station on November 23 after the family failed to locate him. However, three days later, the Kawarsi police contacted the NGO to bury the unclaimed body. President of the NGO, Vishnu Kumar, said, “Police had given me in writing to bury the body.” Singh’s younger brother Ramesh Chand said they had received some videos of the unidentified body on WhatsApp on November 28 and contacted the police, but by that time the body had already been buried. Chand added that the administration later exhumed the body and provided help to cremate it as per Hindu rituals. Additional city magistrate Sudhir Kumar said the confusion regarding the religious identity of Singh happened due to his appearance. “After coming to that he was Hindu, the district magistrate immediately ordered the body to be exhumed and cremated as per the family’s wishes,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mistaken-for-muslim-man-buried-by-cops-exhumed-cremated-after-week/articleshow/88058357.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

This gang of 14 members arrested by Cyberabad police has been operating a cell centre from Noida. The fourteen accused have also been operating two fake websites offering loans to lure gullible customers.  So far, 27 cases have been registered against the accused for duping innocent customers of lakhs of rupees. According to DCP Rohini Priyadarshini, the gang members created fake websites — www. dhanibazaarloan.in and www.theloanindia.in — to lure people looking for loans on internet. “Once a customer fills personal details on the loan application, the fraudsters contact him and collect details like pay slip, Aadhaar card and permanent account number (PAN) card, offering to provide Rs 5 lakh loan.” “The gang members then fleece the innocent customer in the name of processing fee and dupe them,” the DCP added. So far, nine cases have been registered in Cyberabad police station limits against accused. Among the fourteen accused, the main offenders are Abhishek Sharma and Rajendra Kumar, who run the call centre, Brajesh Kumar, who recruits telecallers, Dileep, who maintains the fake websites and Hemalatha, who trains all the telecallers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gang-behind-fake-loan-call-centre-racket-apprehended/articleshow/88059162.cms||---

With the flowering of the fruit affected and chances of getting fungus due to unseasonal weather condition, farmers are far from optimistic of getting a productive yield this season. “It’s only been a fortnight since the flowering has begun and it is already hit with rain. Not only are the crops in the flowering stage likely to be infected with fungus, but even crops that are about to flower will be affected with issues such as blackening. If there is no dry climate and enough stress due to winter, farmers will be staring at losses of up to 50% in the upcoming mango season,” a farmer Shivram Arolkar, said. The unseasonal rain began on Wednesday night and continued up to Thursday morning. Besides the mango flowering getting affected, even the cashew flowers are affected due to the rainfall. Nestor Rangel has a plantation of 700 mango trees at his farm in Valpoi which yielded over 1 lakh mangoes last year. However this year the productivity appears to be bleak. “The unseasonal rain this time will delay flowering and I will most probably get the crop when the actual monsoon starts. The same applies with my 25 acres of cashew crop,” he said. Director of agriculture, Nevil Alphonso said that both mango as well as the cashew season is going to be delayed by three weeks. “By this month all the mango and cashew crops should’ve flowered. This was anyway delayed due to post-monsoon rainfall and now will be further delayed due to the unseasonal rain. It all depends upon how the climate behaves in the next 15 days,” he said. The cultivation of Rabi crops, vegetables, pulses and watermelon are also delayed due to unseasonal rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unseasonal-rain-damages-mango-flowering-yield-likely-to-fall/articleshow/88059796.cms||Nida Sayed

A heavy vehicle, with Rajasthan registration, arrived at the premises of the school and started the work of erecting the tower. When ward councillor Girish Borkar questioned them, they said they have permission from the IT department and that they have been asked to erect towers in every school for better connectivity. However, the locals asked them to put the work on hold. Borkar said, “The school had no idea about this and the municipality was also not informed. The schools can easily opt for Wi-Fi connectivity instead of the tower.” The locals alleged that the school does not even have drinking water facility and that the students come asking for water in the neighbourhood. The toilets are not in good condition and the high tension wires in the compound can come down with the trees, they added. They said if the government want to do something, it should appoint a security guard for the safety of the children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/locals-stop-erection-of-mobile-tower-in-mangor-hill-school/articleshow/88059855.cms||---

No loss of life was reported but there was panic among area residents. Traffic congestion also made it difficult for the fire tender to reach the spot, said residents. Nayagaon market committee president Umesh Gulyani said, “We have been pressing for stationing of a fire tender here in Nayagaon but no action has been taken so far. Secondly, the streets are congested due to heavy traffic flow, which hampers movement of the fire tender. We demand the establishment of a fire sub-station here.” The incident took place on a mobile tower atop a shop after the generator set of the tower caught fire. The flames engulfed the tower in seconds. People ran out of houses and shops fearing that the tower may collapse. Two fire tenders took 25 minutes to douse the flames. Residents alleged that they heard a minor blast from the tower during the fire. Another resident said that they had to call the local police to make way for the fire tenders through the traffic on the main road. People even tried to manage the traffic to make way for the fire tenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mobile-tower-catches-fire-no-loss-of-life-reported/articleshow/88058364.cms||---
---||Delhi||Centre may shut all thermal plants near Delhi for now||NEW DELHI: Facing a 24-hour ultimatum from the Supreme Court, the environment ministry on Thursday held multiple meetings with officials of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on additional measures, including shutting down of all thermal power plants within a 300 km radius of Delhi for a limited period, which can be taken to bring down the level of air pollution immediately. Though the ministry and the CAQM will take the final call on new measures before submitting their response to the apex court on Friday, officials discussed the possibility and pros and cons of closing down remaining five of 11 thermal power plants, located within 300 km radius of Delhi, which had earlier not been shut, and limiting movement of diesel vehicles in the NCR. The CAQM had in its earlier direction on November 16 ordered to shut down six power plants till November 30, but it allowed five to remain operational. "We may now go for shutting down these five as well for a certain period. The Commission has been in touch with the power ministry. It will take a call accordingly," said an official, adding that all the directions of November 16 would be extended for a few more days. He said, "The issue of 'odd and even' vehicle rule was also discussed, but there was no agreement on this issue. So, the Centre will not suggest this measure. There is, however, a possibility of shutting down certain industries in the NCR, considering the fact that many of them in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have not yet switched over to gas."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-may-shut-all-thermal-plants-near-delhi-for-now/articleshow/88059809.cms||---
---||Agra||Railways stops rail bus services for 4 days in Mathura, additional forces on ground||AGRA: Additional security forces were deployed in Mathura in the wake of threats by a right-wing group that it would install idols of Lord Krishna at the Shahi Idgah on the anniversary of Babri Masjid demolition on December 6. It came even as the railways stopped its rail bus services between Mathura and Vrindavan for four days — December 4 to 7. The light weight 75-seater passenger rail car, which operates between the two stations, travels past the main gate of the Shahi Idgah, next to the Krishna Janmabhoomi temple in Mathura. Mathura police has already imposed section 144 in the temple town and security will be further stepped up from December 4. As a precautionary measure, police have decided to barricade all three access roads to the mosque, on December 6, to screen people entering the Shahi Idgah. The Hindu Mahasabha had earlier "withdrawn" their proposed programme. However, what has perhaps sparked off fears is UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s tweet, wherein he wrote: "Foundations of a grand temple in Ayodhya and Kashi have begun, now preparations are being made for Mathura." Local resident Barsney Sharma, 65, said such statements are given at the time of elections and that he has never seen any communal clashes here. “The deputy CM should have refrained from such a tweet. The matter is sub-judice," he added. President of Shahi Idgah committee, Dr Z Hassan, said that he has been living in Mathura for 15 years and has never seen any communal disturbances. He appealed to the people to maintain peace in the city on December 6. Elaborating on the security arrangements in sensitive areas from December 4, SP (city) MP Singh said that eight companies of Rapid Action Force (RAF), 10 companies of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), six additional SPs, 14 deputy SPs, 400 inspectors, 100 sub-inspectors and 1,500 head constables and constables will be on duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/rlys-stops-rail-bus-services-for-4-days-in-mathura-addl-forces-on-ground/articleshow/88058365.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

HMDA conducted land e-auctions in Uppal Bhagat layout on Thursday. HMDA officials were on Thursday overwhelmed with the response as Rs 1 lakh per square yard is the usual going rate in the western part of the city. While the average bid amount was Rs 71,815 per sq yard, the land auction fetched Rs 141 crore to the metropolitan authority. On the first day of auction, 23 plots ranging between 150 sq yards to 1,787 sq yards, totalling 19,719 sq yards, were put up for auction. The second day of auction for 21 plots would be held on Friday. HMDA officials said while the upset price per sq yard was Rs 35,000, the highest bid amount was Rs 1.01 lakh per sq yard and lowest was Rs 53,000 sq yard. Officials said two open plots in an extent of 368 and 222 sq yards received the highest bid of Rs 1.01 lakh per sq yard. The Telangana government had earlier conducted land auctions at the same layout as it is a safe bet on various counts. There were no legal hitches on the land and it got good response from the bidders in the two phases of land auctions that were held in 2019. In two phases, the HMDA had sold 155 plots and garnered Rs 1,050 crore. For some plots, the highest bid amount was Rs 79,000 per sq yard. Officials attributed the good response for the auction to the layout’s proximity to the Metro station at Nagole and it being on the banks of Musi river. Secondly, HMDA had already developed infrastructure at the layout. HMDA had conducted land auction at Neopolis in Kokapet a few months ago and rake in Rs 2,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uppal-auction-sets-tcash-registers-ringing/articleshow/88059172.cms||Koride Mahesh

Rarely do winter months witness such an improvement. Just two weeks ago, Mumbai had reported a poor to very poor air quality index (AQI), especially in pockets such as Colaba, BKC and Mazgaon. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) has forecast satisfactory AQI for at least the next two days. Track the pollution level in your cityThursday readings showed Mumbai’s overall AQI was 78, which indicated a satisfactory 2.5 particulate matter (PM) level in the air, except in areas such as Malad and Colaba where it was moderate “This moderate to satisfactory category of AQI in Mumbai, which is rare in winter, can be attributed to a reversal of sea breeze,” said Gufran Beig, programme director, SAFAR. Winter months usually see the most bad air quality days due to humidity, low sea breeze, a drop in temperature and high pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-unseasonal-rain-improves-city-air-quality-to-satisfactory/articleshow/88059815.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

While banks’ crop credit objective for this year was Rs 59,440 crore, loans to the tune of Rs 41,805 crore have been sanctioned. Farmers in some districts said banks were not ready to grant loans at this state. “Bankers are questioning us as to how can they grant us loans for paddy when there is so much talk about switching over to alternate crops,” said SK Vali, a farmer from Nalgonda. Some farmers said banks were playing a waiting time before deciding to grant the loan. In fact, banks provided only 5% of the planned loans for 2020-21. Only Rs 5,125 crore loans were provided for the summer crop. With seed suppliers being warned by the authorities not to sell paddy seed in big quantities, only a few suppliers few seed stocks with them. Officials said extension service efforts relating to paddy were also kept on hold. “For raw rice, there is scope in summer. Amid confusion over paddy procurement and concern over crop credit availability, we are at crossroads,” said M Manohar Reddy, a farmer from Suryapet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/banks-pause-farm-loan-pleasas-row-over-paddy-simmers/articleshow/88059175.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No lift-off for BEST’s wheelchair-friendly buses one year on||MUMBAI: Are BEST’s wheelchair-accessible buses really ‘friendly’ for differently-abled individuals? Can they board and alight buses with ease? On the eve of International Day of Disabled Persons, which falls on December 3, a city activist set out to find out exactly this with a test drive in the western suburbs. Jasmina Khanna, 49, found that merely having a wheelchair-lift on a bus does not help unless the staff is well-trained and the bus-stop is universally accessible. Armed with findings of her 'audit,' she plans to meet the General Manager of the BEST soon, hoping to bring about a change. About a year ago, the BEST had introduced 26 air-conditioned electric buses with a hydraulic lift for differently-abled passengers. The undertaking has since increased its fleet to 100 and has future plans to expand to 340. The BEST does not have to pay any money on capital costs for the buses as they are procured on 'wet lease' under a Centre-sponsored scheme. "Before the Covid-19 outbreak, I had to hire a special cab that could accommodate my wheelchair to commute to office 8km away from home every day. It used to be very expensive," said Khanna, a software tester by profession. "Now that offices have resumed post easing of restrictions, I decided to check if the accessible buses run by BEST are indeed so." On Thursday afternoon, Khanna and her physiotherapist, Sanket Khadilkar, reached Goregaon bus depot on New Link Road for a short commute up to Andheri. The first challenge before them was an inaccessible bus stop outside the depot. Khanna waited on the road in her wheelchair as the bus-stop had a short concrete barrier on all sides with no opening for wheelchair access. There was no signage on the bus-stop to indicate that accessible buses arrived there. The next challenge was to find an accessible bus. A couple of crowded buses simply passed by. At least two buses that did halt had non-functional wheelchair ramps. The driver of the third bus agreed to lower the ramp. He tried unsuccessfully for 10 minutes till a bystander intervened and explained how it was done. Once inside the bus, the safety clasps that keep a wheelchair in place couldn't be fastened. "I had to hold on to Khanna's wheelchair the entire time to prevent it from sliding off," said Khadilkar, adding that not more than one wheelchair can be accommodated at a time on these buses. Signage was missing inside the bus as were announcements about the next halt. At the Andheri depot, where the journey terminated, it took another five minutes to open and shut the hydraulic lift. "In case the lift wouldn't have functioned in the automatic mode, the driver did not know how to use the manual mode. We found the driver to be patient and willing to learn, but there is a lack of training," said Khanna. The BEST panel member told TOI that it was 'embarrassing' for the BEST if its staff was unable to operate the lifts. In 2004, the Bombay High Court had pointed out the lack of disabled-friendly public transport systems in the city. After the court order, BEST introduced five ultra low-floor buses in 2005. Totally. 30 buses were purchased then for Rs 26 lakh each, but they faced frequent breakdowns.  The rear engines of buses were noisy, and there was corrosion of the body due to humidity. More importantly, the buses had flooding during monsoons due to water ingress as the floor was low. It stayed off the road most of the time for maintenance after which it was pulled out of various routes and run only on a ring route in the Fort area. The BEST committee subsequently cancelled the further purchase of low-floor buses for Mumbai for Rs 64 lakh each in 2016. Khanna and Khadilkar through their NGO, Access to Hope, have earlier fought for accessible streets.  They pushed the civic body to rework Vile Parle's Nehru Road and a part of it is now universally accessible||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-lift-off-for-bests-wheelchair-friendly-buses-one-year-on/articleshow/88059848.cms||Nitasha Natu

He said a large number of passengers have been arriving in Trichy from high-risk countries. If anyone tested positive for the variant, they will be quarantined at the special ward exclusively established at the government hospital instead of Corona care centre wards, he added. The minister along with health secrertary J Radhakrishnan had arrived in Trichy from Madurai and was to fly to Coimbatore as part of inspecting passenger screening at these international airports. “We are ensuring screening and testing of all those from 11 high risk countries where Omicron variant cases are being reported. So far, no one has tested positive in Tamil Nadu,” he said at Madurai earlier. He said 477 international passengers who were tested at Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai and Trichy till Wednesday had tested negative for the Omicron variant.He said a separate holding area had been arranged at all the four airports for passengers to wait till they get the results of their RT-PCR tests which usually take 5-6 hours. Among the four airports in the state, RT-PCR tests are being done within a short duration at Trichy — results arrive within two-and-a-half hours. “Even if passengers from these high risk countries test negative, they still have to undergo home quarantine for seven days and an RT-PCR test has to be done on the eighth day. During home quarantine, a health inspector and officials from revenue department, panchayat and police will be monitoring,” he added.Subramanian said 2% of all international passengers who come from non-risk countries would also be tested for the Omicron variant. “For these 2% of international passengers and those from high risk countries who are from economically weaker backgrounds like workers, the RT-PCR tests will be done free of cost. Those who want to avoid waiting time can also undergo rapid Covid-19 testing at the airport for 3,400 if they can afford it,” he said.The minister said a temperature screening system for all passengers is in place at all airports and quickly isolating those who had fever for Covid-19 testing. “Those who test positive will be taken to the nearest Government Medical College Hospital and will be kept in a separate ward. Genome sequencing of samples is also being done from places like markets and educational institutions where clusters are reported,” he said. Finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan and commercial taxes minister P Moorthy were with him at Madurai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hundreds-of-fliers-tested-none-omicron-ve/articleshow/88059189.cms||---

It was never easy for the sleuths as operators have mastered the art of circumventing the conditions of the Beach Shack Policy. Whenever the department questions about the absence of an allottee at the shack during their surprise visit, the ready response will be “the person at the counter is his manager.” Despite Beach Shack Policy disallowing subletting, several indulge in the illegality without ever getting caught, and not a single case has been booked to date. “Since beach shacks do not fall under the GST bracket, it is not possible to prove illegalities of those who rent shacks,” a senior department official said. The policy requires allottees to submit a list of their staff members, which they do religiously. “In a way, it is a protection shield. The person whom a shack is sublet will be shown as the manager,” said a beach shack operator. The official said that there is no bar on appointing a manager, and if he is found running the shack, it can’t be proof enough to cancel the licence issued. “How do you prove subletting? We have tried,” he said. Another beach shack operator said that when a shack is sublet, the allottee does not transfer the licence as it is not permitted. The tourism department issues documents in the name of the allottee who pays the licence as well other fees charged by it and other departments. But when an allottee sublets, he recovers all fees paid by him from the tenant. “The agreement between the allottee and the tenant is an unwritten one. The tenant will pay him a sum that covers various fees and charges for the shack’s infrastructure. It’s like renting a furnished shack,” said the operator who has experience in subletting. Rent, he said, will depend on the location of the shack and type of furnishing. “The person renting it has a ready setup, and at the most, he may tweak the menu. Plus, he will have methods in place to recover the entire cost of the operation,” the shack operator said. Another operator said that there is a certain segment of allottees who apply for a shack solely with the purpose of subletting. Ninety per cent of the shacks are allotted to applicants having a three-year and plus experience and 10% to new entrants or those with a less than three years of experience. “Over the years, the number of eligible applicants has gone up while the number of beach shacks has remained static. Not surprisingly, competition has intensified,” the shack operator said. When a regular shack operator is not allotted a shack, he or she will rent a shack by paying Rs 3 to 4 lakh for a season,” he said. Every year, 340 to 350 beach shacks are allotted. The number may reduce for a beach stretch due to soil erosion or any other damage to the beach. As per the existing policy, shacks are allotted through a lottery every three years. The three-year validity of licences issued ends this season as also the Beach Shack Policy. For the 2022-23 season, the government will release a new shack policy paving the way for fresh allotments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/since-shacks-do-not-fall-under-gst-it-is-not-possible-to-prove-illegalities/articleshow/88059866.cms||Bindiya Chari

For the fourth consecutive day, TRS MP and floor leader in the Lok Sabha, Nama Nageswara Rao, gave an adjournment motion to speaker Om Birla to take up a discussion on paddy procurement in the House. Nageswara Rao said it was a crucial issue and linked to crores of farmers in the state. However, the Lok Sabha speaker did not allow the issue to be taken up in the House. “If Union minister G Kishan Reddy takes an initiative and holds a meeting on the contentious paddy issue with his colleague, Piyush Goyal, or FCI officials, we are ready to participate in the meeting as farmers’ issue is our top priority. He can also ensure the Centre issues a statement on the issue,” Nageswara Rao told the media in Delhi. He said Telangana BJP MPs were adopting a dual policy on the paddy issue for their political gains. “During the Business Advisory Committee meeting, I had requested the speaker to give an opportunity to discuss the paddy procurement issue. But the speaker is not allowing to take up the issue. The Centre is not making any statement either in the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha,” Khammam MP said. He said the speaker allowed him to speak on the issue, but after a few minutes they cut the mike. “Though Telangana BJP MPs were passing comments against us on the floor of the House, we are bearing with them for the sake of Telangana farmers,” he said.

On Wednesday, at around 5pm, the fire department was alerted by animal activist Mayur Hassija about a dog and a puppy being stranded in the Vaigai near Kamarajar bridge in Arappalayam. The department, along with Urvanam, an NGO engaged in animal rescue took up the rescue operation. With support from the department officials, activist Hassija and P R Vishwanath from Urvanum climbed down from the bridge on a rope ladder to reach the dog and puppy.“The dog and the puppy were on a mound of sand in the river but were completely surrounded by water. Hence the two could not attempt to climb out. The mother must have given birth nearby 50 days ago but now with water flowing, they were displaced and stuck,” said Vishwanath. The puppy was first rescued and after some resistance, the mother was also pulled up with a rescue net. Both the mother and the puppy are safe and the latter was also adopted by one of the fire and rescue services department officials. Public gathered near the Kamarajar bridge in numbers to see the rescue operation and the video of the incident was shared widely on social media platforms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/canines-stranded-in-the-middle-of-vaigai-rescued/articleshow/88059181.cms||---

The ruling is bound to have a positive bearing on similarly placed realty projects, t An apex court bench of Justice R Subhash Reddy and Justice Hrishikesh Roy, in a judgment on November 26, upheld the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) ruling of January 18, 2021 that protected the construction of four buildings and a clubhouse at Sai Exotica, a residential-cum-commercial project, being developed in Chikhali by Chinchwad-based Sai Baba Sales Private Limited. On November 17, 2020, the NGT had imposed a Rs2crore environmental compensation cost, besides, stopping construction of project. The SC had on December 11, 2020, set aside the NGT order and remitted the matter back to the green tribunal for fresh hearing. Later, the NGT passed the impugned (under challenge) order of January 18, 2021 against which the project proponent as well as the original applicant moved the SC, citing varied grounds. Lawyer Saurabh Kulkarni, who was part of the team that represented the builder, told TOI, “The question before the SC was that whether an environmental clearance granted under the provisions of a December 9, 2016 notification of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEFCC) was valid in the wake of a subsequent NGT ruling of December 8, 2017 in another case asking the MOEFCC to revisit and amend/rectify certain provisions under the 2016 notification." As per an MOEFCC notification of September 14, 2006, all projects with a construction of above 20,000sq m and below 1.50lakh sq m require an EC from the ministry’s State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA). The original applicant before the NGT had questioned the validity of the environmental clearance granted by the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation’s (PCMC) environment cell, claiming violation of the 2006 notification. However, the builder’s case was that the MOEFCC had issued another notification on December 9, 2016 stating that the environmental clearance can be obtained from the environment cell of the local authority. The builder had secured permission on November 28, 2017 under this 2016 notification. Barely 10 days after this permission, the NGT passed a ruling in another case, asking the MoEFCC to amend/rectify certain clauses of the 2016 notification. The original applicant claimed before the SC that the environment clearance granted by PCMC on November 28, 2017 can’t be legitimised in view of this NGT ruling and that the SEIAA ought to have issued the environmental clearance and not the PCMC. The SC bench observed that the project proponent can’t be expected to knock doors of an authority, not empowered at the relevant time, to process its applications. "In the present matter the appellant has acted on the EC and made substantial investments," the SC said and added, the builder has scrupulously adhered to the applicable legal framework during the concerned period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sc-cant-expect-builders-to-revisit-sanctioned-clearances/articleshow/88059190.cms||Vishwas Kothari
---||Delhi||Nizamuddin revival project wins two Unesco awards||NEW DELHI: There was double joy for Nizamuddin basti and the Aga Khan Trust for Culture on Thursday. The urban renewal initiative and conservation there, on since 2009, picked up twin awards from Unesco: Award of excellence 2021 and special recognition for sustainable development. “In Nizamuddin, we tried to undertake a model project that couples conservation of significant national monuments with multiple urban and socio-economic development initiatives to improve quality of life and visitor experience. We are delighted that Unesco has ratified this approach for conservation in the Indian context,” beamed Ratish Nanda, CEO, Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC). Nizamuddin basti, where the urban renewal is underway, comprises 20 monuments and heritage structures. While conserving Chausat Khamba, Ataga Khan’s tomb, Jamaat Khana Mosque, Nizamuddin Baoli and Tilangani's tomb, the project also focused on improving the education, health, sanitation, water availability and employment prospects for the area’s communities. “Generations of my family have lived in the basti,” said Mohammad Hamad. “When we first learnt of the conservation project starting here in 2007, we were scared that our houses would be demolished and we would be displaced. But our fears proved wrong. Volunteers from Aga Khan Trust went from door to door coaxing basti women to get training in cookery, stitching and in other income-bringing initiatives. They encouraged them to move out of isolation in homes. Today, Zaika-e-Nizamuddin and Insha-e-Noor, eateries run by the basti women, have been featured in Park Hyatt hotel in Hyderabad and Marriott Hotel in Mumbai.” Just past Phoool Wali Gali at a heritage building called Mashaikh Manzil, women’s self-help groups began cooking some locality favourites for sale, beginning with a high-nutrition laddoo sold for Rs 5. Today, the initiative has transformed into a fully functional kitchen that makes delicacies like kebabs, nihari and biryani. Noor Jahan, who is head of the 11-member kitchen team, said, “Initially, we thought we wouldn’t make much money from this because we were earning only Rs 200 per day. But it was good to work outside our homes. We gained popularity only after 2015 and each of us now earn in the thousands every month.” Fifteen other women in another self-help group fabricate handicrafts like cloth elephants in the same building. Yet others have been trained to make souvenirs in paper and textiles marked with motifs from Chausath Khamba and Humayun’s Tomb. Life for local residents and visiting pilgrims have been improved by the diverse project components ranging from community toilets, landscaped parks, proper housing, vocational training, childhood care and development and cultural revival. During the revamp, the masonry wall built in the 1980s to limit access to Chausat Khamba was dismantled and replaced with a transparent fence using motifs from the decorative lattice screens of the mausoleum. The forecourt was paved with stone in a manner that not only enhanced the historic character but also the creation of the performance space for concerts and cultural festivals. “The conservation was carried out keeping in mind the Nizamuddin society’s well-being,” said Ujwala Menon, member of AKTC. Among the most important conservations of the project is Ataga Khan’s tomb, a fine example of early Mughal architecture. The mausoleum is profusely ornamented and uses a combination of red sandstone and white marble with red sandstone inlay panels on all four facades and decorative inscribed marble panels with handmade tile inlay work in its spandrels “The conservation work included restoring the missing inlay panels on the facade and the incised, ornamental plasterwork on the interiors,” said Menon. The structure was built in 1566-67 by Atgah Khan’s son, Mirza Aziz Kokaltash. Its conservation was taken up by AKTC in collaboration with Archaeological Survey of India, South Delhi Municipal Corporation, Delhi Urban Heritage Foundation and Nizamuddin Dargah Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nizamuddin-revival-project-wins-two-unesco-awards/articleshow/88059851.cms||Zumbish

Then, even the slightest chances of getting one are lost due to paper leaks. Also, if one is able to successfully take exams for securing a government job, results are not announced for years, and then, the exams get annulled due to some scam.” Gandhi further wrote that “as many as 1.25 crore youths are waiting for the results of Railway Group D exams for the past two years.” “Those awaiting recruitment in the army are in a similar situation. For how long will youngsters of India have to be patient?” Recently, Gandhi had demanded action against "education mafia and their political patrons." This was soon after the Uttar Pradesh Teacher Eligibility Test (UPTET) paper leak on November 27. Elaborating on his tweets, Gandhi told TOI, “The avenues of employment for the average young person in rural India are largely restricted to seeking a government job. With the government employing lesser than ever in every sector- defence, police, railways, education- a sense of frustration is developing amongst the youth.” He added that “in the last two years, 17 exams have been cancelled due to paper leaks in the state of UP alone.” Gandhi has of late been critical of the government's handling of economic and employment issues, without directly targeting the central dispensation. He has also tweeted in support of the farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws. On October 5, he shared a video of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and demanded arrest of owners of the vehicles that allegedly mowed down protesters. Earlier, the BJP MP had written strongly-worded letters to UP CM Yogi Adityanath, outlining several measures that could "help farmers improve their revenues and resolve their issues," including increasing sugarcane prices, and doubling the amount of the PM Kisan scheme and bonus on wheat and paddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/17-exams-cancelled-due-to-paper-leaks-in-last-2-years-varun-gandhi/articleshow/88058387.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||World||Covid curbs come back as more countries report Omicron cases||BERLIN/WASHINGTON: Germany decided on Thursday to bar the unvaccinated from all but the most essential businesses and the US was due to announce further travel curbs as countries around the globe scramble to keep out the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said the variant showed the pandemic could be around for “some time”, as countries including India, France, Finland, Greece and Singapore reported their first cases. The US reported its second case of the Omicron variant in Minnesota on Thursday, the state’s health department announced, just a day after the US reported its first case of the new variant in California. The new measures agreed in Germany focus on the unvaccinated, who will only be allowed in essential businesses such as grocery stores and pharmacies, while legislation to make vaccination mandatory will be drafted for early next year. “We have understood that the situation is very serious and that we want to take further measures in addition to those already taken,” Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference. A nationwide vaccination mandate could take effect from February 2022 after it is debated in the Bundestag and after guidance from Germany’s Ethics Council, she said. Eager to avoid derailing a fragile recovery of Europe’s biggest economy, Germany kept businesses open to the almost 69% of the population that is fully vaccinated as well as those with proof of having recovered from the virus. In the US, the Biden administration was expected to announce steps included extending requirements for travellers to wear masks through mid-March. By early next week the US will require inbound international travellers to be tested for Covid-19 within a day of departure, regardless of vaccination status. It will also require private health insurance companies to reimburse customers for at-home Covid-19 tests, a senior official said. The first known US case, announced late on Wednesday, was a fully vaccinated person in California who had travelled to South Africa. The second case concerned a Minnesota resident, an adult male who had a recent travel history to New York City, and had been fully vaccinated. He developed mild symptoms on November 22 and sought Covid-19 testing on November 24, the state’s health department said, adding that his symptoms have resolved. The two French cases, in the greater Paris region and in eastern France, were passengers arriving respectively from Nigeria and South Africa. Finland confirmed its first case of the Omicron variant on a person who had returned from Sweden. Other people travelling with the person had also tested positive for the coronavirus, but the variant was not yet confirmed from their samples. Greece detected its first case of the Omicron variant on the island of Crete in a Greek citizen who had arrived from southern Africa on November 26, health minister Thanos Plevris told reporters on Thursday. Singapore detected two imported cases in travellers who arrived on a flight from Johannesburg. They were isolated upon arrival in the island state on December 1 and had not interacted in the community. Both individuals, who tested negative during their pre-departure tests, are fully vaccinated and have mild symptoms. Russia, meanwhile, has imposed a two-week quarantine for travellers from some African countries including South Africa, the Interfax news agency said, quoting a senior official. Hong Kong extended a travel ban to more countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/covid-curbs-come-back-as-more-countries-report-omicron-cases/articleshow/88060917.cms||---

Subramanian, a worker, said that none of the members of his family had yet taken the vaccine. Residents like T Shanmugam of K K Nagar says that it is a good move to vaccinate all the employees of the public sector companies and departments, as they were the contact point for many people.Meanwhile, AMMK leader TTV Dhinakaran took to social media and condemned the announcement. Workers of the electricity board are those who serve the people selflessly during calamities, even when their own lives are in danger. A good administrative move would be to make arrangements to get all the staff of the TNEB vaccinated, instead of threatening them with such circulars, he said.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tangedco-draws-flak-for-vax-circular/articleshow/88059196.cms||---
---||Nagpur||84% know sickle cell is disability, 60% unaware of certification||Nagpur: On World Disability Day, the National Alliance of Sickle Cell Organisations (NASCO) has released details of the survey it conducted in 8 states of India where the prevalence of the the disease (CSD) is high. Total 84% of the patients know that it’s a disability but less than 41% have the disability certificates. As far as Maharashtra (especially Vidarbha) is concerned, 25% patients never ever applied for the certificate while 24.5% don’t even have any idea that they get such a certification. The overall data from this survey is an eye-opener and underlines the need for awareness among patients. Gautam Dongre, secretary of NASCO, told TOI that the patients must be made aware about their rights and recognition after getting the unique disability ID (UDID). “The survey had participants from Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Telangana and Kerala. The awareness level is different in these states. In Maharashtra, nearly 50% patients are aware of their rights,” said Dongre. Although the NASCO survey shares alarming reality about the sickle cell patients, the picture is not different for other disabilities too. Dr Harleen Uppal, associate professor, department of physical medicine and rehabilitation (PMR) at AIIMS Nagpur, said a very few people are aware about services, facilities available for comprehensive rehabilitation of persons with disability so that they can reintegrate into common society. “The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, is the disability legislation passed by the Parliament. But the awareness about the Act, benefits given and opportunities of rehabilitation of persons with disability need to be publicized at mass level,” Dr Uppal said. As far as AIIMS Nagpur is concerned, it has a PMR department with advanced facilities and right from neuro-rehabilitation, paediatric rehabilitation, cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation and post-Covid rehabilitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/84-know-sickle-cell-is-disability-60-unaware-of-certification/articleshow/88059201.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

She also took a dig at the pending payments of sugarcane growers and said that total cane dues of the farmers are Rs 4,000 crore while "PM Narendra Modi has spent Rs 8,000 crore in buying aircraft for his luxury". Gandhi later apologised to the residents of Moradabad for turning up after a long time at her "sasural (in-laws house)". "I remember this place since the time after marriage. Moradabad was called 'peetal nagri (brass city)'. It was a prosperous city and there were plans of developing the city and preparing an airport here. There were facilities for the exporters and artisans here, but now it has been turned into 'andher nagari (dark city)'. The trade has been ruined and the livelihood of about two lakh artisans finished due to wrong policies of the BJP government in the form of demonetisation and the GST,” she added. Speaking on Lakhimpur Kheri violence, she said, “The PM never uttered a word, CM Yogi kept mum, instead they shared the stage with the same accused minister and he is yet to be expelled. The families of the farmers mowed down by the minister’s son want justice, not money. They say that justice can’t be served till the time the minister is in power." She further said, “The biggest thing that came out of farmers’ protest is that the power is in your own hands. You should recognise this power. Other than these three farm laws, there are other major issues of the farmers and the government is ignoring them.” The Congress leader also claimed that it is only her party which is talking about development issues ahead of next year's state election while others are playing the caste and religion cards. "The CM does not think he is answerable to people. During election time, he gets away by talking about religion and dividing people," Priyanka said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/cane-dues-of-farmers-rs-4kcr-but-pm-spends-rs-8kcr-for-his-aircraft-says-priyanka-gandhi/articleshow/88058402.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Drizzle drags maximum temperature to season low of 19.8 degrees Celsius||NEW DELHI: Delhi experienced light rain on Thursday that pulled the day-time temperature down by 4 degrees Celsius over the past 24 hours even as the weather department expects more rain over the next three days. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 19.8 degrees Celsius — lowest of the season, while a rise in the humidity levels due to the drizzling and mist brought the visibility down to 500 metres in most parts of the city. While the visibility improved by 1pm, drizzling brought it down again, India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said. The minimum temperature spiked by 2 degrees Celsius as an effect of westerly winds towards Wednesday midnight, but the weather was chilly due to the lower day-time temperatures. “The maximum temperature at Safdarjung, the city’s main observatory, was 19.8 degrees Celsius, significantly lower than normal, due to cloudy skies and very light rain in the afternoon,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. “It is five degrees Celsius below normal. However, it is not a cold day as the minimum temperature is required to be below 10 degrees Celsius, which was not the case today,” he clarified. According to IMD, Delhi saw drizzle due to a feeble western disturbance while a stronger western disturbance may bring better shower around December 5-6. Western disturbance is a flow of high moisture winds and clouds from Mediterranean Sea to Himalayas that forms a low-pressure area and sometimes leads to thunder activities in north India. IMD recorded on Thursday a minimum temperature of 13.4 degrees Celsius, which was four degrees above the season’s average as against 11.5 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The maximum temperature was recorded at 19.8 degrees Celsius as against 23 degrees on Wednesday. “As predicted, Delhi experienced poor visibility throughout the day with very light rainfall from Thursday afternoon. At Safdarjung, the visibility was consistently poor with 600-800m due to mist, fog and smog in the first half of the day and then drizzling and mist from 1pm till 5.30pm. The winds were almost calm, with light speed of 5-7kmph observed at some places,” said Jenamani. According to IMD, Friday will not see drizzling, but the day will be cloudy and begin with a shallow fog in the morning. The maximum and minimum temperatures on Friday may hover around 23 and 12 degrees Celsius, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/drizzle-drags-max-temp-to-season-low-of-19-8c/articleshow/88059873.cms||---

Murli Dhar Singh, who’s deputy director of information department, Ayodhya division, termed Modi as the incarnation of Lord Shiva and Yogi Adityanath as the incarnate of ‘Bhratrhari’, the 5th century seer and author of two Sanskrit books — Vyakyapadia and Sphota. And he has termed RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat as the incarnation of Lord Brihaspati, an important deity in Hindu pantheon known for sacred wisdom. Singh said, “As a citizen and official with UP government, I have expressed my feelings as the Constitution has given the right of speech and expression to every Indian. The Kashi Vishwanath Dham has been expanded and renovated for the first time in independent India by PM Narendra Modi. It was renovated more than 240 years ago by Hindu queen Maharani Ahliyabai Holkar.

Former Uppal MLA suggested that government abolish VAT on diesel used by RTC buses to assist organisation in reducing losses. “RTC has highly valuable properties throughout the state that are leased out at a throwaway price.

---||Kochi||Kerala: CPM in dock as ex-MLA KV Kunhiraman too arraigned in Periya twin murder||Kochi: The CBI has arraigned CPM former MLA and Kasaragod district secretariat member K V Kunhiraman (59) as an accused in the Periya double murder case. Kunhiraman and nine others, including five persons arrested by the agency on Wednesday, have been named in a report filed at Ernakulam chief judicial magistrate court.  The court on Thursday remanded the five accused, including a CPM branch secretary, in judicial custody till December 15. The case pertains to the murder of two Youth Congress activists Kripesh and Sarath Lal at Kalliyot in Kasaragod on February 17, 2019. Kunhiraman (A20) -- along with Manikandan (A14), Raghavan Velutholi (A21) and K V Bhaskaran (A22) -- has been accused of forcibly taking away Saji George (A2) from police detention on February 18 night . Besides these accused, the agency has accused Gopan Velutholi (A23) and Sandeep Velutholi (A24) of providing logistical assistance to the hit team. Sources said the CBI had questioned Kunhiraman twice and is looking to procure evidence regarding his direct involvement in the murder. Those arrested on Wednesday are A Surendran alias Vishnu Sura (A15), Madhu alias Sastha Madhu (A16), Regi Varghese (A17), Hariprasad A (A18) and Rajesh P alias Raju (A19). The CBI did not file a custody application for these persons but sources said they had played crucial roles in the crime. The agency is trying to file a final report before December 4, the deadline set by the high court, they said. According to the agency, Vishnu Sura was assaulted along with the first accused, Peethambaran, on January 5, 2019 by Sarath Lal and others, which led to the murders. “He telephoned Peethambaran, as instructed, on the day of the crime after Sarath Lal and Kripesh left on a bike. He also actively participated in the conspiracy," the CBI report said. Rajesh P Raju, CPM branch secretary of Echladukkam; Madhu, uncle of A5 Gijin and A7 Aswin; and Reji Varghese have been accused of conspiracy and facilitating the murders. Hari Prasad, a former clerk with the CPM-controlled Periya society, has been accused of transporting the accused in his car. “During interrogation, they admitted their role in the conspiracy but did not reveal the subsequent acts. They did not cooperate with the investigation and they were arrested after observing all legal formalities,” the CBI submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cpm-in-dock-as-kunhiraman-too-arraigned-in-periya-twin-murder/articleshow/88059215.cms||---

The saffron party has lost ground in UP. This is the reason its leaders are resorting to the Mandir-Masjid issue,” said Maulana Mufti Asad Qasmi, national vice president of Deoband-based Ittihad Ulema-i-Hind. Qasmi accused the BJP of playing the communal cards as “the party had failed to perform in the state in the past five years”. “Whenever elections come, the BJP will do these things, as the party does not have any other thing to show to the people. They have not performed in the past five years in UP. Everyone is struggling under the BJP rule. Unemployment is a big issue in the country.” Maurya had tweeted barely a few hours after right-wing group Hindu Mahasabha announced its plans to install statues of Lord Krishna at the Shahi Idgah on December 6. “Ayodhya, Kashi bhavya mandir nirman jari hai… Mathura ki tayyari hai… (Foundations of a grand temple in Ayodhya and Kashi have begun, now preparations are being made for Mathura),” read the tweet. The deputy CM’s tweet was criticised by many and had immediately triggered a political row.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/mauryas-mathura-temple-tweet-shows-bjp-on-shaky-ground-in-up-deoband-cleric/articleshow/88058406.cms||Mohd Dilshad

However, construction work related to pedestrian and cycling tracks has been completed,” said district magistrate R Rajesh Kumar. The DM, who is the chief executive officer of the smart city project, took stock of the work ongoing in the area on Tuesday. For now, workers have been asked to level the ground to prepare it for the rally on Saturday. “We have been asked to level the whole place by December 3. Nearly 100 workers have been hired to complete the task within the deadline. We already have prepared the stage and fixed the washrooms. The barricading will be done soon,” said a labour contractor at the spot. While officials did not comment on economic losses incurred due to the halting of the development works, locals complain of traffic congestion in the area. “The narrow stretch has been congested further by JCBs and other big machines. The whole place was dug up but they have been carrying out patchwork for the past two days. However, no such step is being taken for the area surrounding the Parade Ground. We can only imagine how chaotic it will get when the PM arrives here,” said Dinesh Kumar, an autorickshaw driver. In the wake of upcoming assembly elections, PM Modi is expected to address a rally from the Parade Ground and inaugurate projects worth Rs 3,000 crore in Dehradun. This will be the PM’s third visit to the poll-bound state in the last three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/smart-city-work-halted-at-parade-ground-for-pm-modis-doon-visit/articleshow/88058405.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The petition was filed by two social workers from the village through advocate Dharmesh Gurjar. They complained that as the panchayat elections are due later this month, the election authority published a notification on November 22 declaring that the seats of sarpanch at Shahpur, Unawa and Dashela villages will remained reserved for SC candidates in accordance with the Gujarat Gram Panchayat Election (The Method of Simultaneous Allotment of Reserved Seats) Rules, 1994. However, on November 23, the roster for Shahpur village was changed and the seat, which was to remain reserved for an SC candidate, was changed to a general category candidate. The petitioner claimed that this change happened due to an unknown reason and came as a shock to them because the village has sizeable numbers of people from SC communities and other backward classes. The authorities revoked the decision for reservation with malafide intention. They have demanded quashing of the decision converting the seat to one for a general category candidate. The court issued notice and posted a further hearing for December 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-moved-after-sc-quota-for-village-panchayat-withdrawn/articleshow/88059227.cms||---

---||Delhi||Omicron variant: Four more with travel history admitted to Lok Nayak Hospital||NEW DELHI: The number of people suspected to be infected with the Omicron variant of Covid-19 has reached 10 in Delhi. All of them are admitted in the special ward of Lok Nayak Hospital that has been designated to isolate and treat travellers from at-risk countries who test positive for Covid-19 or show symptoms of the disease. “We have sent samples of all the travellers for genome sequencing to confirm whether they are infected with the Omicron variant. The report is awaited,” said a hospital source. The source added that four people, including two men and two women, were admitted to the special ward on Thursday. All travellers, except one with a history of travel to Tanzania, are asymptomatic. “The person with a history of travel to Tanzania has high fever and body ache and he is being administered medication to manage the symptoms,” said a senior doctor. Covid-19 was marked by high fever, dry cough and a dip in oxygen saturation in the first and second waves. However, reports from South Africa, where Omicron was detected first, suggest that the new variant leads mostly to extreme fatigue and body ache, among other symptoms. Six people with a history of travel to the UK (1), Belgium (1) and African nations (4) were referred to Lok Nayak Hospital on Wednesday from IGI Airport. Hospital sources said all of them were stable and had no symptoms. A dedicated team of doctors, nurses and other staff members has been deputed in the ward. They are trained to look after the high-risk patients with utmost precaution to not get themselves infected. The Lok Nayak Hospital director said all staff members posted in the ward had been asked to wear PPE kits and maintain distance. Preliminary data with World Health Organisation (WHO) suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalisation in South Africa, but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people getting infected, rather than a result of specific infection with Omicron. “There is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with Omicron are different from those of other variants. Initial reported infections were among university students, but understanding the level of severity of the Omicron variant will take days to several weeks. All variants of Covid-19, including the Delta variant that is dominant worldwide, can cause severe disease or death, in particular to the most vulnerable people, so prevention is the key,” added WHO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/4-more-with-travel-history-admitted/articleshow/88059897.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

---||Dehradun||Tree felling for Del-Doon e-way: NGT asks for mitigation measures||DEHRADUN: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Thursday gave petitioners a week to submit a list of mitigation measures that can be deployed in the matter related to the proposed felling of over 11,000 trees for the Delhi-Dehradun expressway. The court said it will pronounce its judgment thereafter. The 206-km-long expressway will reduce travel time between Delhi and Dehradun to less than three hours from five. A 12-km stretch on the expressway that connects Meerut's Ganeshpur and Dehradun will have an elevated wildlife corridor. It is set to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. Officials claim it is Asia's longest wildlife corridor. Himanshu Arora, secretary of Citizens for Green Doon (CFGD), said, "Arguments between both parties went on for over one-and-a-half hours. The court is set to pronounce its judgment within the next two weeks." CFGD is a petitioner in the case. Arora added that his organisation raised several issues before the tribunal on Thursday, which included the lack of an environmental impact assessment (EIA). CFGD alleged that like the Char Dham all-weather road project, this project was also divided into multiple "packages" and phases to overcome the mandatory EIA. “This project is almost 210-km-long. It should have undergone a mandatory EIA, but it didn't. It's not just about the animals. The entire Shivalik landscape is at stake,” said Arora. An EIA is an assessment carried out to measure the impact of a planned activity on the environment, which includes the biodiversity, vegetation, ecology, and the water and air of the area. Experts are concerned that the felling of trees will cause soil erosion in the porus Shivalik landscape, which can lead to floods on the Indo-Gangetic plains. The felling of over 11,000 trees is proposed on the 19-km stretch that connects Saharanpur and Dehradun. Over half of the expressway's last 20-km stretch has been declared a "critical wildlife crossing" by a Wildlife Institute of India report. This means that it is a traditional habitat of wild animals and is used by them to cross from one side of the forest to another. TOI had earlier raised the issue of an around 2,500-century-old British-era Saal forest that stretches from the Daat Kaali temple to Asharori, and which may be axed under this project on the Uttarakhand stretch. The trees may never regrow as they are apex species. Thereafter, CGFD, through an RTI, discovered that 8,800 trees will be felled on the UP stretch for the road project. Dehradun-based activist Reenu Paul took the matter to the Uttarakhand high court as she was concerned about the Shivalik landscape, which is an extension of the lower Himalayas and is famous for its rich habitat of apex carnivores such as tigers and megaherbivores such as elephants. The CGFD also took this matter before the Supreme Court, which referred it back to the NGT, and pronounced a stay on the felling of trees until November 26. The NGT subsequently heard the case on November 25. The next hearing will take place after two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tree-felling-for-del-doon-e-way-ngt-asks-for-mitigation-measures/articleshow/88057640.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Trichy||Floods set to influence real estate preferences in Trichy city, suburbs||Trichy: The massive waterlogging and flood in several residential areas of the city and suburbs after 16 years are set to influence buyers’ demands in land and real estate projects. While land promoters feel that the need for stormwater drains in residential layouts would increase, builders say there are chances of apartment projects blooming even in the suburbs. In the recent floods in Karumandapam, Kuzhumani road and Vayalur road, most of the apartments had remained unaffected as the ground floor was marked for the parking lot, thereby helping residents escape inundation woes. However, most of the areas in the suburbs where the demand for land was high were flooded by the overflowing Kodingal, Ariyar and Korayar rivers. “The waterlogging in layouts may affect the sales prospects but we do not think that the prices will nosedive. Residential plots in low-lying areas will offer stormwater drain network to convince buyers,” K Dharman, a land promoter from Trichy city said. He said layouts in the flooded area may see people bargaining for lower prices . As far as housing projects are concerned, real estate developers plan to come up with add-ons to overcome the inundation threats. Perforated pipe systems with underground sumps to avoid surface level inundation and reinforced cement concrete (RCC) walls for lifts to avoid seepage were among the methods likely to be adopted for new flats in the inundation-prone areas. “We expect the demand for apartments to increase post the flooding as the first floor itself will be around 13 feet above the ground level. We may have to increase the height of the foundation level in low-lying areas,” S Anand, chairman, Jeyam builders, said. As the core residential neighbourhoods in the city are already saturated, residents have a few choices on other than in the extension areas and suburbs that have been flooded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/floods-set-to-influence-real-estate-preferences-in-trichy-city-suburbs/articleshow/88059228.cms||Deepak Karthik

As many as eight centres will be set up in the city where people can donate new or used clothes. The centre coordinators will then arrange for its distribution among the needy. After launching the scheme, district magistrate Abhishek Prakash said, “LMC’s zonal offices have been made collection points. People can also visit the district administration’s website for more details.” TimesViewMany people who want to donate clothes to the needy are not able to do so either due to paucity of time or lack of information about where to go. The initiative of district administration and LMC will now act as a bridge and people should make maximum use of it.“People can send clothes by post to the zonal office of LMC of their respective area or call at the numbers issued by the district administration and delivery men will collect clothes from their home. They can also visit these zonal offices and deliver clothes themselves,” he added. “At present, there are 36 shelter homes in Lucknow - 20 permanent and 16 temporary.

---||Delhi||Delhi: First Covid, then pollution; stop-start schooling hits morale||NEW DELHI: When the principal announced to the students at the end of the classes on Thursday that the school was closed again, the children wanted to know if Covid was the reason. When the principal replied it was because of pollution, many of them laughed. “What’s the point!” one exclaimed, “it’s either this or that.” The constant opening and closing of schools have left feathers ruffled. Schools resumed in the first week of November after the Covid closure, but were closed due to pollution on November 13, a week after students started attending classes in person. They reopened again on November 29. TimesViewThese are extraordinary times and some degree of flexibility is needed, but such frequent and unsettling changes are best avoided. They are upsetting for everybody involved – students, teachers, parents, even school authorities. We need a more consistent policy for schools in the Covid world.Tanya Agarwal, a lawyer and parent of a Class I student, said she did not have the heart to tell her 6-year-old that he couldn’t go to school again. “He was in good spirits after meeting his friends and teachers today for the second time in 600+ days. I have to tell him now that he cannot return to the school in the foreseeable future because the Supreme Court thinks going to school will be bad for him,” said Agarwal. Mother of a 7-year-old, Pritha Srikumar calls such a closure a “knee-jerk reaction”. She said, “The decision does not consider ground realities or the real issues facing all of north India during the annual winter pollution season. The issue is not limited to Delhi alone. Are schools across north India to shut down? Most children don’t have access to more purified air at home. It is assumed that all school-going children have access to air purifiers and seamless digital access to learning. The impact of the loss of education on account of Covid is incalculable. Sadly, no one seems to have benefited and the kids have certainly lost out on education.” Another mother of two children questioned why prohibiting private cars and shutting down airports and play areas in the malls and parks wasn’t being considered but only schools were. “I can’t believe this. The vast majority of the children of our city are breathing in the same air at home and in school,” said Vaidehi Kanoria. “You have neglected our children for too long. My children have lost faith in being in school in Delhi and want to be shifted to an embassy school or a school in Gurgaon or Noida.” Lalan Kumar, assistant professor at IIT, Delhi, too has a question for the government. The father of two children asked, “How is the government making sure that children will get pure air by closing schools? Let the parents decide whether they want to send their children for classes or not.” Another parent, Ravi Khatri, however, wasn’t against suspending classes when the air quality was so bad in the city. “Protecting the children is the right decision,” he said. “However, opening or closing schools shouldn’t be the prerogative of an official or a court. Scientifically arrived figures on pollution should decide this. Schools, for instance, should be closed if the AQI remains above 400 for 24 hours and opened if it descends to 300 for 24 hours.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/either-this-or-that-parents-kids-irked/articleshow/88059904.cms||Shradha Chettri

Since the state legislature is not in session and other improvements are required to be made, the governor granted permission to issue the ordinance. It was signed by the governor on November 30.  The ordinance states Section 5 of the BMC Act stipulates the number of directly elected representatives. The current number of representatives is based on the 2001 census. No change has been made in the number of seats for elected representatives. Based on the 2011 census, there has been an almost 3.9% increase in the population within the BMC’s jurisdiction. Considering the increase in population and rapid urbanisation, it was felt necessary to increase electoral representation in the BMC. Hence, a change is being proposed in Section 5 of the Act. The BMC has proposed five additional seats in the western suburbs, three in the eastern and one in the island city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-formally-increases-bmc-electoral-seats-to-236-from-227/articleshow/88059900.cms||---

It plans to control the water supply at the jackwell of Khadakwasla from where the PMC lifts water in its pipeline. “The irrigation department has been demanding that the PMC reduce water usage from Khadakwasla dam as it has started lifting water from Bhama Askhed dam. But no step to reduce water usage has been taken by the civic body so far. So, the irrigation department now plans to control the supply,” stated the letter issued by the irrigation department to the PMC. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “The increased demand for water in PMC areas after the merger of 34 villages should be considered by the irrigation officials. The department’s decision should be scrapped and guardian minister Ajit Pawar should give orders accordingly,” he said. Irrigation department officials said as per the contract, 11 TMC water has been allotted to the PMC, so around 900 to 950 MLD water should be lifted from Khadkwasla. But the PMC has been lifting 1,460 MLD from the dam, while 180 and 200 MLD is being lifted from Bhama Askhed per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/irrigation-dept-plans-to-curb-water-supply-in-pmc-areas/articleshow/88059232.cms||---

A team headed by senior police inspector Arvind Gokule arrested the woman in front of a jewellery shop in Hadapsar on Tuesday. During investigation, police recovered 12 stolen rings worth Rs6.23 lakh. With her arrest, the police solved jewellery theft complaints registered with the Faraskhana, Kothrud, Chinchwad, Chakan, Bhosari and Sahakarnagar police stations. Speaking about the woman’s modus operandi, Gokule said, “She used to buy an imitation gold ring and put a tag on it. She’d visit a shop as a customer and demand a similar ring. She used to divert the salesperson’s attention and replace the original ring with the imitation ring.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-held-for-stealing-gold-rings-from-12-shops/articleshow/88059233.cms||---
---||Delhi||Collections from Covid challans decline after July||New Delhi: The Covid-19 threat continues, but the seven-month data on enforcement action against safety-norm violations reveals that the number of challans has been consistently dipping since August. The Delhi government collected Rs 36.2 crore in July as fine from people violating Covid-appropriate behaviour, but in November, till 25th, the count stood at Rs 17.6 crore. In July, 6,424 FIRs were registered while only 2,078 FIRs have been registered in November. The number of challans has come down every month since August though scores of people are seen violating Covid protocols at crowded markets and other public places, which may spread the novel coronavirus infection again. The challan numbers increased significantly between May and July when the second Covid wave tore through the city. In May, 85,175 challans were issued, which increased to 1,58,341 in June and 2,11,267 in July. But since August, the number has been decreasing — 1,81,103 challans were issued in August, 1,69,370 in September, 1,27,862 in October and 93,583 till November 25. An official said several enforcement teams had been deployed in various public places across 11 districts. “Earlier, teachers were also engaged in enforcement action, but since the schools have opened, we are facing manpower issues,” he said. Currently, 156 enforcement teams are deployed with 129 enforcement vehicles. The focus areas include mandis, ISBTs, railway stations, shops, malls, market complexes, weekly markets and restaurants. Experts have repeatedly warned against complacency and advised following all Covid protocols, especially wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, to maintain the hold on the pandemic spread and avoid another deadly wave. Representatives of different market associations claimed that nothing was under their control unless a person entered their premises. “We request customers without masks to wear them when they enter our premises,” said a trader. Niranjan Poddar, president of Automotive and General Traders Welfare Association of Mori Gate, said that since it was a public health crisis, all market associations should come forward and ensure that the customers wear masks. “Nobody is safe until everybody is safe. We are organising a vaccination camp in association with the Delhi government on Friday at Mori Gate to give an opportunity to unvaccinated people to get the shots,” Poddar said. The detection of Omicron, a new novel coronavirus variant, has made enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour more essential. Large numbers of international flights land at the Delhi airport, putting the city and its people at higher risk. Fresh Covid cases are under control as of now, but some travellers from “at-risk” countries have been referred to Lok Nayak Hospital, which has a separate Omicron isolation facility. Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Monday emphasised on the need for strict enforcement of Covid norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/collections-from-covid-challans-decline-after-july/articleshow/88059924.cms||AlokKNMishra

The biopsy can also determine how quickly the disease is progressing, informed Prof HL Trivedi, faculty at institute of transplantation services, Ahmedabad on Thursday. He was addressing teachers and students at the 109th foundation day ceremony of KGMU’s pathology department. In case, ther is blood discharge in urine and tests are not able to detect the source, biopsy of kidney tissues can confirm if the problem is due to some issue in the organ. Head of the pathology department Prof US Singh presented the annual report of the department. KGMU vice-chancellor Lt Gen (retd) Dr Bipin Puri gave certificates of appreciation to four junior residents of the department, Dr Deval Brajesh Dubey, Dr Shweta Verma, Dr Pooja Dwivedi and Dr Swati Agnihotri for their exemplary work.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Jamiat Ulama E withdraws legal aid for 2 accused in Malad ISIS case||MUMBAI: Jamiat Ulama E Maharashtra’s legal cell, which was providing legal aid to Rizwan Ahmed (24) and Mohsin Sayyed (33) who were accused of instigating youth from Malwani in Malad to join the terror group ISIS in 2015, said that they do not support their action of wanting to plead guilty, and hence are withdrawing legal aid with immediate effect. Sayyed’s lawyer Wahab Khan said that on November 26, he made his decision known to him. Khan said that despite assurances that the case was progressing favourably, Sayyed did not relent. It is the prosecution’s case that in 2015, the family members of wanted accused Ayaz Mohammed, Sayyed and the two renegade youths, who are now witnesses in the case, filed a missing person’s complaint with the Malwani police station. It was claimed that the four used to take keen interest in ISIS-related news and also held discussions on the outlawed group’s activities. It was further submitted that two of the youths returned home. On December 30, 2015, the anti-terrorism squad (ATS) registered an FIR against Mohammed and other unknown persons. Following investigations it was alleged that in 2015, Mohammed entered into a criminal conspiracy with Ahmed, Sayyed and his handler—absconding accused Yusuf Al Hindi—to propagate ISIS’s jihadi activities. Ahmed, a Uttar Pradesh-based student, was arrested in January 2016. He was accused of being the ‘nayab ameer’ (rank of a senior leader) of Jundul Khilafa Al-Hind (JKH) which allegedly had allegiance to the ISIS in India. It was alleged that on the instructions of his handler, Ahmed travelled to Chennai and Bengaluru with the intention of identifying and spotting vulnerable Muslim youths who could be targeted to join ISIS for ‘jihad’. He is also accused of arriving in Mumbai for the same purpose in December 2015 with Sayyed’s help. The NIA took over the investigations in March 2016. The chargesheet was subsequently submitted. Ahmed, in his bail plea before the HC, had said that he was merely a child in 2013, when Mohammed’s alleged radicalisation had begun. He said that Mohammed had left on his own accord and there was no evidence to show that they knew each other. His bail plea had said that allegations that he was the ‘nayab ameer’ of JKH was a “figment of imagination”. “It is highly improbable that the young boy of less than 20 years makes the chances of him being in a high position of an international terrorist organisation,” Ahmed’s bail plea had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-outfit-withdraws-legal-aid-for-2-accused-in-malad-isis-case/articleshow/88059928.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Mumbai||Reasons behind Param Bir Singh's suspension order||MUMBAI: According to the 3-page order on Param Bir Singh’s suspension signed by joint secretary Venkatesh Bhat, Singh has been suspended with immediate effect in view of cases of extortion and corruption registered against him at Marine Drive, Bazarpeth (Kalyan), Kopari and Thane nagar police stations. In addition, an offence under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and Protection of Civil Rights Act too has been registered against him at Bazarpeth police station. Manere is also named as an accused in the offences registered at Bazarpeth police station and in Kopri for extortion, corruption and under the SC/ST Act. Further, the order cites among the reasons “certain irregularities and lapses” committed by Singh, including unauthorized absence from duty. Singh has been on unauthorized leave from August 29. While three courts had issued non-bailable warrants against Singh following the offences that were lodged, another court had declared him a proclaimed offender. During the period of suspension, Singh shall be paid a subsistence allowance, dearness allowance and other allowances as admissible under rule 4 of All India Services rules, 1969, on production of certificate that he is not engaged in any other employment or business. His headquarters will be the DGP’s office, and he shall not leave the HQ without the DGP’s permission, the rules state. Any breach of conditions will be liable for action.  Singh was appointed Mumbai CP on March 1. He was shunted out to the home guards branch as DG on March 17 in the wake of the Antilia bomb scare. It was then alleged by the state that Singh suppressed key information on the episode. A few days after he was shifted, Singh wrote a letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray levelling allegations against then home minister Anil Deshmukh. Singh alleged Deshmukh had asked (now-dismissed) police officer Sachin Waze to mobilize Rs 100 crore a month from 1,750-odd restaurants and bars in the city. Following Singh’s letter, Deshmukh quit the MVA cabinet, while the state government set up a one-man commission presided over by Justice K U Chandiwal, a former judge of Bombay high court, to probe allegations made by Singh. Singh has now submitted before the commission that his letter was based on hearsay and on information given by subordinates and colleagues. The Chandiwal commission too had issued bailable warrants against Singh, but he was not traced. The state CID informed the commission that it made relentless efforts to trace the ex-CP, but did not succeed. A senior IPS official reacted sharply, saying the suspension was long-awaited. “The law-enforcing agencies have given him a long rope. Even after the state CID issued a lookout notice against him on July 12, it failed to keep track of him. Dilip Walse Patil must fix responsibility for why Singh was not traced. Singh arrived on the scene only after SC granted him protection from arrest on November 21,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-order-on-ex-cp-speaks-of-irregularities-and-lapses/articleshow/88060658.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

A report prepared by a city-based market research firm has estimated this as market of electric vehicles is expanding globally. People across the world are turning towards EVs due to rising fuel prices, less or no pollution, cost-effectiveness among other factors.  An estimate by International Energy Agency states that electric car sales reached a record 3 million in 2020, up 40 % from 2019.  With such an increase in EV sales, one major issue will arise, related to batteries – the heart of an EV.  “As sales of EVs continue to surge, so will the volumes of spent batteries. These lithium-ion batteries are made up of hundreds of cells produced using valuable metals and minerals. They are toxic to the environment, so environmentalists and researchers are trying to save them from ending up in landfills,” the report states.  “EV batteries are more complicated to handle because of they are larger and heavier than those used in fossil fuel-based cars, EV battery recycling represents an untapped opportunity,” said firm’s founder Harsh Shah, adding that currently only 5 % of the EV batteries are recycled while others are stored and piled up at battery producing plants.  The report states that most EV manufacturers and auto makers are collaborating with battery manufacturing firms to set up recycling processes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ev-battery-recycling-mkt-to-hit-10-bn/articleshow/88058560.cms||Prashant Rupera

---||Lucknow||LU’s ‘special’ hangout gets popular||Lucknow: The Lucknow University students now have a special hangout on campus – a mobile canteen near Lal Baradari run by a specially-abled woman, Sapna Maurya (29). LU authorities gave permission for running the canteen to Maurya on the directive of Governor and Chancellor Anandiben Patel. The refreshment point, ‘Divyang canteen’, has become a hotspot for students, especially those who are part of LU’s Sanskritiki Board and practice for various cultural events at Lal Baradari. Sapna lost both her parents when she was just two years old. A year later, she met with an accident in which she lost her leg. A fighter to the core, Sapna is pursuing her post-graduation with the help of ‘Kanya Vidya Dhan’ and simultaneously running the canteen to make both ends meet. The canteen is operational from 9am to 6pm. “Governor Anandiben Patel took the initiative to provide employment to differently-abled girls under which LU was told to set up a canteen with the help of Technology Innovation and Development of Entrepreneurship Support (TIDES) Centre, set up by specially-abled alumnus of IIT-Roorkee, Vikas Gupta,” an LU official said. “I am a graduate and have knowledge of computers. I was denied job at many places due to physical challenges I face. LU is a second home to me as I get a lot of affection from students. I am thankful to IIT-Roorkee, the Governor and LU for extending help to me,” said Sapna, a resident of Indiranagar. Speaking about the initiative, Vikas Gupta, said: “Since I have faced challenges in my life due to disability, I didn’t want others to face a similar situation. Hence, I came with the concept of ‘Divyang canteen’ where a hassle-free business can be run by specially-abled people.” “Our team has already set up such canteens at KGMU, Dr Shankuntala Misra National Rehabilitation University, and now at LU. The canteen has been designed in such a manner that it can be easily operated by specially-abled persons. It has ramps, railing and can be moved from one place to another,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lus-special-hangout-gets-popular/articleshow/88059919.cms||---

While commuters moving towards the area enjoy a smooth ride between Balanagar X roads and Fatehnagar Junction which fall under Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits, the movement from Bowenpally X roads becomes a nightmare as a result of the traffic congestion. Elsewhere, a dangerous curve adjacent to the graveyard near Tadbund X roads poses another serious threat to motorists. Over the past one year, five persons have lost their lives while others have been injured in accidents after skidding and crashing their vehicle near the curb. Police have identified this part as a hotspot and have even urged the Cantonment Board to widen the road. A recent inspection was conducted by SCB and local defence officials under former ward member J Maheshwar Reddy. Coming indoors, while residents in the ward are getting regular supply of potable water, they are having to pay abnormal tariffs for it, in some cases nearly double compared to charges under GHMC limits. “While the supply is fine, the question is why can’t we avail a 20-KL free water scheme. As equal citizens, we too should be granted the same access,” said Vaishali, a retired teacher residing in Soujanya Colony. Soujanya Colony, considered to be one of the posh localities in the Cantonment, is home to several senior bureaucrats but roads and by-lanes in the colony are in a poor state but rain-damaged roads left in neglect. Among other issues unresolved is the building of a modern, multi-purpose hall at Pension Lane. The project will require 5.4 acres of Cantonment (Class-C) land. “Acquisition of nearly 400 sqare yards of Army land is nearing completion. This will help us widen the roads at Bowenpally X roads,” said former SCB vice-president and ward member for the area, J Maheshwar Reddy and added that efforts are also being made to widen the road at the curve in Tadbund. The former SCB Ward 1 representative added that he had spent Rs 10 crore on works on drainage systems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ward-1-reels-under-choked-roads-blind-curves/articleshow/88059593.cms||Sunil Mungara

Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association (HYSEA) president Bharani Kumar Aroll pointed out that if the exports of non-STPI units are taken into account, the overall exports growth would be much higher in the period under review. In fact, Telangana is gunning for doubling its IT exports from the existing Rs 1.45 lakh crore to Rs 3 lakh crore in the next five years. “Despite the pandemic, the IT sector in Telangana has recorded double digit growth … There has been significant growth of IT exports and a sustained addition of employment in this sector during last fiscal,” Ramprasad of STPI (Hyderabad) said at the curtain raiser of HYSEA Annual Innovation Summit and Awards 2021. The summit will be held on December 16 on the theme ‘Digital Convergence: Touching Lives and Businesses’. It will see more than 30 startups showcase their products and compete for awards in six different categories. Additionally, Hyderabad’s Hot 10 startups will also be chosen by HYSEA. Over 500 delegates, including more than 200 IT industry leaders, are expected to attend the event, which will feature keynotes and panel discussions by leaders from major IT players and emerging startups. On the impact of the Omicron variant on the return to office plans of IT companies, Aroll said that it is too early to say anything as much information is not available about the variant. He pointed out that currently around 5 per cent of the IT workforce in large companies, 30 to 60 per cent in mid-size companies and 60-70 per cent in small IT companies are back to their offices in the city.

The family developed symptoms two days back and during the period, the unsuspecting DMHO had visited Tirupati and had attended an award function too, officials said. The samples of these six family members will be taken for genome sequencing on Friday, said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director of public health. “We are taking the samples for genome sequencing as a precautionary measure since the two members of the family have a travel history to Germany," said Dr Rao. So far, 169 people landed at the airport from the 12 high risk countries, only the 35- year-old woman tested positive. However, in the case of the DMHO and his family, his son and daughter-in-law had flown in from Germany over 10 days back and had tested positive on Wednesday.

The insurance sector regulatory body, which played a key role during the Covid first and second waves by directing insurers to come up with specialised Covid-19 policies, has been headless for over seven months now. During the pandemic, IRDAI had also made timely interventions on issues such as issuance of electronic policies, allowing payment of premiums in instalments by policyholders as well as directing insurance players to approve cashless in a stipulated period, among others.  Outgoing IRDAI chairperson, SC Khuntia, had vacated the chair on May 6, 2021, and the government had called for applications setting May 29, 2021, as the deadline but it has fallen silent after that. “This shows the irresponsible attitude of the government and how lightly they take the insurance sector in this country… Moreover, they tend to appoint IAS officers, who take a couple of years to understand the industry and by the time the person is ready to perform, his time is up. In Khuntia’s case, they could have given him an extension as it is pandemic time,” said an industry expert. IRDAI has had five chairmen since its inception -- N Rangachary (1996-2003), CS Rao (2003-08), Hari Narayan (2008-13), TS Vijayan (2013-18) and SC Khuntia -- of which only TS Vijayan has an industry background while the rest are bureaucrats. Interestingly, Khuntia has had the shortest tenure as IRDAI chairman. In fact, N Rangachary said it is time for Centre to review the regulatory body to see how it can contribute towards the development of the insurance industry. Meanwhile, insurance sector industry bodies rued the lackadaisical attitude of government in not filling up the top post has led to no new reforms this year. “Letters written by various associations have not been replied…many of the new insurer licenses are pending. Also, there has been no decision on the three PSUs that are having a bad solvency margin of below 1.5 due to which there have been a lot of complaints about non-settlement of claims purely because of lack of money,” an industry source said. To qualify for the top job at IRDAI, aspirants from the public sector would need to have at least 30 years of work experience. They should have worked as secretary to the government of India or its equivalent level at the Centre or state level. On the other hand, applicants from the private sector would need to have work experience as the CEO or equivalent of a large financial institution. The IRDAI chairperson is entitled to a consolidated pay and allowances of Rs 4.5 lakh per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/irdai-headless-amid-omicron-concerns/articleshow/88059647.cms||Swati Rathor

In a media conference held on Thursday amid fears of Omicron variant spread, health director Dr Srinivasa Rao said the woman, who arrived on a British Airways flight hails from Rangareddy district. She is asymptomatic, stable and currently at the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS). “A total of 325 people arrived at the airport on British Airways flight and Singapore Airlines flight. We have conducted RT PCR tests for all of them, and this one woman from Ranga Reddy tested positive,” he added. The public health director said results will be available in the next two-three days. Since arrivals from Britain and Singapore were added to the list for mandatory screening, tests were performed on all 206 passengers of British Airways and 119 passengers of Singapore Airlines. The official said that all passengers are being monitored and their arrival data is being shared with respective state surveillance units, as well as districts throughout the state. Among the passengers, 239 are from Telangana, 72 from Andhra Pradesh, 10 from Maharashtra, two from Madhya Pradesh and one each from Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Explaining the present Covid- 19 scenario, the director of health said that just eight nations have reported a decrease in cases, while the majority of nations have reported a surge in cases. “We are attempting to accelerate vaccination across the state, and we hope to finish delivering the second dosage for those who are due by the end of the month. Currently, we have approximately 80 lakh vaccine doses available,” the director of public health said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/omicron-fear-genome-result-of-covid-19-ve-flyer-awaited/articleshow/88059665.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Out of the 960 students in Mahatma Jyotiba Phule BC Welfare Residential School in Indresham village, tests were conducted for 300 students out of whom 27 tested positive. District medical and health officer (DMHO) Dr G Gayatri Devi told TOI that tests would be done for the rest of the students also. “All the affected students have been kept in isolation,” she said. On November 24, a class IX student developed fever in her hostel. The staff gave her medication but it did not subside. Her parents who took her home to Gajwel got a Covid-19 test done for her and the result came positive. Following this, the school authorities began conducting Covid-19 tests for the hostel students. “Ideally, we want to keep the students in the hostels by providing them the required quarantine facilities. But when parents insist on taking their children home, we cannot stop them. It is better that the students stay in the hostels so that they do not become the source for the virus spreading where they reside,” the district medical health officer said. A few days ago, 48 students of Jyothiba Phule Gurukul School at Muthangi village in Sangareddy had tested positive and were taken home by their parents. Meanwhile, three students of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV) at Julurupadu in Bhadradri Kothagudem district have tested positive. The students had fever and cold following which a Covid-19 test was done. As the three students tested positive, the authorities will conduct tests for the other students also.

It was a “sordid story of two poor, helpless and hapless victims who had not only been raped, but one of them had been brutally murdered,” said a division bench of Justices S S Jadhav and P K Chavan in its order on November 25, a copy was which made available on Thursday, as it gave Rahimuddin Shaikh the benefit of doubt based on the evidence on record. “The standard of proof is not in consonance with the gravity of the offences. The accused be released forthwith, if not required in any other case.” The testimony of the injured survivor was also found wanting by the high court. “Merely because she is an injured eyewitness, her evidence cannot be mechanically accepted though her testimony holds more credence,” said the judgment authored by Justice Chavan. The high court observed that there were “discrepancies, lacunae and blatant illegalities” which it said “would definitely indicate that the prosecution has utterly failed in connecting the dots and bringing home the guilt of the accused”. “This can, at the most, be a case of strong suspicion and no more. From the evidence, it is also apparent that the murder was neither perplanned nor premeditated. The evidence is neither clear, cogent nor credible. There is absolutely no question of awarding death sentence to the accused, rather, it is the case wherein the accused must be given the benefit of doubt, nay, it would be a travesty of justice,” the judgment read. According to the prosecution, at the time of the incident, the survivor was 19 years old, while the woman who was killed was 28. On May 9, 2012, the two accused approached the ragpickers saying they had arranged jobs for them, and so the women accompanied them in an autorickshaw to a place below a bridge where they were offered liquor and raped. When the women resisted, the men assaulted them with a “hacksaw”. While one of the women, the other died on the spot, said the HC.

They wonder how they are to address the learning losses, which everyone is discussing animatedly, when they have to shut down every now and then. Action Committee, an umbrella body of private unaided schools, said in a statement on Thursday that it understood that pollution was high, the abrupt shutting down of physical classes in the backdrop of the pandemic resulted in aggravating issues for school authorities. “The entire private school fraternity has been badly disturbed for the last two years and this is time for the whole society to come together to support children returning to school,” the statement said. Budget private schools, only now seeing a revival since March 2020, are miffed. Chandrakant Singh, national general secretary, Private Land Public Schools Trust, said, “Please tell me how shutting down schools will improve air quality in Delhi. We all know that 75% of Delhi’s people live in JJ colonies and unauthorised colonies, where children are outside their homes most of their time.” Even in government schools, the teachers are agitated. “Our students were very happy to return to school. Now, we are closed again. We will have to wait for a directive from the Directorate of Education regarding the exams in classes IX and XI,” said AK Jha, principal of a government school in Rohini. Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said, “Everyone is talking about learning loss, but how are schools to address this when there are no continuous classes?” Jyoti Arora, principal, Mount Abu Public School, Rohini, added, “We urge the decisionmakers to deliberate on the rising pollution levels in the city and offer a strategic long-term solution. As responsible stakeholders in society, schools also must come together to raise awareness about pollution and climate change among students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/educators-fret-over-how-to-bridge-learning-gaps/articleshow/88059962.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat Congress: Jagdish Thakor likely to be new chief, Sukhram Rathwa LOP||Gandhinagar: Jagdish Thakor, the former Lok Sabha MP and MLA, who is presently vice-president of the Gujarat Congress, has reportedly been choasen by the party leadership to be the next Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president. The party leadership has also reportedly finalised the name of five-time Pavi Jetpur MLA Sukhram Rathwa as the next leader of opposition (LOP) in the Gujarat assembly. He will replace Paresh Dhanani. Both Chavda and Dhanani resigned after the Congress’drubbing in the local elections held earlier this year, where the BJP won an overwhelming majority of district panchayats, taluka panchayats and municipalities. The BJP also won all the municipal corporations for which elections were held. While Thakor belongs to the OBC Thakor community, Rathwa is from the tribal community. Thakor earlier served as the MP from Patan and MLA from Dehgam. He had won the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 from the Patan Lok Sabha seat, but was not given the ticket by the party in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Thakor is a good orator. Despite being a very senior MLA, Rathwa is a low-profile tribal leader. It appears that the Congress has finalized Rathwa’s name in a bid to attract the tribal community as the state goes to a crucial assembly elections next year. Earlier, it was expected that Gujarat Congress working president Hardik Patel would be considered for the top party post in the state. However, the Congress has reportedly decided to choose senior and experienced leaders to lead the party into next year’s assembly election. After the buzz began of the Congress choosing Thakor and Rathwa as the new leaders to lead the party in 2022, a discussion began within political circles that the Congress is shifting its focus from wooing Patidars to concentrating on its traditional votebank of OBC, SC and ST voters. A senior BJP leader commented, “Congress is going back to its old KHAM — Kshatriya, Harijan (SC), Adivasi and Muslim — formula. This will help the BJP in once again attracting our traditional Patidar voters, a section of which had shifted to the Congress after the 2015 Patidar reservation agitation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-congress-jagdish-thakor-likely-to-be-new-chief-sukhram-rathwa-lop/articleshow/88059272.cms||---

Conflicts such as the one in Dongurli are not new. In one instance, a tiger had killed four domesticated animals of Surla resident, Deu Pingale, in the course of a year, making it apparent that domesticated animals of the forest-dwelling dhangar community were among the prime targets of tiger attacks. “There is an immediate need to provide interim relief to the affected families for the loss of their domesticated animals. These animals should be restrained from venturing into the forest. Poaching of sambar should be prohibited. Efforts should be made to revive the chital (spotted deer) and barking deer populations by creating patches of grasslands inside the forest,” former dean of the Wildlife Institute of India A J T Johnsingh told TOI. Wildlifers have also called for the recovery of prey and the urgent establishment of a Corbett Foundation-like NGO that is fully dedicated towards wildlife conservation. Girish Punjabi, a wildlife biologist, said it was equally important to create awareness about compensation programmes and explain why it is important to report livestock loss. “To avoid negative perceptions, a process for quick compensation claims should be initiated. If possible, dhangar families could be provided with a strong boma (enclosure) with chain link fencing to protect their livestock at night. Workshops on smoke-free cooking stoves should also be conducted to deter tribal people from risking their lives by venturing into the forest to collect firewood. Also, a recent study has shown that painting a pair of eyes on the rear of cattle can stave off attacks by big cats,” he said. A tiger task force has been constituted in the Dongurli panchayat jurisdiction to keep an eye on tiger movements, range forest officer of the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, Deepak Tandel, said, adding that people living in the sanctuary’s vicinity have been advised not to venture into the forest or take their cattle there for grazing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-tigers-prey-on-livestock-calls-for-holistic-conservation-get-louder/articleshow/88059976.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

The state has said the money should be deposited in the farmers’ bank accounts by then. For the kharif 2020 season, more than 1 crore farmers had opted for crop insurance but had not received pending payouts worth Rs 223 crore for the season. Claims worth Rs 1,068 crore had been approved but the payout received so far was only Rs 844 crore, officials said. The state had taken a review on Thursday with crop insurance companies. The state also said that for kharif 2021, 84 lakh farmers had opted for crop insurance. Of this, claims worth Rs 1,842 crore had been approved but the payout so far was only Rs 994 crore. Mid-season as well, the rains damaged crops worth Rs 425 crore, officials said. Although rabi claims had yet to be approved, the state had already started receiving complaints from farmers in the Buldhana district. State agriculture minister Dada Bhuse said that the non-settlement of claims resulted in farmers getting upset and that it would hold the insurance companies responsible of there was a law and order problem. He also asked the companies to re-examine rejected claims. The insurance firms that attended the meeting included Bajaj Allianz, Reliance, Iffco Tokio, ICICI Lombard, AIC of India and HDFC Argo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-settle-farmers-kharif-claims-in-8-days-state-tells-insurers/articleshow/88060418.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Vijayan said the officials at the dam site should closely monitor the water level and release water during day time. “The discharge of water in the night and early morning without prior warning creates avoidable panic and risk,” he said. Chief secretary V P Joy had alerted his Tamil Nadu counterpart on November 30 about the high water levels in downstream areas like Vandiperiyar and people’s anxiety. “Shutter release at the rate of around 5,700 cusecs has been the cause of flooding due to high water levels and consequent inundation of houses... As per the information received, shutters V1 to V8 of Mullaperiyar dam were opened at 3am on December 2, 2021. Sufficient warning was not given before discharging 6,413 cusecs, which was subsequently increased to 8,017 cusecs at 4am by opening all the 10 shutters,” he said. Vijayan requested Stalin to intervene in the matter so that the apprehensions of people living in downstream areas are put to rest. Directives need to be given that the opening of shutters should be done during day time and only after sufficient warning. Kerala is of the considered opinion that Tamil Nadu should get adequate water while ensuring the safety of people in the state, he added. Idukki district collector Sheeba George had given a detailed report to the government on Tamil Nadu opening the dam shutters. In her report to the additional chief secretary of disaster management, George urged the government to take up the matter with Tamil Nadu urgently and ensure that intimation about opening the shutters is given at least six hours in advance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/open-shutters-in-daytime-with-enough-warning-cm-to-stalin/articleshow/88059275.cms||---

Wildlife photographers and birders, sharing a common passion for documenting and conservation of the winged creatures, will participate in a national-level Bird Race to be held in Jamnagar on January 9.Jamnagar, home to over 300 migratory birds, is a paradise for birders with its many bird sanctuaries located at Narara, Khijadiya, Gaga bird sanctuary. The Lakhota lake area too boasts of different bird species. The Bird Race will be jointly organized by Nawanagar Nature Club (NNC), Forest department and Suraksha Setu Society of the police. Photographers and bird watchers from across the country are expected to participate in the event. Many such races are held across the country to promote awareness about different bird species and their conservation. Bird lovers are divided in small teams and are designated areas to count and click the birds from dawn to dusk. Jamnagar district is well known for its bird habitats. Having geographical features like large wetlands, saltpans, coastal areas, grasslands and scrub lands that are ideal for nesting and breeding, it attracts the birds as well as the birders in large numbers. The Khijadiya bird sanctuary, with 200 species of birds, is one such location. Vijaysinh Jadeja of NNC said that the race will help in boosting the conservation efforts. “Participating teams will come up with photographic proof of the bird species observed. The data collected through the Bird Race will be used for conservation related activities. The data and photographs of tagged and ringed birds give vital information to understand the migratory routes used by different species,” Jadeja said. “Apart from documenting birds, the teams will also check for any degradation of habitat, pollution, serious human disturbance, spread of harmful chemicals or insecticides or even spread of parasitic vegetation at bird habitats or nesting areas. This data will help us in the conservation process. The main motive of the Bird Race is to bring the future generations closer to birds and to make them aware about nature conservation,” Jadeja added. The organizers are optimistic that rare birds will be spotted during the race. The winners will also be given cash prizes, they informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/a-race-to-capture-birds-boost-conservation/articleshow/88057715.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Priyavardarn Korat, a member of the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board, demanded this in a letter written to the board chairman. In the letter, he stated that the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 includes thalassaemia patients in the persons with disabilities category. “So, the board should make necessary changes to ensure that students with thalassaemia can apply in the category for persons with disabilities,” it said. The online form filling exercise for Class 10 and Class 12 board exams is currently going on. According to Korat, the Class 10 exam forms have four categories for students with disabilities, including visually impaired, mentally challenged, hearing impaired and orthopedically challenged. In the case of Class 12 students, there is a fifth additional category for students suffering from ‘leprosy’. “There is no option for thalassaemia students to apply in the category meant for students with disabilities. As a result, such candidates are deprived of the benefits that can be availed under this category,” according to the letter. The board must immediately take necessary action and add another category online for persons with disabilities where thalassemia patients can apply, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/changes-board-exam-forms-for-thalassaemia-students/articleshow/88059279.cms||---

---||Delhi||Will Omicron overtake Delta? Experts weigh in||NEW DELHI: Will Omicron, first detected in South Africa last month, overtake Delta as the predominant variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19? This concern has gripped public health specialists, as sporadic cases of the new, highly mutated variant begin to appear in various countries, including India. Dr N K Mehra, an honorary emeritus scientist of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), told TOI that information available so far suggests that Omicron is more transmissible and, therefore, it has the potential to replace Delta as the predominant variant. “In South Africa, the Alpha variant was predominant initially but was overtaken by Delta. And now, 70% of all Covid-19 cases are being caused by the Omicron variant,” he added. Dr Mehra, however, clarified that it is too early to assess the impact Omicron may have on the course of the pandemic in India. “South Africa has the largest population suffering from HIV/AIDS. It also has low vaccination rates. This could be the reason behind increased need for hospitalisation in persons affected by Covid-19 due to the Omicron variant. It is too early to say whether the predominance of the new variant will have a similar impact in India where a significant number of adults have been vaccinated. If you look at reports from other countries that have reported detection of the Omicron variant, there aren’t any cases with severe symptoms,” he observed. Dr S K Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), said normally it takes eight to 12 weeks for a new variant to overtake the existing one. However, he added, given the high rates of replication seen in the case of Omicron, it is possible that the new variant may spread faster. “We need to be more vigilant about adopting preventive measures and strengthening steps required to detect and isolate positive cases early on,” he said. In Delhi, Lok Nayak Hospital has been designated to isolate and treat international travellers who test positive for Covid-19. The hospital’s medical director, Dr Suresh Kumar, said that viruses are known to evolve to be able to survive. “SARS-CoV-2 has also evolved. But we don’t know for sure whether they have become more deadly. Chances are that the new variant may cause milder symptoms,” he said. Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, a public health analyst and epidemiologist, also said that there were less chances of the Omicron variant causing a crisis similar to the one seen during the second wave of the pandemic in India. “Some reports suggest that the new variant may have immune-escape properties. Even if this was true, I don’t think that the immunity accorded due to natural infection or vaccination will not have any effect at all. It will, in my view, reduce the risk of severe disease and need for hospitalisation,” he said. There are many things that governments need to do to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant and its potential impact. But, say public health specialists, people also need to shed complacency and follow Covid norms to prevent the disease from spreading. “We need a social movement against the pandemic. People need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, like wearing a well-fitting mask and maintaining social distance. Those who haven’t received the vaccine should get it. All this will help reduce the impact of newer variants of the coronavirus,” Dr Neeraj Nischal, additional professor, department of medicine at AIIMS, told TOI. He added persons with a history of travel to countries affected by Omicron should come forward on their own so their health can be monitored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/will-omicron-overtake-delta-experts-weigh-in/articleshow/88059989.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Killer mom who filed fake infant kidnap case held||MUMBAI: A 33-year-old woman who killed her three-month-old daughter by drowning her and lodged a police complaint by concocting a story that someone had kidnapped her daughter was arrested by Kalachowkie police on Thursday. The arrested woman, Sapna Bajrang Makdum, told police she killed her daughter as she was being constantly harassed by her husband and in-laws for a male child. The three-month-old was Makdum’s second daughter. The city crime branch’s unit 3 got Makdum to confess the truth and handed her over to Kalachowkie police. Makdum, a resident of Parel, has been arrested on charges of killing the newborn and dumping her body in a storage water drum in her house. Police officials said they will produce Makdum before a court and seek her custody. Meanwhile, police have recovered the girl’s body and sent it for post-mortem to know the exact cause of death. DCP (zone 4) Vijay Patil confirmed the arrest. On Wednesday, Makdum had lodged a complaint that an unknown woman had kidnapped her second daughter while she was away for work. Based on her and her husband’s complaint, police registered a kidnapping case and scanned CCTV footage. One blurred image of a woman walking with a newborn child was picked out, and based on that, police drew a sketch of the suspect and circulated it for identification.  Meanwhile, the city crime branch team suspected foul play and grilled Makdum. “Normally, baby boys are kidnapped, but here the case was uncommon, the victim was a girl child from a middle-class family. We studied the body language of the complainant and we were sure there was something amiss,” an officer said. Police found out Makdum’s first daughter was born in 2013.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-killer-mom-who-filed-fake-infant-kidnap-case-held/articleshow/88059985.cms||Ahmed Ali

The project was approved in 2008, and the Central Railway completed work on its portion above the tracks in 2017, but the TMC could not complete the work on approaches due to several issues such as hurdles in land acquisition and the COVID-induced lockdown. In a letter to additonal divisonal railway manager of Central Railway’s Mumbai division, the TMC said that the work on the approaches would be over by December 25. The shutting down of the level crossing gate will drastically improve punctuality as it is opened and shut 36 times a day. A CR official said, “There are times when the level crossing gate has to be kept open for a longer time as there may be a heavy traffic build up.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-level-crossing-closed-crs-punctuality-set-to-improve/articleshow/88060017.cms||Manthank Mehta

Health officials will now focus more on checking for breeding inside houses. “As the outside temperature is falling, we are observing more breeding inside homes,” said a public health official. The high court has pulled up the municipal corporations for their failure to control the spread of dengue, which has doubled this year in Delhi, saying there is a complete paralysis in the civic administration as no one is bothered about the deaths. To control the spread, anti-larval spray is being done with the deployment of 1,009 pitthu pumps, 494 fogging machines, 325 Ganesh pumps, 46 motorised pumps and four tankers in the SDMC areas. “The fogging drive is being carried out with the help of 1,300 field staff. Each and every household is being checked by 1,120 domestic breeding checkers. Nearly 92 lakh houses have been checked, out of which 75,000 were found mosquito-breeding,” said mayor Mukesh Suryan. Till now, 25 lakh houses have been sprayed. Nearly 60,000 notices were served while legal action was taken against 7,000 people and institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-to-intensify-anti-dengue-steps/articleshow/88060026.cms||---
---||Kochi||Corp faces probe into graft charges over waste mgmt||Thiruvananthapuram: The civic body, which has hardly recovered from the aftereffects of furore over fund fraud, is now facing another departmental inquiry over waste management. The local self-government department (LSGD) has ordered for a probe into corruption allegations in the functioning of IT cell for waste management and awarding of consultancy for solid waste management. Urban affairs joint director (health) has been asked to submit the report within 15 days. The probe has been ordered based on a report by vigilance and anti-corruption bureau (VACB). VACB had earlier received anonymous complaints alleging corruption in the corporation’s source-level waste management and VACB had heard the persons associated with waste management initiatives of the corporation. The IT cell, constituted during the tenure of former mayor V K Prasanth, was instrumental in rolling out online systems for septage management and drinking water distribution. Recently, online septage management system was picked up and included in the special book brought out by the ministry of electronics and information technology among the 75 most notable digital interventions. The barrage of complaints forwarded to VACB and office of the chief minister was perceived as a by-product of dissent that had existed within the corporation against Prasanth. The recent order from LSGD calling for a departmental probe gives fresh fodder for BJP, which has always levelled allegations of graft in source-level waste management. Officials with the city corporation said that the corporation had deployed ‘Haritha Sahaya Sthapanam’ (HSS) based on government orders and empanelment by the Suchitwa Mission (SM). It was this deployment of agency which was being misrepresented as consultancy. Close on the heels of developing online system for septage management and drinking water distribution, an app was pitched for solid waste collection and management among households. The officials said that all the decisions were approved in the council and that survey cost for field-level distribution of QR code stickers and mandated charges by SM for HSS have been allotted by the civic body. It was as part of strengthening Haritha Karma Sena that the agencies were empanelled for the service of urban local bodies. Even the recently-launched smart garbage app by the state government was based on the system originally developed for the city corporation. The ruling council is likely to have a hard time answering a departmental probe into the same system, which is now being emulated across the local bodies in the state. Urban affairs directorate in its report on allegations of corruption in hiring of vehicles for waste management related to Attukal pongala had noted that it was irrational on the part of the corporation to take 21 vehicles on rent to transport 28 loads of waste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-faces-probe-into-graft-charges-over-waste-mgmt/articleshow/88058575.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The local police launched a rescue operation with the help of the Indian Coast Guard helicopter to find the missing fishermen. Gir Somnath district collector R G Gohil told TOI, “A coast guard helicopter is leading the search operation. Besides, a team of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) is also on its way to Una.” According to the Gohil, the boats were anchored at the fishing port when the incident occurred. “The boats got untied due to rough weather and collided with each other before capsizing. At least 10 boats were completely destroyed and 12 fishermen got pulled into the sea. Four of them managed to swim back to the shore, while search is on for the eight missing men,” Gohil added. Locals told authorities that at least 40 boats were anchored at the port and most of them have suffered minor damages. Navabandar sarpanch Somvar Majithia said, “The fishermen were inside their anchored boats when the strong winds and waves struck the coast after midnight on Wednesday due to sudden change in the weather.” It was a storm-like situation after midnight, he added. Coastal Gujarat witnessed a change in the weather conditions on Wednesday with some parts of the state receiving rains, which is unusual in the month of December. Parts of Maharashtra and south Gujarat received rains on Wednesday, owing to a low-pressure area in the Arabian Sea and a western disturbance, the India Meteorological Department earlier said. The IMD has also issued an advisory for the fishermen asking them not to venture into the sea till Friday. It has further stated that high waves in the range of 1.5 - 3.2 meters are forecast for the next two days along the coast of Gujarat from Diu to Okha and from Mandvi to Jakhau.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/eight-fishermen-missing-in-rough-sea-near-una/articleshow/88057749.cms||---

The 16-year-old boy was caught at Niyol check post after a team a Puna police station kept a watch there following specific information. They found nearly two kg opium from his school bag. The boy was sent from Chittorgadh and promised Rs 5,000 for delivering the consignment.

On identifying the boy, police checked him and recovered opium from his school bag. He could not give a satisfactory reply after which police detained him. Later police registered a case under The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. Police booked the boy along with Gopal Sharma, who provided the opium consignment to him, and receiver who was supposed to take the drugs from him. However, the name of the receiver is still not known. The boy was produced in juvenile court on Thursday but court sent him to children's home, rejecting cops’ plea for remand. "The boy seems to be well trained to act as a carrier. He did not cooperate with police in basic questioning and was hiding important details," said an official at Puna police station.

Asking people to remain vigilant against what she termed as BJP’s desperate last attempt at Hindu-Muslim politics to win the upcoming election, Mayawati said: “The deputy CM’s statement ahead of assembly elections in the state, saying that temple construction is taking place in Ayodhya and Kashi and now it is the turn of Mathura, reinforces the general view that BJP is going to lose this election.” Maurya’s tweet, which invited similar reactions from other Opposition leaders, on Wednesday had said: “Ayodhya Kashi bhavya mandir nirman jaari hai, Mathura ki taiyyari hai.” Meanwhile, BSP national general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP S C Mishra also slammed BJP for the comment. “Elections are here.

On Thursday, the woman was summoned to the office of deputy superintendent of police of Kattakkada sub-division, where her statements were recorded. Police authorities said that the inquiry has been launched based on a petition she filed before the chief minister as well as the state police chief a week ago. In her statement, she reiterated her allegation that even after registering the case, she and her daughter were forced to spend one night with her live-in partner, who abused her daughter, as police delayed the arrest of the accused. She also alleged that the accused might have received support from the police as he was able to get bail soon. He was released on bail after two weeks whereas she had to spend 47 days in jail as a remand prisoner on charges of attempting to murder him. Despite these developments, the police officers involved in the case continued to claim that the woman had gone back to the accused’s home on her own will citing that her stepson and her gold ornaments were not safe there. Police are also trying to locate her relatives, whom she claimed to be based in Thrissur. According to the complainant, she was a beautician settled in Mumbai and she reached the district in June this year after receiving a marriage proposal from the accused, who is reportedly an Indian Air Force official, through a matrimonial site. In July, they held a marriage ceremony at a local temple. But two days later, the accused tried to sexually abuse her daughter. After police registered the case, she had to spend one more night with the accused in the same house, during which the accused allegedly injured himself and put the blame on her, which resulted in her arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/inquiry-on-into-alleged-lapses-by-police-officers/articleshow/88058593.cms||---
---||Delhi||These two exchanged gold jewellery for fake notes, arrested in Dabri||New Delhi: Delhi Police has arrested a man and a woman who allegedly used to cheat women by exchanging their gold jewellery for fake currency notes in Dabri area. The arrested man has been identified as Vijay (34) and his female accomplice as Simran (32). According to the police, the cheating came to light when two separate cases of cheating were registered on October 30, wherein the victims, both women, complained that they had been cheated by a couple of Rs 20,000 and some jewellery. Based on the complaint, a team from Dabri police station started an investigation. “Our teams analysed CCTV footage based on which the suspects were identified. We later received a tip-off that the two accused would come to 25 feet road in Dabri to target other people. A trap was laid and around 3 pm, they were nabbed,” an officer said. During their search, two fake bundles of notes and one pair of gold tops were recovered from Simran. “During the interrogation, they stated that they were attracted to each other and have been together since 2019. While Simran’s husband had died in 2016, Vijay had left his wife in 2011. During lockdown, they even had to beg to earn a living. That was when they came in contact with another couple who used to cheat people using similar modus operandi,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/these-two-exchanged-gold-jewellery-for-fake-notes-arrested-in-dabri/articleshow/88060067.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh's MSME first in job creation, investment, says Sidharth Nath Singh||LUCKNOW: UP’s MSME sector has gained the first position in the country in investment and providing employment, said a government spokesperson on Thursday, adding that in the past 4.5 years, nearly 90 lakh MSME units in the state have brought in investment of more than Rs 5 lakh crore and provided employment to 3 crore people. “The sector is thriving due to the investment friendly policies of the Yogi Adityanath government. The sector was languishing earlier due to the apathy of the previous governments. Majority of the industries had migrated to other states. After 2017, several teps were taken to revive the sector and their impact can be seen,” he said. MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh said the improvement in the sector is the result of a multitude of initiatives taken by the Yogi Adityanath government. “Exports from UP have increased by 38% and the ‘one district-one product’ goods account for 70% of this growth. Our emphasis on quality control, branding and packaging played a key role. No previous government thought about exports in a focused manner like the Yogi government. For the first time, a firm like PWC was hired to identify a global supply chain for our products,” the minister said. The government also passed an order to ensure purchases of 25% of its annual budget from MSMEs. In the current financial year up to November 10, the government procurement from MSMEs through the GeM portal was 69.6% of the budget or Rs 3,855 crore. The total purchases in 4.5 years through GeM has been over Rs 15,000 crore. Additional Chief Secretary (MSME) Navneet Sehgal said the government had also assisted in record loans being sanctioned to MSMEs and Rs 2,70,611 crore was disbursed in the last 4.5 years. “Around 92 lakh units got loans under various schemes in the past 4.5 years,” Sehgal added. An official said the common facility centres (CFCs) set up in districts for providing MSMEs access to technology, equipment, training and packaging, have shown excellent results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-msme-first-in-job-creation-investment/articleshow/88060064.cms||Neha Lalchandani

City-based realtor and promoter of various educational institutions, Mahesh Savani and his family have so far helped 4,446 destitute girls tie the knot in the mass marriages he organizes every year. This year girls from different states of the country, including a majority from Gujarat and belonging to Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and Christian faiths will be united with their life partners. “After a few years of successfully organising these mass marriages, I started receiving calls from different states and I mostly do not refuse help,” Savani told TOI. “This year, of the 300 daughters, 103 are those who have been living with their grandparents or relatives after losing their own parents and they also do not have any siblings,” he said. The girls select suitable life partners on their own and inform the organisers about it. Savani and his team verify the details of each girl to ascertain their willingness to get married before the mass marriage event. “Few girls complained about their future partner’s bad habits or wayward behaviour after which we called off their marriages,” the philanthropist added. Apart from organising the marriage ceremony in accordance with traditional rituals, the Savani family also provides jewellery, clothes and a set of household products to each couple at the time of marriage. They also offer the newly-weds a tour after the marriage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/savani-family-to-help-300-fatherless-girls-get-married/articleshow/88058642.cms||---

---||Delhi||How tackling pollution can help Delhi save Rs 1,000cr/yr||NEW DELHI: The advisories and precautions by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) can save Delhi Rs 1,096 crore per year on health expenditure, claims a study. Co-authored by the central forecasting agency’s founder project director, Gufran Beig, the study asserts that even if only 5% of the population suffering from air pollution-related ailments uses SAFAR’s advices and precautions, over a thousand crore can be saved per year. “Our findings support the notion that public knowledge and early warning remain critical components of health and economic growth. SAFAR is credited with saving 11-14% of total money spent by such residents, according to this research,” said Beig. “Impact of SAFAR Air Quality Forecasting Framework and Advisory Services in Reducing the Economic Health Burden of India”, published in the international journal “Regional Economic Development Research”, is written by Suvarna Tikle, Ishika Ilme and Beig, and talks of pulmonary disease linked with air pollution, allergic rhinitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. It considers the total population of Delhi at 2.2 crore, percentage of people suffering from pulmonary illnesses and the cost they bear at hospitals. The study estimates that besides basic treatment, costs of hospitalisation and ICU can be saved. It talks of prevention by intervention through an early warning about the pollution situation. The warning includes suggesting people to avoid going out or prolonged exposure, barring outdoor activities, on the predicted polluted days. “A crucial finding indicates that the yearly average total cost of all ailments caused by air pollution in Delhi and Pune is around Rs 7,694 crore and Rs 948 crore, respectively. Allergic rhinitis OPD treatment costs the highest (Rs 1,449 crore), followed by asthma (Rs 1,001 crore), and COPD (Rs 514 crore) in Delhi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-tackling-pollution-can-help-delhi-save-rs-1000cr/yr/articleshow/88060083.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Samajwadi Party stopped scholarships to SC/ST students, says CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Accusing the Samajwadi Party of having stopped scholarships to SC/ ST students when the party was in power, chief minister Yogi Adityanath mounted a massive attack against its chief and former CM Akhilesh Yadav. Calling the party anti-Dalit, the CM said that this discrimination had negatively impacted the lives of several children. Stressing on how it was his government which started the scholarships again, Adityanath said: “The previous government used to discriminate before providing scholarships to the children. They stopped providing scholarships particularly to the children belonging to SC/ST community. When we came to power in 2017, we came to know that in 2016-17, only the scholarship of SC and ST children had been stopped. Our government immediately restored this scholarship,” the CM said, accusing SP of having an anti-Dalit mentality. In a direct attack on Akhilesh, the CM said that when his government was in power before 2017, it played with the lives and future of children to satisfy its political interests. It says a lot about SP that it specifically stopped the scholarship of Dalit and tribal children. “This is also an example of a political party directly obstructing public welfare schemes of the government. These are elements who played with the lives of children,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-stopped-scholarships-to-sc/st-students-cm-yogi/articleshow/88060080.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Environment ministry tags eco-tourism as ‘forestry activity’, not requiring Centre’s permissions||Nagpur: The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) seems to be on a mission to dilute the Forest (Conservation) Act (FCA) 1980, which was brought in to stop de-reservation of forests in the country. The environment ministry has done a complete U-turn and designated eco-tourism as a forestry activity, instead of the earlier non-forestry tag, facilitating unhindered ‘eco-tourism’ activities in all forests. In a similar climbdown, the ministry had earlier exempted National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and state road user agencies from forest clearance if the right of way (RoW) belonged to them. On October 25, the forest conservation division of the ministry issued a circular amending Para 11.10 of the Handbook on FCA, which will now be read as “Development/construction of facilities, which are not of permanent nature, in forest areas for the purpose of eco-tourism by the government authorities shall not be considered as a non-forestry activity for the purpose of FCA, 1980.” Earlier the Para 11.10 said, “Construction of permanent structures for the purpose of ecotourism on forest land shall be considered as non-forestry activity. In such cases, prior approval of the Central government under the FCA is required.” The MoEFCC also deleted Para 12.13 which states “Eco-tourism is a non-forestry activity, and will be allowed in protected areas (PAs) if the said activities are part of the management plan/tiger conservation plan (TCP) and are duly approved by the Central government.” The environment ministry has also done away with the clause which mentioned that “ecotourism is a non-forest activity requiring prior approval under the FCA.” “From the removal of eco-tourism clauses from MoEFCC’s ‘Handbook on FCA’, it is clear that eco-tourism is no more a non-forestry activity and no management plan or TCP will be needed while implementing eco-tourism. Moreover, who will decide what is a temporary and a permanent structure?” asked senior forest officials. Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust (CAT), said, “The MoEFCC decision to treat ‘eco-tourism’ as a forestry activity is another nail in the coffin as far as protection of forests is concerned. Our forests are already under tremendous stress and allowing unbridled construction of structures on forest lands will inevitably lead to further destruction and degradation.” Goenka added, “Most of our prestigious national parks and tiger reserves are already surrounded by fancy hotels and resorts owned by outsiders, with very limited benefits flowing to the locals. The last thing we need is more resorts, that too on forest land. Most importantly, the environment ministry should itself understand that there is a vast difference between ecotourism and wildlife tourism.” The MoEFCC letter states that the decision to simplify the rules has been taken based on Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) meeting on April 23, 2019, and January 23, 2020, and representations received from various states. Wildlife activists said the forest departments itself wants to simplify the FCA, how can we expect them to protect forests? They shouldn’t forget that SC order of December 12, 1996, in TN Godavarman Vs Union of India case, where the word ‘forest’ must be understood according to its dictionary meaning. “The term forest land, occurring in Section 2 of the FCA, will not only include ‘forest’ as understood in the dictionary sense, but also any area recorded as forest in the government record irrespective of the ownership. This is how it has to be understood for the purpose of Section 2 of the Act,” the apex court had said. Suresh Chopne, president, Green Planet Society, said, “The FCA is supreme and such convenient circulars and guidelines cannot overpower the Act. If the eco-tourism activity is exempted from FCA there will be a flood of activities like roads and amenities in forests for unwarranted tourism projects. The authorities and leaders will turn our precious forests into gardens.” Honorary wildlife warden Uday Patel fears the NITI Aayog plans to introduce public-private partnership (PPP) model in the field of forestry programmes. “One of the activities among others is to introduce this model in eco-camping, wilderness camps, recreation activity etc. It is possible the rules are being relaxed to implement such models,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/environment-ministry-tags-eco-tourism-as-forestry-activity-not-requiring-centres-permissions/articleshow/88059321.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath transfers scholarships of Rs 450 crore to 12 lakh students||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath transferred scholarships of Rs 459 crore to the accounts of 12.17 lakh students on Thursday. This was the second instalment of scholarship funds released by the government, following the transfer of the first to around 57 lakh students on October 2. Attributing the delay in distribution of scholarships and admissions to the Covid-19 linked lockdowns, the CM said that a large number of school, colleges and polytechnics had not been able to commence their session and it was due to the late admission that funds were being released in instalments. “Students should not face any problem in reimbursement of fees or in purchasing any kind of course material for themselves. Departments and colleges concerned should ensure that the admission process in various educational institutions in the state is completed by December 30 so that scholarship money can be transferred to the accounts of eligible students at the earliest,” he said. In his interaction with students from various districts, the CM told them that the government would soon commence the distribution of tablets and smartphones to college students. Explaining the scheme to them, he said that these would be given free of cost to students in various universities, engineering institutes, polytechnics, ITI, nursing, paramedical and various other courses of undergraduate and postgraduate level starting from the middle of December. He encouraged students to take advantage of schemes like the Abhyudaya Yojana, under which the government was providing free coaching to eligible students for competitive exams. “The government is working to provide equal and immense opportunities to the students in the state itself, as a result of which several students who got themselves enrolled for the Abhyudaya coaching have achieved great results in competitive examinations,” the CM said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-transfers-scholarships-of-rs-450cr-to-12l-students/articleshow/88060089.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Driver of school van gets 5-year jail for molesting girl||MUMBAI: A special Pocso court convicted and sentenced a 35-year-old private school van driver to five years of rigorous imprisonment on Wednesday for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old student in 2019. The court held that a grave offence had been proved against the accused, who was supposed to be the caretaker of the child, and in whom her parents had reposed their faith and trust. The court said it would be improper to award lesser punishment than that prescribed by law. “I am also of the view that crime involving sexual offences against woman needs to be severely dealt with. These crimes are not only crimes against any particular woman but against society at large. We need to hear a loud cry of the society…,” special judge HC Shende said. The court also said that it was looked upon with hope to deal with such crimes strictly and impartially. The mother told the court that on January 30, 2019, she received a call from the child’s school to come over for a meeting. When she met the teacher, she was informed that the child had confided in her that on January 29, 2019, when she was returning home after school in the private van, an unknown person was also travelling in the van. The child told the teacher that since the person threw up, the accused driver asked her to come sit next to him. The accused then sexually assaulted her and did not stop even though she repeatedly protested. She also identified the accused. The mother said that she then spoke to the child who reiterated the allegations. The mother said she was shocked and the child was weeping continuously. The girl’s father was travelling and both she and her mother were very disturbed when they returned home. The cops were informed and an FIR was registered. Special public prosecutor Geeta Malankar cited the evidence of 10 witnesses including the child and her mother to seek the conviction of the accused. Arguing for severe punishment, Malankar submitted that the parents had given custody of the child to the driver with utmost faith and confidence but he misused his position. Among the sections he was found guilty of, are offences under the Pocso Act relating to aggravated sexual assault committed on a child younger than 12 years of age and by a person who is in a position of trust. The accused was arrested on February 1, 2019, and the sentence will be set off against the time he already spent in jail. The accused was also fined Rs 10,000. Out of this amount, Rs 5,000, if recovered, will be given to the child as compensation after the appeal period ends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-driver-of-school-van-gets-5-yr-ri-for-molesting-girl/articleshow/88060094.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The I-T has issued a press note stating that during the search action, they “unearthed various methods of tax evasion adopted by the group. Several documentary and digital evidences have been found and seized demonstrating receipt of cash to the tune of Rs 100 crore, as part of consideration on sale of flats, which is not accounted for in the regular books of account.” The I-T did not name the group they had searched in the press note, but officials said it is developing several projects in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. It is also developing projects under the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) scheme. A group representative refused to comment on the action. The I-T press note said "the preliminary analysis of evidence revealed that the group has acquired controlling stake in a company by paying consideration in cash. Defaults on compliances to the provisions of tax deduction at source have also been found. The assessee group did not deduct tax at source on certain payments claimed by it which aggregate to more than Rs 300 crore." It further added “the fact of receipt of on-money on such transactions is also corroborated in the statements recorded during the search proceedings. The modus operandi adopted by the group includes issuing of promissory notes equivalent to the on-money component to the customers and these promissory notes are destroyed after registration of the flat.” I-T officials said the group had made cash payments to slum dwellers for vacating their structures and to others helping in the process. The press note said, “Incriminating evidence regarding unaccounted cash payments made not only to the original tenants of the slums for vacating the dwelling unit but also to some other persons for facilitating vacation of the properties by slum dwellers has been found and seized. Further evidence suggesting irregularities and violation of guidelines of SRA have also been detected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-i-t-finds-receipts-for-rs-100-crore-cash-payment-by-realty-group/articleshow/88060708.cms||Vijay V Singh

Revabhai Parmar (45), along with his four children — daughters Nisha (17), Bhumi (13) and Bhanu (12) and son Punabhai (16) — had consumed poison outside the women’s police station in Patan on Monday. They were shifted to Dharpur civil hospital for treatment on the same day. On Wednesday, all five were shifted to Ahmedabad civil hospital where Anu died late in the night. Police said that while Bhanu’s body was sent for postmortem, the condition of four others was said to be critical.According to police, Revabhai, a resident of Khakhal village in Harij taluka of Patan had attempted suicide with his four children as he was upset over his wife Asha (40) leaving them about a year ago. He had lodged a police complaint accusing one Kamlesh Gosai from Kutch of adducting his wife and seven-year-old daughter. As the police could not trace Revabhai’s wife for over a year, he went into depression and took the extreme step of consuming poison with his four children on Monday. Soon after the suicide bid, Revabhai and his children were taken to Dharpur civil hospital where they received treatment for two days before being shifted to Ahmedabad in critical condition. “Bhanu died at Ahmedabad civil hospital on Wednesday night. Her postmortem was performed on Thursday morning. Her funeral will be held at her native place in Khakhal,” said Patan B-Division police inspector Shaktisinh Gohil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/five-of-patan-family-attempt-suicide-minor-girl-succumbs/articleshow/88057829.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Ganga expressway to be built by Adani Group, IRB Infrastructure||LUCKNOW: The proposed 594-km Ganga Expressway, the longest in the country connecting Meerut and Prayagraj, will be constructed by Adani Group and IRB Infrastructure. The state government on Thursday formally announced that the project will be constructed under four groups of which three will be done by the Adani Group. Besides Adani and IRB, Ashoka Buildcon Ltd was one of the bidders to have participated in the technical bids. The bids were opened under the supervision of the public-private partnership bid evaluation committee headed by the infrastructure and industrial development commissioner. The committee also has additional chief secretaries and principal secretaries from different departments including finance, planning and law.  While IRB will carry out construction under group 1 at a cost of Rs 5,039 crore, Adani will take care of the other three: proposed to be constructed at estimated costs of Rs 5,647, Rs 5,810 and Rs 5,626 crore.  The development comes just over a fortnight after the PM inaugurated the Purvanchal Expressway connecting Lucknow with Ghazipur. The move to expedite the construction of Ganga Expressway comes even as the ruling BJP seeks to step up its outreach in west UP.  It was less than a week ago that the state environment assessment authority gave its clearance to the project. Sources said that the foundation stone of the project is expected to be laid by the PM soon.  Already, the process of land acquisition is being fast-tracked by UP Expressways and Industrial Development Authority. The industrial corridor will also be established with the help of this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ganga-e-way-to-be-built-by-adani-group-irb-infra/articleshow/88060103.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||World||US House passes bill to prevent looming govt shutdown, sends to Senate||WASHINGTON: The US House of Representatives on Thursday passed a bill to fund the federal government through mid-February, sending it on to the Senate which faces a midnight Friday deadline to pass it or face a partial government shutdown. The Democratic-controlled House voted 221-212 to approve the stop-gap funding bill, which runs through Feb. 18. Only one Republican supported the bill. It was unclear whether the Senate will meet the Friday deadline as a small group of hard-line Republican senators threatened to hold up the bill without an amendment to defund President Joe Biden's vaccine mandate for workers. A failure to pass the bill mean that hundreds of thousands of federal workers could be laid off, causing scores of programs to be halted or pared back. "This is a good compromise that allows an appropriate amount of time for both parties in both chambers to finish negotiations on appropriations," Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Thursday. But a group of Republican conservatives, including Mike Lee, Ted Cruz and Roger Marshall, disagreed, raising the possibility that the government could partially shut down over the weekend while the Senate moves slowly toward eventual passage. Lee said on the Senate floor that if he and other Republican senators got a vote on whether to include funding for vaccine mandates in the upcoming government appropriations bill, they might not delay the government funding bill. "All I'm asking for is a vote. It would take 15 minutes, we could do it right now," Lee said, adding that he and the other Republican senators behind the effort wanted a simple majority on the amendment. Democrats hold 50 seats in the 100-seat Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris able to vote as a tie breaker. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who must quell the rebellion within his caucus to keep the government operating, reiterated on Thursday that there would be no shutdown. But he did not respond when asked whether Republicans would agree to move quickly by consenting to circumvent the Senate's cumbersome legislative rules. "We need to pass it and that's what we'll be working toward doing," the top Senate Republican told reporters. Pelosi blasted the Republican move, saying it demonstrated "irresponsibility" that Congress would reject. The temporary spending bill would maintain funding of federal government operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, amid concerns about a new rise in cases and the arrival of the Omicron variant in the United States. The emergency legislation is needed because Congress has not yet passed the 12 annual appropriations bills funding government activities for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. A partial government shutdown would create a political embarrassment for both parties, but especially for Biden's Democrats, who narrowly control both chambers of Congress. Congress faces another urgent deadline right on the heels of this one. The federal government is also approaching its $28.9 trillion borrowing limit, which the Treasury Department has estimated it could reach by Dec. 15. Failure to extend or lift the limit in time could trigger an economically catastrophic default. The fact that the temporary spending bill extends funding into February suggested a victory for Republicans in closed-door negotiations. Democrats had pushed for a measure that would run into late January, while Republicans demanded a longer timeline leaving spending at levels agreed to when Republican Donald Trump was president. "While I wish it were earlier, this agreement allows the appropriations process to move forward toward a final funding agreement which addresses the needs of the American people," House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro said in a statement announcing the agreement. But she said Democrats did prevail in including a $7 billion provision for Afghanistan evacuees. Once enacted, the stopgap funding measure would give Democrats and Republicans nearly 12 weeks to resolve their differences over the annual appropriations bills totaling around $1.5 trillion that fund "discretionary" federal programs for this fiscal year. Those bills do not include mandatory funding for programs such as the Social Security retirement plan that are renewed automatically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-house-passes-bill-to-prevent-looming-govt-shutdown-sends-to-senate/articleshow/88060963.cms||---

---||Delhi||Crackdown on child pornography: Delhi police file over 100 FIRs, arrest 50||NEW DELHI: In a massive crackdown against online circulation and distribution of child sexual abuse material, Delhi Police is learnt to have filed over 100 FIRs and arrested over 50 people in raids across the city. The Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations (IFSO) unit had launched “Operation Masoom” to tackle the menace of child pornography. Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana closely supervised the operation executed by the newly formed cyber police stations in all districts. Asthana said, “Delhi Police has zero tolerance against crimes against children and women. All units are working to maintain order for the betterment of public safety and security. Many steps are being taken in this regard.” DCP (IFSO) KPS Malhotra said, “The investigation is ongoing and we will share details when the operation is over.” A source said Malhotra had formed a team comprising ACP Raman Lamba, inspector Surjeet, sub-inspector Manoj and others to probe the nexus. After the formation of the cyber police stations, IFSO started a drive against child sexual exploitation offenders. “More than 100 cases were registered and over 50 people were arrested based on tip-offs received from other agencies” said an officer. The raids were a classic example of intra-departmental and inter-agency coordination. “The details of the violations about child pornographic material are received at IFSO through National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB),” the officer said. NCRB has signed an MoU with National Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), which is a private non-profit organisation based in the US. NCMEC has tied up with social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and others and keeps a hawk-eyed vigil on content posted on them. Whenever it comes across any content violating privacy and obscene material regarding children, the same is red-flagged. The IP address of the user uploading the obscene content is procured and NCMEC then provides Cyber Tipline complaints and information to NCRB. “These complaints, along with the details of the person sharing or uploading such sexually offensive content, is also shared with state nodal agencies,” said the officer, adding that IFSO was the nodal agency in Delhi. At IFSO, the details received from NCRB are analysed for identification of any organised nexus. The information is then shared with the agencies concerned to take legal action. “The Cyber Tipline information provided by NCMEC was segregated on the basis of jurisdiction of districts and police stations. The information was then shared with the police stations and districts concerned for registration of cases. More than a dozen FIRs were registered in Shahdara, South and Southeast districts,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/crackdown-on-child-pornography-police-file-over-100-firs-arrest-50/articleshow/88060115.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Kolkata||CBSE IX & XI students in Kolkata to take MCQ tests on OMR sheets||KOLKATA: CBSE schools in the city are introducing multiple choice questions (MCQ) in all tests for classes IX and XI that will have to be answered in optical mark recognition (OMR) sheets. The move comes in the wake of the first-term exams for classes X and XII in which all papers were MCQ-based and required to be answered in OMR sheets. Also, if the board decides to stick to this pattern of examination in future, schools will gradually switch to MCQ and OMR sheets in middle school as well. Though CBSE had said the second-term exam would be subjective, school heads feel the surge in Covid cases and the uncertainty over how the Omicron variant will run its course may lead to the board sticking to MCQ and OMR sheets in the second term as well. Schools have observed that while children are finding answering theory portions easy on OMR sheets, they still need practice when it comes to answering numericals and mathematical questions. Here, they have to work out answers on a rough sheet and then tally them with options on the OMR sheets. This is where many are either fumbling or making mistakes. “One has to accept that those who are writing the boards had studied online and are now taking an offline exam in a changed format. They need a lot of offline practice. So we have decided to formally introduce MCQ patter of exams and OMR sheets right from the beginning in the classrooms and then in our exams as well,” said Meena Kak, director of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. DPS Ruby Park has already prepared MCQ-based term exam question papers for classes IX and XI. “Even if they know all the answers, choosing the right one from a set of options, some very close to each other, to deliberately confuse the examinee and check his/her level of learning, requires a different skill set. So we are trying to equip them early,” said principal Joyoti Chaudhuri. South Point High School is also planning to introduce students of Class IX onwards to MCQ and OMR sheets the moment the board term-I exams and the ongoing term exams are over. “We were planning to order OMR sheets and let the board examinees practice. Unfortunately the school reopening in our state and the CBSE exams coincided. We will make OMR-based evaluation a part of our system now if the board continues with this changed pattern,” said principal Rupa Sanyal Bhattacharjee. Some principals, like Asian International School head Vijaylakshmi Kumar, said the term-I exam was conducted the way any national-level competitive exam is conducted. So while a large number of science students who go to coaching centres for these exams were aware of how to handle them, others needed help, especially the Class X board examinees. “All of us have seen the benefits of the new pattern that made a physical board exam possible in a pandemic situation,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbse-ix-xi-students-to-take-mcq-tests-on-omr-sheets/articleshow/88058668.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP youth outreach in 403 seats from today to bring new voters in party fold||LUCKNOW: In a major youth outreach, BJP will roll out its organizational machinery in all 403 assembly seats for next three days to meet new voters, who will be exercising their franchise for the first time in state elections due in next few months. The exercise, which begins on Friday will witness volunteers and functionaries of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), youth arm of the saffron outfit, meeting college students to convince them on steps taken by BJP in the last four-and-ahalf years of its rule. The saffron outfit will subsequently amplify the campaign later this month by holding district-wise conventions across the state in an apparent bid to bring young voters closer to BJP. These workers will also convince the youth to take membership of BJP — a move that could potentially help the party gauge the mood of young voters. Currently, BJP has a membership of around 15 lakh youth, which is proposed to be scaled up further as part of the drive. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said, the threeday ‘Pravas’ and then district-wise youth conventions will help the party to pervade among young and progressive voters, who hold the key for any political party. “The youth is certainly with BJP because of the popularity of PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath,” he said, while speaking to TOI on Thursday. This comes days after BJP drew opposition criticism over TET question paper leak that left more than 20lakh job seeks in quandary. Though CM Yogi has hardened his stance by ordering slapping of NSA and Gangster Act on the accused, the BJP organization does not wish to leave any chance as part of the damage-control exercise. BJP’s overdrive to connect with youth comes amid Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party’s concerted bid to mobilize the youth by holding discussions with youths on their issues — education becoming costlier, unemployment, police implicating them in cases, lack of investments, closing factories, retrenchment, job losses, problems and anomalies in online education and neglect of students of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. BJYM state general secretary Devendra Singh Patel said, youth will be told on how the state government managed to provide jobs “with transparency”. He said, various schemes of the Centre and the state and a robust law and order situation will be prominently highlighted by the party. He said, district-wise conventions are proposed to coincide with ‘yatras’ which BJP has planned to be carried out in each of the six organizational regions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-youth-outreach-in-403-seats-from-today-to-bring-new-voters-in-party-fold/articleshow/88060116.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Hubballi||Neglected, polluted Koli Keri a breeding ground for diseases||Dharwad: Hire Keri, referred to among locals as Koli Keri, a body of water in the heart of Dharwad city is in a pitiable state – polluted and parched, largely owing to the apathy of the authorities concerned. Residents of Hosayallapur, which abuts the lake, are understandably upset with the state government’s failure to take cognisance of Koli Keri’s polluted state. Aggrieved residents have pointed to the obvious hazards that the contaminated lake poses to the health of those in its vicinity, not to mention the threat to animals and marine creatures.Koli Keri, spread across 40 acres, is bearing the brunt of Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation’s (HDMC) negligence. Residents attributed the alarming levels of pollution to the HDMC’s practice of dumping garbage on the banks of the lake. Tests have confirmed that the lake’s water is highly contaminated, and unfit for consumption for animals and human being alike. Furthermore, the lake runs contiguous to the sprawling agricultural fields on side, while a Hindu crematorium lies on the other and the residential locality of Hosayallapur is at the other edge of Koli Keri.Water collected in the lake flows in from Rajatgiri, Vidyagiri, Saraswatpur and Jannat Nagar. Unfortunately, water from the stormwater drains also flows into Koli Keri, the maintenance of which falls under the purview of the minor irrigation department. The lake has now turned into a breeding ground for several infectious diseases.The project envisages cleaning and desilting the lake, diverting the sewage flowing into the lake, preventing garbage from being dumped in its catchment areas and rectification of the stormwater drain network to prevent the flow of polluted water into Koli Keri. The project also proposes the construction of bunds around the lake, in addition to the development of a walking path along its rim. The aim is to turn the lake into a sanctuary for birds.In 1996-97, when the district lake development committee was tasked with drafting a preliminary report on reviving Koli Keri, then deputy conservator of forests Shrikantaiah and assistant conservator of forests Shankar Sadhani had submitted their findings. Unfortunately, the minor irrigation department, despite being allocated funds for rejuvenating the lake, while addressing some of the problems, did not revive Koli Keri. Thankfully, the efforts of then MLA Chandrakant Bellad and then deputy commissioner Darpan Jain, a new detailed project report was submitted by HDMC, seeking Rs 5 crore for the project. The report was submitted to the Karnataka Lake Development Authority, which, in turn, sent it to the National Lake Development Authority.JD(S) leader Suresh Hiremath said that the state government sanctioned Rs 2 crore towards Koli Keri’s rejuvenation when Vinay Kulakrni was the Dharwad district in-charge minister. “The project envisaged fencing the lake, construction of a walking path, building a musical fountain and developing an open gymnasium. Unfortunately, none of this has materialised and the condition of the lake is pitiable,” Hiremath rued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/neglected-polluted-koli-keri-a-breeding-ground-for-diseases/articleshow/88057835.cms||---

Others accompanying her are already on other side by that time. The team reaches a hut a little further, where the woman vaccinates a villager as the child stands by.For Praveena Wankhede, a health worker posted in Melghat region of Amravati district, has become a routine these days. Praveena starts from the health sub-centre at Motha village under Chikaldhara tehsil, over 80kms from Amravati town. She rides on a bike for over 16km with her husband, reaching villages under her area. The last mile connectivity is on foot. “Sometimes, I bring my three and half years old daughter with me if there is no arrangement at home,” she says. The video was shot this week when the team was in Aadnala village which the authorities say has been fully vaccinated now.Due to the MSRTC strike, there are no buses running in the area. So, the health workers have to manage on their own where government vehicles are not available. Praveena takes a bike ride. “Even after going by bus, we have to walk down around 4kms from the bus stand. So, at times, a bike is better,” she said.Praveena has to go for such trips every alternate day, often her husband and child accompany the journey.As vaccination remains an uphill task in Melghat, a predominantly tribal area, teams have to also reach out to people in remote areas. Some pockets are only accessible by foot. Videos of such journeys are regularly posted in the internal WhatsApp groups of the district administration.Melghat has two talukas — Dharni and Chikaldhara — the latter has more inaccessible areas, said sourcesThere are three remote villages under Mothi sub-centre. Aadnadi, where Praveena and her team had gone, has been fully vaccinated. There is some resistance in Bhildkheda and Mangbhang hamlets.Sources in the district administration said there are different pockets where going by foot is the only option. The distances are as much as 2 to 2.5kms but teams do reach there as part of door-to-door drive. “Despite a number of attempts to push vaccination, superstition hampers the region. Lately, there was a strong rumour that vaccination is life threatening. The locals said they don’t mind not being extended government schemes but they would not get vaccinated. Yet, we have been able to push through,” said an official in tehsil office level.A door-to-door survey is being carried out for those who cannot reach the centres. The free vaccination drive continues.“There is another sub-centre — Katkumbh — which has a village deep in the jungle over 55kms away from the centre. There are over 231 persons eligible to be vaccinated, out of which 200 have been covered,” said a source.Another video shows women workers walking on an elevated area to reach a house as a pup follows them. This is Rehtyakheda, another inaccessible pocket.So far, 69% of the targeted population over 81,000 odd persons have got the first dose in Chikaldhara and 22% have got the second.Dharni, the other taluka in Melghat region, also has remote areas. “But it is not as inaccessible. Migration of locals in search of work is the issue here. Locals go to Amravati or other cities for work. This affects vaccination,” said sourcesIn Dharni, 52% have got the first dose and 13% have taken the second jab.The Amravati collector Pavneet Kaur said there has been a major jump lately due to the drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/foot-soldiers-going-extra-mile-to-vax-melghat-villages/articleshow/88058691.cms||Shishir Arya

Even the maximum temperature plummeted almost 15-odd degrees to 18 C from Wednesday’s 33 C. Urban and rural areas in south Gujarat continued to receive light to moderate rain even on Thursday. Total 47mm rain was recorded in Surat district and city, while in the tribal district 15mm rain was recorded in the past 24 hours. Two mm rain was recorded in Valsad. Due to the incessant light rain since the morning, commuters in many areas got stuck in heavy traffic jams at multiple locations. Due to the chaotic traffic situation, roads where traffic movement is light on normal days saw heavy vehicle movement. Rainy weather also impacted the Ponk fair on the banks of river Tapi forcing the Ponk-roasting traders to close chulhas and take shelter from the chill as well cover their stock with plastic sheets to prevent damage. “If ponk gets drenched in rain, it will lose taste and colour. Since there was no heavy rain, our stock will maintain its distinct flavour,” said an optimistic ponk seller. Jayesh Patel, president, Khedut Samaj, Gujarat told TOI, “The unseasonal rain may not impact agriculture in south Gujarat heavily, but there will be some impact on mango farming as it requires dry weather before the flowering season starts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/it-looks-a-lot-like-winter-as-coastal-surat-chills-at-16c/articleshow/88058686.cms||---

Stating that the scientists and experts are still having early projections related to the Omicron Covid variant, Dr Tatya Lahane, who is a Padma Shri award winner, said, following Covid-appropriate behaviour and undergoing immunization could prove to be the best defence against the pandemic. “While the first confirmed case of Omicron variant in the world emerged on November 26, the scientist community requires around four weeks to develop a precise understanding of the variant. Once proper studies are finished, the medical field gets a better idea about dealing with the Covid-19,” he said. Earlier, in his formal address, Dr Lahane appealed to the youth to strive for the development of society. “The basic purpose of education is to not only to make an individual self-sufficient but also ensure he or she realizes the social responsibility. The youth should utilize their knowledge for the development of the society,” he added. Lahane and former vice-chancellor of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu) and writer Nagnath Kotapalle were honoured with the lifetime achievement award of the Nanded university on the occasion. Kotapalle, in his speech, expressed concerns over the reduced focus on research activities in India. “As compared to many other countries, India has a very small share in global research taking place in different domains. The education policy of the country should address the related issues,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/very-contagious-virus-is-less-virulent-lahane/articleshow/88057838.cms||---

Addressing a gathering in Saharanpur during foundation stone laying ceremony of Ma Shakumbhari Devi University in the district, Yogi flayed the previous government denouncing them of unleashing anarchy which resulted in mass exodus of people from the region. He attacked the previous SP government for felicitating those accused in 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. Likewise, in the case of 2014 Saharanpur riots the Sikh community was at the receiving end as scores of their establishments and shops were set ablaze by the rioters, he recalled. "It was because of these riots that the Hindu faith came under attack and celebrations of festivals and melas remained disrupted," Yogi said. This, he said, is not the case anymore. "There has not been a single riot in the last five years and people are celebrating festivals with all the vigor," he said. The CM said that Saharanpur, which is known for agriculture, handicraft and industries had been demanding a university of its own for the past many years. "But the previous government did not have development on their agenda," he said, declaring that the construction of the university will be fast tracked. Ma Shakumbhari Devi University, which is proposed to come up at an estimated cost of Rs 92 crore. In the phase 50 acres of land has been allocated for the university and a deadline of June 2023 has been fixed. As many as 264 degree colleges in parts of west UP region will be affiliated to it. "This is the same region where the cane farmers were left harried because of non-payment of dues and casteism and nepotism was at its peak," he said. The CM said that not only various developmental projects were being speeded up but also a robust law and order situation was put in place for expediting the growth of the state and its people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-attacks-oppn-parties-accuses-them-of-fomenting-communal-riots/articleshow/88060124.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Vijayawada||AP to dump 400 norms to attract investments||AMARAVATI: In an attempt to make doing business further easy, the government is contemplating to relax the rules and attract investments into the state. The government has informed the NITI Aayog that it is planning to abolish about 400 rules and regulations from the set of over 1,300 which are found to be creating hurdles to new industrialists who want to invest in the state. AP is determined to make the state a best destination for investors by clearing all the roadblocks. A delegation of NITI Aayog, headed by vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar, interacted with the senior officials of the industries department and industrialists at Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) buildings late on Wednesday. Special chief secretary (industries) Karikal Valaven, APEDB CEO and APIIC MD JVN Subramanyam and other senior officials were present. Rajiv Kumar promised to extend fullest support from Centre to the industrialists. He said they would make suitable recommendations to the Centre to promote the industrialisation in the state. He said NITI Aayog is aware of the fact that AP had suffered following the bifurcation and needed certain additional measures to provide relief. “AP is number one in the country in Ease of Doing Business (EODB) rankings. The state government has done tremendous job in relaxation of certain age-old rules and regulations to promote the industrialisation. However, it could tap more investments by clearing unneeded hurdles,” said Rajiv Kumar. He suggested industrialists to make use of Product Linked Incentive scheme announced by Centre. Making a presentation, special CS Valaven said the state government has readied a blue print to remove all the hurdles before investors. He said the state government launched a new industrial policy where they would handhold the investors till their units launched commercial operations. He said chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is very particular about encouraging the MSMEs as they were generating more employment after agriculture sector. He said the state government launched YSR Navodayam scheme for MSMEs through which they have rescheduled the old loans. He said state government had paid all the incentives due to the MSMEs in order to make them recover from the covid-19 induced loses. Valaven said they have devised the industrial policy in such a way that more incentives would be granted to those putting their investments in backward districts. “AP has reported higher GSDP and export rate than the national average even during the covid-19,” said Valaven.

The district administration's efforts are now yielding results, as 58 villages in Dharwad district have achieved 100% vaccination of the first dose. Now, health officers and workers are working hard to achieve similar results in other villages. Dr SM Honakeri, RCHO and nodal officer, Dharwad district, told TOI: “We have been working hard to meet our goal of vaccinating all eligible people in the district. In Dharwad district, we have now reached 100% vaccination of the first dose in 58 villages.

We have achieved this despite vaccine hesitancy among some people.” Dr Ashok Agarwal, who works in Selvadi PHC, said, “We faced a difficult situation in villages in reaching out to people because many would leave for work in the early morning and return in the evening, so we kept visiting each house and managed to vaccinate everyone with the first dose. We also went to farmers' fields and vaccinated some people. We held many camps and persuaded people with the help of local leaders, and we were successful in vaccinating everyone. Some NGOs have also provided ambulances and other facilities which helped us to reach this target,” he said.

---||Chandigarh||Foundation stone of Kharar bus stand laid for second time||TNN Mohali: The Congress party laid the foundation stone of Kharar bus stand for the second time in the past four years. Transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring laid the foundation stone on Thursday. After laying the foundation stone, Warring said that no one knew that former CM Captain Amarinder Singh laid the foundation stone in 2017. “If it was laid, then why the bus stand could not be constructed? This time it will become a reality,” he said. Giving a major fillip to infrastructure in the region, Punjab transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring laid the foundation stone of the modern bus stand to be built here at a cost of Rs 6.57 crore. The upcoming bus stand is a dream project of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. It will be developed on 16 kanals of Panchayat Samiti land in the heart of the city. Crediting the chief minister with reinvigorating the much-needed project, which had been in limbo for four and a half years, Warring said Charanjit Singh Channi acknowledges the concerns and aspirations of people. “Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had shared with me that he had once travelled to Kharar by bus to join an agitation and at that time, buses did not stop there. The chief minister then decided to ensure that the city got a proper bus stand.” The new bus stand will have five bays to streamline passenger entry into buses, especially the elderly, a cafeteria besides 34 shops. It will have all required amenities of clean drinking water and toilet facilities besides separate male and female rest rooms and cabins with proper signages. There will be no dearth of funds for this project and I will ensure it is completed within the fix timeframe, Warring announced. The CM has given me free hand to ensure we increase the revenue of state government by catching the tax offenders like Badals, the Minister said his aim is to enhance daily department revenue to Rs 1.50 Crore daily which as of today stands at Rs 1.05 Crore daily. Allaying their concerns, Raja Warring also assured shopkeepers that nobody's business will be impacted and they would be suitably accommodated within the upcoming complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/foundation-stone-of-kharar-bus-stand-laid-for-second-time/articleshow/88058693.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Many want to save 208-yr-old banyan in way of owner’s building plan||Nagpur: To cut or not to cut, a notice issued by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) inviting objections over proposed axing of a 208-year-old banyan tree on a private property has sparked controversy.The owners of the property, on which the tree stands in Sitabuldi, want it felled to construct a residential scheme. Green crusaders though want it to be saved, and wish to see the same outcry for ‘unsustainable development projects which are killing thousands of such age-old trees’.The plot owner, Ghanshyam Purohit, who is a builder by profession, wanted to go by the law. “In 2017, I submitted an application at NMC’s garden department for felling the tree. Being an environment lover myself, I didn’t want to cut the tree going against the norms. NMC officials inspected the spot but didn’t grant us permission.”Wanting to construct a residential apartment, Purohit again applied for permission recently. “When we are ready to follow the law and undertake compensatory plantations, I don’t understand why NMC is not granting us permission. I have to pay my debts. If NMC doesn’t allow me to cut the tree and go ahead with the scheme, I would appeal to them to take my land and give me compensation in return,” he added.Environment experts, who visited the spot, are ready to help the owner come up with a sustainable alternative plan. “We have asked the owner to share the apartment designs with us. Most architects don’t make plans focusing on how existing trees can be saved. We are willing to study the plan and see if there is any way we can save the tree and still build the apartment,” said conservation architect Sandeep Pathe.Ever since the public notice has come out, activists have been flooded with calls from concerned people across the country. “We even got a call from someone living in Australia. People from different cities are asking if they should bring a morcha to Nagpur. While we appreciate this, we fail to understand why the same concern is not shown for projects like Ajni Vann. Here it’s one tree but at Ajni Vann, thousands of such heritage trees are at stake. Is it easy to raise a voice against a common man but not against a project backed by powerful politicians?” said activist Anasuya Kale Chhabrani.According to NMC officials, the objections will be compiled and will then be sent to the state tree committee as per the amended tree act. “In 2017, paperwork was not complete hence we didn’t give permission,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/many-want-to-save-208-yr-old-banyan-in-way-of-owners-building-plan/articleshow/88058704.cms||Manka Behl
---||Delhi||Govt ignored issues causing pollution: BJP||New Delhi: Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and leader of the Opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri demanded chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s resignation after the Supreme Court chided the Delhi government over air pollution. “The Delhi government is not capable of solving the problem. This situation has arisen only because of the wrong policies of the Delhi government. In the last seven years, not a single new bus was purchased in Delhi, no attention was paid to repairing the roads and neither roads were expanded, nor flyovers were built to meet the growing needs. For years, even the work of the underpass of Ashram Chowk is not being completed by the government,” Bidhuri alleged, claiming that the situation worsened only because the Delhi government did not pay adequate attention to the fundamental issues causing pollution. “If Kejriwal has any morality or shame left in him, he should immediately resign,” Gupta said. No response was available from the Delhi government despite TOI’s attempts.

Now, to cement this association, he will reach the Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) on a boat via the holy Ganga to inaugurate this over Rs 700-crore project, touted to be his favourite. A direct access to Kashi Vishwanath Dham temple from river Ganga side has become possible with the completion of the KV Dham project, which he had started in March 2019. Officials and the company executing the KV Dham (corridor) project giving finishing touches to the ramp, ghat steps in Varanasi on ThursdayWhen TOI took stock of the KV Dham project area on Thursday, it was evident that all focus of the officials as well as the company executing it was on giving finishing touch to the ramp, ghat steps and already completed buildings. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal, who camped the site in the morning, said, “The PM is likely to reach KV Dham via Ganga on December 13 and enter the project area from Jalasen Ghat, the entry point of the corridor at the river bank. After reaching KV Dham campus, he will perform the rituals of opening this ambitious project at Mandir Chowk.” “He would also address the gathering of selected people at the same venue. Buildings of Mandir Chowk have already been finished while flooring work is in its final phase,” the commissioner said. He expressed confidence that all the remaining work at this point, including ramp and view point from where people could see the KVT on one side and river Ganga on the opposite, will also be finished in a couple of days as the company has to hand over the project area after completing all the work by December 10. All efforts were being made at the riverfront entry point of the corridor to complete the work which would enable visitors to access the corridor and temple directly from Jalasen Ghat. The commissioner said that a jetty in river Ganga has already been constructed while work on finishing the ramp is in progress. This entry point of the KV has witnessed many other works, including Manikarnika gate, Jalasen entrance point, a Ganga view gallery, cafeteria and public utilities, which were added later to this project and will be completed in the second phase. “The second phase work is also likely to be completed by January-end,” he added. The KV Dham project had been initiated by chief minister Yogi Adityanath after the formation of his government in 2017. After completion of basic exercise, especially the purchase of 320 identified buildings and their removal, the PM laid the foundation of the mega project on March 8, 2019. Major construction work, except the riverfront side, was done at an accelerated pace. Officials said that removal of some dilapidated buildings, which were purchased near riverfront late due to one or other reasons, had resulted in changes in the initially approved design of the project area especially at its entry points from ghats along the river Ganga. Officials said, “Not only space for creating Ganga view gallery was found, but the alignment of the approach road from the access points near Manikarnika, Jalasen and Lalita Ghats to KVT became more convenient for the visitors. At this entry point, the visitors will have to move on steps and ramp up to the highest flood point after which they will find an escalator facility to reach up the areas like Mandir Chowk. The completion of the second phase of the project will enable people to stay at a giant platform to be known as Ganga view gallery, while a lower platform will be utilized for events like Ganga Aarti and cultural activities. Between both platforms steps are being constructed in the shape of a pyramid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pm-to-reach-kvd-on-boat-via-ganga-route-for-opening-rs-700-cr-project/articleshow/88059348.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Bassi SHO Bhupendra Singh said the victim Vicky’s body was recovered from a secluded spot near Chainpura village on Tuesday. He worked as a painter and electrician. Police examined CCTV footage of nearby areas and arrested four persons identified as Anil alias Papu (40), Deepak Kumar (32), Kanaram (23) and Raju alias Golu (18). Singh said the entire scheme was plotted by a woman identified as Reshma. She suspected that Vicky had an illicit relationship with her daughter-in-law. “The victim lived in a rented room in the same locality. Reshma suspected Vicky of having an illegitimate relationship with her son Deepak’s wife,” Singh said, adding that Reshma is currently on the run. Police said the accused had abducted Vicky on Monday and took him in their SUV to multiple places. They first strangulated him and then returned to beat him up with sticks to ensure that he was dead. As per Singh, Reshma is one of the prime accused in the case and had enlisted the help of other man. Police said Reshma thought that her daughter-in-law was ready to elope with the victim, this led to Reshma planning a murder conspiracy. The accused had dumped Vicky’s body in a secluded field behind a local school in Chainpura. They fled in their SUV through small pathways in order to avoid being caught in the CCTVs of toll booths. But police had learned about the movement of a suspicious vehicle in the location after the crime and rounded up the suspects for the interrogation where they admitted to the conspiracy. Police also said that the accused had consumed liquor before killing the victim. A love letter was also recovered from the victim’s clothes, which is under investigation to find out who had written it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/4-arrested-for-bassi-youths-grim-murder-over-illicit-love-affair/articleshow/88060130.cms||---

The decision, taken during the meeting of the high-powered Team-9 on Covid-19, aims at creating healthy competition in the community to achieve maximum coverage. “It has been decided that villages where all eligible persons have taken their first dose will be labelled as first dose saturated villages and heads of these villages will be felicitated for the effort made,” an official spokesperson said. There are over 90,000 villages in Uttar Pradesh and rural vaccination has remained in top gear since the launch of the cluster model in July. Health officials monitoring the progress of Covid-19 vaccination in the state have noted that 55% of the total doses given in Uttar Pradesh have been received by the rural population. In the cluster model, vaccination target population was divided on a micro scale, covering sub-block levels. Reaching out to villages one by one through the micro-plan comprised motivation reinforcement and taking service to the doorstep of the villagers. Health officials said UP’s success on the vaccination front is directly linked to the cluster model. Data from the CoWin Portal shows that UP is the state with the highest number of doses administered besides being home to over 5 crore fully vaccinated adults and 11.5 crore partially vaccinated adults. In all, 15 crore people are eligible for vaccination against coronavirus in UP.

The government has also set up escrow account to clear the bills soon after completion of the works. The state has secured Rs 2,000 crore loan from the Bank of Baroda (BOB) for road works.  The government had called the tenders to initiate repairs of all the major roads including the state highways and major district roads two months ago. However, contractors kept themselves away from filing the bids in view of the financial troubles of the state. The contractors feared that they might not get the bills on time after the completion of the works. After seeing the poor response from the contractors, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy directed the Roads and Buildings (R&B) department to initiate measures to create confidence among the contractors.  Subsequently, the R&B department held discussions with the contractors and cleared their apprehensions about clearing the bills. The government promised the contractors to pay the bills through escrow account soon after completion of the third party quality control agencies after finishing the works. Although, the contractors insisted on clearing the old dues, the government told them it would first clear the bills pertaining to the works to be initiated under road maintenance project. Subsequently, the contractors expressed their inability to take up the works at old prices due to the steep increase in the cost of material components including cement, gravel and bitumen.  Taking the issue of road conditions with a serious note, the state government decided to revise the prices of material and pay the contractor at the new price index.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pay-row-ends-road-works-to-begin-soon/articleshow/88058719.cms||Samdani MN

However, in the April-November period, registrations of homes have increased by a whopping 95% from 14,060 in 2020 to 27,349 in 2021. Realtors expect sales and registrations to again pick up in December and January. Developers and realty consultants attributed the November decline to multiple factors: registration rush to meet the October 30 incentive deadline before it was extended by three months, lack of awareness among a section of prospective home buyers that the incentive is still available and narrowing of choices with depleting inventory and absence of new project launches. “Since the incentive period was to end in October, home buyers have queued up till late in the evening throughout October to get the homes registered. Consequently, there is a lull in November. Also, enough projects have not been launched to excite the market. On the contrary, inventory has declined as many units have got lapped up due to the incentive,” said Sushil Mohta, president of the Bengal chapter of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India. He though is confident sales and registrations will again pick up in December and January, leading to the best-ever fiscal for the real estate sector in Kolkata. “Kolkata’s real estate market continues to benefit from the stamp duty cut window extension. Though the pace of residential property registrations did slow down in November 2021, the sharp Y-o-Y rise since July 2021, is encouraging for both developers and buyers going forward. We are hopeful that the next three months will see more deals being sealed in Kolkata’s residential segment as prices remain stable and the interest rates continue to be low. This is an opportune time for buyers to execute transactions before there is any upward revision in prices by developers as stamp duty cut window has been extended till January 31, 2022,” said Knight Frank India chairman and managing director Shishir Baijal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/realtors-expect-sales-to-pick-up-again-after-nov-registration-lull/articleshow/88058721.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The foundation stone of a 12-lakh litre per hour discharge capacity drainage pumping station, which will largely solve the recurring waterlogging problem of a huge area under Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC), was laid opposite City Centre II on Thursday. BMC board of administrators chairperson Krishna Chakraborty, Rajarhat New Town MLA Tapas Chatterjee, Rajarhat Gopalpur MLA Aditi Munshi, Hidco MD Debashis Sen and other senior officials were present on the occasion. Officials said the project, which is a collaboration of different government agencies, is scheduled to be completed before next monsoon. The project is being funded by Hidco and will be executed by the state public health engineering (PHE) department. A huge area under Rajarhat New Town assembly constituency and places including Haldiram junction on VIP Road, Chinar Park, BMC ward 6, 7, 12 and a large part of BMC ward 4 and 5, will benefit once the pumping station starts functioning. “The capacity to flush out excess stormwater of the entire area will be four to five times more than the present capacity,” said a BMC official. Vast areas of Rajarhat and New Town were inundated during heavy showers in September this year. Meanwhile, Bidhannagar MLA Sujit Bose and senior KMDA officials inspected the work progress of the 15MGD water supply project that is being set up at Bangur-Dum Dum Park area. The project is expected to be start operating by March next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-pumping-stn-to-end-new-town-flooding-woes/articleshow/88058728.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The authorities are identifying more stretches from where parking fee is being collected illegally. NDITA officials said that one such stretch from near Webel building has now been demarcated as a fee-parking zone that will be operated by agencies for collection of parking fee. Unauthorized agents had been fleecing motorists on this stretch by collecting Rs 20 from cars for every hour and Rs 10 from bikes, claiming that it was a fee parking zone. The police had also arrested one person. Police said they regularly keep a check across Sector V to prevent any such unauthorized collection of parking fee. NDITA is engaging fresh agencies to operate the parking zones. Tenders have been floated to engage agencies to operate two such zones for one year. The contract may later be renewed for five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-fee-parking-zone-in-sec-v-to-weed-out-touts/articleshow/88058732.cms||Suman Chakraborti

It will be able to supply 4.5 million litres per day potable water. The site located at a corner of the project will later be developed into a green space, said an EDMC official, adding that the project aims to augment drinking water supply in the neighbouring areas and will also help generate Rs 4.2-crore revenues for the civic body. Officials claimed that the site won’t affect the project work, which has missed several deadlines due to funds shortage. The total green belt measures 32.4 acres. The proposal for transferring land to DJB was okayed at a standing committee meeting on Thursday and sent to the House for final approval. “DJB had requested for the allotment on permanent basis and a survey was also conducted in September-end,” the proposal stated. DJB can’t use the allotted area for any commercial purpose without prior approval of the corporation in writing. It will also have to get the construction plan approved by the municipal authorities and no deviation will be acceptable. A DJB official said the site would be cordoned off to avoid water contamination. “The purpose is to ensure equitable distribution. Generally water is stored at one place and later it is supplied in an equitable manner. It helps in getting water in sufficient quality, quantity and duration. When the supply is made directly to consumers, the issue of unequal supply is quite common,” said the official. “We are developing such reservoirs in different areas for 24x7 supply,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-gives-land-near-jheel-to-djb-for-reservoir/articleshow/88060194.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Delhi||Supreme Court rejects DMRC plea against arbitral award||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has dismissed a plea filed by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) seeking review of its judgement that upheld the 2017 arbitration award of around Rs 4,600 crore in favour of Reliance Infrastructure subsidiary, Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt Ltd (DAMEPL), enforceable against it. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat said no case for review was made out. “We have gone through the review petitions and the connected papers filed therewith. In our opinion, no case for review of order is made out. The review petitions are dismissed. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of,” the bench in its November 23 order said. The apex court on September 9 had upheld the 2017 arbitration award enforceable against DMRC and said there was a disturbing tendency of courts setting aside arbitral awards.  The top court had quashed the Delhi high court order that had set aside the arbitration award in favour of DAMEPL, which had pulled out from running the Airport Express Metro line over safety issues. The arbitral tribunal in its May 2017 award had accepted DAMEPL’s claim that the running of operations on the line was not viable due to structural defects in the viaduct through which the train would run.  The decision by a division bench had come on DMRC appeal against a single judge order of March 6 last year upholding the arbitral award in DAMEPL’s favour.  The concession agreement between the two was signed on August 25, 2008. Under the agreement, DMRC was to carry out the civil works, excluding at the depot, and the balance, including the project system work, were to be executed by DAMEPL, a joint venture of Rinfra and a Spanish construction company — Construcciones Y Auxiliar De Ferrocarriles — with a shareholding of 95 and five per cent, respectively. The Airport Express line was commissioned on February 23, 2011 after an investment of over Rs 2,885 crore, funded by the DAMEPL promoters’ fund, banks and financial institutions.

Last year, phase 1 and 2 combined there were only 195 companies. The highest package offered so far is Rs 65.46 lakh, up from last year’s Rs60 lakh. This year 668 students have registered for placements at IIT-H. In phase 1 of placement that began on December 1, a total of 225 offers have been made — 143 are full-time and 82 are pre-placement offers. With the pandemic giving a push to digital roles, the institute has observed a rise in number of offers in data science, business analyst, research engineer etc. “Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Amazon, Accenture, Indeed, Optum, Flipkart and Jaguar are among top companies offering jobs at IIT-H this year. Several start-ups are also participating in campus placements for 2021-22,” said Abhinav Kumar, faculty-in-charge, office of career services at IIT-H, adding that the number of six-month internship offers have more than doubled to 28 from last year’s 12. “It has been a long journey that started with anxious assessments and ended with a cheerful offer letter. I sure learned a lot on placement, and while it was obviously great to increase my technical knowledge, the soft skills were the most significant to me,” said Abhignya Pampati, an MTech student, who landed a job at Google. Also, the first batch of MTech in networks and information security (NIS) graduated from IIT-H this year. “Opting for MTech in NIS exposes one to the research areas of network architecture, cryptography and internet of things security, while also ensuring ample job opportunities in big tech firms and start-ups alike,” said Shubham Lahoti, teaching assistant at department of computer science and engineering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iit-h-offers-overcome-covideffect-ph-1-starts-with-bang/articleshow/88059355.cms||Preeti Biswas

The petition pointed out that during the first and second waves, thousands of people have lost their lives and the state government struggled to provide essential medicines and oxygen. The hospital, doctors, and medical staff were overwhelmed by the level of infection. Besides, the government is constantly reviewing its policy on opening educational institutes and such a rally should be avoided at all costs, the petitioner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pil-against-cong-jaipur-rally-hearing-on-dec-6/articleshow/88060137.cms||---

Prof. Lakhotia said, "The metallic piece went inside the patient's body accidentally while he was firing a cracker from a country-made equipment during Diwali in Mathmahamadpur village in Mau district. The 18-year-old youth suffered grave injury while exploding the cracker from the equipment holding it in his hand. The cracker probably malfunctioned and the metallic piece of the equipment backfired and pierced into the patient's chest, badly injuring his right lung. He developed severe pain and became breathless. He was taken to the hospital in Mau, from where he was referred to the BHU Hospital." "He underwent an emergency operation for removal of the metal inside his lung and drainage of the collected blood in his right thoracic cavity. Due to severity of the injury, his upper part of right lung was severely injured and this resulted in loss of large amounts of blood in his right pleural cavity. He was lucky that his heart was not injured. Surgery lasted for around three hours," Prof. Lakhotia added. After removal of the metallic piece, the lung was repaired and the bleeding points were controlled. Now, the patient is fine and was discharged from the hospital on Thursday, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/in-complex-surgery-ims-bhu-docsremove-metal-piece-from-youths-lung/articleshow/88059356.cms||Binay Singh
---||Mumbai||South Mumbai celeb trainer duped of Rs 20,000 for Instagram blue tick||MUMBAI: A 25-year-old commerce graduate has been arrested for duping a Malabar hill resident, a fitness trainer for celebrities and business persons, by promising her to get a blue tick verified badge (see box) for her Instagram account. The accused also similarly cheated another woman, who works in digital media. He told the police he makes around Rs 1 lakh a month through this activity.  Latishkumar Sharma was nabbed from his Secunderabad residence by a team led by API Tukaram Dige of Malabar Hill police station. “He has formed a company, LM Digital Media Pvt Ltd., but it is not functional. He uses his Paytm account to get money,” said Dige.  The complainant in the first of the two cases, a 33-year-old woman, told police she learnt about Sharma through a friend who got an Instagram blue tick through him (certain criteria -- see box -- need to be fulfilled for blue tick verification. She got his number and contacted Sharma, who asked her to fill a form and deposit Rs 20,000. This was in October last year. When the complainant did not get any blue tick on her Instagram account, she called up Sharma, who later switched off his phone. The victim lodged a police complaint in August this year.  Sharma was arrested on Thursday, but in the second case, where another woman, dealing in digital media, had contacted him for a blue tick verified badge, paying him Rs 10,000. She too never got a blue tick for her social media account. “He had demanded Rs 70,000 from her and then asked her to deposit Rs 30,000 as advance. She sent Rs 10,000. She lodged her complaint last week,” said an officer. “Sharma had no connection with any social media company, but he would ask every person who contacted him to fill a form, making his operation seem legitimate.”  The police have so far found records of 17 victims while examining Sharma’s phone. The victims are from Madhya Pradesh, Jodhpur, Nasik, and various parts of MMR and the state. The police have warned social media users not to fall prey to such tactics of cyber criminals, and are contacting other victims to ask them to lodge complaints. As a caveat, a police officer said, “Do not pay money to anyone to get any blue tick verified badge. Such badges are allotted by social media companies. So, don't contact any individual other than such platforms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sobo-celeb-trainer-duped-of-rs-20k-for-instagram-blue-tick/articleshow/88060732.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The observation came while hearing a lawyer’s petition, who was asked to visit Rana Pratap Nagar police station with his client or provide information regarding her whereabouts. “At least, prima facie, we find that such a letter or notice could not have been issued to an advocate requiring him or her to divulge any information about the client. In such matters, there is no question of lawyers being required to help the investigating agencies, one way or the other, particularly when they are discharging their professional duties to their clients,” a division bench comprising justices Mahesh Sonak and Pushpa Ganediwala said. While hearing the petition filed by Tarun Parmar through counsel Satish Uke, the bench had asked additional public prosecutor Tehsin Mirza to take instructions on the former’s contentions. Later, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) filed a reply in HC explaining that the letter of November 16 sent to the petitioner was neither an order nor a notice, but a request letter to help the police. “Again, we do not find such an explanation to be acceptable. However, now it is clarified by ACP that their letter was only a request, and there is no question of any adverse consequences, even if the petitioner ignores the same. We do not propose to take this matter any further,” the judges said while accepting the police clarification and disposing of the petition. Parmar approached the HC after police sent him the letter asking him to produce his client, a woman, to record her statement in a complaint of extortion against her filed by her employer. The woman had earlier accused the employer of rape and various violations of the Atrocities Act. Parmar made commissioner of police, ACP Sonegaon division, and deputy commissioner of police at Crime Branch (Detection) as respondents. According to the petitioner, a complaint was registered against his client at Sitabuldi police station by the person who had allegedly committed sexual assault on her. He is also defending her in the petition filed for granting anticipatory bail to her. Terming himself a social worker, the petitioner said he had made various complaints before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against various political leaders, a former collector and CP, and had also recorded his statement at its Mumbai office. According to him, his client had also filed a complaint against Rana Pratap Nagar police station inspector, who told her to delete names of some persons from her complaint and report, as per the CP’s directives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/probe-agency-cant-force-lawyer-to-divulge-clients-whereabouts-hc/articleshow/88059357.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Though accident rate came down due to lockdown in past two years, traffic police focussed on violations and booked lakhs of cases. Following a few accidents involving youth in recent days, traffic police have started checks for drunk driving which were stopped almost two years ago due to Covid-19. They started alcometer tests as part of a special drive on Tuesday and booked 33 people for drunk driving, while cases were registered against 1,818 people for driving without helmet. City police chief Manish Kumar Sinha told TOI that special teams consisting of one sub-inspector or circle inspector and three constables have been posted at 32 key points in the city to check helmet-less riding, rash driving, drunken driving, and use of modified silencers. The teams worked in two sessions from 10 am to 1 pm and 4 pm to 9 pm and booked 1,818 riders without helmet, 33 drunk drivers, 11 rash drivers, and 6 for using modified silencer, he added. The traffic wing of the port city registered 14.37 lakh cases of traffic violations in 2020 and collected a fine of Rs 24.71 crore while the number has increased this year.

As soon as the employees came across it, they ran behind the goat to save the file. However, the video of the incident went viral on social media, drawing attention of hundreds of netizens. In the 22-seconds long video, shot in the Chaubepur block office, a few employees could be seen sitting outside the Panchayat Secretary’s office and some others basking in the sun and doing work. As the office room was empty, the black goat entered inside the vacant room and later, came out pressing a file containing documents in the mouth. As soon as a personnel saw the animal, there was chaos. A man was later seen chasing the goat to get the file back from it. Meanwhile, someone shot a video of this incident and uploaded it on social media. Within seconds the video went viral, with users lashing and mocking the employees for their lackadaisical attitude. A social media user, while replying to the video, wrote, “It is such people who do not understand the dignity of the post and their carelessness, for which no one else but the general public suffers.” Another user said that the goat is going to audit the file, while one other user said, “brother, it seems like a big scam.” The video also recieved a number of comments. “The goat is hungry, and it needs fodder,” one user commented. The incident took place on Wednesday at the office of Panchayat Secretary in Chaubepur block, where the files of work related to village development are stored. It is here that the personnel and officers associated with the Panchayat department sit and do their work. After the incident occured, the employees, later, pasted the pages of the torned file with a transparent tape. Chaubepur block development officer, Mannu Lal Yadav, said that the employees were working outside the room, sitting in the sun, at the time when the goat entered the office and escaped with a file containing documents. However, no person paid heed to it. This is a very serious negligence, an explanation has been sought from the concerned employee in the matter. The employee who went after the goat had, however, snatched the relevant documents from the goat’s mouth, but a part of it was probably gulped by the animal.  “Staff persons have been directed to sit and work inside the office rooms,” said Yadav.

On Thursday, collector K Shashanka visited Kongairigidda village in Gudur mandal and assured a new school building would be constructed in the next two months, and the students taught at the community hall till then. A villager on Wednesday had tweeted a video of the dilapidated building to MA&UD minister KT Rama Rao, who immediately ordered the collector to respond. The Tribal Primary School comprising a hall for students and a staff room was built in 1987. Since then there has been no upkeep, the school staff said. With concrete chunks falling, students were forced to study outside and even eat the mid-day meal in the open. The hall seats all 44 students from classes 1-5 and the school has a head master with an assistant teacher. According to head master (HM) Tenuka Yellaiah, Rs 5.30 lakh was allocated in 2012 under Rajiv Vidya Mission for a new building. But the contractor left after constructing a few pillars and walls in collusion with the then HM who stopped all work citing lack of funds. Now, there was only Rs 93,000 left in the account, Yellaiah said. The collector assured that action would be taken against the earlier HM if it was established that the funds sanctioned in 2012 were misused. “We are uneducated. My grandchildren go to the school in the morning and return in the evening. I do not know what happens there. But the school building is a threat to the safety of all children. It can collapse any moment. We are scared to send them near the building, but doing so only because the head master says that it would give them a better future.

---||Nagpur||Tigers attacking humans wakeup call for government, civil society, says Bombay high court||NAGPUR: Expressing concern over the growing number of wild animals attacking humans, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Thursday said such incidents are a wakeup calls for the government, forest officials and members of civil society. It said there is a need to take immediate steps to restore peaceful co-existence. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Pansare also batted for urgently taking measures to address this issue like providing additional habitats for the wildlife, training field staff, labourers, guides and also to the tourists on their behaviour inside forests. “Stringent measures are required to be taken for protecting precious human life and also the wildlife, as there is a direct connection between them. If the wildlife feels safe and secure in terms of shelter, tranquillity and availability of food, there would be less possibility of wildlife attacking human beings,” the bench said. “If humans feel safe and secure in the forest, there would be less possibility of them turning against wildlife. There is a need for creating an environment where both humans and forests with wildlife peacefully co-exist. If such conditions are not created, the possibility of some humans actively harming wild animals may become a reality,” it added. The directives came while hearing a PIL (No 34/2021) by Udayan Patil, founder member of NGO Srushsti Paryawaran Mandal, highlighting the unfortunate death of forest guard Swati Dhumane in the attack by tigress T-12 (popularly knowns as Maya) on November 20. She was on duty when the attack took place. Patil, through counsel Radhika Bajaj, had made the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEFCC) and Maharashtra department of forest and revenue as respondents. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) and TATR field director are other respondents in the case. While issuing notices to them, they were directed to reply before December 15. According to Bajaj, the tigress was never involved in any violent attack in the past and such incidents are on the rise since the last 3-4 years. A few days after the attack on Dhumne, a similar incident took place in Gadchiroli forest. She also submitted media reports informing on figures of humans killed since 2017 in such attacks. “The administration can explore measures like providing protective shields such as armours and guards around the neck. They can also provide well-protected buses while discarding use of smaller open vehicles like gypsies, encouraging cottage and small-scale industry in villages situated near sanctuaries, parks and other forest areas, and providing incentives for scientifically producing forest produce of varied nature in farm lands so that dependence of humans on forests is reduced,” the justices said. Adding that some of the measures have already been taken and guidelines are also in place, they said there is an urgent need for addressing all these issues on the backdrop of steep rise in incidents of wildlife attacks on human beings in Vidarbha forests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tigers-attacking-humans-wakeup-call-for-govt-civil-socy-hc/articleshow/88059398.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

A retired government servant whose son underwent stem cell therapy eight years said that there was no change in his son’s condition despite the injection. “We followed up with the centre for months, but they kept insisting that my son would benefit from taking another shot,” he said, adding that he had spent over Rs 1.9 lakh at the clinic. “If we had seen some change in our son’s condition, we would have willingly taken the second shot.” Other parents he spoke to also said that they too hadn’t noticed any change in their children after stem cell treatment. Developmental pediatrician Dr Leena Deshpande from Navi Mumbai said, “I have patients whose parents have tried stem cells with no effect. It is sold as a miracle cure and parents willingly spend Rs 3-4 lakh in the process. They are told their child is maintaining better eye contact due to stem cell therapy, but this can happen with regular treatment as well.” While some studies have been published in medical journals about stem cell therapy for autism, Dr Deshpande said they were not done scientifically. “In a scientific study, you have to create two arms in which only one is given stem cells, but this wasn’t done in any of the published studies.” The signatories include Action for Autism-Delhi, Forum for Autism-Mumbai, National Platform for the Rights of the Disabled, as well as 117 doctors, including paediatric neurologists Dr Vrajesh Udani and Dr Anahita Udwadia-Hegde, Dr K John Vijay Sagar from NIMHANS-Bangalore and developmental pediatrician Dr Vibha Krishnamurthy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/doctors-stem-cell-therapy-not-a-magic-cure-for-autism/articleshow/88060772.cms||---

The high court asked what was the need for coercing the violators to pay the challan when there is a provision to file charge sheet against the offenders. The high court also took a serious view and asked how a photograph will become an evidence to issue challan for not having driving licence. One T Leela Krishna from Challapalli in Krishna district moved high court challenging the challans issued to him for not wearing helmet, talking on mobile phone while driving and for not showing driving licence when asked. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, PVG Umesh Chandra told the high court that the allegation of not showing driving licence is false as the petitioner is in possession of licence and the photo attached to the challan that he was not having driving licence is not proving anything. Umesh Chandra further told the court that the Vijayawada police often call the petitioner on his mobile phone to pay the challan amount. He said the said challans issued against him are wrong as the person in the photo attached to the challan was not the petitioner and the vehicle also not belonged to him. Considering the arguments of Umesha Chandra, Justice Ch Manavendranath Roy asked the counsel for the respondents as to how a photograph can be an evidence to show that the petitioner do not have licence. The HC directed the DGP, home secretary and SP to file affidavits in the matter and posted further hearing after three weeks.

Bodies of them surfaced in the lake waters on Thursday. The deceased were identified as E Saritha, wife of Srisailam, a farmer from Midjil town, and infant Bhumika. Their bodies surfaced in Mellakunta lake in Midjil. Police fished out the bodies and recorded the statement of Saritha’s father Sangayya. “Sangayya alleged that at the time of the wedding two years ago, they gave Rs 2 lakh cash and five-tola gold as dowry. However, Srisailam and his parents started harassing Saritha asking her for half an acre of agricultural land. In a suicide note found in the house, Saritha mentioned that she had decided to end her life due to dowry harassment,” Midjil SI Jaya Prasad said. Saritha, a native of Gummakonda village in Thimmajipet mandal of Nagarkurnool district, along with her daughter left her Midjil home on November 30 night. As she did not return home, Srisailam lodged a complaint with Midjil police on December 1 and a missing case was registered. A case of dowry death under IPC section was registered against Srisailam and his parents. No arrests have been made yet.

While speaking in Lalitpur, Akhilesh said, “If my government would have been in power, no one would have to walk even if I had to deploy the district magistrate’s car for ferrying the poor.” He asked people, “Do you want a government who only believes in changing the name and colours or a government which believes in doing work. They may even change the three colours of the traffic light into one.” Akhilesh said this is the new SP which includes people from all walks, cast and religion. Hailing the huge crowd of people and the inclement weather, he said, “Lucknow walo ka mausam kharab ho raha hai (people of Lucknow are facing rough weather).” Attacking Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, he said “the present CM is not a Yogi because Gita says that a yogi is one who understands the sorrows of the poor”. He further said that BJP had announced to take people, who walk in ‘hawai chappal’, in planes but today they have sold the planes and the airport. Because of their decisions, whether be it demonetisation, procuring medicine during pandemic or fertiliser at present, the poor are forced to stand in long queues. “I appeal to you to vote against BJP in long queues and wipe out their line,” Akhilesh said. Accusing the present government, Akhilesh alleged that under the Yogi government, a maximum number of custodial deaths have been reported. He further alleged that the present government was deliberately avoiding a cast-based census as they know that the outcome will be against them. He also promised that if his party is voted to power, it will conduct a caste based census and will pass on the benefits as per the population ratio. He further said SP had initiated dial 100 after getting inspired from America but, ‘inhone sau ke bara karke police ka kabara kar diya’ (they have ruined the police by changing 100 to 112).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/pandemic-migration-trauma-faced-by-poor-worse-than-partition-akhilesh/articleshow/88059401.cms||Arindam Ghosh

The findings of the nationwide survey released on Thursday showed that EV charging infrastructure was a key priority, with 57% keen to invest in the coming 12 months and 21% in 1-3 years. The survey was conducted with a set of questionnaires for resident welfare associations (RWAs) to understand the pulse of gated communities towards EV charging infrastructure facilities, solar power and rainwater harvesting. “Of the three, EVs are clearly a priority area, with solar not far behind and on the other hand, nearly one in three communities had already set up rainwater harvesting facilities,” the survey said. Nearly 800 RWAs participated in the survey, out of which 160 were from Mumbai. As many as 71% of respondents indicated that they intend to install solar energy infrastructure within three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-78-housing-societies-want-to-set-up-ev-charging-infra/articleshow/88060490.cms||Somit Sen
---||World||Woman, 20, sues doctor for allowing her to be born, wins millions||A disabled equestrian showjumper in the United Kingdom won the right to millions of pounds in damages on Wednesday after claiming she should not have been born. Evie Toombes, 20, a spina bifida victim since birth — a condition where a baby’s spine and spinal cord fail to develop in the womb — sued her mother’s doctor in a unique “wrongful conception” court case. She said Dr Philip Mitchell failed to advise her mother to take vital folic acid, which minimises risk of the defect, before becoming pregnant. Had he done so, she claimed, her mother Caroline would have delayed conception until she had taken the supplement and, as a result, Evie would never have been born. Caroline, 50, would instead have had a different totally healthy baby, said Judge Rosalind Coe, who held Dr Mitchell liable. The ruling is a landmark one as it fixes the responsibility of healthcare professionals and holds them liable for improper pre-conception advice. Evie, who has competed in showjumping internationally despite sometimes spending 24 hours a day connected to medical tubes, sued for “having been born in a damaged state”. Her lawyers earlier said the sum she is claiming is not yet calculated but will be “big” as it must cover the cost of extensive care for life. The case will return to court to decide the amount of Evie’s compensation, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Despite her mobility being “very limited”, New York Post reported that she hopes to compete in the paralympics. As she grows older she will be bound more frequently to a wheelchair. She suffers from bowel and bladder issues as a result of her condition, it said in its report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/woman-20-sues-doctor-for-allowing-her-to-be-born-wins-millions/articleshow/88060945.cms||---

The SIT has handed over the list of the names of the accused to the government. The accused will be arrested as soon as the order is received. To recall, 127 Sikhs were killed in the 1984 riots in Kanpur. During that time, 40 cases were registered in Kanpur Nagar, under sections like murder, robbery and dacoity. The police had submitted the final report in 29 of these cases. Earlier, the SIT had recorded statements and searched the records by meeting the people of the victims’ families living in different states. SIT SP, Balendu Bhushan Singh, said that 20 cases with the final report were considered worthy of advance consideration and investigation was started, out of which the investigation of 11 has been completed. “In these cases, 146 rioters were marked, but 79 of them have already died. In such a situation, the number of rioters who survived has been reduced to 67. Although, of these, 20-22 accused are those who are more than 75 years of age or are suffering from serious diseases,” he added. On the question of arrest, he said that he has given a report to the government. As soon as permission will be given, the process of arrest of the remaining 45 accused will be started. The state government had set up SIT on February 5, 2019, to inquire into the circumstances leading to the deadly riots. The team was set up after the apex court issued notice to the state government in August 2017, on a petition seeking SIT probe into the riots. The four-member SIT is headed by retired UP DGP Atul. The other members are retired district judge Subhash Chandra Agarwal, and retired additional director (prosecution) Yogeshwar Krishna Srivastava. SP Balendu Bhushan Singh is its member-secretary. Recently, the tenure of the SIT has been extended by six months. The SIT had written a letter to the state government to extend the tenure. The SIT has now been given time to complete the investigation and make arrests by May 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/sit-identifies-67-accused-of-1984-riots-in-kanpur/articleshow/88059407.cms||---
---||Delhi||Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal gives push to Central schemes in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The flagship schemes of the Centre have been given a major push by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal for their implementation. Since December 2020, the LG has been regularly reviewing and monitoring the schemes, including PM SVANidhi (a micro-credit facility for street vendors), Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) and One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC). In all, 47,884 loans were sanctioned under PM SVAnidhi. Under PMAY (Urban), construction of 3,024 houses in Kalkaji Extension was completed, while 2,800 flats in Kathputli Colony and 1,675 in Jailorwala Bagh, Ashok Vihar, were on the verge of completion. Under ONORC, over 6.8 lakh transactions took place since July. “Since December 18, 2020, 12 meetings were conducted in which the schemes were routinely monitored. This led to seamless coordination between different agencies like Delhi Development Authority, the municipal corporations, food and civil supplies department and DUSIB,” said an official from the LG office. The official added that review meetings were regularly attended by the chief secretary and heads of departments concerned, which resulted in improvement in implementation. In the wake of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021, which came into force from April 27 giving primacy to the LG over the elected government, the meetings fuelled speculation that Baijal was assuming a greater role in administration. However, an LG office official said the review meetings of flagship schemes were going on since December 2020, while the amendment Act came into force in April 2021. The PM SVANidhi scheme is aimed at providing financial relief to street vendors stressed due to the pandemic and related lockdowns. The LG also wrote to the RBI governor to prompt hesitant banks to disburse loans to the beneficiaries. Over the past one year, urban local bodies approved and issued 1,09,862 letters of recommendations for loans to banks. Of these, 79,406 applications actually reached banks and 47,884 loans were sanctioned. Under the PMAY (Urban) scheme, nearly 79,000 dwelling units would be provided to about 4 lakh people living in Delhi’s slums. Of these, 51,716 units would be developed according to the in situ rehabilitation policy and about 26,000 houses through credit-linked subsidies. The ONORC scheme was implemented in all 1998 fair price shops from July 19. The months of July, August, September and October saw 16,150, 40,797, 91,268, and 1,06,926 transactions, respectively. Till November 25, 6,78,22 transactions were recorded. Delhi had the highest number of transactions across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lg-gives-push-to-central-schemes-in-delhi/articleshow/88060210.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Pune||Covid-19 variant Omicron chase to change genome sequencing plan||PUNE: A needle in a haystack hunt currently under way for Omicron — the latest variant of concern of SARS-CoV-2 — is set to rejig the country's genome sequencing strategy. Research centers across the country are advising genomic sequencing of positive samples (virus particles) detected using the RT-PCR kit that uses the ‘S’ gene target failure (SGTF) strategy. “This will reduce the scope of our search for Omicron and make it more focused. In the SGTF strategy, we can primarily take up those positive samples in which RTPCR test result has shown the S gene drop-out or negative result, but Orf and N gene-positive results,” Nagpur-based CSIR-NEERI scientist Krishna Khairnar, one of the key researchers in Covid diagnostics in India, told TOI. Multiple genes make up the genetic structure of SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19. Most of the available RT-PCR kits in India and abroad currently target multiple genes of the virus. But most spare the ‘S’ gene target detection. There are a handful of RT-PCR kits that target three or more genes, including the ‘S’ type, of Covid. “Hence, if a person tests positive using such an RT-PCR kit, we can then take his or her sample for whole genomic sequencing on priority. The chances of the variant detection rise manifold in such cases. This will also save a lot of time and resources genome sequencing as sequencing is costly,” Khairnar said. The Omicron variant has been found to include the 69-70 del mutation of the ‘S’ gene, first identified as a mutation in the Alpha variant. “This mutation causes a dropout of the ‘S’ gene target using the specialized RT-PCR test kit available in India. This could indicate to clinicians and researchers a possible Omicron variant infection. Confirmation of the variant can then be performed by sequencing the sample,” said a senior scientist from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), New Delhi who refused to be named. “Specialized RT-PCR kits available in India can help us detect cases that may contain the new variant by identifying samples exhibiting S-gene dropout. This early identification is important in helping us track and understand the spread of the B.1.1.529 variant (Omicron) in India,” said senior microbiologist Suvarna Joshi of state-run B J Medical College and Sassoon general hospital in Pune. Laboratories, especially those conducting RT-PCR tests at the airports in Maharashtra, have geared up to have appropriate kits necessary for checking the missing ‘S’ gene for the detection of the Omicron variant. Maharashtra additional chief secretary Dr Pradip Vyas on Tuesday in a letter to all district heads said the WHO guidelines stated that the diagnostic test kits with two confirmatory gene targets, with at least one being the ‘S’ gene, should be used for early detection of the Omicron variant of Covid. “We have started procuring such kits, especially for travellers,” a laboratory official said. A state public health official said there were three to four companies manufacturing such specialized kits and laboratories should use them for early detection of the Omicron variant. Representative of practising pathologists society Dr Rohit Jain said, “In the current scenario, there’s a need to use the RT-PCR kits that can detect the ‘S’ gene drop. It is good that the states are issuing orders mandating use of such kits. The aim should be to ensure that the ‘S’ gene does not go undetected.” State coordinator for genome sequencing Dr Rajesh Karyakate said the use of those kits would certainly hasten the process of identifying the Omicron variant. RT-PCR kits targeting the ‘S’ gene, along with other viral genes, could simultaneously come in handy in the current scenario, experts said. “The mutations in the ‘S’ gene of Omicron lead to SGTF, which can be exploited for preliminary confirmation of Omicron in the Covid-positive samples,” an expert said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/omicron-chase-to-change-genome-sequencing-plan/articleshow/88059402.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Pune: Research labs to check more samples for new variant||PUNE: The research laboratories in the city have intensified the search for Omicron by expanding the pool of Covid positive samples being drawn randomly from private and public laboratories to rule out the presence of the new variant of concern — Omicron (B.1.1.529) — in the region. “Earlier, we had decided to sequence 550 positive samples randomly picked up using the CT value norm from the positive samples detected in Pune in November. Now, we have doubled this number. As of now, a total of 1,400 samples from the Pune region are in process for targeted accelerated sequencing,” said senior microbiologist Rajesh Karyakarte, the state coordinator for genome sequencing. The number of positive samples taken up for sequencing had been doubled in view of the city’s high exposure to Covid and the equally high presence of a globe-trotting population, he said. The samples of patients having had a cycle threshold (CT) value of 30 or less are being taken up for genome sequencing. The CT value is the number of cycles an RTPCR device has had to run to amplify viral RNA to reach a detectable level. A CT value of 30 or less indicates a high viral load in the infected person's throat/nasal swab samples. “The samples need a high viral load because they will be analysed again during the genome sequencing. Some portions (viral particles) get used up during the first test with the RTPCR machines. Hence, we prefer positive samples of less than 30 CT values,” Karyakarte said.  “This sequencing data will help us identify clusters where there is a sudden spike in cases,” said state surveillance officer Pradip Awate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/research-labs-to-check-more-samples-for-new-variant/articleshow/88059408.cms||Umesh Isalkar

In anticipation of the third wave, the administration has ramped up developing of facilities. Soon, a new 100 bed-facility — all oxygen supported — will also be developed. The authorities right now have decided to activate the treatment centres instead of developing new ones. The preparations are on to keep one Covid Care Centre (CCC) ready at each taluka along with one quarantine centre. District collector Rahul Rekhawar said, “We have completed setting up 15 oxygen generation plants. Currently, we have 111 tonne of oxygen generation capacity that is much more than the limit prescribed by the government to tackle the third wave. The 15 oxygen generation plants have a capacity to generate almost 1,200 litre per minute.

---||Delhi||Discrepancies in Metro tree-cutting estimates: CAG||New Delhi: The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) pointed out discrepancies in the tree-cutting estimate of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and flagged its claims of compensatory plantation of more than 1.9 lakh trees as ‘misleading’ in a report tabled in Parliament on Thursday. The observation was part of the Performance Audit Report on Implementation of Phase-III project of DMRC. The report said the corporation didn’t adhere to various norms, such as obtaining environmental clearance and monitoring of compensatory afforestation. Moreover, a water audit, required under the National Water Policy, 2012 and DMRC Water Policy, was not conducted and no records were maintained, either by DMRC or contractors for the water extracted, consumed or lost during the expansion. CAG pointed out that there were no proper records on tree plantations by the forest department and no site visit or inspection was conducted by DMRC officials from April 2011 to December 2018. When contacted, a DMRC spokesperson declined to comment on the findings of the report. In its report, CAG said DMRC decided to adopt driverless technology on all new lines of Phase-III “without preparedness” and, instead of operating nine-coach trains on the new standalone corridors as planned, it decided to operate six-coach trains “without cost benefit analysis” and by eliminating scope for increasing coaches in the future when ridership increases. The report highlighted that while Delhi Metro’s ridership rose between 2011-12 and 2016-17, it was impacted by the fare revision in 2017-18. Ridership for 2018-19 was 25.21 lakh, compared with 25.94 lakh for 2015-16, indicating that there was no incremental growth despite the addition of 131 km of new sections during this period. Actual ridership on the corridors was lower than the projected ridership in detailed project reports, the report said, adding that DMRC didn’t consider a rational method for selecting the most suitable form of transportation like Light Metro and Bus Rapid Transit System as suggested by the Working Group on Urban Transport. According to the report, the completion of the Mayur Vihar Pocket-I to Trilokpuri section ‘missing link’ of the Pink Line got delayed due to frequent change of relocation site of people affected, which led to a delay in awarding of revenue contracts, cost escalation of balance work and under-utilisation of trains and depot facilities. The audit observed that there was an overall shortfall of Rs 1,847.8 crore from property development and against a projected revenue of Rs 1,917.2 crore for non-fare box revenue during 2016-17 to 2019-20, DMRC earned a little over Rs 76 crore. The report added that DMRC has not explored possibilities for property development at Vasant Vihar, Bhikaji Cama Place and Anand Vihar. The report highlighted that DMRC was suffering operational loss instead of earning operating profit as mentioned in its annual report. While calculating operating ratio, DMRC excluded the depreciation and amortisation expenses and interest cost as part of the operating expenses, it added. In another observation, IIT Delhi, which provided technical assistance to CAG, found out that vibration and noise levels were higher than permissible values at different locations of the Pink Line. Some of the significant recommendations made by CAG included ensuring that detailed project reports are prepared with realistic assumptions for computation of financial internal rate of return to ensure economic viability of the corridor. It also recommended that the corporation should ensure timely availability of land for property development to make the project financially viable. CAG suggested that DMRC may consider full-height platform screen doors and evaluation of impact on heating, ventilation and air-conditioning requirements in the underground station design studies. It should also ensure adherence to relevant environmental requirements and carry out water audit, it further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/discrepancies-in-metro-tree-cutting-estimates-cag/articleshow/88060220.cms||---

Police on Thursday produced the minor girl before a bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy. As the girl also gave her consent to go with her parents before the bench, the high court directed the police to hand over the girl to her parents. The counsel for the petitioner, Peeta Raman, filed another petition before the court seeking transfer of investigation to an independent agency and also sought permission for abortion as the girl was impregnated by the accused. Peeta Raman told the bench that the girl was taken away by one Mohammad Khaled on the false promise of marriage and impregnated her. As the girl is only 16-year-old, the marriage will not be valid and sought permission for abortion. Peeta Raman also sought directions for transfer of the investigation from West Godavari police to an independent agency. He also sought directions to take action against the investigation officers for not producing the girl before the court soon after they traced her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/minors-abortion-plea-sent-to-single-judge-bench/articleshow/88058825.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Mullaperiyar dam row: Idukki collector asks govt to take up matter with Tamil Nadu||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Idukki district collector, who is also the chairperson of the district disaster management authority (DDMA), has submitted a report to the government after Tamil Nadu opened the shutters of the Mullaperiyar dam without giving adequate time for evacuating the people residing on the banks of Periyar. In her report to the additional chief secretary of disaster management, Sheeba George has requested the government to ensure that the matter be taken up with Tamil Nadu urgently and that the intimation be given at least six hours in advance before opening the dam shutters. The district collector cited the details of the intimations received from Tamil Nadu regarding the opening of the shutters of Mullaperiyar and the actual time of opening the shutters of the dam. In several instances, the intimations were received after the shutters of the dam were opened. On Wednesday late night, the shutters were opened at 2.30am, while the communication was given to the state at 2.44am, 14 minutes after the shutters were opened. In fact, later, when Tamil Nadu released 8,017.40 cusecs of water at 3.30am on Thursday--- the largest quantity of water released from the dam in this monsoon season--- the intimation was given only at 3.20am. The report said that the shutters were being opened without giving adequate time for alerting the citizens residing on the river banks. Though the matter has been taken up with Theni district administration several times, the issue remains unresolved, the report said. The report further said that since there is an existing protocol as per the rule curve prepared by Tamil Nadu to release the water to Peiryar through the spillover shutters when the water crosses 136ft, the water is being released without any intimation. For the same reason, whenever the water level approaches 136ft, the police, fire force, revenue and local self-government department officials are pressed to the task, thereby causing other works to be stalled. Also, since all these officials are put on tasks to address the issues relating to the water level rise, there is a shortage of officers for other duties if any other contingency situation arises in any other parts of the district, the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/idukki-collector-asks-govt-to-take-up-matter-with-tn/articleshow/88058837.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Nagpur||Nagpur Municipal Corporation bans sale, purchase of nylon manja||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation has banned the sale and purchase of nylon manja and anyone found in possession will be fined Rs 1,000. “On Thursday, the NMC has issued a circular banning the sale and purchase of nylon manja (sharp kite strings) which injure and kill birds as well as people,” said deputy municipal commissioner Vijay Deshmukh. The circular under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act 1986 was issued by solid waste management’s nodal officer Dr Gajendra Mahalle. All assistant municipal commissioners of 10 zones have been asked to monitor traders during pre and post Makar Sankranti (celebrated on January 14). Dr Mahalle, in his circular, stated that any person contravening this order shall be punishable under section 5 of the Environment Protection Act. This time the NMC has issued the circular well in advance. Dr Mahalle told TOI that it will help the NMC to implement the Act without any opposition from traders. Last year, the NMC had banned both sale and use of nylon manja. With the help of nuisance detection squad, the NMC had seized 297 wheels of nylon manja not only from traders but also from kite flyers. Besides, it had also collected Rs 1.30 lakh as fine from the violators. Animal activists welcomed the move and said that it will help to save hundreds of lives of birds and animals. Sachin Gaikwad, an animal activist, pointed out not only nylon manja, but glass-coated manja too injures animals and birds. He added that such thread amounts to hunting under section 9 which is punishable under Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and forest department can also take action. “Causing injury or death to domestic animals attracts provisions of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960,” said Gaikwad. “Apart from banning nylon manja, the NMC will also initiate action against kite sellers if they were found selling plastic kites,” said Dr Mahalle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-bans-sale-purchase-of-nylon-manja/articleshow/88059416.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Pune||Complete vaccination of adults first and then booster dose: Experts||PUNE: Experts on Thursday stressed on generating evidence regarding the efficacy of Covid vaccine booster doses, identify the jab for it, and check for production and supplies, instead of pushing for it before the completion of full vaccination of the adult beneficiaries. Epidemiologist and public health expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya said full vaccination of the entire adult population should be the first priority in the wake of the new variant, Omicron. “The new variant will escape the immunity (by vaccines or natural infection) or not is not known; what we know is that vaccination reduces the severity of the disease and mortality. What is important is to ensure that all adult beneficiaries get both the doses as currently, about 43-45% of the adults in the country have got full vaccination,” he said, stressing on Covid-appropriate behaviour to prevent the spread of any new variants. The booster dose was not an immediate priority because there were many unanswered questions, like the timing of its administration, to arrive on the decision, he said. The Covid task force said it would come out with a comprehensive policy on additional and booster doses for Covid-19 in two weeks. A booster dose is given to healthy people after a few months of receiving the second dose, when the immunity against Covid is likely to have waned. An additional dose is administered to immunocompromised people, who may not have mounted an immune response to the usual doses because of their medical conditions. Dr Shashikiran Umakanth, head, department of medicine, TMA Pai Hospital in Manipal, said booster shots should only be considered based on the risk of exposure and potential complications instead of approving it for all. “Health workers, frontline workers and people with comorbidities like diabetes, heart diseases and kidney failure should be prioritised. The currently available evidence states it is not necessary for all,” said the expert. He said if scientific studies showed better evidence of reducing immunity, a booster might be considered. “The pandemic is not yet over. Irrespective of the booster doses, we need to be alert and continue to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said. Eminent virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang, too, said the government should focus on increasing the second dose coverage. “The counting of doses delivered was useful initially, but the focus should now be on the proportion of vulnerable and eligible population covered with one or two doses. Once we reach high coverage in the elderly or if data indicating waning are available, then we can consider boosters,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/complete-vaccination-of-adults-first-then-booster-dose-experts/articleshow/88059413.cms||Nisha Nambiar

One person succumbed to the contagion in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) area during the day, while the rural areas registered two casualties due to the contagion. The active Covid case count in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMC) has been steadily on decline and the tally touched 1,928 on Thursday evening. As many as 198 new Covid cases were recorded in the region on Thursday as against recoveries of 138 patients. The active case tally had reached to a new low of 1,870 on Wednesday. It recorded a slight increase on Thursday. Of the total active cases in the region, 1,283 (about 65%) were in home isolation and remaining were being treated at various hospitals. The active cases in the region have been on the decline since last week. A report released by district health officer Bhagwan Pawar stated that both the municipal corporations of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, as well as the rural parts of the district, registered less than 100 new patients on Thursday. As many as 15,333 samples were checked in the region for the infection. These included 6,528 in the PCMC areas, 5,227 in the PMC limits and the rest were in the rural and Cantonment limits. The tally of sample testing reached 86.66 lakh on Thursday evening. The region has, so far, registered 19,189 deaths due to the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-death-run-on-in-pmc-areas-for-5th-day-straight/articleshow/88059421.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Nagpur||As footfalls drop, wait for walk-in vaccine beneficiaries extends||Nagpur: Ashish Chauhan (name changed), a professor who stays in Zingabai Takli, was initially shocked when the staff at Indora’s Ambedkar Hospital told him that vaccination was closed for the day when he returned at 2:45pm. An hour ago, Chauhan had come to enrol his father’s name for second Covaxin dose. He was told that vaccination would continue till 3pm. When he confronted the staff and spoke to the centre incharge, the staff reopened the seating area and asked his father to wait till all 20 chairs are full.The senior citizen, having difficulty in walking, got his second Covaxin jab at around 4pm. At another NMC centre a few kilometres away, Covishield beneficiaries too were asked to wait for a few people to start the vaccination.While centres are witnessing enough vaccine takers in the morning hours to ensure beneficiaries walk in and out as quickly as possible, the situation turns dull post-lunch. Some centres wrapped up the drive by 3pm while some waited to use the leftover doses. Ambedkar Hospital has 20-dose vials which prevents them to open the unit for a single beneficiary. The centre had vaccinated 180 beneficiaries after which they closed the drive for the day as less than 20 takers were available.Some mismanagement too led to people returning without the first or second dose.When TOI visited the hospital, the guard said vaccination drive was closed though some people were waiting for a quorum. “If the guard keep sending back people, how will we get 20 people even after waiting till evening,” the professor asked.On Thursday 2, TOI had highlighted the issue of 20-dose Covaxin vial due to which many people had to return. Ambedkar Hospital has been forced to send back people regularly because of the multi-dose vials. The centre had also written to the NMC seeking smaller unit vials.Both, Ambedkar Hospital and civic officials, have blamed the 4-hour vial usage norm for the mess. “We have been instructed not to waste doses. Once the vial is opened, it has to be utilized within four hours. Hence, we are reluctant to open the multi-dose vials,” hospital officials said. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) Dr Sanjay Chilkar told TOI, “As per government guidelines, we have been instructed to discard the leftover doses in the vial. Once a vial is opened, it has to be used within 4 hours and discarded if there is any left over dose. Even five-dose vials would help prevent wastage and avoid inconvenience to public,” he said.Bharat Biotech spokesperson said, “The WHO has approved a 28-day multi-dose vial policy for Covaxin. Covaxin has a shelf life of 12 months at 2-8C temperature.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/as-footfalls-drop-wait-for-walk-in-vaccine-beneficiaries-extends/articleshow/88058839.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Delhi||Ensure quick trial of NE riots cases, sensitise junior officers, says court||New Delhi: A city court has directed Delhi Police to ensure expeditious trial of northeast Delhi riots cases and sensitise subordinate police officials so that there is no delay in the trials. The observations came while setting aside an order by which a cost of Rs 25,000 was imposed on the police for failing to comply with the court’s repeated directions in the riots cases. District Judge Ramesh Kumar said that the imposition of the cost was not justified. While allowing the request of the police for further investigation, a magistrate court had on October 12, 2021, imposed the cost on the state to be paid to all the seven accused people in equal proportion. The police had moved the sessions court against the order, saying the special public prosecutor, appearing for the state, and the investigating officer (IO) had sought permission for further investigation in view of the directions given by another sessions court in respect of the probe conducted in the matter. The counsel for the accused had argued that there was no infirmity in the October 12 order as it was passed after observing the conduct of the investigating agency, as undue delay was being caused in the trial of the cases pertaining to northeast Delhi riots. “Since, IO was supposed to comply with the direction of the sessions court, I am of the considered opinion that the imposition of cost of Rs 25,000/- is not justified,” the judge said in an order on December 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ensure-quick-trial-of-ne-riots-cases-sensitise-junior-officers-says-court/articleshow/88060212.cms||Usha Das

The scheme is now being fine-tuned at the final tendering stage under the supervision of Divisional regional manager (DRM) Richa Khare and senior divisional commercial manager Krishnath Patil. Among the other materials, which would be available, are oral health care products, skin care items, mobile and laptop chargers, cosmetics, stationary products, newspapers and garments. Even local handicrafts would be made available. Such scheme is learnt to be existing in the Jabalpur division of western central (WC) railway.The authorized vendors, who would be employed in the scheme only after police verification and medical examination, would be allowed to sell their fares between 6am and 9pm. “The vendors would sell strictly on the basis of the maximum retail price (MRP) printed on the products. Any complaints from a passenger regarding any foul play would be taken seriously,” said an official, adding CR had also added a round-the-clock multi-purpose amenity of a juice centre, light snacks eatery and a photocopy facility all under one roof for its employees, central railway hospital patients and medical staff, apart from any other commoners visiting the office of the DRM. According to an official, the latest facility of ‘train-side vending’ would be allowed in Nagpur-Itarsi, Nagpur- Badnera and Nagpur-Ballarshah route at the initial stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/now-passengers-to-get-generic-medicines-masks-in-trains/articleshow/88058833.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||HC asks DGCA, govt to file reply on NFC’s grounded aircraft||NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Thursday directed Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Maharashtra government through the divisional commissioner’s office here to file a reply on petitioner’s application questioning their decision to include ‘Cessna-172R (VT-ACQ)’ aircraft on ‘flying training organization (FTO) list of approved equipment' in absence of airworthiness certificate at the Nagpur Flying Club (NFC). A division bench justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Pansare asked them to file their detailed reply on affidavits within two weeks. The judges noted that during their visit to the British-era club on November 27, the facilities were found to be satisfactory and hoped that it would start full-fledged functioning soon with training the flying aspirants for the Private Pilot License (PPL) and Commercial Pilot License (CPL). The directives came while hearing a civil application filed by petitioner's lawyer Shrinivas Deshpande praying for explanation from the apex body contending that the grounded aircraft in FTO list would put the lives of students at a big risk, as it never flew after 2017. TOI on Thursday highlighted the lawyer’s concern in detail where he pointed out that the aircraft was lying defunct for the last four years and was overhauled twice in 2017 and 2020, but never taken to skies that was mandatory for receiving airworthiness certification from the Delhi-based apex body. The judges were made to sit on the same aircraft during their visit but it was not flown. Earlier, DGCA counsel Mugdha Chandurkar contended that the approval for restarting operations was granted to NFC as it has completed the minimum requirement of three aircraft in flying conditions. She added that bodies for granting approval and the airworthiness certificate are separate. Countering Deshpande’s contention that approval for ‘Cessna-172R (VT-ACQ)’ aircraft was handwritten, Chandurkar said, it was provided by NFC and not by the DGCA. She also clarified that granting a license to NFC to operate did not mean that the DGCA had provided the airworthiness certificate to all aircraft. According to Deshpande, there are about 34/35 functional/non- functional flying institutes/clubs in India. If the DGCA’s pursis on this aircraft is accepted by HC, it will be a law of the land and it would be misused for illegal benefits. “The reason cited by the commissioner's office for inability to undertake ‘Cessna-172R (VT-ACQ)’ test flight was faulty radio transmission due to electronic software. It was detected by the engineer after almost four years of grounding of this aircraft. It was assured to this court that the problem in this aircraft also will be rectified in a week on November 18,” he argued. His application was filed in a PIL (No13/2016) filed by late Flt Lt Shridhar Ghatate which was later pursued by his wife Sumedha, after the British-era club stopped operating on account of the Maharashtra government’s apathy in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-asks-dgca-govt-to-file-reply-on-nfcs-grounded-aircraft/articleshow/88059435.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

A village with 10 or more active Covid-19 cases is considered a hotspot village. During the peak of Covid-19 wave in April this year, the number of hotspot villages had gone up to 465 out of the 1,400 villages in rural Pune. As on November 29, the Pune zilla parishad authorities recorded eight hotspot villages, which was down from 34, which was recorded on October 30. “We have focused on enhancing vaccination. A total of 443 villages out of the 1,400 villages have achieved 100% vaccination within our limit, so far. We are working towards completing the vaccination in all the villages at the earliest,” said Ayush Prasad, the ZP’s chief executive officer. The declining trend was evident from the figures. In May there were 397 hotspot villages, which came down to 186 in June, 100 in September and less than 50 in October. “Now, we are expecting the figure to be nil soon,” said Prasad. On vaccination and testing strategy, Prasad said, “Given the new Covid-19 variant, we have decided to conduct tests of at least 10,000 people daily at places where mass gatherings occur in rural Pune. These include places such as the bazaar areas, Agriculture Produce Market Committee-run vegetable markets, temple towns, among others.” Prasad said that ramping up of the vaccination was the need of the hour in the rural areas that had witnessed a spike in Covid-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic.“We have directed our primary health centres and community health officers at the village-level to work in tandem with gram panchayats to speed up the vaccinations in their limits. The door-to-door vaccination drive is also taking place at a decent speed nowadays,” Prasad added. A section of the PHC in-charge officers told TOI that they were facing issues in vaccination as people are saying that there is no fear of the Covid now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hotspot-villages-in-pune-rural-belt-reduce-to-eight-from-34-in-a-month/articleshow/88059428.cms||Sandip Dighe

Harsh Tibrewal, Aditya Gupta, and Keshaw Singhania are among the 150 Indian students, who have scooped 177 awards for their outstanding academic achievements in the November 2020 and March 2021 exam series. Outstanding Cambridge Learner Awards are hailed as the hallmark of exceptional student achievement in Cambridge exams around the world. The global awards acknowledge student success in four categories – ‘Top in the World’, ‘Top in the Country’, ‘High Achievement Award’ and ‘Best Across Subjects. Altogether, 42 students in India scooped the highly coveted ‘Top in the World’ award, which is awarded to students who achieve the highest marks in the world in a particular subject. In addition, 65 won the ‘Top in Country’ award and 17 won the ‘Best across Subjects’ award. The Doon School's Harsh Tibrewal is among 42 students who have won ‘Top in the World’ award. Mahesh Shrivastava, Regional Director, South Asia, Cambridge Assessment International Education, said, “The pandemic has continued to disrupt teaching and learning around the world, creating a great deal of uncertainty for students and teachers alike. Yet our students and their teachers have all worked incredibly hard to overcome these challenges and have maintained their focus on teaching and learning.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: In 2019, rainfall was heavier from 12am till early morning, says study||MUMBAI: The first published analysis of data from the most extensive rain gauge network in the city has thrown up some intriguing findings for the 2019 monsoon. Heavy rainfall events that year were more frequent from midnight to early morning, the analysis found. And they tended to happen in the northern suburbs such as Andheri and Powai, rather than the southern parts such as Colaba, the data showed. Whether these patterns are a long-term feature of monsoon rainfall in the city or were peculiar to that year, remains to be seen, said S K Das, a scientist with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and one of the study authors. “We have three years of data, and we’ve analysed one year so far,” he said. “The long-term observations will bring more answers.” The data comes from a network of 131 rain gauges known as MESONET that combines the stations of the Indian Meteorological Department, the IITM, and the BMC. The network was set up a few years ago to help capture local variability in rainfall across the city—that is, the way in which one neighbourhood can be dry at the same time that another one is being deluged. The urban form— hills, flatlands and tall buildings —is thought to contribute to these differences. Looking at the 2019 monsoon rainfall, Das and others were surprised at the number of stations that recorded over 100mm daily, with the most accumulation in pockets of the north.  Their analysis found that heavy to very heavy rainfall events tended to occur in three- to four-hour bursts while moderate rainfall occurred over a day. Rainfall seemed to peak along the coast in the late evening and propagate inland at midnight. The timing of heavy rainfall events (over 60mm) from midnight to early morning can result in water accumulation by morning, with implications for transport networks, Das noted. It is not yet clear why heavy rainfall occurred at night—the trend may have to do with wind circulation patterns. Such detailed trends could not be detected earlier, Das noted, due to the lack of fine-grain ground measurements. The MESONET gauges are within 10-25km of each other and update rainfall data every 15 minutes. IITM is also establishing short-range “X-band” radars, and two networks combined should be able to provide higher-resolution data for improved rainfall and flood forecasting, said Das. “We will also be able to investigate extreme precipitation dynamics better,” he said. This kind of data is important for “nowcasting” rainfall in cities such as Mumbai, agreed Subimal Ghosh, a professor at IIT Bombay who was not part of this study. “Mumbai has huge spatial variation in rainfall, and this plays a role in flash floods,” he said, adding, “At one time, we had only two rain gauges in Colaba and Santacruz, which didn’t give us a detailed picture. A distributed gauge network allows us to track ward-level rainfall.” Earlier statistical studies by Ghosh had found that rainfall tends to start varying after a distance of 10km, and also indicated diurnal variation in rainfall. “More studies like this are needed to understand the patterns,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-19-rainfall-was-heavier-from-12am-till-early-morning-study/articleshow/88060492.cms||Vaishnavi Chandrashekhar

He has written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray demanding to allow Mahagenco to sign a coal purchase agreement with the WCL to facilitate the execution of two projects while ensuring supply of coal to the state during coal crisis.Ahir claimed that WCL is going to acquire 224.24 hectares of land from Patala village for Naglon UG to OC project in Majri area. WCL has implemented section 4 and section 7 procedures of the Coal Bearing (CB) Act this year for acquisition of the land. For the lack of coal procurement agreement, WCL has withheld the further procedure of the land acquisition.“The Naglon project is going to generate 277 jobs for project affected people (PAP). For the lack of coal purchase agreement, PAP farmers have been denied compensation and jobs in WCL. To add to the agony of PAP farmers, Implementation of CB Act sections denies the farmers to carry out any development of their land,” Ahir said.Same is the case with Chincholi recast project of WCL Ballarpur area. The company has implemented section 11 of CB Act for acquisition of 182 hectares of agricultural land from the villages Chincholi, Subbai, Dongargaon and Kavithpeth five years back. But with no coal purchase agreement, WCL is unable to proceed further. The project is expected to generate 205 jobs for PAPs, but apathy on part of the state government has put the farmers into fix, said Ahir. “Government’s nod to Mahagenco can solve the problem. I have written to the CM urging him to take initiative into the matter and help the PAP farmers who are in a fix,” Ahir said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/allow-mahagenco-to-procure-coal-push-wcls-lingering-projects-ahir-to-cm/articleshow/88058852.cms||Mazhar Ali

Gangi Reddy argued that the lower court erred in its decision while granting bail and it did not consider the larger conspiracy that was hatched. He sought directions from the high court to quash the order of the lower court and stay all further proceedings pending disposal of the main petition. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a petition before the trial court under Section 306 of CrPC to grant pardon to Shaik Dastagiri as he confessed his participation in the murder and willingness to turn approver. The trial court considered the petition by the CBI and granted him pardon. Gangi Reddy argued that Dastagiri turning approver is part of the conspiracy being hatched out against him to falsely implicate in the case leaving the real culprits in the case. He said that the trial court ought to have considered the fact that the CBI not disclosing before the court while deciding the bail petition of Dastagiri that they received a letter from Dastagiri on October 21, is in violation of 306 CrPC. He also contended that on the day Dastagiri was given anticipatory bail, the CBI filed petition for pardon on the same day. Gangi Reddy further argued that the petition filed by CBI is beyond the scope of Section 306 as it was not the case that is impossible to establish the guilt of the accused without the evidence of Dastagiri. The high court yet to hear the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/viveka-murder-accused-challenges-pardon-order/articleshow/88058841.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Women thieves soiled clothes with faeces to evade grilling by cops||NAGPUR: Three women thieves, who targeted passengers in autorickshaws, left Hudkeshwar police station personnel hassled with their weird antics, like farting and soiling clothes by relieving themselves while wearing them. The cops said this was part of their strategy to evade interrogation, foil detection and hinder recovery of stolen material. Despite the harassment, threats of false allegations and complaints before human rights bodies, the cops under senior inspector Sarthak Nehete managed to recover five tola stolen gold from the three women thieves and detect two cases. “The women seem to have mastered some special skills to fart whenever they wanted. They also took out blood soiled sanitary napkins, and soiled their sarees with stools to distract the cops, including women personnel,” said an official. The women thieves had been netted by a team of assistant inspector Swapnil Bhujbal after toiling for 12 days, scrutinizing CCTV footage from around 60 places across the city. The women thieves, who kept changing their names during the probe, tried dodging the cops all sorts of antics. However, they were outsmarted by tactical interrogation despite their relentless nuisance. The women did not reveal their real names until the magistrate demanded their original Aadhaar card during bail hearing. In November, Hudkeshwar police have nabbed 14 accused, including the three women, and detected 13 burglaries, seven bike thefts and other offences. They have recovered more than 22 tola stolen gold and other valuables worth around Rs10 lakh. The Hudkeshwar police team of head constable Manoj Neware, Deepak More, Shailesh Thawre and others also busted a four-member team of burglars after 28 days of continuous CCTV footage scrutiny at around 50 places between Nagpur and Walni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/women-thieves-farted-soiled-clothes-with-faeces-to-evade-grilling/articleshow/88058847.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kochi||Kerala: Opening Mullaperiyar dam shutters caused sleepless nights||IDUKKI: Many houses were waterlogged in Manjumala, Vallakkadavu areas of Vandiperiyar after Tamil Nadu opened 10 of the 13 shutters of the Mullaperiyar dam early on Thursday. “We were in deep sleep when we received the call from Elizabeth Sebastian, a resident at Vallakkadavu, asking us to move to safety. We rushed out of our house immediately. Had we failed to get the call, there was a chance of us getting washed away in the flash flood,” says Ramani Xavier, a resident of Manjumala Aattoram, one of the downstream areas of Mullaperiyar. Her house was among the several waterlogged. According to residents, this was the fourth incident in two weeks. On Tuesday, TN opened nine shutters around midnight and caused a flood-like situation in downstream areas of the dam. P N Sebastian, a Vallakkadavu resident, said that the people suspect conspiracy behind the opening of shutters at night without prior intimation. “Yesterday at 2am, a resident here noticed that the water level suddenly increased in the dam. Following this, we alerted others and saved the lives of many in the region. TN close the shutters during the day and open them at night, aiming to create a flash flood in the region. Once the flash flood happens, people will be evicted, and the demand for a new dam is avoided,” alleged Sebastian. Syam Sivan, a resident of Churakkulam Aatoram in Vandiperiyar, said that the opening of the shutters caused sleepless nights to many in the area. “We did not sleep for the last two weeks after TN began opening the shutters of the dam at midnight. How can we sleep without fear,” asked Sivan. Anoop Kumar, Vallakkadavu resident, said the timely intervention saved the life of a newborn and others. Congress members and residents took out a march to the Vandiperiyar police station and blocked the NH on Thursday, demanding action to avoid the dam opening at night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/opening-dam-shutters-caused-sleepless-nights/articleshow/88058854.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Likewise, the fine for 33 traffic violations has been revised by the home department, which has implemented the amended Motor Vehicles Act 1988. B Thakur, section officer home (transport) department, issued the MV (amended) Act 2019 on December 1. As per the law, now vehicles with fancy number plates, in fonts other than those prescribed in Central Motor Vehicle rules, will invite Rs1,000 fine. Earlier the fine was only Rs200. The government has also increased fine for driving vehicles without reflector or tail lamps from Rs200 to Rs1,000, said an official from the regional transport office. Similarly, those allowing unlicensed persons to ride or drive their vehicles will be fined Rs5,000, up from Rs2,300 earlier. The government has also revised the fee by introducing categorization of vehicles in cases if speeding. Earlier the fine for speeding vehicles was common. Now, for two and three wheelers, the penalty for driving beyond permissible speed limits will be Rs1,000, while it will be Rs1,500 for tractor, LMV (Rs2,000), and for other vehicles including trucks (Rs4,000). The amended MV Act has also increased the penalty for overloading vehicles. Earlier, the fine was Rs10,000, which has now been revised to Rs20,000. Besides this, an additional amount of Rs2,000 per tonne of excess load and liability to pay offloading charges will also be levied on violators. Traffic experts pointed out that revision in penalty will act as a deterrent to violators, which will ultimately reduce road accidents across Maharashtra. “The notification has basically enhanced the fines for errant motor vehicle users to act as a deterrent. Many states have already enhanced the archaic penalties and fines which were too meagre. Wrong parking was let off with a paltry fine of Rs200. Section 180 “allowing unauthorised persons to drive vehicles” along with the enhanced fine also can get a jail term of three months to the vehicle owner, which magistrates rarely enforce,” said traffic expert and high court lawyer Anjan Chatterjee. In many violations, fines have been enhanced for second and subsequent offences too, he pointed out. The traffic police and RTO have already been given handheld devices which can detect repeated traffic violations. “The results of revised fines will only be seen with strict implementation of the amended act,” said Chatterjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/traffic-fines-hiked-rs500-3-month-suspended-license-for-riding-sans-helmet/articleshow/88059453.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

He claimed NMC has already finalized 19 names, but is yet to get one representative from the market association, which is delaying the process. Once the procedure is done, NMC will publish the gazette notification of the 20-member TVC. However, sources said, NMC’s social welfare department is delaying the process of formation of TVC due to alleged pressure from hawkers community. The formation of a TVC is mandatory under the Street Vendors’ Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending Act 2014.The 20-member TVC comprises eight representatives of hawkers’ associations across the corporation limits, two from NGOs, two from residents’ welfare associations, one representative each from market and traders’ association etc. The committee will be headed by the municipal commissioner.In October this year, the government had submitted to the high court that the TVC had been formed, and informed about the appointment of Vinod Taywade and Kaustav Chatterjee as two members from NGO category.Sources said NMC social welfare department is deliberately delaying the process due to pressure from city hawkers. “If TVC is formed, NMC will demarcate particular space for hawkers. This will hamper their business and so a majority of hawkers are trying hard to delay the process,” said sources.Meanwhile, city hawkers protested against NMC’s anti-encroachment drive launched across the city. A delegation of Nagpur Pheriwala Footpath Dukandar Sangathana recently met additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and demanded stopping the anti-encroachment drive until NMC forms TVC and declares hawking zones across the city.TVC member and Sangathana joint secretary Razzaq Qureshi expressed concern over the ongoing anti-encroachment drive, which is depriving hawkers of their daily bread.He pointed out that NMC should take action against hawkers obstructing free movement of vehicles on city roads. However, the enforcement team should not take any action against those sitting in market areas without causing any obstruction to traffic, Razzaq urged Joshi.As per Razzaq, the city has around 65,000 hawkers, but very few were registered with NMC. In the past, NMC had identified 53 hawkers’ zones. Once NMC issues notification of forming TVC, a fresh process to enroll hawkers, and declaring hawking and no-hawking zones will be initiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-informing-hc-about-town-vending-panel-formation-nmc-yet-to-notify-body/articleshow/88058857.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

They said the country has surplus vaccines which must be given to specific age groups at the earliest.Restrictions such as mandatory quarantine for travellers from ‘at-risk’ nations, and RT-PCR negative certificate even for fully vaccinated domestic travellers have not gone down well with the doctors. They also slammed the dual policy of keeping schools open in rural parts and not allowing certain sections in city limits.Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said the effectiveness of vaccine has reduced because of the new variant. “Two doses would have been sufficient if there was no new variant. When effectiveness of vaccine goes down, there are two options. Either you tweak the Covid vaccine, which involves commercial risk and, hence, ruled out, or booster dose. The primary series can be three dose instead of two. Many vaccines have three series. In South Africa, young population is needing hospitalization because of partial or no vaccination,” he said.Dr Shinde added, “The norms introduced in the wake of Omircron threat just ridicule scientific approach.”Internal medicine expert Dr Vaibhav Agrawal felt both imposing restrictions and thinking about booster dose would be a good idea. “During Delta variant surge, we had seen that vaccinated people suffered less severe disease. Mortality could also come under control after some time. When restrictions are imposed, the virulence too decreases. Existing vaccines are as per the previous strain of virus. Yet, they can still offer 50% protection. Rest of the 50% risk can be subsided by movement restrictions. At the same time, we must go for booster dose,” he said.Pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat, who is VHA president, said large number of vaccines are likely to go waste. “Booster dose increases immunity. Every vaccine has a booster dose, like flu, pneumococcal etc,” he said.Dr Anup Marar, convenor of VHA, proposed the idea of paid booster dose. “Considering the impending attack of third wave, it would be prudent for authorities to seriously contemplate on approving booster doses for all, including frontline workers who had their 2nd doses around 7-8 months back. They can at least endorse voluntary self-paying modality which can easily be shouldered by the private sector, which has unutilized idle vaccine stock,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/surplus-vaccine-stock-meet-omicron-threat-with-booster-dose-docs/articleshow/88058870.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

These exports registered a 100% increase compared to October 2020, according to official data. Cumulative exports — merchandise and services — from operational SEZs in Gujarat, which fall under the jurisdiction of Kandla Special Economic Zone (KASEZ) development commissioner, increased to Rs 19,602 crore in October from Rs 17,790 crore in September this year. Exports rose based on greater demand from international markets, said industry players. According to data from the Export Promotion Council for EoUs and SEZs (EPCES), exports from SEZs falling under the KASEZ authority were up 100% from Rs 9,787 crore in October 2020. The surge is mainly on account of the low base effect of last year. Separately, exports from the manufacturing sector stood at Rs 19,286 crore, while trading and services exports were worth Rs 315 crore in October this year, the data further reveals. SEZ exports have risen by 75% to Rs 1.12 lakh crore during the April-October period of the current financial year against Rs 64,212 crore in the same period last fiscal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sez-exports-grew-by-10-in-a-month/articleshow/88058863.cms||---

Initially when the tourism sector opened up to travellers, the demand for domestic travel didn’t grow as Covid cases continued to remain high in the state, amid a flood-like situation. However, with many city hotels offering discounts during the peak Christmas and New Year time, there was advance bookings done by domestic tourists as well as international tourists, in the anticipation that India may open its skies by mid-December. However, the tourism and hotel industry insiders here said that already there is 50% cancellation in hotel bookings during the peak Christmas and New Year. They said that still worse inquiries for future bookings have also stopped, which indicates that there might not be much tourist movement during the peak season, which ends in March 2022. “Tourism sector was just recovering and we never expected to end the year with a bang. But we were hopeful that we would start 2022 on a positive note, but now the Omicron scare has left many travel plans in a limbo. “The hotel industry was reviving and business had picked up by about 20%. But now again there is a crisis and we are seeing 50% to 60% cancellations in bookings. This will be the second peak season when we will have no business and this is not good news for the industry,” said Association of Approved and Classified Hotels of Kerala (AACHK) president Riaz Ahmed. “Majority of travellers — 65%-75% — have opted for the full-refund booking options in case of cancellation since the second wave. Very few are opting to postpone the trip as uncertainty looms large now with the new strain of the coronavirus,” added Ahmed. The hotel and travel industry that was the hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, with the loss in earnings in the tourism sector in 2020 alone pegged at Rs 20,000 crore to Rs 25,000 crore. While 90% are domestic tourists, 10% are international tourists who come for leisure or medical tourism to the state. However, since Covid the flow of both had slowed down leading to job loss and 50% salary cuts in the hospitality and tourism industry. It was only now that the hotels had started filling in the vacancies with the arrival of guests. “We fear that the future tourism season in the state will be severely affected and we will again be in big trouble if states bring in lockdowns and travel restrictions again,” said Baby Mathew, president, Kerala Travel Mart (KTM), an umbrella organization of the travel, tourism and hospitality industry in Kerala. “We are keeping our fingers crossed and have asked everyone to take necessary precautions as mandated by the government without causing discomfort to the guests,” said Confederation of Kerala Tourism Industry (CKTI) president E M Najeeb.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tourism-sector-takes-a-beating-as-omicron-dashes-travel-plans/articleshow/88058861.cms||Preetu Nair

The Covid control room has started witnessing an increase in calls related to travel inquiries, and majority of the calls are from abroad. The control room receives around 250 travel inquiry calls per day now. Calls related to Covid infection are received mostly in the night. “The number of travel inquiry calls increased by around 150 after the reporting of Omicron variant. Most of the calls are from abroad, mainly from the US, UK and Gulf countries. They ask us about the current quarantine restrictions in the state and the protocols to be followed during their return trip. Before the Omicron scare, we used to receive calls mostly related to Covid infection and shifting of patients,” said a source from the control room. Health officials said surveillance authorities should not fall prey to the justifications put forward by travellers to skip quarantine rules. “There is a chance of a large number of Malayalis returning to their native places in the coming days. Some may make false claims like they have returned for a short-stay, in order to skip quarantine. That should not be allowed. Our surveillance should be strengthened. Already our health system is stretched to the maximum. There is no room for any complacency,” said the health official. District medical officer Dr V Jayashree said they have intensified screening at the Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial) and a medical team has been appointed in this regard. “No passengers are coming via Cochin Port now. If the port starts receiving passengers, we will implement the same procedures there,” she said. The district had witnessed huge clamour to get the vaccine dose when the second wave hit badly. When the government started vaccination programme, there was vaccine hesitancy among the public initially. But after the second wave people started queuing up to get their jab. “Currently, there is vaccine hesitancy among public when it comes to second dose. People should get the second dose when the due date approaches,” said Jayashree. Meanwhile, Ernakulam mental health team say they have not received any panic calls related to the Omicron variant. “It seems people have learned to live with Covid. We have received any panic calls from the public so far,” said mental health programme officer Soumya Raj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/control-room-registers-increase-in-travel-inquiries-from-abroad/articleshow/88058875.cms||T C Sreemol

The joint director-general filed an affidavit in response to the HC’s order, telling the aviation authorities to take a final decision by November 30 on their order to demolish parts of 27 buildings. The affidavit reads, “Owners of twenty-seven of identified obstacles around Surat airport were issued with final orders as per rule 6 of the Aircraft (demolition of obstructions caused by buildings and trees etc) Rules, 1994.” The orders were issued in August. Public notices in this regard were also issued on court directions. The affidavit further stated that in response to final orders, the owners and builders made representations, but they did not categorically mentioned that they should be treated as appeals against final orders. However, they were called for a hearing to ascertain whether the property owners would like their representations to be treated as appeals, but none appeared for the hearing. They approached the high court, which has placed the hearing in abeyance. Since the representations and appeals were not processed further, they have been disposed of, the aviation department informed the court. Due to unavailability of a couple of senior advocates on Thursday, the HC has adjourned the hearing.

Disposing the suo moto petition taken up in the arrest of suspended junior civil judge, S Ramakrishna, the court warned of serious consequences if the guidelines were not followed. The high court had earlier considered the letter written by the son of Ramakrishna explaining about the arrest of his father and suspecting threat to his life in Chittoor jail. Senior counsel A Satya Prasad, who has been appointed as amicus curie in the case, told the high court that the police did not follow the guidelines prescribed by the apex court while arresting Ramakrishna. In the counter affidavit filed, police admitted that they have failed to inform the high court about his arrest. Satya Prasad further told the high court bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy that presently Ramakrishna is out on bail and hence the bench may pass appropriate orders. Advocate general S Sriram said that necessary steps will be taken to make police aware about the Supreme Court guidelines in the issue. The high court observed that as Ramakrishna is out on bail there is no need to continue the petition and accordingly disposed it. The high court directed the state government to issue a circular informing about the apex court guidelines to all station house officers in the state. Any further violations in this regard will be viewed seriously, said the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/stick-to-sc-norms-in-arrest-of-judicial-officers-hc/articleshow/88058873.cms||Srikanth Aluri

One of the bone fossils is four feet long and a foot in width, while the other is three feet in length. The fossils first came to the knowledge of villager Vijay Thengne and some school children from village Tulana in the Wardha River bed flowing close to their village. “Sand mafia has excavated the river bed up to eight feet depth, which led to the fossilised giant bones lying exposed. Locals speculate that the sand mafia might have thrown away other such fossils recovered during sand excavation earlier,” says geologist and environmentalist Prof Suresh Chopne. He visited the site to examin the fossils and confirmed that they belong to the bones of some giant animal of the past. “There are layers of basalt rock dating back to 60 million years at the place, but it has got mixed with the layers of silt rock, making it difficult to fix the time period of fossils,” he said. He underlined the need to carry out scientific carbon dating procedure to estimate the period of fossils. Chopne claimed that the bigger bone appears to be the leg of the animal, while the three-feet-long bone looks like the rib of a giant animal. Based on the size of the bones, he speculates that the animal must have been around 15 feet high and 20 feet in length. Although villagers claim they are bones of dinosaurs, he maintained that the weak and fragile nature of fossils suggest they are no more than 20,000 years old. “I have informed the regional office of Geological Survey of India at Chandrapur about the discovery and asked the officials to recover and preserve the bones for further study. Chandrapur district has a treasure trove of such fossils, but thanks to the apathy of the government and concerned department many such fossils have been lost,” Chopne told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/4-ft-long-bone-fossils-discovered-in-wardha-river/articleshow/88059476.cms||Mazhar Ali

Pune and Nashik recorded the highest rainfall for a 24-hour duration in December at 75mm (Shivajinagar observatory) and 68.3mm, respectively. Foggy and cold weather conditions prevailed across the city and Pune district throughout Thursday with low visibility. With the Shivajinagar and Lohegaon observatories recording maximum temperatures of 20.2°C and 20°C respectively, many citizens felt the chill in the air. Meteorological officials said people are feeling cold because of the reduced gap between night and day temperature. The rainfall and the northerly winds too have contributed to the cold conditions. Day-time temperature remained below normal by 8-9°C. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecast conditions, said, “Due to the cloudy conditions and rainfall in the last 24 hours, the day temperatures have fallen below the normal range. Similar conditions are likely to prevail till December 4. From December 5 onwards, the city’s weather is likely to become dry with clear skies, and day temperature will come back to the normal range.” Met officials said the weather system over the Arabian Sea has weakened now. “There is an upper air circulation over off South Gujarat and North Konkan coast. From there, a trough line extends up to the Southeast Arabian sea. These conditions are influencing the weather over Madhya Maharashtra,” said Met officials.  Kashyapi said a depression is likely to form over the Bay of Bengal in the next 48 hours which will then turn into a cyclonic storm, named ‘Jawad’, and move northeastward. “The cyclone will not impact the weather of any region,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rain-recedes-but-thick-fog-hangs-in-the-air-amid-chill/articleshow/88059481.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Pune||Day-long downpour leads to power cuts, traffic snarls, tree fall incidents||PUNE: Many parts of the city witnessed power cuts and reported incidents of trees falling amid Wednesday’s unseasonal downpour and foggy weather. The maximum temperature dropping to 20.6°C led to cold weather conditions throughout most of Thursday. Sadashiv Kulkarni, a resident of Warje’s Tapodham, was left concerned after Wednesday’s downpour and Thursday’s decline in day-time temperature with aged people at home. “The power went out at 10pm on Wednesday and was restored during the early hours next day in my locality. With the power out amid the cold weather and rain, it was a bit concerning,” said Kulkarni said.  Local authorities said most services were restored by midday on Thursday. Power cuts were reported in areas such as Baner, Kalyaninagar, and especially Kondhwa, where multiple households and societies reported outages as the rainfall intensified late on Wednesday. Large parts of Kondhwa were without electricity supply on Thursday. “The power went off at 10pm on Wednesday and was restored later after multiple stop-starts,” said a Kondhwa resident. A Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company (MSEDCL) engineer said there were cable problems in parts of Kondhwa due to the rain. “Our teams have been working on the ground to restore power supply; most work was completed by afternoon while work at some locations was expected to be finished by the end of Thursday,” said the engineer. The city fire brigade received 20 calls regarding trees falling; no injuries were reported. “Our personnel were on the road from Wednesday 4pm to Thursday 1pm clearing traffic,” assistant inspector M K Adling of the Pimpri Chinchwad traffic branch told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/day-long-downpour-leads-to-power-cuts-traffic-snarls-tree-fall-incidents/articleshow/88059482.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Alliance that leaves out Congress will help BJP: Nana Patole||MUMBAI: A day after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) does not exist, state Congress president Nana Patole reacted sharply, saying any effort of an alliance by excluding the Congress will only help BJP. “Rahul Gandhi is the only leader in the country who has directly challenged PM Narendra Modi and the BJP,” Patole said after a meeting of Congress cabinet members to take stock of the political situation in the wake of Banerjee’s meeting at the residence of NCP president Sharad Pawar on Wednesday. Patole said the Congress and Rahul Gandhi have been playing the role of a capable opposition party for the last seven years. “In our opinion, the present stand taken by Banerjee will certainly help the BJP. Similar attempts were made before the 2019 general elections, which had directly benefited the BJP,” Patole said. Patole alleged that during BJP rule, democracy is in danger, all-out attempts have been made by the government to silence the opposition, and agencies like the CBI, I-T and ED have been pressed into service to take on the opposition. “We are not scared of the Central agencies. We will raise our voice against the abuse of power by the NDA government. We found that several political parties are not taking a firm stand against Central agencies for fear of coercive action against politicians opposed to the BJP,” Patole alleged. Further Patole said the farmers’ movement has clearly established that people’s power can ensure that the government surrenders. “Farmers forced Narendra Modi to repeal the anti-farmer legislations,” Patole said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/alliance-that-leaves-out-cong-will-help-bjp/articleshow/88060540.cms||---
