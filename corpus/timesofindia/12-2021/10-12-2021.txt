The group, which was about 60km away from the shrine, had halted for tea and snacks when a speeding truck ploughed into them after hitting their vehicle, resulting in the death of two on the spot. The deceased were identified as Adi Narayana and Shankar, residents of Budhavaripeta and Deva Nagar localities in Kurnool. Police later shifted the bodies of the deceased and admitted nine other injured devotees to a nearby government hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/two-andhra-pradesh-devotees-die-in-kerala-road-accident/articleshow/88194372.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

The announcement ignited the fire in the North Andhra region and MPs of Andhra Pradesh are now demanding the central government to give clarity over the issue and various people’s organizations and political parties are now raising voices against the government. It is recalled that the BJP government in the center had announced the new zone headquartered at Vizag on February 27 of 2019. The new zone named “South Coast Railway (SCoR)”, will comprise existing Guntakal, Guntur, and Vijayawada divisions. Waltair division shall be split into two parts. One part of the Waltair division will be incorporated in the new zone i.e. in South Coast Railway and will be merged with the neighboring Vijayawada division. The remaining portion of the Waltair division shall be converted into a new division with headquarters at Rayagada under East Coast Railway (ECoR). South Central Railway will comprise Hyderabad, Secunderabad, and Nanded divisions. It had appointed an Officer on Special Duty (OSD) for the zone too. A Detailed Project Report (DPR) was also prepared and submitted. To date, the government authorities have been reiterating that the DPR is under examination. The Waltair Division in Vizag has prepared around 200 acres for offices of New Zone. The Waltair division has another 780 acres of land, including 210 acres surrounding the Railways Station. As per the DPR, the zone will have 3496 km of railway routes, 5437 km of railway lines. The Indian Railways notified South Coast Railway Zone name on its website in the first week of July of this year. The Srikakulam MP K Rammohan Naidu of TDP raised his voice in the parliament and alleged that the government is observing apathy. Even after three years of the announcement, there was no progress. “Only Rs. 40 lakhs were allotted for the new zone in the 2021-22 budget and that amount would not be sufficient to construct a building. The new zone issue is neither in the existing zones list nor in the proposed zones list,” he alleged. The CPI activists led by senior leader JV Satyanarayana Murthy staged a protest at the main entrance of the Vizag Railway Station On Thursday evening. He alleged that the BJP government cheated the public of AP. He warned that the Railway Zone Sadhana Samithi would intensify the agitation across the state. The CPM district and city wings and forum for the development of North Andhra (FDNA) demanded the government to establish the South Coast Railway zone immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/demand-for-establishment-of-scor-zone/articleshow/88194779.cms||Siva G

The devotees claimed that it was useless to wait for authorities to construct the road so decided to take the matter in their own hands and started the work. Initially, all the deep potholes are being filled and from Friday onwards, bitumen will be laid down. The residents of nearby villages claimed that since 2008, road was not constructed and for over five years they have been demanding the reconstruction of the road. They rued that it was only 2km stretch that passes through the famous gurdwara where lakhs of people visit it every month on special days from Ludhiana, Rahon, Nawanshehr and other cities. For the construction of road Public works department had prepared the estimates worth Rs 1.72 crore but till date work did not take place.

Putting off celebrations in deference to the last rites of CDS Rawat and other personnel who died in the chopper crash, the Unions will take out a victory procession only on Saturday. All toll plazas are to be cleared by December 15 even as Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) said the farmers are “suspending” the agitation that began 378 days ago and would meet on January 15 to assess the government’s actions on their demands. What a beautiful coincidence.Kisan morcha began on 26 November, the day Constituent Assembly concluded its work.A… https://t.co/IHu2obI6Rl— Yogendra Yadav (@_YogendraYadav) 1639059016000“We’ll review its progress every month and decide our course of action accordingly. If government does not fulfil its promises, we could resume our agitation," said SKM leader Gurnam Singh Charuni of BKU-Haryana while addressing a joint press conference with other leaders, including Darshan Pal, Yogendra Yadav, Hannan Mollah and Shivkumar Sharma 'Kakkaji'. The decision raises hopes the blocks that severely inconvenienced entry and exit on Delhi borders will be gone soon though the state of the highways will have to be inspected by NHAI and state authorities before traffic is allowed. Read AlsoSongs, sweets and scenes of joy at protest sites as 'victorious' farmers prepare to head homeNEW DELHI: The atmosphere is celebratory, the mood victorious. At the site of farmers' protest on Delhi borders, sweets are being distributed and slogans raised. The farmers are preparing to go home after more than a year of protest during which they endured harsh Delhi winter, scorching summer,As the farmer leaders formally called off their protest, many farmers started to dismantle their tents and bringing down iron structures erected at Singhu border. Many said they are being approached by scrap dealers and told TOI they will celebrate on December 11 instead of Friday as a tribute to CDS Rawat and others. The scenario at Singhu border was of joy and happiness. Big speakers and woofers on tractors played Punjabi numbers louder than usual while smaller tents were already taken down. However, protestors at UP Gate (Ghazipur border) declared they will be the last ones to leave because they want to "see off" farmers, mainly from Punjab, camped at Singhu and Tikri, to show their gratitude. BKU, which has been leading the agitation here, said the idea was proposed by its leader Rakesh Tikait. BKU spokesperson Dharmendra Malik said, "Rakesh Tikait wants that we should see off farmers from Punjab, who are mostly camping at Singhu and Tikri borders and have a long distance to travel, first...Tikait has said he will be the last one to leave as he wants to see off the last farmer as a gesture of appreciation for the unflinching support they extended to the agitation." There weren’t many protesters at UP Gate but among the 100 or so in the camps were some of the most steadfast agitators. Rajasthan farmers will vacate Alwar's Shahjahanpur border on Friday paving the way for reopening of Jaipur-Delhi national highway after almost a year. "After a general meeting on Friday morning, the ‘morcha’ will be removed from Shahjahanpur-Kheda border...a public awareness campaign will be launched in villages along with a thanks-giving drive," the SKM said. In a statement, SKM said the battle to secure minimum support price (MSP) as a legal entitlement for all farmers will continue even as agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal's letter to the forum noted that a committee proposed by the centre will have a mandate to see how to "ensure" MSP is available to farmers, stopping short an assurance on legal backing. The Unions are likely to raise it in the state polls coming up, particularly in UP and Punjab. SKM's decision to wind up the current agitation comes after Agrawal wrote to them on Thursday morning, formally accepting points which were stated informally in a revised draft proposal a day before. Since the farmer Unions agreed to the draft on Wednesday, the agriculture secretary replicated those points in his formal note to the Morcha while requesting its leaders to end the agitation. The government's written promises include 'unconditional' withdrawal of all cases against farmers and their supporters in states and UTs including Delhi, compensation to kin of all farmers who died during the year-long protests, mandating the proposed committee on MSP to ensure support price for crops, consulting stakeholders, including SKM, before introduction of the Electricity Amendment Bill in Parliament and decriminalisation of stubble-burning. During the back channel efforts by the home ministry to end the protests in the wake of the repeal of three farm laws, Unions were learnt to have adopted an accommodative approach when the government side accepted their most of the demands and explained to them how the issue of 'environment compensation' (penalty) on stubble-burning episodes and the Lakhimpur Kheri incident cases were being directly monitored by the Supreme Court and therefore the Centre could not do anything on these matters. Dismissal and arrest of junior home minister Ajay Mishra in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident case was one of the six demands of SKM which it had flagged in its email to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 21. Besides, the farmer Unions also wanted the 'environmental compensation' clause (Section 15) to be removed from the law on Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas. "Emergence of SKM as a big united force at national level is also one of the biggest achievements of this year-long agitation. The Morcha remained united despite facing many difficulties throughout the year. This struggle also shows how a peaceful protest can force an elected government to listen to the people in a democracy. Farmers together have emerged as a big force now," said P Krishnaprasad of the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) - one of the key constituents of the SKM. Yogendra Yadav too flagged that how the farmers regained their lost dignity and emerged as a strong political force who can set national agenda for common people. "It's also a beautiful coincidence that the 'Kisan Morcha' began on November 26, the day Constituent Assembly concluded its work. And it concluded on December 9, the day Constituent Assembly began its deliberations. Farmers must defend this constitutional republic," he said.

---||World||Reality TV personality Josh Duggar convicted for possessing child sex-abuse images||Former reality television personality Josh Duggar was convicted by a jury in Arkansas on Thursday on federal charges relating to downloading and viewing photos and videos depicting the sexual abuse of children, the United States Justice Department said.  Duggar, known for the TLC reality TV show "19 Kids and Counting" that focused on his parents and their 19 children, was convicted on two criminal charges. Duggar, 33, tried to hide his actions by using a password-protected partition on the hard drive of a desktop computer he kept at his used car sales lot, prosecutors said.  The show was suspended in 2015 after news broke that Duggar had molested five girls, including four of his sisters. He issued a statement at the time admitting to his actions and resigned from his post at a conservative advocacy group, but did not face criminal charges relating to that matter.  "Today's verdict sends a message that we will track down and prosecute people who download and view child sexual abuse material, regardless of the lengths they go to conceal their conduct," Kenneth Polite, assistant attorney general at the justice department's criminal division, said in a statement.  Justin Gelfand, a lawyer for Duggar, said: "We appreciate the jury's lengthy deliberations, we respect the jury's verdict, and we intend to appeal."  A sentencing date for Duggar has not yet been set. He could face between five and 20 years in prison for receiving child sexual abuse materials, and he could face up to 20 for possessing the materials.  Law enforcement officials first detected his activities during an undercover investigation into online file-sharing activities and later searched the premises of his used car sales lot in November 2019. He was charged in April.  The show "19 Kids and Counting" delved into the religious values and beliefs of his parents, including their opposition to birth control, their preference to home-school their children and their strict rules about dating, which entailed chaperoning their daughters through a courtship and banning them from kissing until marriage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/reality-tv-personality-josh-duggar-convicted-over-child-sex-abuse-images/articleshow/88195037.cms||---

Even as the crucial flight data recorder (FDR) was recovered from the wreckage near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu, defence minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament on Thursday that the ill-fated chopper was just seven minutes from its scheduled landing at Wellington. How Gen Bipin Rawat's helicopter crashed: Timeline of what happened“The helicopter took off from Sulur airbase at 11.48am on Wednesday and was expected to land at Wellington by 12.15pm. Air Traffic Control (ATC) at Sulur Air Base lost contact with the helicopter at approximately 12.08pm,” Singh said. What happened during those crucial minutes will also be examined by the tri-Service inquiry led by Air Marshal Manvendra Singh, who heads the IAF Training Command, to ascertain whether it was a technical defect or human error, and if was caused or compounded by a sudden weather-related problem in the hilly Nilgiris terrain. CDS Gen Bipin Rawat, 12 others killed in helicopter crash in Coonoor in Tamil NaduThe chopper pilots, Wing Commander PS Chauhan and Squadron Leader Kuldeep Singh, were both well qualified. “No aircraft or helicopter gets airborne unless it is deemed fully airworthy. In VIP flights, the mechanical checks are even more stringent,” an official said. The black box has been recovered from the crash site. “But sometimes one gets caught in sudden bad weather, with foggy or misty conditions reducing visibility. The FDR will be analysed after it is downloaded by the IAF. All the documentation, including the servicing record, of the Mi-17V5 is also being meticulously studied,” the official added. As per preliminary reports, it does not look like sabotage could have been behind the crash but the inquiry will nevertheless also examine that possibility as per standard operating procedures. Video of ill-fated chopper carrying General Bipin Rawat moments before it crashedThe defence minister told Parliament that after the helicopter lost contact with the ATC, a few locals spotted a fire in the forest near Coonoor and rushed to the spot to find the wreckage engulfed in flames. “Rescue teams from the local administration in the vicinity reached the site and attempted to recover the survivors from the crash site. All those recovered from the wreckage were rushed to the Military Hospital, Wellington…(but) out of the 14 persons, 13 succumbed to their injuries,” said Singh.

Live updates: Gen Bipin Rawat's last ritesIn Delhi, PM Narendra Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, national security adviser Ajit Doval and the three Service chiefs were present at the Palam airbase to pay tribute to those who died in the crash. There was an air of poignancy as the 13 caskets lay lined up inside a hangar at Palam, with family members of the dead officers and jawans showing tremendous stoicism despite their huge loss. The Army said “positive identification” of the bodies of Gen Rawat, his wife, Brig Lidder and Lance Naik Vivek Kumar has been possible. “The process for positive identification of remaining mortal remains is continuing. These mortal remains will be kept at the mortuary of the Army Base Hospital till completion of positive identification formalities,” said an officer. Gen Rawat and his wife will be cremated with full military honours at the Brar Square crematorium in Delhi Cantonment on Friday afternoon, while “appropriate military funerals of all other deceased are being planned and coordinated in consultation with close family members”, he added.

According to police, the explosion at room number 102 happened when the court was in session. The explosion, investigators said, was being probed as an act of terror. It was of low intensity and a policeman deployed there was the only one injured in the incident. However, the steel tiffin box was blown to smithereens. The nitrate-based device was activated with a timer, and the person who planted it may have left the courtroom just before the blast at 10.25am, sources said. The explosion couldn't happen with full intensity because of a faulty circuit, cops suspect. A white powder found at the spot was unburnt explosive powder. With no outfit claiming responsibility for the explosion, police suspect the involvement of a lone wolf or a group of youths radicalised online. Investigators are waiting for the final explosive analysis report of the residual matter to comment on the nature of the explosive used in the IED. Sources said that initial findings suggest it could be ammonium nitrate. The incident comes days after a shootout inside a courtroom here in which gangster Jitender Gogi was shot dead by his rivals, who were dressed as lawyers and waiting for him. The September 24 incident had led to serious questions being asked about security at the busy complex. Soon after the explosion, it was suspected that a laptop may have exploded, but pictures of the blast spot circulated internally amongst all units led the cops to launch a full investigation. Fire officials said they received information about the explosion at 10.40am, following which seven fire tenders were rushed to the spot. The police control room was also alerted around the same time by a person in the court about a blast of unknown nature.  The spot was cordoned off by the court security staff and forensic units were alerted. Cops from Northern Range and New Delhi Range of the special cell rushed to the spot. Forensic and NSG explosive teams also reached the spot. The white powder, which sources said was the residual matter after the explosion, was found scattered at the spot along with parts of a tiffin box and a laptop bag. Police have filed an FIR under the Explosives Act and the special cell is investigating the case. Due to injuries to the naib court — a policeman who acts as a link between the jail, police station and court — sections of the IPC have also been added. Raids are being conducted and the information network has been activated, sources said. Footage from CCTV cameras is being scanned for leads. Delhi Police said in a statement: "Today on 09.12.21, at around 10.25am, an incident of minor low-intensity explosion in a laptop bag occurred at the Rohini court complex. Prima facie, the incident seems to have occurred in a black colour bag (sic) which was found lying on spot." "There have been no casualties. However, a naib court, namely head constable Rajeev, sustained minor injuries and is receiving treatment at the hospital. He is fine. Forensic teams have collected the debris from the spot and taken it for examination," added a spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ied-blast-at-rohini-court-cops-probe-terror-angle/articleshow/88195103.cms||Rajshekhar Jha

Having grown up surrounded by vintage statues and furniture, Saumo couldn’t adjust to the modern building. So, he used antiques to decorate his apartment. Soon he found some beautiful antiques – a 150-year-old Burma teak staircase and a 200-year-old fireplace. After months of restoration work, he installed both pieces in his apartment. Many collectors and restorers of vintage furniture in the city are feeling lucky like Saumo as the inflow of old furniture has surged since the pandemic for several reasons. A steady increase in supplyRestorers and collectors from the city told us there are quite a few sources of vintage furniture. Besides different auction houses, the collectors constantly monitor old buildings in the city. “Many of these colonial buildings are being remodelled or demolished. If the owners don’t want to keep the old furniture, they sell them,” said a city-based Parsi collector. Even homes of consulate officials. “When a diplomat or a consulate official comes to Kolkata, they often buy antique furniture to decorate their residence. So, when they leave the country, they sell them,” he added. Being a largely unorganised market, it’s extremely difficult to say exactly how much it has grown in the recent past, but the collectors we spoke to said the increase would be between 15% and 25%. More old buildings are being demolishedExplaining the reason for this sudden surge, restorers told us that it’s because of revival of real estate projects. “So old buildings are being demolished to make multi-storied apartments. As people are shifting to smaller apartments, they are selling their old and often broken furniture,” said Amritendu Roy, a restorer of vintage furniture. Remodelling of homesThe pandemic has also prompted many to remodel their homes. “Carving out an office space in the house is a prime reason for remodelling. And while doing that, people often sell old furniture and replace them with antique ones,” said the Parsi collector. A few impressive vintage pieces 88194348Early 20th century Burma teak wood sideboardThis sideboard travelled to India in the early 20th century from Burma. The design was inspired by the Golden Palace Monastery in Mandalay, Myanmar. “When I got this, it was in a better condition than most of the furniture I usually get. But it was dirty. The intricate engraving and woodwork had to be cleaned minutely. It took about a week just to clean it,” Amritendu Roy, the current owner, said. After that, it was polished with a varnish of the same colour. 19th-century Victorian love seatIt may look like a regular couch, but a love seat was used by two lovers in Europe to spend a quiet summer evening in the garden. Amritendu Roy inherited it, but it was completely broken. “The backrest was in extremely bad condition, so was the seat. I had to dismantle everything and after repairing the broken parts, assembled them all over again,” he said. The most challenging part of the restoration was polishing it, because Amritendu, a perfectionist, did some research on the old techniques of wax polishing and applied it to the love seat. It took more than a month to complete the restoration. The Burma teak FireplaceIt was originally from one of the oldest jute mills in Bengal and was gifted to Saumo’s uncle some 50 years ago by a British man. In the beginning of 2020, Saumo inherited it and started working on it. “It was just a mantelpiece back then. Luckily, I got an iron fireplace from another old house and joined the two pieces. Now the fireplace is in perfectly usable condition,” he said. There was some woodwork missing and Saumo had to polish it entirely. The Burma teak staircaseIt was collected from a 250-year-old British mansion in Alipore, which was being knocked down. The entire staircase was broken and Saumo Prokash Gangoli paid around Rs 80,000 for it. After that Saumo had to scrub off five coats of paint and restore the bannisters and railings. “All the urns were missing except one, so I had to make three more and it took more than six months to complete the work,” he said. Chinese open display cabinetThis furniture was collected by a Parsi collector during the first half of 2020. One of his old friends informed him that in a North Kolkata house a number of old pieces of furniture were waiting to be sold. After a careful inspection – the artwork, style and material – the collector understood that it was made in the fourth quarter of the 19  century. Interestingly, about 10 years ago the collector had acquired two similar pieces from another source and this one made the set complete. How antiques are pricedThere are several reasons that determine the price of vintage furniture, but the important ones are: Historic value: The older the furniture, the higher is the price. Besides, if it had been used by a historic figure, the price and value increases exponentially Artwork: If the furniture has intricate decoration, the price goes up. Also, the genre of art used in the piece also determines the price Material: If it’s wood, then what kind of wood? Does it include silver or gold? Are there precarious gems attached to it? These questions also determine the price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pandemic-a-boon-for-the-antiques-business-in-city/articleshow/88194350.cms||Bishwabijoy Mitra
---||India||Government hunts for new CDS to end Rawat’s unfinished task||NEW DELHI: The government has begun the process to appoint a successor to General Bipin Rawat as the country’s next chief of defence staff (CDS), who apart from other tasks also functions as the military advisor to the Nuclear Command Authority chaired by the Prime Minister. There is no operational urgency to immediately appoint a new CDS because the Army, Navy and IAF chiefs exercise full control over their forces. But sources said the government wants to ensure that the “unfinished work” of Gen Rawat, who died in the Mi-17V5 helicopter crash on Wednesday more than a year before his retirement, is “taken forward to its logical conclusion”. With the groundwork already done by Gen Rawat, one of crucial tasks for the new CDS will be to work towards the creation of four new unified commands: the integrated maritime theatre command (MTC), air defence command (ADC), and two land-based commands for Pakistan and China. “The initial consultation process and file work for appointment of the new CDS has started. There are no written rules for appointment of a CDS except that he can serve till the age of 65 (Service chiefs serve till 62 or for three years, whichever is earlier). It’s a situation without any precedence. The government will soon take a decision based on merit-cum-seniority,” said a source on Thursday. General Manoj Mukund Naravane, who took over as the Army chief from Gen Rawat on December 31, 2019, and is slated to retire in April next year, is considered to be the frontrunner for the post of CDS, as was reported by TOI. The present IAF and Navy chiefs are two years’ junior to Gen Naravane. While Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari took over on September 30 this year, Admiral Radhakrishnan Hari Kumar assumed charge on November 30. The CDS, who also acts as the permanent chairman of the chiefs of staff committee and secretary of the department of military affairs in the defence ministry, would logically be appointed from among the three current Service chiefs. The direct appointment of a three-star officer (Lt-General, Vice Admiral or Air Marshal) to the CDS post seems unlikely in the rank and hierarchy-conscious environs of the 15-lakh strong armed forces. If Gen Naravane is appointed the CDS, there could be major implications for the succession line within the Army. Three top Lt-Generals who are slated to retire early next year would then be in contention for the top job. They are vice chief C P Mohanty, Northern Command chief Y K Joshi and Training Command chief Raj Shukla. In normal circumstances, Eastern Command chief Lt-General Manoj Pande would have been the senior-most Lt-General when Gen Naravane retired as the Army chief on April 30 next year. “It’s up to the government to take a call on who will be the next CDS, and later the next Army chief. It’s the government’s prerogative,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-hunts-for-new-cds-to-end-rawats-unfinished-task/articleshow/88195161.cms||Rajat Pandit
---||Business||In a first, Starbucks workers agree to union in Buffalo, NY||BUFFALO: Starbucks workers have voted to unionise at a store in Buffalo, New York, over the company's objections, raising the possibility of a new labour model for the 50-year-old coffee giant.  The National Labor Relations Board said Thursday that workers voted 19-8 in favour of a union at one of the three locations in Buffalo. A second store, however, rejected the union in a vote of 12-8. A third store is still being counted.  If the labor board certifies the vote - a process expected to take about a week - it would be the first for any Starbucks-owned store in the US to unionise. Starbucks has actively fought unionisation at its stores for decades, saying its stores function best when it works directly with employees.  Workers watching the vote count over Zoom on a big screen at a union office in Buffalo erupted into cheers and chants of "Elmwood, Elmwood, Elmwood" when the results of that location were announced, jumping up and down and hugging each other.  "We still made history," barista and union organiser Casey Moore told the others watching as it became clear the second store had voted down the union effort.  Workers at all three stores began voting by mail last month on whether they wanted to be represented by Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union.  The National Labor Relations Board began counting ballots Thursday from union elections held at the stores. Around 111 Starbucks workers were eligible to vote by mail starting last month.  "Yes" votes could accelerate unionisation efforts at other US Starbucks stores. Already, three more stores in Buffalo and a store in Mesa, Arizona, have filed petitions with the labor board for their own union elections. Those cases are pending.  Union backers at the first three Buffalo stores filed petitions with the labor board in August seeking representation by Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union. Those workers say Starbucks' stores had chronic problems like understaffing and faulty equipment even before the pandemic. They want more input on pay and store operations.  "We have no accountability right now. We have no say," said Moore, who has been working at a Buffalo-area Starbucks for around six months. "With a union we will actually be able to sit down at the table and say, 'This is what we want.'"  Starbucks insists its 8,000 company-owned US stores function best when it works directly with its employees, which it calls "partners". Many employees in the Buffalo area work at more than one store depending on demand, Starbucks says, and it wants to have the flexibility to move them between stores.  Starbucks asked the labor board to hold one vote with all 20 of its Buffalo-area stores, but the board rejected that request, saying store-by-store votes were appropriate under labor law.  In a letter to Starbucks' U.S. employees this week, Starbucks President and CEO Kevin Johnson reiterated the company's wish to include all Buffalo-area stores in the union vote.  "While we recognize this creates some level of uncertainty, we respect the process that is underway, and independent of the outcome in these elections, we will continue to stay true to our mission and values," Johnson wrote.  Johnson also reminded employees of the company's generous benefits, including paid parental and sick leave and free college tuition through Arizona State University. Late last month, the company also announced pay increases, saying all its U.S. workers will earn at least $15 - and up to $23 - per hour by next summer.  But backers of the union say Starbucks can do more.  "If Starbucks can find the money to pay their CEO nearly $15 million in compensation, I think maybe they can afford to pay their workers a decent wage with decent benefits," said U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, in a recent Twitter post. Sanders held a virtual town hall with Buffalo Starbucks workers earlier this week.  Johnson earned $14.7 million in salary and stock awards in the company's 2020 fiscal year.  Starbucks or the union can contest individual votes in the election, which could delay the certification process by the labor board. But if the votes do get certified, Starbucks is legally obligated to begin the process of collective bargaining with Workers United and any of the three stores that vote to unionize, said Cathy Creighton, the director of Cornell University's Industrial and Labor Relations Buffalo Co-Lab.  In some cases, companies have closed a location rather than deal with a union. But that's difficult for a retailer like Starbucks, since it would be illegal to close one store and then open another nearby, Creighton said.  Starbucks has shown a willingness to bargain outside the US. In Victoria, Canada, workers at a Starbucks store voted to unionise in August 2020. It took Starbucks and the United Steelworkers union nearly a year to reach a collective bargaining agreement, which was ratified by workers in July.  The union votes come at a time of heightened labor unrest in the US. Striking cereal workers at Kellogg Co. rejected a new contract offer earlier this week. Thousands of workers were on strike at Deere & Co. earlier this fall. And the US labor board recently approved a redo of a union vote at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama after finding the company pressured workers to vote against the union.  Labor shortages are giving workers a rare upper hand in wage negotiations. And Dan Graff, director of the Higgins Labor Program at the University of Notre Dame, said the pandemic gave many workers the time and space to rethink what they want from their jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/in-a-first-starbucks-workers-agree-to-union-in-buffalo-ny/articleshow/88195238.cms||---

The mortal remains of 13 defence personnel, including Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and his wife, were carried in as many ambulances from the Army Hospital at Wellington in the Nilgiris to Sulur Air Force Station. When the convoy reached near Mettupalayam, one of the ambulances hit another moving in front of it. Immediately, the casket from the ambulance that met with the accident was shifted to another spare ambulance. Meanwhile, a police van, which was part of the convoy, met with an accident in the ghat road near Burliyar on Coonoor-Mettupalayam road. The police van is attached to the Tirupur district police’s striking force. More than 15 police personnel were travelling in the van. The driver of the van lost control and the front portion of the van rammed into a rocky portion of the ghat road. A few policemen suffered minor injuries.

Read AlsoBipin Rawat chopper crash: Tri-service probe begins to find out what happened in last minutesThe high-level inquiry into the Mi-17V5 helicopter crash that killed General Bipin Rawat and 12 others on Wednesday has begun under a three-star officer, with technical defect or human error being the main focus and the possibility of sabotage being considered extremely remote.According to an official attached to Sulur air base, two small IAF choppers were sent to scout the route as part of protocol to gauge the weather conditions in the Nilgiris. “We are not sure whether the choppers landed at the Wellington helipad or returned without landing,” the official said on condition of anonymity. However, a senior official from the Madras Regimental Centre at Wellington said, “Actually no trial runs by small choppers were made as the Mi-17 V 5 is a reliable aircraft.” Read AlsoGovernment hunts for new CDS to end Rawat’s unfinished taskThe government has begun the process to appoint a successor to General Bipin Rawat as the country’s next Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), who apart from other tasks also functions as the military advisor to the Nuclear Command Authority chaired by the Prime Minister.An official from the Defence Services Staff College, where Gen Rawat was headed to deliver a lecture, said, “Not authorised to comment on it.” Eyewitnesses at Nanjappachathiram, where the helicopter crashed, said they had not seen or heard another chopper anytime during the day.

But he was not able to confirm with the IAF authorities whether any choppers were operated prior to the Mi-17 V 5 taking off for Wellington. "The Mi-17 V 5 was operated by a highly experienced pilot. The chopper was technically advanced, and I suspect human error led to the crash,” Ramesh Kumar said. “The cloud/fog might have been thicker than normal.

---||India||Help preserve open societies: PM to tech companies||NEW DELHI: Participating in US President Joe Biden’s ‘Summit for Democracy’ on Thursday, PM Narendra Modi emphasised the need for democratic countries to deliver on values enshrined in their constitutions and also called on technology companies to contribute in efforts to preserve open and democratic societies. Official sources said Modi outlined sensitivity, accountability, participation and reform orientation as four pillars of Indian democratic governance. His remarks came during a closed-door session that saw interventions by 12 ‘select’ countries, including India. The PM will deliver India’s national statement, which will be open to the public, at the summit on Friday. According to sources, Modi said the democratic spirit, including respect for rule of law and pluralistic ethos, was ingrained in Indians and added that the Indian diaspora carries it too, thereby contributing to economic well-being and social harmony of their adopted homes. “He stressed that principles of democracy should also guide global governance and that, given technology’s ability to impact democracy positively or negatively, technology companies should contribute to preserving open and democratic societies,” said a source. In his remarks today, Modi also recalled that exactly on this date 75 years ago, India’s Constituent Assembly had held its first session. He highlighted India’s civilisational ethos as one of the original sources of democracy. This virtual summit by the US envisages participation of leaders from government, civil society, and the private sector. As the world’s largest democracy, sources here said, India had commended this “innovative initiative” and stood ready to share its experiences with fellow democracies. “As a special gesture, PM Modi was invited to participate in the main leaders’ plenary session hosted by President Biden. This closed-door session saw interventions from 12 select countries, including India,” said a source. More than 100 countries are participating in the virtual summit. While India has fully backed the summit, many have described as strange the fact that US didn’t invite South Asian countries like Bhutan and Sri Lanka for the virtual meeting of leaders. The US chose to invite Pakistan but Islamabad skipped the summit apparently under pressure from China, which has attacked the US initiative saying there's no fixed model of democracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/help-preserve-open-societies-pm-to-tech-companies/articleshow/88195491.cms||---

Addressing the Convocation at National Law University, Delhi, the CJI said, "Any keen observer of Indian society would notice that in the past few decades no big leader has emerged from the student community. This appears to be correlated with diminished participation of students in social causes after liberalization." Underlining the importance of students' participation in modern democracy, he said, "It is essential that more and more well-meaning, forward-looking, and upright students like you enter public life. You must emerge as leaders. After all, political consciousness and well-informed debates can steer the nation into a glorious future as envisioned by our Constitution. A responsive youth is vital for strengthening democracy." He said students are the guardians of freedom, justice, equality, ethics, and social equilibrium. "All this can be achieved only when their energies are properly streamlined. When the youth become socially and politically conscious, the basic issues of education, food, clothing, healthcare, shelter, etc. would come into focus in the national discourse. The educated youth cannot remain aloof from social reality... While most of you leave these institutes with degrees and titles, always be aware of the world that you are a part of. You cannot remain self-centered. Do not allow narrow and partisan issues to dominate the nation’s thought process. This will ultimately hurt our democracy and the progress of our nation." The CJi said present day professional courses do not give importance to two vital subjects - humanities and natural sciences. "In an anxiety to secure highly remunerative and profitable job opportunities, children are sent to exile in privately run residential schools and coaching centers. The formative years of budding talents are spent in a suffocating atmosphere which unfortunately resembles prisons. Holistic development of a child cannot be achieved in such a restrictive environment," he warned. "The harsh reality is that even after the students enter professional universities, the focus is on classroom learning, and not on the world beyond the classroom. I am not sure who or what is to blame for these changes. My general observations on the power and responsibility of students and the youth, are even more relevant when it comes to all of you who are graduating today. You are all law graduates of one of the premier law universities in the country. All of you have a special responsibility to society," he said, with Delhi HC chief justice D N Patel and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal alongside him on the dais. He lamented that NLUs, set up with the primary objective of improving quality of legal education to enhance the standards of legal profession, have ended up with elite tag as majority of students passing out from these premier institutes preferring corporate law firms to courtroom battles. "Even though such law firms are an integral part of the country's legal landscape, it is unfortunate that a comparable addition is not being made to the ranks of lawyers practicing in courts from the NLUs. This is perhaps one of the reasons why NLUs are perceived as elitist and detached from social realities," he said. The CJI said a practicing advocate interacts with a wider cross-section of the society as compared to one working in a corporate law firm. "You will be able to spend your time and efforts on causes that you are passionate about. You will be able to fight battles in court relating to various social issues. An enrichment of courtroom advocacy is the need of the hour and is something that the profession must think about collectively. I urge all the stakeholders to consider this issue and come up with a solution," he said. Kejriwal came for effusive praise from the CJI, who said the CM has been a pillar of strength for NLU Delhi. "I am told he honors every request that is made in the interest of this institution. He is known for his commitment and hard work for the welfare of the people of Delhi. His work in the field of education and health care are highly appreciated," Justice Ramana said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lack-of-big-student-leader-not-good-for-democracy-says-cji/articleshow/88195582.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Singh said the opposition cannot question the competence of the high-powered panel in deciding “public interest” behind The Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2021, and The Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Bill, 2021. He said the enabling provisions for extensions in three instalments of one year actually cap the total tenure of directors at five years which otherwise would be open-ended. “The government should be complimented for this instead of criticised,” he said. Amid vociferous allegations from all Opposition parties that the Bills are improper, the Lok Sabha passed them with the government defending them as initiatives to create international standards of transparency and continuity at the helm, and debunking the protests as personal grievances arising out of corruption exposes against political leaders. Replying to the debate dominated by stinging comments from Opposition benches, Singh said the need for a longer tenure is to create stability and continuity at the top of the organisations so that there were high standards of confidentiality and competence. Singh’s defence came after Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Manish Tiwari of Congress, A Raja of DMK, Kalyan Banerjee and Saugata Roy of TMC, Vinayak Raut of Shiv Sena and Supriya Sule of NCP, Ritesh Pandey of BSP and Asaduddin Owaisi of MIM among others tore into the government for what they alleged was malafide intent to capture the already compromised enforcement agencies. “You are putting the two directors on probation, on a tight leash, with a hidden quid pro quo,” said DMK leader Raja. Tiwari said the Bills were part of the BJP regime’s efforts to dismantle all systems of checks and balances over seven and half years. “You are dangling a carrot before an officer, do as we say...It will only strengthen the perception that CBI, ED, I-T are frontal organisations of BJP to harass the Opposition,” Tiwari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-opposition-din-ls-oks-bills-on-tenure-of-cbi-ed-chiefs/articleshow/88195634.cms||---

The killings took place in Nagaland’s Mon district. A communiqué issued by the Office of the Oting Citizen’s media cell said the bullet holes in the truck’s windscreen “exactly at the driver’s position” indicated that the special forces first shot the driver and then “ambushed the remaining point blank (sic)”. The miners had been returning from work. Left behind: The unnamed victims of botched Army ambush in NagalandAfter the firing, the personnel blocked the road. The communiqué said the villagers had been waiting for the pick-up truck to reach the village as they had learned that shots had been fired on the route. By the time the villagers informed the district administration about the incident, it was around 7 pm, the media cell said. At around 8 pm, villagers found the pick-up truck empty. The villagers chased the three vehicles of the Indian armed forces and took over them, it said. The security forces first denied any knowledge of the whereabouts of the men. Next, while searching for the men, the villagers found the soldiers sitting on tarpaulin that covered the floor of the third vehicle. Under it, six half-dressed men were lying dead, the communique claimed. The soldiers attempted to “brand the boys as militants by planting weapons” and dressing them in “camouflage uniforms and boots”, the communiqué claimed. The villagers assumed that the soldiers might have dumped them elsewhere following which the fight started between the two sides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kohima/naga-locals-soldiers-1st-shot-driver-to-stop-pick-up-truck-then-others/articleshow/88195654.cms||---

In a review meeting on Thursday, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan also emphasised that such events should be promptly investigated by the rapid response teams and contacts of all positive patients are traced and tested as quickly as possible. This comes a day after Bhushan asked states to earmark separate isolation areas for Omicron infected Covid-19 patients in designated Covid facilities. It has to be ensured that no cross-infection takes place and adequate precautions are taken by healthcare workers in these facilities to prevent transmission, Bhushan told states. The government is also monitoring the prevalence of influenza-like illness (ILI)/severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and respiratory distress symptoms. States have also been advised to maintain adequate buffer stock for the eight critical drugs identified in clinical treatment of Covid-19. The Centre asked states to ensure that all hospital infrastructure is ready for any possible surge in Covid-19. “It needs to be ensured that all health facilities at the field-level have functional ventilators, PSA plants, oxygen concentrators etc. Many ventilators supplied by the Centre are still lying unpacked and unused at some field hospitals, with consumables not being procured and made available by the states,” said Bhushan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/omicron-in-focus-states-told-to-monitor-covid-19-clusters/articleshow/88195717.cms||---

At the administrative meeting held in Krishnanagar on Thursday, Banerjee said: “I will ask the ICs (inspectors-in-charge) to increase their mobility and step up ‘naka’ checking. You have borders with Bangladesh, starting from Karimpur. You also have to keep an eye on that... You also have to see that BSF does not get into villages without your permission. BSF will do their work and you will do yours. Always remember law and order is your subject.” Meanwhile, Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Thursday expressed “deep concern” over the CM’s stance on BSF jurisdiction and said it sent “disturbing signals and is potentially alarming for federal polity and national security”. “In the state, having an international border with Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan — the BSF and Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) play a significant, well-defined, crucial role from the perspective of national security,” the governor said in a letter to the CM. “There is an obvious need to generate bonhomie and not confrontation; cooperation and not combat amongst these agencies and the state apparatus,” Dhankar further said and added that the CM’s statement was not in sync with law. TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh took a dig at Dhankhar, saying he should take a look at the letter Narendra Modi, as then Gujarat CM, wrote in 2012 on BSF jurisdiction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ensure-bsf-doesnt-get-into-villages-sans-nod-didi-to-cops/articleshow/88195749.cms||Ashis Poddar

The sequencing, carried out at BMC’s genetic laboratory in Kasturba Hospital, found the Delta variant in 11% of the 221 Covid patients from Mumbai studied. The remaining 89% showed Delta Plus or A.Y.x sublineages and less than 1% (two cases) had Omicron. In the four sequencing exercises carried out since August, Delta was most dominant, accounting for 70-80% of samples. “But now Delta derivatives appear to be more in circulation in Mumbai. The clinical symptoms of positive patients bear testimony to the fact that Delta is either getting weaker or the population has developed immunity against it,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. Experts said phasing out of the Delta variant isn’t surprising. “The proportion of Delta derivatives have been increasing steadily. We can state that the second wave has declined and only the unvaccinated are getting hospitalised,’’ said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/deltas-descendants-outdo-even-delta-in-mumbai-samples/articleshow/88195771.cms||Malathy Iyer

As RS deputy chariman Harivansh, on behalf of the House, expressed profound sorrow over the “tragic incident” and said, “Gen Rawat had vast operational experience, having served across a wide spectrum of combat and conflict situations in India and abroad. In the last two years, Gen Rawat tried to bring in transformative reforms in the security architecture of our country.” After the defence minister shared details of the crash with the House, leader of the opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said floor leaders of all parties should be allowed to pay tribute. But Harivansh said the House has collectivity mourned the deaths and there was no precedent to allow such a thing. Congress leader Anand Sharma reiterated that they be allowed to speak, but the deputy chairman did not allow it, pointing that there was no such precedent. Even as Zero Hour started, a few opposition members kept asking for permission to speak. TMC later termed it “unfortunate” that the opposition parties were not allowed to pay their homage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/warring-parties-in-house-unite-in-collective-grief/articleshow/88195558.cms||---

In relation to his autobiographical account ‘Justice for the Judge’, TOI asked, “You in the book said that you have not opted for party affiliation within six months of taking oath as a MP and hence you remain independent of the party in power that nominated you to Parliament. But somewhere in the back of the mind, one remains obligated to the party that had nominated the person to Rajya Sabha as a MP. Your thoughts.” Justice Gogoi said, “I don’t share this perception. If I come across an occasion to find fault with the government, rest assured, I will find it. But, look at the sequence of events since March 2020 when I came to Parliament. There is hardly any sitting — first, because of the pandemic and then because of disruptions. Once things settle down, I will try to project matters of public importance in the manner it requires to be projected, regardless of who nominated me and who did not support that nomination.” “After my retirement as CJI, when rumours swirled of me being the BJP candidate for the CM’s post in Assam , my mother called me one night, saying, ‘Don’t even think about it!’ She hung up once I convinced her that the news was nothing but a rumour.” In his book, Justice Gogoi writes, “I did not even remotely think there was anything wrong in accepting the offer (for his nomination to Rajya Sabha) or that it would be inviting the kind of adverse comments. Even in my wildest imagination, if it had occurred to me that people would have publicly aired their ‘views’ and ‘thoughts’ in such a manner, I would probably have thought twice before accepting nomination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/am-still-independent-mp-will-criticise-govt-if-need-arises-gogoi/articleshow/88195785.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

With this, the bench set aside an order of a Pocso court which had ordered a DNA test of the baby on the plea of a minor, who is one of the accused in the rape case. The bench passed the verdict, allowing a revision plea of the survivor’s mother. “The question before the Pocso judge was to determine whether the accused committed rape on the survivor and not to determine who is the father of the baby born to the survivor after the incident,” the bench said. The survivor’s mother had lodged an FIR on December 17, 2017, that her minor daughter was raped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cant-force-rape-survivor-for-babys-dna-test-hc/articleshow/88195809.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

In a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, the minister said more nuclear power plants are also planned in future as nuclear energy has an important role in the country’s energy transition for meeting the goal of net zero economy. He said that nuclear power is not only clean and environmentally friendly but is also a source of base load power available 24x7 like thermal power. On the issue of the government’s plan to meet energy demands of the country using different energy sources (both renewable and non-renewable) in the next 10 years, the minister informed that a total of 79 hydro schemes with an aggregate capacity of more than 30,000 MW (comprising 11 pumped storage schemes of 8,700 MW) have been envisaged for capacity addition during the period 2019-2020 to 2029-30. These include 12,663.5 MW of hydro-electric projects under construction during this period. He also pointed out that of the 79 projects, five hydro schemes with capacity of 1,023 MW have since been commissioned. Similarly, a total capacity of 31,665 MW of coal-based capacity are in various stages of construction. Jitendra Singh said PM Narendra Modi, in his statement at COP26 summit in Glasgow, had stated that India will reach its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030 and the country will meet 50% of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nuclear-power-capacity-to-be-raised-to-22480-mw-by-2031-minister-jitendra-singh/articleshow/88195838.cms||Surendra Singh

The lawsuits were filed in federal court in Detroit and Oakland County Circuit Court by Jeffrey and Brandi Franz on behalf of their daughters, Riley, a senior who was wounded Nov. 30, and her sister Bella, a 14-year-old ninth grader who was next to her at the time she was shot, attorney Geoffrey Fieger said.  The parents attended a news conference Thursday with Fieger in his Southfield offices. Jeffrey Franz appeared stoic, staring ahead as the personal injury lawyer accused school officials and staff at Oxford High of not doing enough to prevent the shooting and protect students.  Brandi Franz sat, often with head bowed. The parents did not address reporters.  The lawsuits are the first known civil suits filed in connection with the shooting. Named in the suits are the Oxford school district, Superintendent Tim Throne, Oxford High School principal Steven Wolf, the dean of students, two counselors, two teachers and a staff member.  The Associated Press sent an email Thursday seeking comment from the district.  Ten students and a teacher were shot at the school in Oxford Township, roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Detroit.  A 15-year-old sophomore at the school, was arrested and has been charged as an adult with murder, terrorism and other crimes. His parents later were charged with involuntary manslaughter and arrested.  Personal-injury lawyers have expressed doubt that the school district could be successfully sued for letting the stay in school. That's because Michigan law sets a high bar to wring liability out of public schools and other arms of government.  "You have to show that the administration or faculty members were grossly negligent, meaning they had a reckless disregard for whether an injury was likely to take place," said attorney A. Vince Colella.  Fieger acknowledged Thursday that state law makes it difficult to successfully sue public bodies like school districts. He said a federal lawsuit allows him to subpoena the school district for records and evidence connected to the teen and the shooting.  "I understand that this is not going to be easy," Fieger said. "However, now is the time to do something about it."  The gun used in the shooting was bought days before by the father and his son had full access to it, prosecutors said.  The morning before the shooting school officials met with the accused after the school after a teacher found a drawing of a gun, a bullet and a person who appeared to have been shot, along with messages stating "My life is useless" and "The world is dead".  The parents "flatly refused" to take their son home, Throne has said.  The Franz family lives in Leonard, just northwest of Oxford. One of the lawsuits criticised school officials for not expelling, disciplining or searching the boy prior to the shooting, which allowed him to return to his classroom "and carry out his murderous rampage".  The lawsuit alleges civil rights violations under the 14th Amendment and also said the school district "knew or should have known that the policies, procedures, training supervision and discipline" staff members named in the suit "were inadequate for the tasks that each defendant was required to perform".  "There's a responsibility that our society shares in protecting our children," Fieger said. "There is a responsibility among teachers, counsellors and school administrators who could easily have prevented and stopped this slaughter." Riley Franz was hospitalised following the shooting. She now is recovering at home, Fieger said.  A 17-year-old student - the remaining victim hospitalised from the shooting - was removed Thursday from an intensive care unit, the Oakland County sheriff's office said.  She was moved to a standard room and was expected to remain in a hospital for the next four to six weeks while undergoing rehabilitation.  On Wednesday, a statement posted on the district's website by Throne said that after all the facts have been obtained and released through the course of the prosecution, he will recommend to the Oxford Board of Education that the district initiate a review of its entire system "as other communities have done when facing similar experiences."  "Our goal with all of this is to bring together all of the facts of what happened before, during and after this horrific incident," he wrote. "We are committed to doing this in a way that allows our community to move forward and does not re-traumatise our community members, who are reeling and suffering from this horrible event."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/michigan-school-violence-could-have-been-prevented-parents-file-two-100-m-suits/articleshow/88195847.cms||---

The pilots had to shut down an engine and divert the flight to Mumbai where the aircraft landed safely, said a source. The incident is most likely the first-ever mid-air emergency involving a SpiceJet Boeing 737 MAX aircraft after the fleet returned to service on November 23. The three-year-old aircraft (VT MXE), which had departed Mumbai at 6.55pm, was eastward-bound and had climbed to around 33,000 feet when a problem with hydraulics and ‘oil filter bypass’ forced the pilots to divert, said a source. The aircraft landed in Mumbai around 7.50pm. In its previous avatar, the Boeing 737 MAX had suffered recurring problems, which had the aircraft system overriding the pilot’s inputs to repeatedly push the plane’s nose down post takeoff. The repeated downward pitching had led to two accidents, one in Indonesia and the other in Ethiopia, killing a total of 346 people. Then, from March 2019, the aircraft was grounded worldwide till November 2020 when the US cleared it for resumption of flights. In India, though, SpiceJet brought it back to life again only last month. A SpiceJet spokesperson said: “SG- 467 operating Mumbai-Kolkata returned to Mumbai after takeoff due to a technical issue. It landed safely in Mumbai.” On the day it resumed Boeing 737 MAX operations, SpiceJet said the Boeing 737 MAX had operated over 2,35,000 commercial flights since it returned to service in the US in November 2020. The flights had totalled over 5,75,000 flight hours. More than 32 airlines have returned their Boeing 737 MAX fleets to service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/grounded-earlier-737-max-faces-mid-air-emergency/articleshow/88195849.cms||Manju V

The report was tabled in Parliament on Thursday. Since BBBP is one of the most important vehicles of the government to improve child sex ratio in backward regions and ensure education of the girl children, the committee has recommended that the government should, hereafter, reconsider spending on advertisements under the BBBP scheme and should focus on planned expenditure allocation for sectoral interventions in education and health. Noting that there was a need for more efficient allocation and release of funds, the Committee cites that since the inception of the scheme in 2014-15 till 2019-20, the total budgetary allocation under BBBP scheme was Rs 848 crore, excluding the Covid stricken financial year of 2020-21. During this period, an amount Rs. 622.48 crore was released to the states. “However, to the Committees’ dismay, only 25.13% of the funds, i.e. Rs. 156.46 crore have been spent by the states reflecting not upto the mark performance of the scheme,” they note. The committee has recommended the WCD ministry must immediately take up the issue with states/UTs and ensure proper utilisation of BBBP funds for the benefit of the girl child. The committee said the unabated decline in child sex ratio (CSR) since 1961 (from 976 in 1961 to 927 in 2001 and 918 in 2011) was a matter of grave concern but noted that with consistent efforts the states are beginning to show positive results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/79-of-beti-bachao-funds-spent-on-media-advocacy/articleshow/88195879.cms||---
---||India||Sufficient material to show Anil Deshmukh's PS Sanjeev Palande helped collect bribe: Court||MUMBAI: A special PMLA court that rejected the bail plea of jailed former state home minister Anil Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande (51) said there is prima facie sufficient material to hold that he knowingly assisted in collection of bribes, which itself is illegal and amounts to generation of proceeds of crime. Relying on statements of co-accused, dismissed cop Sachin Waze and others, the court said Palande and Deshmukh’s jailed personal assistant Kundan Shinde were closely involved in the illegal activities and were actively assisting and collaborating with Deshmukh. “They were giving instructions to Sachin Waze at the instance of Anil Deshmukh and monitoring work of collection of money from bar owners. These are the allegations in the complaint, which are supported by statements of Sachin Waze, Sanjeev Palande and others,” special judge MG Deshpande said. While the bails pleas of Palande and Shinde were rejected on Tuesday, the former’s detailed order copy was made available on Wednesday. The two were arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on June 25. The court refuted defence arguments that Palande was Waze’s victim. “There is nothing to show that applicant had any past enmity with Sachin Waze or against whosoever, either ‘No.1’ Anil Deshmukh or Param Bir Singh,” the court said. The court said even if it is assumed that Waze has tried to implicate Palande, the fact stated by him regarding meetings at Sahyadri guest house and official residence of the (former) home minister are fully corroborated by statements of others. It is ED’s case that at the meetings, collection of money was discussed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sufficient-material-to-show-deshmukh-ps-helped-collect-bribe-court/articleshow/88195900.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The final hearing of the petition, filed by the BJP leader in 2015, challenging the proceedings of a lower court in Assam’s Karimganj in Barak valley against him was held on November 11. The court had reserved the judgment after the hearing. Senior advocate Swamy argued his own case in the HC as a “petitioner-in-person”, and was assisted by a senior lawyer of Guwahati high court, Bijan Mahajan, and others. A single-judge bench on Thursday pronounced the judgment by quashing the proceedings at the court of chief judicial magistrate, Karimganj. The case was initiated by a lawyer from Karimganj, Tutur Rahman Patikar, at the lower court against Swamy for allegedly creating communal disharmony and defaming a particular community while delivering a speech at a function organised by a private university in Guwahati in March, 2015.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/guwahati-high-court-quashes-proceedings-against-swamy-in-2015-hate-speech-case/articleshow/88195940.cms||Mukut Das

Pakistan should try its best to stop the formation of these blocs because we should not become a part of any bloc,” Khan said while addressing the Islamabad Conclave 2021. The US invitation to the virtual democracy summit had put Pakistan in a difficult situation as Washington had invited Taiwan, instead of Beijing, to represent China. Islamabad could not risk upsetting China, its closest ally.  Moving to regional challenges, Khan said the biggest problem keeping South Asia hostage was the “Kashmir issue”. He said his government had reached out to India for peace but did not get apositive response. Meanwhile, Pakistan NSA Moeed Yusuf asserted during a BBC interview that the country has not offered any military bases to China in the strategic Gwadar port. “There are economic bases of China in Pakistan, where any country in the world can invest…the same were also offered to US, Russia and the Middle East.

And the country's first space station is likely to come up by 2030, he informed the Parliament. Sharing the status of other major space projects with the Parliament, the minister said the Venus mission is also planned for launch in 2023, while L-1 Aditya solar and Chandrayaan-3 missions are due for 2022-23. In reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, the minister said Gaganyaan’s major missions like the test vehicle flight for the validation of crew escape system performance and first uncrewed mission of Gaganyaan (G1) are scheduled during the beginning of the second half of next year. This will be followed by the second uncrewed mission at the end of 2022 carrying ‘Vyommitra’, a spacefaring human robot developed by Isro, and finally the first crewed Gaganyaan mission in 2023, “which would, undoubtedly, place India in the elite club of nations (America, China and Russia)”. Singh said that more than 500 industries are involved in the launch of Gaganyaan. “The programme got slightly delayed due to Covid restrictions, but preparations are now in full swing to achieve the mission by 2023,” he said. Providing details on the status of the programme to the Rajya Sabha, the minister said an astronaut-training facility is being established in Bengaluru and is in an advanced stage of completion. “Basic aeromedical training and flying practice have been completed as part of the Indian leg of training. The design of all systems has been completed and realisation of various systems is in different stages of progress. Ground qualification tests of human-rated launch vehicle propulsion stages have been successfully progressing,” he said. The minister added the Gaganyaan programme will be different from other human missions undertaken by other countries in a sense that this will be more cost effective and inclusive. On Chandrayaan-3, he said it is targeted for launch in the second quarter of the financial year 2022-2023. “Integrated sensors and navigation performance tests on the lander have been completed and other tests are in progress,” said the minister, adding that all tests will be completed before the launch. Setting a timeline for India’s first space station, he informed the Rajya Sabha that “by 2030, we would, possibly, be able to set up a space station, which would be unique. As I said, the journey of India's ascent to the top has already begun through space.” In another reply to the Upper House, Singh said the allocation of funds for the research and development (R&D) of six major scientific agencies — the departments of science and technology, bio-technology, space, atomic energy, ministry of earth sciences and DSIR/CSIR — has been increased from Rs 17,406 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 37,823 crore in 2021-22, that is more than double in the last seven years. He added the government has consistently increased the allocation of funds for investment in R&D in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/eyeing-space-station-by-2030-crewed-gaganyaan-mission-in-2023-minister/articleshow/88195891.cms||Surendra Singh
---||India||Be tolerant of those with different views: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: Citing examples of politicians of the bygone era, including former Prime Ministers P V Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpaiyee who respected each other despite belonging to two different political streams, the Supreme Court on Thursday said people, including the “political class”, should introspect and be tolerant towards those having opposite views. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh expressed concern over the quality of public discourse, including on social media, and said there are bound to be differences of opinion and perception and people must be respectful to even those who are not in agreement with their ideology and philosophy. It said there must be mutual respect. The court was dictating orders on a plea of OpIndia Editor Nupur Sharma against whom FIR was lodged by Bengal police for writing articles critical of the state government. Though the state government informed the bench at the outset that it decided to withdraw the cases against Sharma and others, the court said it would not “let go this opportunity” to express concern over the prevailing situation in the country when people have ceased to be accommodative and tolerant. “This country is a land of diversity. It is bound to have different perceptions and views and which is the essence of democracy,” the bench said. It said that there is an urgent need for people including the political class to introspect. The bench appreciated the state government for its decision to withdraw cases which were allegedly filed to harass the journalist for writing against it. The court also applauded Senior Advocate Siddharth Dave for convincing the state to take the decision. The bench agreed with senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani and lawyer Ravi Sharma who argued that there was nothing objectionable in the articles written by Sharma. They contended that those articles and reports were just reiterations of what politicians had said earlier and were already in the public domain. Noting the stand of state government, the bench quashed the FIRs against Sharma and hoped that other states will also follow it, hinting that people with different views and political ideologies are not to be targeted by a government. “It is better late than never. I hope it will be a model for others to follow also,” the bench said. In a clear message to present-day politicians, who engage in no-holds-barred bickering and criticism on public platforms, the court said this was an unprecedented situation and a far cry from the days when politicians on the opposite sides of the fence used to respect each other, observed decorum and decency even while criticising each other. The court said the relationship of Rao and Vajpayee was of that type, who respected each other despite fighting on political turf. Indirectly referring to the nature of the acrimonious discussion on social media and channels, Justice Kaul said he has never been on social media and it’s “better to watch entertainment channel instead of news channel”. He said people should learn that differences of opinion can be expressed in a better way without hurting others. The bench also had a word of caution for journalists and said they also needed to be careful in the “twitter age”. The court had earlier stayed the FIRs against Sharma and granted her protection from arrest. In her petition, she alleged that the Bengal police had registered FIRs against Sharma and other OpIndia staffers over reports on the website. It said although other news outlets also carried write-ups on the subject, police had singled out OpIndia, and the “authoritarian Kolkata police” was using registration of FIRs as a tool to “intimidate journalists” in getting online content and reports critical of the state government deleted.

Justice Nicola Davies and Justice Saini handed down the judgment refusing to give the Indian government permission to appeal the decision by a magistrates’ court not to extradite Kuldeep, saying India’s evidence was “inadmissible”. Since permission to appeal was not granted, India can’t appeal to the Supreme Court and Singh will remain in the UK. The Indian government has accused Singh of plotting terrorist attacks and assassinations in Punjab.  The hearing took place on November 16. The judges turned down India’s request for permission to appeal owing to the fact that the only evidence India relied on was a police interrogation report of Kuldeep’s two co-accused in India. Davies ruled the evidence was inadmissible since they were summaries produced by a police officer of the co-accused “who appear to have been interviewed in the absence of a lawyer and who haven’t signed the statements||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-hc-rejects-indias-appeal-to-extradite-terror-accused/articleshow/88196008.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The inputs ahead of the Budget, expected to be presented on February 1, come as the finance ministry is pushing government departments to step up spending, sources told TOI. While the Centre has budgeted for a fiscal deficit of 6.8% of GDP for the current financial year, the plan is to gradually lower it to 4.5% of GDP by 2025-26 as part of overall fiscal consolidation effort. Government sources said Niti Aayog has suggested that it may be useful to rework the fiscal consolidation plan and budget for higher spending and deficit during the next financial year too. "The economy is not out of the woods yet and there is a constant threat from Covid variants. So, it may help to go for higher capex next year too," said a source, adding that efforts to lower the fiscal deficit at this juncture may not be desirable. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has budgeted for a 26% increase in the Centre's capex during the current financial year with the allocation enhanced to over Rs 5.5 lakh crore. Between April and October, capex was estimated to have increased 28% to over Rs 2.5 lakh crore, latest data released by the Controller General of Accounts showed. The numbers also threw up a worrying statistic as capex during October fell 24% to Rs 23,919 crore from the year-ago level and there was a sharp drop from September level of Rs 57,483 crore. Sitharaman has held discussions with ministries and public sector companies to prod them to spend the allocated amount, while promising higher allocation wherever needed. There are, however, concerns that several ministries have not performed adequately on the capex front and there is a need to step up their spending plans. For instance, during April-October, the department of telecommunications had spent only 12% of the Rs 25,933 crore allocated to it. Similarly, the power ministry has managed to spend just 7% of the over Rs 1,500 crore set aside for the ministry's capex plans. The good news is that the railways has spent Rs 60,434 crore of the Rs 1,07,100 crore allocated to it, which translates into utilisation of 56% up to October. The roads and highways ministry too has spent 68% of the capex allocation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-shouldnt-rush-to-rein-in-fiscal-deficit-niti-aayog/articleshow/88196009.cms||Surojit Gupta

"Our only effort is to sensitize you," a division bench headed by Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi said after going through an affidavit filed by BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta. The bench wanted to know if there were any cases involving VIPs so that exemplary action even in one or two such cases would set an example for 1.3 lakh buildings, which were surveyed in the city's eight zones as of November 30 this year.Of the 1.3 lakh buildings surveyed, the BBMP issued notices to owners of 16,286 buildings asking them to submit documents to prove that their buildings are not unauthorized constructions.  Appearing for the BBMP commissioner, senior advocate DN Nanjunda Reddy informed the court that three buildings found violating the rules have been demolished between December 1 and 4. As many as 1,712 replies from building owners have been received. He said they would pass the final orders after due process of the law. In Bommanahalli zone, 75,008 buildings were surveyed and 4,779 were issued the notices. In RR Nagar, of the 38,147 buildings surveyed, 1,687 notices were issued. Of the 10,619 buildings surveyed in the west zone, 2,701 notices have been issued so far. At least 75 buildings in Dasarahalli zone have been issued notices, seeking further details about the buildings. The court will hear the case next on March 15 and asked the BBMP chief commissioner to appear in person.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-to-bbmp-take-credible-action-against-illegal-bldgs/articleshow/88196039.cms||---

Many Western nations have been rolling out boosters, targeting the elderly and people with underlying health issues, but worries about the fast-spreading Omicron have prompted some to expand their programmes. The WHO recommended boosters instead for those with health issues, or those who have received an inactivated shot. The jury is still out on how effective current vaccines are against Omicron. They have so far proved hugely successful in slowing the spread of the coronavirus and the severity of illness, but low rates of inoculation pose the risk of more dangerous and more vaccine-resistant variants emerging. “As we head into whatever the Omicron situation is going to be, there is risk that the global supply is again going to revert to high-income countries hoarding vaccine,” the WHO’s vaccine director, Kate O’Brien, said. Mike Ryan, WHO emergencies director, said Omicron appeared to be “fitter and faster” but it was not invincible. “We don't fully understand the implications clinically or the implications for our vaccines. ... What we do in the coming days and weeks, both in terms of virus suppression, vaccination and equity will make a huge difference to the evolution of this pandemic in 2022,” he said. Omicron was first detected in southern Africa and Hong Kong and Africa accounts for 46% of reported cases globally, Richard Mihigo, coordinator of the WHO’s Immunisation and Vaccine Development Programme for Africa, told an online briefing. Just 7.5% of over one billion people in Africa have had primary doses||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/who-worried-rich-countries-could-hoard-vaccines-over-omicron-fear/articleshow/88196030.cms||---

As per data from Oxford University’s ‘Our World in Data’ South America has the highest proportion of the population (60%) fully vaccinated, while Europe is close behind with 59%. Asia has achieved at least 50%, and India too, as announced by the Centre earlier this week, has crossed the halfway mark. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reiterated the need to maintain the same momentum.However, with no vaccine equity, experts believe, countries are allowing for more mutations, as is evident with the latest SARS-CoV2 variant — Omicron. Statista, a global company specialising in market and consumer data, quotes a recent release by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation: “...The longer the world takes to deliver vaccine equity, the more we allow Covid-19 to mutate and become more dangerous. This new variant demonstrates that vaccine nationalism is a short-sighted approach that is self-defeating and puts us all at risk. It reinforces the reality, once again, that no one is safe until everyone is safe.”Separate data shows that twelve months after the woman from Coventry, England received the dose, the gap in global vaccine distribution is still wide, even as 8-billion vaccine doses have been administered globally. “The Covax initiative, which has been set up to ensure global equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines, has so far fallen short of its goal, despite shipping 635 million doses to 144 countries and territories,” a Statista report based on this data reads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/year-after-1st-covid-vax-dose-india-asia-at-50/articleshow/88196047.cms||---

The domestic currency opened at 75.45 and came under pressure following a sustained demand for dollars. It finally closed at 75.52, down 6 paise from its previous close of 75.46. According to a report by IFA Global, foreign investors are cautious ahead of the release of US inflation data on Friday. A sharper increase in prices in the US increases the risk of interest rates rising there. Higher interest rates would cause money to move back into US treasuries, triggering an appreciation of the dollar. Foreign banks bought US dollars to cover their existing bets placed in favour of the rupee, ahead of the end of the calendar year. This dragged the domestic currency. Dealers are also watchful of the equity markets as some of the large anchor investors in recent mega IPOs complete their one-month lock-in. Results of a survey conducted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which were released on Thursday, indicate that economists expect the Indian rupee to remain stable within the narrow range of 74.70-75.00 against the US dollar till the second quarter of financial year 2022-23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rupee-faces-year-end-pressure-ends-at-75-52/articleshow/88196048.cms||---

The student, pursuing first-year BBA at a private college near Yelahanka, lives in northeast Bengaluru. Though the incident took place on December 4, the student kept the matter to himself, fearing more trouble from his attackers. However, his family members noticed an injury on his face and enquired about it. When he revealed the incident, his parents took him to a hospital and later lodged a complaint. “There are 100 students, including 25 girls, in the class. Many are my friends, however, I’m close to a girl, which irked a classmate. On December 3, at 3.30pm, he called me, asking to meet him near a mall on Kodigehalli Main Road. He was standing there with four more people. They accused me of getting close with the girl and punched me on my nose. Then, they attacked with an iron rod.

Police claimed to have solved four cases of burglary with the arrests. They recovered Rs 9.3 lakh in cash and gold ornaments worth Rs 19 lakh from the gang. The accused are Karan Bista, a security guard at the apartment, and his associates Hikmat Shahi, Gorakh Kalu, Jeevan, and Raju. All of them work as security guards in the city. The gang allegedly burgled flat no. 402, belonging to Ramachandrareddy Atla, a businessman from Andhra Pradesh, on the night of October 15. Atla, his wife and daughter were at their hometown to attend a funeral. Bista himself called and informed Atla that some miscreants had stolen valuables from his residence. Atla returned to the city and filed a case of house burglary on October 17. He told police the burglars had taken away Rs 28 lakh in cash and gold ornaments worth Rs 15 lakh. Hennur police took up the case. On finding the trail of the gang of guards, they picked up Bista for interrogation and he allegedly confessed. Based on this, the other four men were arrested. Investigation revealed Bista had shared information about Atla’s trip with his associates on Facebook Messenger. The men took the valuables and returned to Nepal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/five-nepalese-guards-burgle-bizmans-flat-land-in-custody/articleshow/88196050.cms||---

Mohammed Ali Athar Ahmed, also known as MD Ahmed, was shown 32 flashcards with three-digit numbers for a second each. Soon after all the cards were shown, Ahmed recalled the numbers correctly in the same order. In doing so, he broke a Guinness record previously held by an Iranian (30 three-digit cards) to memorise most three-digit flash numbers in the world. Ahmed created the record on October 18, overcoming anxieties during the pandemic. However, this wasn’t the first time he conquered an uncertain period of life. Back in his 20s, there was a phase when he was without a job, nursed suicidal tendencies and suffered from poor health. Ahmed said when he saw people around him achieving things in life, he was motivated to stop wasting time and start doing something. From reading self-help books to learning neurolinguistic programming, Ahmed, who is now in his 40s, has come a long way to become a life strategist. He said the pandemic played a role in motivating him to break the “most challenging Guinness World Records in the field of accelerated learning,” though he had been contemplating attempting it even before Covid-19 struck. “The record was a display of superfast memory, concentration power and mental strength. It was during the pandemic that I felt my emotions fluctuating. As a professional who teaches people to handle emotions and anxiety, I took this as a wake-up call and decided to reframe my thoughts and started practising regulating my emotions,” said Ahmed. He has been teaching students (school, college-going as well as professionals) about accelerated learning for 10-15 years now. This method involves learning in a way that suits a student’s brain. “It is through this method that I wish to convey there are no average or below-average students, only average or below-average teaching and learning methods,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-man-bags-guinness-record-for-super-memory/articleshow/88196051.cms||Farheen Hussain

---||Bengaluru||With 144 cases, Karnataka among top 3 in cybercrimes against children||BENGALURU: With children getting more accessibility to electronic devices over the past one year, the number of cybercrimes has leapfrogged in the country. As many as 1,102 cases of cybercrimes against children were registered in 2020, shows the data from the Union ministry of women and child development. The three states that top the list are Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka. The data, which was primarily sourced from the National Crimes Records Bureau (NCRB), is a pointer to the vulnerabilities with regard to safe use of the internet by schoolchildren, especially those attending online classes. While Maharashtra registered 207 cases, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka reported 197 and 144, respectively. Kerala stood fourth with 126 cases. The most common set of cases are cyber pornography/hosting or publishing obscene sexual materials depicting children. In Maharashtra, 69 cases are registered for cyber bullying and stalking. Except for one case in Chhattisgarh, nobody has been convicted yet. In Karnataka, of the 144, 122 are in pornography and the rest are classified as other crimes. Of the total cases, 34 people have been arrested and 12 chargesheeted. The world, however, was different a year ago. In 2019, the number of cybercrimes against children registered in India was 306. In 2018, it was 232. In Karnataka, the numbers were 10 and 25, respectively. “The Covid-19 pandemic was indeed a facilitator to the rise in cybercrimes,” said Krutika Patil, research associate at the School of Internal Security, Defence and Strategy Studies at Rashtriya Raksha University, Gujarat. “Children had no alternative for entertainment and education apart from the internet and social media. The internet works in such a way that the more you spend time on it, the more hooked you get. Apart from that, children’s innate curiosity to know more gets them to explore further. In many families, both parents are working and they may not get time to monitor the children’s activities either,” she said. Dr Manoj Sharma, chief clinical psychologist at Service for Healthy Use of Technology (SHUT clinic), Nimhans, attributed this to increase in accessibility to devices and lack of cyber literacy. “There is peer pressure to do things like sharing information or other stuff that can eventually become harmful to them. There are multiple options for them along with time availability and boredom also contributes. The best way is to educate children on the do’s and don’ts. They have to be taught to identify the misinformation and risky elements. The best way is to unmute themselves. Families should build trust so that children discuss issues without fear and their accessibility or time availability with the technology will reduce if they open up,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/with-144-cases-ktaka-among-top-3-in-cybercrimes-against-children/articleshow/88196053.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Miscreants hack credentials, approve e-khata for 36 sites at Channahalli village||BENGALURU: A group of miscreants illegally obtained e-khata for 36 sites at Channahalli village, near Devanahalli, by misusing the login credentials of two panchayat officials. On December 4, Northeast CEN Crime police registered a criminal case of cybercrime and cheating against unidentified miscreants based on a complaint by Vasantha Kumar HD, executive officer of Devanahalli taluk panchayat. According to Kumar, the alleged fraud took place between 1.50pm on September 17 and 5pm on September 20. The panchayat development officer of Channahalli brought it to Kumar’s notice. As per procedure, the taluk panchayat EO should assign the login for the PDO to approve e-khata of sites. But some miscreants hacked the EO’s login ID and assigned a person — Guruprasad HN — to approve e-khatas. They misused the login credentials and approved e-khatas for 36 sites belonging to Tirupati Reddy and Ajay Narne. But those approvals did not have the PDO’s digital signature, which is mandatory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/miscreants-hack-credentials-approve-e-khata-for-36-sites/articleshow/88196054.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: BJP govt in two minds on tabling anti-conversion and APMC bills||BENGALURU: The government seems to be in two minds over tabling two significant bills — one to repeal the contentious Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) law and the other to check illegal religious conversions — in the winter session of the legislature. The cabinet which met here on Thursday, four days ahead of the Belagavi session from December 13, did not take up the two bills for approval. “Both were not discussed at the meeting,’’ a senior minister told TOI. As per rules, all bills should get cabinet approval before tabling them in the house. Though there is a provision for the government to get cabinet approval after the bill is passed in both houses, this is normally avoided for significant bills. The APMC Bill was passed in both houses in September. The Act is the state version of the central government legislation to modify APMC law, which allows farmers to sell their produce outside APMC markets. However, farmers protested the move nationwide, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that his government would repeal the Act. Farmer bodies in Karnataka had told the government to follow suit and repeal the amendment to APMC Act and Land Reforms Act. Expectations on the anti-conversion regulations built up after chief minister Basavaraj Bommai had categorically said his government was keen on enacting the anti-conversion law and a bill would be tabled in Belagavi session. He even said a draft was being prepared. But sources said allegations of forceful conversions in coastal and central Karnataka and demand by some BJP MLAs, including Goolihatti Shekhar whose mother reportedly converted to Christianity, forced the government to mull over the bill. As far as repealing recent amendments to the APMC Act is concerned, the government is said to have adopted a wait-and-watch policy. “Many BJP-ruled states haven’t repealed the amendments yet. The Karnataka government is waiting for that before taking a call on the matter,” said another minister. However, party insiders said the possibility of the bills being tabled and passed in both houses can’t be ruled out. “The government may have deliberately avoided getting cabinet approval to silence the opposition before the session. They may table the bills at the fag end,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bjp-govt-in-two-minds-on-tabling-anti-conversion-and-apmc-bills/articleshow/88196055.cms||---

The final figure is also 20% more than the $50 billion it had targeted for the year. Buoyed by this performance, the company is targeting $90 billion in TPV for 2022. CEO & co-founder Harshil Mathur said the company has clocked over 300% year-on-year TPV growth for the second year in a row. “We power more than 5% of IMPS (Immediate payment service) transactions on the disbursement side. Out of 42 unicorns (in India), 34 are powered by Razorpay,” Mathur said. Razorpay powers payments for over 8 million businesses including the likes of Facebook, Ola, Zomato, Swiggy, Cred, Muthoot Finance, and Indian Oil, and is on track to reach 10 million businesses by 2022. Almost 70% of customers drop off at the last step of an online transaction, abandoning their carts, the primary reason being complex check out pages with multiple hoops that need one to remember and manually enter passwords, card details, addresses and OTP, to complete a purchase. Razorpay simplifies this process.Shashank Kumar, CTO and co-founder, said their new solution, Magic Checkout, automatically prefills the needed information at all stores within the Magic Checkout network for all current and future purchases. “This reduces the dropout by 40%-50%,” he said. Shoppers, he said, will now be able to checkout 50% faster while retailers can expect a 20% increase in conversions.The recently launched RazorpayX tax payment suite, a one-stop platform for all tax payments needs of small businesses, be it TDS, GST, TCS or advance tax, is proving to be a success. The RazorpayX dashboard provides businesses a single, transparent view of all disbursals for seamless collaboration between finance teams, external accountants, and business owners. “Nearly 60-70% of the $160 milion that we raised earlier this year would go into RazorpayX and neobanking,” Mathur said.Razorpay has launched a startup launchpad called Rize for first-time entrepreneurs that will help them right from the initial incorporation to filing their first tax, paying their first payroll, and providing tools to cater to sales, marketing & finance needs. Rize will also help entrepreneurs acquire their first loan or funding. Rize has partnered with over 50 product companies including AWS, Freshworks, WeWork, Zoho, Shiprocket, and WebEngage to create the comprehensive toolkit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/razorpays-total-payment-volume-rises-300-in-21/articleshow/88196057.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

I own the decision to do the layoffs, but in communicating it I blundered the execution. In doing so, I embarrassed you,” he wrote. “I realise that the way I communicated this news made a difficult situation worse. I am deeply sorry and am committed to learning from this situation and doing more to be the leader that you expect me to be.”The firing was all the more surprising because it came a week after the SoftBank-backed lender received $750 million in cash. Better.com has raised over $400 million in equity capital since its inception and is valued at $7 billion. The company has nearly 10,000 employees, of which about a fifth are in India, mostly in Gurgaon. Many in India too slammed the way the layoff was done. RPG Enterprises chairman Harsh Goenka tweeted, “My heart went out to the 900 employees sacked through Zoom by Vishal Garg. Totally wrong! Do it on a one-on-one basis. And in person. And not before Christmas and after a $750-million recent infusion. This is how corporates get a heartless tag!”Garg in his apology went on to say, “We will talk more at our upcoming All Hands meeting about what to expect for the year ahead. I hope you’ll join me for the discussion. We are also taking fast steps to make sure we are very transparent and aligned as a company on the goals for 2022, the metrics that matter most, and how we can all work together even better to serve our customers and achieve our mission. I believe in you, I believe in Better, and I believe that working together we can make home-ownership better together.”Garg founded Better.com in 2014, following his own experience of buying a home.

South Western Railway (SWR) has decided to cancel two trains, partially cancel six, divert 11, and regulate one on account of non-interlocking work for three days, from December 13 to 15, for commissioning line doubling in the Yelahanka-Penukonda section. KPSC will conduct exams for the posts of assistant engineer and junior engineer in the public works department. Officials say centres have been allocated away from candidates’ hometowns to prevent exam malpractice. However, many aspirants say their centres are up to 500km away and they received sudden notice about it, making it difficult to find transport options. Karnataka Rail Users, a rail group, tweeted on Wednesday: “In the interest of students who are allotted faraway centres for KPSC exams, please consider special trains from Bidar, Belagavi, Vijayapura, and Karwar to Bengaluru/Mysuru (and vice-versa) … Postponement of this scheduled work of the railways will also be of great help to the candidates.” SWR chief PRO (in-charge) E Vijaya said, “There are four trains running from north Karnataka to Bengaluru every day. Initially, we planned to cancel two pairs of trains, but we’ve now decided to only cancel 12735/36 Secunderabad–Yeshwantpur Garib Rath Express. The 11311/12 Solapur-Hassan-Solapur Daily Express will operate. We have not received any representation for special trains so far. We will examine it based on demand.” Secunderabad–Yeshwantpur Express has been cancelled on December 12 while the one in the return direction has been cancelled on December 13. Trains partially cancelled A few trains will be partially cancelled: 18463/64 Bhubaneswar-KSR Bengaluru-Bhubaneswar Prasanti Express between Sri Sathya Sai Prasanthi Nilayam and KSR Bengaluru from December 12 to 15; 17603/04 Kacheguda-Yelahanka-Kacheguda Daily Express between Yelahanka and Dharmavaram from December 12 to 15; and 17211/12 Machilipatnam-Yeshwantpur- Machilipatnam Express between Dharmavaram and Yeshwantpur on December 13 and 14.

---||Bengaluru||Four held, stolen SUV used for two robberies in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: On the night of November 5, a sports utility vehicle (SUV) belonging to a city-based businessman was driven away by miscreants from a pub in Ashoknagar in the central business district after showing a tampered slip to the valet parking staff. The staff allowed the vehicle to pass after looking at the date and the number mentioned in it. The same night, the businessman filed a police complaint. Though cops scanned over 50 pieces of CCTV footage collected from surrounding areas, they failed to get immediate clues about the miscreants. The breakthrough came when Kudur police from Ramanagara district caught four men, including the son of a retired police sub-inspector, on robbery charges last week. It was found that the SUV seized from them was the stolen one. The suspects had changed its licence plate, matching to a SUV they had seen on social media. The owner was intending to sell it and had posted a picture. Three days after driving away the vehicle from the pub, the miscreants targeted their first victim. On November 8 night, they accosted a 30-year-old private company employee near Gudemaranahalli Cross. Holding a walkie-talkie, they posed as policemen. Accusing him of driving under the influence of alcohol and indulging in smuggling, they beat him up. Later, they took him to an ATM kiosk in Solur near Kudur and made him withdraw Rs 3,000. On November 17 night, the four men in the SUV blocked a 32-year-old man near Avaragere village in Bidadi. The man, a cashier with a bar in Bidadi, was carrying the day’s collection of Rs 80,000 with him. Claiming to be cops, they bundled him into the vehicle. After reaching Byadarahalli junction, they snatched the cash. “We noticed that one SUV was used for back-to-back robberies, with four men in it. Investigation revealed the SUV had repeatedly passed through a toll gate in Nelamangala in the direction of Kunigal. We deployed police in plainclothes to trace the vehicle. They watched from morning till midnight. On two instances, the vehicle passed these tolls during the wee hours and we extended the deployment to round-the-clock,” a senior officer said. Last week, the vehicle passed the toll gate and headed in Kunigal direction. “We blocked the vehicle and detained the four. The licence plate and the chassis number of the vehicle were mismatching. Upon questioning, the suspects spilled the beans,” he said. The accused are G Rajesh, 33, from Yeshwantpur, PT Chetan, 35, of Arishinakunte, R Puneet Kumar, 24, Sringar and S Srinivas, 24, of Chamrajpet. Rajesh, a cabbie, drove away the car from the valet parking. “Rajesh was earlier booked in 11 criminal cases, including robbery, dacoity and theft. Chetan is son of retired police sub-inspector and was booked in a drug case previously. Puneet Kumar was arrested for his role in a dacoity case. The accused know each other for a long time,” sources said, adding: “The walkie-talkie was stolen from a private apartment in Nayandanahalli.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/4-held-stolen-suv-used-for-2-robberies/articleshow/88196063.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

It will also initiate criminal action against those who spread the false message.TRB’s computer-based test for recruiting 1,060 lecturers for government polytechnics began on Wednesday and was held from 2pm to 5pm. An image of handwritten questions circulated on WhatsApp claimed it was posted at 5.13pm and an accompanying audio message said it was released before the exam ended on Wednesday. The exam is on till December 12.A TRB inquiry found thhe released questions belonged to a candidate from Namakkal, identified based on the order. “In the computer based test, the order of questions and choices are not the same for any two candidates. They are shuffled to increase security,” a TRB release said. “The candidate used rough sheets to write down some questions and released it on WhatsApp after the exam. So, it was confirmed that the questions were not leaked before the exam,” it said.The polytechnic lecturers exam conducted in 2017 was cancelled after unearthing a major scam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/trb-to-ban-candidate-for-life-for-releasing-questions-on-social-media/articleshow/88196069.cms||---

The educational institutions too have been asked to follow the practice and encourage students to affix their signatures in certificates and documents in Tamil.The government order, dated November 2, has been issued as per an announcement of minister for industries, Tamil official language and Tamil culture Thangam Thennarasu in the state assembly during the debate on demands for grants for the department. The minister announced that the department would make an effort to bring the practice of writing the initials in Tamil when the names are written in Tamil in government documents, in government offices, colleges and schools. The public would be encouraged to follow this practice.The GO 140 was the outcome of the continuous efforts of the department of Tamil development to promote the usage of Tamil in daily life among government employees and the student community and make it a common practice among the younger generation in the years to come. It was aimed at doing away with the practice of using an English alphabet as initial even if the names were written in Tamil. The initials, first letter of father, mother or name of the native place should be written in Tamil when the government staff writes his or her name in Tamil. It asked the government departments to put up posters to create awareness among the public coming to their respective departments to encourage them to follow this practice, according to the GO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/initials-names-in-govt-docus-to-be-written-in-tamil/articleshow/88196070.cms||---
---||Chennai||‘River interlinking only with states’ consensus’||Chennai: The Union government told Parliament on Monday that Pennar-Cauvery and Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar river interlinking projects would be viable only if there was consensus among the basin states. This comes against the backdrop of Karnataka chief minister Basavaraja S Bommai calling on Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat last week and urging the Centre not to give nod to Tamil Nadu’s Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar intra-state link project till his government’s Mekedatu project gets cleared.Responding to a query from DMK MP Kanimozhi NVN Somu in the Rajya Sabha, Union minister of state for jal shakti Bishweswar Tudu said the detailed project reports of Pennar (Somasila)-Cauvery (Grand Anicut) link and Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar link had been completed and sent to the states concerned in April 2021 and August 2020 respectively. “However, these links would be viable only when there is consensus among the party states for implementation of link projects. No amount has been allocated/sanctioned for the projects,” the Union minister said. As per the detailed project report on Godavari (Inchampalli)-Cauvery (Grand Anicut) link, there would be transfer of 247tmcft or 7,000mcm of water from Godavari to Krishna, Pennar and Cauvery delta. This project has three links, Godavari (Inchampalli)-Krishna (Nagarjunasagar), Krishna (Nagarjunasagar)-Pennar (Somasila) and Pennar (Somasila)-Cauvery (Grand Anicut). The previous AIADMK government urged the Centre to take the last leg of the project at a higher elevation and terminate at Kattalai barrage instead of Grand Anicut.“The Tamil Nadu government has requested for providing 200tmcft of water for meeting the demands of Tamil Nadu under the link project in phase I itself. As per the draft detailed project report, a provision of 84tmcft has been, inter alia, kept for meeting the irrigation, domestic and industrial needs of Tamil Nadu,” the Union minister said. In the sixth governing council meeting of Niti Aayog, former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami demanded that the Centre declare Godavari-Cauvery interlink as a national project to benefit the southern states.Even as the in-principle approval from the Centre for Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar intra-state project is still pending, the previous AIADMK government laid the foundation for the multi-crore project on its own in February last. Administrative sanction was granted to form a “flood diversion canal” from Cauvery (Kattalai barrage) to South Vellar as phase I of Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar project at 6,941 crore in anticipation of funds from NABARD Infrastructure Development Assistance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/river-interlinking-only-with-states-consensus/articleshow/88196071.cms||Julie Mariappan

---||Chennai||Inlet takes sewage from Ambattur lake to lake in Korattur||Chennai: Residents near the Korattur lake and surrounding areas are worried about sewage getting mixed with water coming from the Ambattur lake, fearing it will contaminate groundwater in the area. During monsoon, a senior PWD official said, surplus water from the Ambattur lake drains into the Korattur lake through an inlet that is kept closed during normal times. When there is an increase in rainfall, the authorities open the inlet. This time, Balaji Nagar Residents Welfare Association executive committee chairman G Singaravelu said, the inlet was not closed by greater Chennai Corporation officials even after the rain stopped and sewage was getting mixed with the water. This mix, he said, would help in the proliferation of water hyacinth that would in turn reduce the oxygen levels in the water body and become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The inlet should be immediately closed, he said.Founder of Korattur Aeri Padhukappu Makkal Iyakkam S Sekharan said on that on Wednesday when chief minister M K Stalin inspected the Korattur lake and its surroundings, representatives of the organisation presented him with a five-point memorandum of demands including widening of the inlet carrying water from the Ambattur lake to Korattur, completion of the underground sewage system in Ambattur and removal of encroachments from Korattur lake. The organisation also wants the Korattur lake de-silted and deepened and the height of its weir increased. “If this work is completed, inundation or sewage flowing through roads in Ambattur can be avoided,” he said.S Thirunavakkarasu, a former assistant executive engineer of the PWD, said the lakes at Ambattur, Korattur and Madhavaram are fairly big and now have a large quantity of sewage flowing in. When pollutants, especially metals, percolate into the soil, they will contaminate the groundwater which will in turn pose serious health hazards, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/inlet-takes-sewage-from-ambattur-lake-to-lake-in-korattur/articleshow/88196074.cms||P Oppili

Officials said the lab had also informed the couple first about their test results and delayed informing the corporation. City health officer Dr M Jagadeesan issued the notice to KHM labs in Mannadi, (zone 5 - Royapuram) seeking a response. The couple was about to fly to Dubai and wanted a Covid-19 negative certificate, officials said. Officials sources told TOI that the husband (42) and wife (38) from Kalmandapam in north Chennai had given samples for Covid-19 tests in the lab on December 4. “The couple had tested positive on December 5 but the private lab did not tell the corporation about their results but informed the couple instantly,” official sources said. As a result, the couple absconded and did not quarantine or hospitalize themselves. “When informed on Monday, we verified the register of the private lab only to find that the address only had the name of locality but no door number,” officials added. After locating the right house following searches, officials found the couple hiding inside. “We have admitted them to a private hospital,” officials added. Shamsuddin of KHM labs, said it was the fault of the data-entry operator. MD of the lab Harris Farvez said they had informed the patients about their positive status on sympathetic grounds as they had a flight ticket to cancel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/lab-issued-corpn-notice-for-bungled-covid-data-record/articleshow/88196077.cms||Omjasvin M D

They added that after they are declared to be fit after the treatment, a decision shall be taken to set them free or release them again to appropriate areas where they may survive without any difficulty.The interim order was passed on a plea moved by People For Cattle India for proper upkeep of over 100 dogs on the campus and are lodged in three dog parks.

However, the judge refused to accept the contention.In 2014, Zee Media responded to the suit and said it only reported the deposition of Sampath Kumar made to the Mudgal Committee appointed to probe the scam.

In a counter-affidavit, filed in response to Rajesh Das’ petition to challenging the proceeding and report of the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) on grounds of violation of natural justice, the DGP said, “the FIR was solely based on the complaint made by the victim.” Denying Rajesh Das’ claim that the sexual harassment complaint was motivated with an intention to destroy his career, the DGP wanted the court to dismiss the plea moved by Rajesh Das. He further denied the allegation of violation of principles of natural justice during the probe into the complaint and asserted that all representations made by Rajesh Das were responded to by officers concerned. As to the allegation that authorities refused to provide him a copy of the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) report dated April 8, and list of witnesses, the counter said the DGP office had not received any copy. The report was forwarded to the state government, which, in turn, issued a charge memo, the affidavit said.

Tamil Nadu’s spin trio --- M Siddharth (4-23), R Sai Kishore (3-28) and Washington Sundar (1-27) --- were instrumental in bowling out Karnataka for 122 which was subsequently chased down in 28 overs.Karnataka --- who won the toss and chose to bat --- had a shaky start when their opener R Samarth and No. 3 K Siddharth departed with just 20 on board. Medium-pacers Sandeep Warrier (1-22) and R Silambarasan (1-11) provided the initial breakthroughs for Tamil Nadu. Skipper Manish Pandey (40, 3x4) and Rohan Kadam (37, 1x4) kept Tamil Nadu bowlers at bay with their 67-run stand. The dismissal of Rohan --- cleaned up by Washington in the 23rd over --- turned the tide in Tamil Nadu’s favour. Left-arm spinner Siddharth then struck vital blows --- dismissing Manish and Karun Nair (9). Karnataka failed to recover from those two strikes. Siddharth was well complimented at the other end by Sai Kishore as Karnataka folded up for a below-par total.Chasing 123, B Indrajith (51 n.o, 6x4) and Washington (31 n.o., 3x4) played a key role as their unbeaten 65-run stand helped Tamil Nadu reign supreme.

From around 12% before the pandemic, online sales currently account for more than a fourth of the Swedish furniture retailer's sales in the domestic market, Peter Betzel, CEO & CSO at Ikea India, told TOI. "We have seen all around the world that online sales and online interest have been increasing 70%. It's almost a 30% share of the total turnover," he said. "The trend is here to stay," said Betzel on the eve of opening an 'Ikea City Store' in Worli, Mumbai. City Stores are group a of smaller stores that will be launched by the company to reach more consumers. While only a limited inventory of products at these smaller stores will be available for direct takeaway, others will be home delivered. The move, which signals an omni-channel approach by Ikea, is in sharp contrast to its original global strategy of banking solely on big-format stores, similar to a Walmart in the US. "What has also happened is that we have been speeding up our omni-channel approach in terms of accessibility," said Betzel. Ikea has big plans for 2022, with another City Store scheduled to open in Mumbai, followed by a big-format and a City Store in Bengaluru. Ikea has committed Rs 10,500-crore investment in Indian retail operations and Rs 6,000 crore in Maharashtra by 2030.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ikea-more-than-doubles-online-sales-in-2-years/articleshow/88196120.cms||John Sarkar

The income tax (I-T) officer, in the course of assessment for the financial year 2012-13, had held this gift to be a taxable transaction and had raised a demand of Rs 719 crore. Balaji Trust, a private discretionary trust, was settled (set up) on March 29, 2012 by Shashikant Ruia, with an initial sum of Rs 10,000. On the same date, Essar Investments, that was holding the Essar brand, contributed the brand, trademarks and copyrights to the corpus of the trust as a voluntary gift. The trust became the registered owner of the Essar brand. Subsequently, the trust entered into brand-licensing agreements with Essar Group entities and earned a licence fee for use of the intellectual property. This income was accounted for in the years of receipt under the cash system of accounting. However, the I-T officer held that the value of the Essar brand would be taxable in the hands of the trust in the financial year 2012-13 (the year in which it was gifted to the trust). He was of the view that the definition of income under the I-T Act is very wide. Thus, the receipt of the brand, trademarks and copyrights by the trust was an income, taxable under section 56 (1) as 'Income from other sources'. The I-T officer proceeded to apply the discounted cash flow method and valued the Essar brand at Rs 1,668 crore. He raised a tax demand of Rs 719 crore on Balaji Trust. The trust succeeded in its first level of appeal before the commissioner (appeals) who held that the receipt of the Essar brand was on capital account and could not be characterised as a taxable income. Taking the litigation forward, the tax department submitted additional grounds of appeal to the ITAT. In appeal, the I-T official sought to question whether Essar Investments was the genuine owner of the brand and whether settlement in favour of the trust was a bona fide transaction. The ITAT bench, composed of judicial member Ravish Sood and accountant member S Rifaur Rahman, dismissed this as it was a "complete volte face".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cant-tax-essar-brand-gift-to-ruia-family-trust-itat/articleshow/88196124.cms||Lubna Kably

"I failed to show the appropriate amount of respect and appreciation for the individuals who were affected and for their contributions to Better. I own the decision to do the layoffs, but in communicating it I blundered the execution. In doing so, I embarrassed you," he wrote. "I realise that the way I communicated this news made a difficult situation worse. I am deeply sorry and am committed to learning from this situation and doing more to be the leader that you expect me to be." The firing was all the more surprising because it came a week after the SoftBank-backed lender received $750 million in cash. Better.com has raised over $400 million in equity capital since its inception and is valued at $7 billion. The company has nearly 10,000 employees, of which about a fifth are in India, mostly in Gurgaon. Many in India too slammed the way the layoff was done. RPG Enterprises chairman Harsh Goenka tweeted, "My heart went out to the 900 employees sacked through Zoom by Vishal Garg. Totally wrong! Do it on a one-on-one basis. And in person. And not before Christmas and after a $750-million recent infusion. This is how corporates get a heartless tag!" Garg in his apology went on to say, "We will talk more at our upcoming All Hands meeting about what to expect for the year ahead. I hope you'll join me for the discussion. We are also taking fast steps to make sure we are very transparent and aligned as a company on the goals for 2022, the metrics that matter most, and how we can all work together even better to serve our customers and achieve our mission. I believe in you, I believe in Better, and I believe that working together we can make home-ownership better together." Garg founded Better.com in 2014, following his own experience of buying a home. Better.com provides services including mortgage, real estate, title, and homeowners' insurance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/blundered-in-execution-betters-garg/articleshow/88196126.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

A day after one student from tested positive for Covid-19, Greater Chennai Corporation officials organised a camp to test all other students on campus.“So far, tests have been conducted for 300 students. Of this, nine students tested positive for the viral infection,” health minister Ma Subramanian said on Thursday. Officials said they would test all 763 students on campus, teachers and other staff. “We do saturation testing on campus. Samples of positive patients are sent to the whole genome sequencing lab,” Subramaniam said after visiting the campus with senior health and civic officials.The 10 students who tested positive are asymptomatic and are in quarantine at the government Covid centre on King’s Institute campus.The varsity has suspended physical classes for students of Alagappa College of Technology. Hostel students have been quarantined in their hostel rooms. “Online classes will continue for the next two weeks. Physical classes will resume only after confirmation that there are no new cases among hostel students,” a university official said. Other campuses like College of Engineering, Guindy, continued regular in-person classes on Thursday. The corporation along with the health and revenue departments has called for a meeting on Friday with educational institutions to discuss following Covid protocols. Health secretary J Radhakrishnan said there won’t be any knee jerk reaction following the Covid cluster. The university was told to allow students in batches to hostel messes to maintain social distancing. In most clusters detected in educational institutions, health workers found high transmission among students who met at canteens for lunch or tea. “Students don’t wear a mask in the canteen, sit close to each other and chat. This increases transmission rate,” the health minister said. The department will conduct a high-level meeting with school and higher education departments on guidelines to be followed in hostel messes, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/10-test-ve-on-alagappa-tech-campus/articleshow/88196145.cms||---

The reply presented on December 6, in response to DMK Rajya Sabha MP P Wilson, says that four sites are identified. No reply talks about the Union government including the Sriperumbudur site in the National Infrastructure Pipeline. “The state government of Tamil Nadu has identified four potential sites for development of a second airport in Chennai and has requested AAI to inspect these sites and prepare the feasibility study report,” the reply presented on December 6 said. However, AAI has conducted preliminary study for these sites and also completed feasibility report for the site at Sriperumbudur.The response presented in Parliament does not mention if the current DMK government has given approval for any of these locations for a new airport.In an answer presented in Parliament in July 2021, the ministry of civil aviation said, “State government in November 2019 identified two locations of Mamandur and Parandur. However, they are yet to finalize the site for setting up of the second airport near Chennai.”Wilson said repeating the same set of answers shows that the ministry is not interested in developing a new airport in Chennai.The AIADMK government did not show interest in building an airport in Sriperumbudur and new locations were identified after a delay of nine years. But it was at the end of the term.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/centre-gives-same-old-reply-to-query-on-2nd-city-airport/articleshow/88196147.cms||---

All three patients , one of whom is a child, are recovering normally. It was a race against time as teams coordinated the transport of the organs through Green Corridors in the three cities. A team of more than 60 people lead by the chief surgeon Dr K R Balakrishnan, head of anesthesia Dr Suresh Rao and chief cardiologist Dr Ravikumar were involved in this process. The entire process, right from harvesting and transporting of the organs and successfully transplanting themtook 14 hours.  “Travelling from Chandigarh to Chennai without a direct air connectivity is not an easy task. The team reached Chennai after travelling over 7 hours,” said Dr K R Balakrishnan adding that the cold ischemic time, which is the time between removal of the heart from the donor and implanting it in the recipient was 8 hours. In a release, the hospital said the recipient was very sick in the intensive care awaiting a donor organ for a long time and that the new heart is functioning normally.

There was no talk of an increase in monthly pay in the last two years, and even the government withheld dearness allowance hike for its staff. The recent rain too heavily impacted the livelihood of downtrodden. “The prices of essential commodities, including vegetables, increased manifold. In this situation, if the electricity tariff is raised by 20% as proposed by the electricity board, the living standards of the poor and middle class will be much worse,” Anbumani said.The former Union minister said administrative reforms alone were necessary to make the electricity board profitable. Malpractice and purchase of power at higher rates were the reasons for the losses. “Increasing electricity board’s own power generation, stopping purchase of electricity from private sector altogether and buying more power from the central agencies at lower rates will be the r’ight course of action in today’s scenario to make the board profitable,” the PMK leader said, adding that the state should reduce annual interest of 16,000 paid towards outstanding loans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dont-hike-power-tariff-says-pmk/articleshow/88196151.cms||---

Recently, the Serum Institute of India (SII) has filed an application with the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) regarding approval for a booster dose of Covishield. The Serum Institute cites that there is adequate stock of the Covid vaccine in the country now and a demand for a booster shot is there due to the emergence of new coronavirus variants. The Serum Institute is the first vaccine manufacturing company in India to apply for approval for Covishield as a booster dose. The SEC meeting in this regard will start at 12 pm on Friday. Many experts have also recommended booster doses in India especially after the emergence of new highly transmissible Covid-19 variant Omicron. But the government has not taken any decision so far. However, recently National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation in India (NTAGI) also conducted a virtual meeting regarding the additional dose of Covid-19 vaccines in India, but no consensus was reached on the issue. Meanwhile, SII started shipping the Covishield vaccine from January this year and has crossed the one billion dose landmark in the last week of November. In total country has administered 114.78 crore Covishield vaccines till date. The Union health ministry said India's cumulative vaccination coverage crossed 131 crore landmark milestone on Thursday.

Addressing a ‘Jan-Samvad’ programme at the water resources department’s inspection bungalow at Tarapur in Munger, he said, “Necessary arrangements for teaching up to Class IX and X have been made in all panchayats in the state. Intermediate-level teaching is being done in more than 5,000 panchayats and similar arrangements will be made in the rest of panchayats.” Nitish reached Tarapur to fulfill his promise made during the campaigning for the JD(U) candidate in the recently-concluded assembly byelection in Tarapur constituency. While campaigning for the JD(U) candidate, Rajiv Kumar Singh, who won the byelection, Nitish had told the local people that he would visit Tarapur again after the bypolls to listen to their grievances. Many people who could not get time to speak before the CM were asked to submit their grievances in writing to the officials accompanying him. Prominent demands of the local people included opening of an art research centre at Tarapur in the name of famous artist Nandlal Bose, who was born and brought up at Haveli Kharagpur in Munger district, and upgrading Tetiya Bamber into a full-fledged police station. Locals argued that the foundation stones for an art research centre in the name of Bose were laid way back in 2003, but the centre was yet to come up.

Raising the issue through a supplementary question, he wanted to know if the Union rural development ministry had any specific plan for construction of roads to facilitate easy access of children as well as common people to schools and hospitals situated in the flood-affected areas of north Bihar. He sought to know the total number of schemes being currently run for construction of such roads by the Union rural development ministry besides those planned for future. While seeking the details on the issue, Sinha said thousands of acres of farmland in north Bihar remain submerged almost throughout the year owing to its topography. “It is a double whammy as the affected farmers are able to grow only one crop a year. Waterlogging over long period of time badly impacts the construction of roads, creating hardships for rural children as well as common folk to reach schools and hospitals. Though the rural development belongs to the concurrent list of subjects, the matter is of crucial importance as it affects a large number of rural population,” he said. Interestingly, while Sinha is a native of Begusarai district, Giriraj Singh, who holds the portfolio of the Union rural development and panchayati raj minister, is also member of the Lok Sabha from Begusarai. In his reply, Giriraj informed the member that the phase 1 and phase 2 of Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Nirman Yojna for construction of rural roads, an initiative of the former PM late Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is already complete and phase 3 of the scheme is currently underway. “While phases 1and 2 were aimed at promoting rural connectivity, the phase 3 involves upgradation of the core of the rural network of roads. Altogether 6,113km road has been constructed under the scheme,” Giriraj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/issues-of-waterlogging-in-north-bihar-rural-roads-raised-in-rs/articleshow/88193293.cms||---

The action follows several complaints by affected farmers and locals. Recently, a local farmer, Jasvinder Singh, whose land was to allotted local BJP leader Alok Diwedi for mining under a river training policy, had filed a petition in the Nainital high court, seeking a ban on mining and action against the wrongdoers. Earlier, the logging officer of forest department had written to administration and divisional forest officer of Haridwar apprising them of illegal mining in the forest land, but no action was taken. However, administration swung into action and impounded some vehicles after Jasvinder moved court. The court also asked administration and mining department to submit a report within three weeks. Meanwhile, government has transferred then DFO, Neeraj Sharma. When asked about the matter, DFO, Haridwar, DS Meena told TOI, “I have just assumed office and will conduct a field visit in Ravasn region.

After they get wilted, the flowers that form sacred offerings at temples and shrines are not discarded in trash bins.  Instead, they are usually flung into local water bodies or rivers leading to pollution and irreversible damage to the environment. Students of MS University have now found a practical solution to this problem by converting the spent floral wastes into organic products using simple and inexpensive technologies. Three MSc final year students of MSU’s botany department — Himanshi Ramaiya, Shivani Bhatt and Anjali — have taken up a startup project of managing the temple floral waste which is recycled into organic colours, incense sticks and organic compost. Under Gujarat government’s students’ startup and innovation policy (SSIP), the floral waste from temples in and around Vadodara is collected, dried and later used in powdered form to make value-added products. “After a survey of temples in the city, we started collecting floral wastes directly from the temples. We collected the floral wastes from Ayyappa temple, Sama, Suryeshwar Mahadev temple at Manjalpur and a couple of other temples in the city area. The value-added products have been branded as ‘Phoolansh’,” said Ramaiya. “It not only helps in saving water bodies near the temples from getting contaminated but also adds up to the spiritual value of our products. The products made would be sold to devotees and also the general public. The methodology of processing will also be transferred to those interested,” said Dr Amee Taunk, who has co-mentored the project along with Dr Bhavna Sharma under the mentorship of professor Susy Albert. The project has received a Rs 40,000 grant under the SSIP. Apart from the usual marigolds, roses and seasonal flowers, even ‘billi’ leaves that are offered to Lord Shiva and ‘tulsi’ leaves that accompany most of the ‘prasad’ and floral offerings, are used for making compost. “Flowers collected from temples are brought to a laboratory where they are dried. Later, they are sieved and the finer powder is used for making incense sticks. The remaining coarse particles are used for preparing compost,” said Taunk. “Similarly, after extracting colours, which are used to produce dyes, from wet and dry flower waste, the remaining petals and other material is used for preparing compost,” she said, that the compost prepared acts as a good fertilizer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/startup-taps-hidden-treasure-in-discarded-floral-offerings/articleshow/88193665.cms||Prashant Rupera

The deceased has been identified as Korrakuti Srinivasa Rao (50), a former sarpanch of Pedanemalipuri village associated with the ruling party. Rao suffered severe head injuries in the attack and was rushed to a private hospital in Piduguralla. He slipped into a coma due to excessive bleeding and eventually succumbed to his injuries. Rajupalem police said Rao had a long-running rivalry with Kurra Veeranarayana, a farmer from Polerammagudi village, and suspect that he may have plotted the killing. Rao served as sarpanch of Pedanemalipuri village from 2006 to 2011. His wife Venkayyamma is the current sarpanch of the village. Police said they are yet to ascertain the actual motive behind the crime. A case has been registered under section 302 of IPC (murder) against Veeranarayana, who is absconding. A team has been formed to trace his whereabouts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ex-sarpanch-of-guntur-village-murdered/articleshow/88193687.cms||---

The Mishra brothers have been implicated by CBI in illegal coal mining and cattle smuggling cases. Till reports last came in, Vikas was not discharged from hospital. Vikas, who was out on an interim bail on health grounds, was supposed to appear before a special CBI court in Asansol on Wednesday. Since he did not appear in court, citing health grounds, the CBI said he had flouted the bail condition and pleaded for his custody. The court granted custody of Vikas on Wednesday, following which CBI officers reached the hospital in Kolkata on Thursday afternoon. It is still not clear when and how he will be produced in court. In the Asansol court, Vikas’s lawyer submitted a medical certificate on Wednesday. “He has not flouted any bail condition as he had interim bail was granted to him,” said Shekhar Kundu, Vikas’s lawyer. According to sources, Vikas, already suffering from liver ailments, was admitted to hospital on Tuesday after he complained of severe uneasiness. “He was feeling suffocated, and the oxygen level had dropped. He also had lower respiratory tract infection. He has been suffering from liver-related issues for a long time,” said a source close to Vikas. The hospital declined to comment but sources said had had been admitted with multiple ailments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbi-reaches-hosp-to-arrest-coal-mining-case-accused/articleshow/88194287.cms||Rohit Khanna

Travelling on a tourist visa, Tabassum Rahman came to Kolkata on a Biman Bangladesh flight on Tuesday, where her husband was waiting. They had a flight booked for Delhi, but Rahman was stopped by immigration officers after her statements regarding the purpose of visit were inconsistent. Airport officials said the woman’s husband worked in Austria and the woman wanted to settle with him and so she was even slated for a visa interview at the Austrian Embassy in Delhi. “But the immigration rules do not allow one to undertake any official work while travelling on a tourist visa. Moreover, it was also unclear why she was applying for a Shengen Visa to Austria from India and not from her own country. It is also under investigation if she had planned to make a fake Indian passport while applying for a visa from India,” said an airport official. The woman was questioned for hours and was held under detention at the airport lounge in the upper arrival area for two nights before she was sent back on a Biman Bangladesh flight to Dhaka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bangla-woman-sent-back-after-2-nights-at-airport/articleshow/88194274.cms||---

It has been almost four months since the government allotted Rs 6.90 crore for relaying the synthetic track, but the detailed project report (DPR) of the project is yet to be ready. The track has been in a dilapidated condition for the past several years due to lack of proper maintenance. A meeting convened by mayor M Anilkumar and T J Vinod, MLA, in mid-September 2021 had decided to complete the work on the DPR within a fortnight. As per the decision at the meeting an expert inspected the synthetic track and gave his suggestion within a week. “The holes on the track would be filled with water during rains. So, a strength test is to be conducted before preparing the DPR. The PWD, which is to carry out the work, will be able to bring the engineers required for conducting the strength test only after a couple of months,” an official associated with the project said. Though the authorities decided to conduct the next round of review meeting within two weeks from September 18, it didn’t occur so far. Meanwhile, the PWD is learnt to have informed that the funds allotted will not be sufficient for the entire renovation works. As per the original plans, relaying of the synthetic track and construction of warm up area were the major works. Later, when the expert examined the track, he gave certain suggestions. “Now, the PWD officials say that the work can’t be completed with Rs 6.90 crore,” sources said. During the discussions in September, the cost of relaying the track and constructing warm up area was projected at well below Rs 6.90 crore. So, the meeting decided to use the remaining amount for other projects to upgrade the ground to international standards. The plan was to complete the work immediately after the rainy season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/synthetic-track-work-makes-no-headway/articleshow/88194330.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Business||Can’t tax ‘Essar brand’ gift to Ruia family trust: ITAT||Mumbai: The Mumbai bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has held that the voluntary gift of the ‘Essar brand’ (comprising the brand name, trademarks and copyrights) by Essar Investments Limited to Balaji Trust, set up for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Ruia family members, is not taxable in the hands of the trust. The income tax (I-T) officer, in the course of assessment for the financial year 2012-13, had held this gift to be a taxable transaction and had raised a demand of Rs 719 crore. Balaji Trust, a private discretionary trust, was settled (set up) on March 29, 2012 by Shashikant Ruia, with an initial sum of Rs 10,000. On the same date, Essar Investments, that was holding the Essar brand, contributed the brand, trademarks and copyrights to the corpus of the trust as a voluntary gift. The trust became the registered owner of the Essar brand. Subsequently, the trust entered into brand-licensing agreements with Essar Group entities and earned a licence fee for use of the intellectual property. This income was accounted for in the years of receipt under the cash system of accounting. However, the I-T officer held that the value of the Essar brand would be taxable in the hands of the trust in the financial year 2012-13 (the year in which it was gifted to the trust). He was of the view that the definition of income under the I-T Act is very wide. Thus, the receipt of the brand, trademarks and copyrights by the trust was an income, taxable under section 56 (1) as ‘Income from other sources’. The I-T officer proceeded to apply the discounted cash flow method and valued the Essar brand at Rs 1,668 crore. He raised a tax demand of Rs 719 crore on Balaji Trust. The trust succeeded in its first level of appeal before the commissioner (appeals) who held that the receipt of the Essar brand was on capital account and could not be characterised as a taxable income. It should be noted that the income, which subsequently arose under the licensing agreements, was reported by the trust as its income. The appellate commissioner also disagreed that any tax incidence arose under section 28(iv). This section provides that the value of any benefit arising from a business would be taxable as business income. He stated that receipt of the trademark is not arising during the course of carrying on any business. Taking the litigation forward, the tax department submitted additional grounds of appeal to the ITAT. In appeal, the I-T official sought to question whether Essar Investments was the genuine owner of the brand and whether settlement in favour of the trust was a bona fide transaction. The ITAT bench, composed of judicial member Ravish Sood and accountant member S Rifaur Rahman, dismissed this as it was a “complete volte face” done by the tax department. They also dismissed the charge that the Essar brand was not received by the trust but represented its undisclosed income. The request for fresh computation of its value was also dismissed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cant-tax-essar-brand-gift-to-ruia-family-trust-itat/articleshow/88194819.cms||Lubna Kably
---||Pune||Kin of nearly 60k coronavirus victims file online applications for ex gratia||Pune: Relatives of nearly 60,000 people, who died of Covid, have so far submitted applications on a recently launched state government website seeking an ex gratia of Rs50,000 each. The Maharashtra government had last week launched the website, mahacovid19relief.in, for the Covid victims’ kin to apply for ex gratia. A senior official in the state disaster management department said, “The applications have come from all districts. After scrutinizing the applications, the respective local authorities will start releasing the amount. We should be able to start releasing the amount soon.” Maharashtra has so far registered around 1.41 lakh deaths due to Covid and has to allocate a little over Rs700 crore towards the disbursal of the ex gratia amount. Earlier the government had suggested that the applicants could approach the collectors’ offices for the ex gratia. However, on realizing that this would delay the process, the state government launched the website for the Covid victims’ kin to directly apply for the ex gratia. The applicants can log in the website with the cellphone numbers and have to fill up the details of the deceased, along with their Aadhaar numbers. There is also an option to upload the death certificates and hospital details on the website. The centralised website is directly linked with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “With the Aadhaar card numbers, the government will get all the details of the deceased person. This will ensure that the process is transparent and fast,” the official said.. The families without positive RT-PCR and RAT results and Covid death certificates would also get the ex gratia if the person, for whom the ex gratia is being sought, died within 30 days of being clinically diagnosed with Covid in a hospital. According to the guidelines, all claims must be settled within 30 days of submission of the required documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/kin-of-nearly-60k-coronavirus-victims-file-online-applications-for-ex-gratia/articleshow/88195055.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Business||Flexi sop, safety net for staff, gig workers: HUL||Mumbai: In what could set a trend among large corporates in India, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has introduced employment models that challenge traditional employer-employee dynamics. In a first, the FMCG major has launched two models that offer flexible work arrangements with benefits to both existing employees and gig workers who are associated with it but are not on its payroll. Under ‘U-Work’, HUL employees can choose to be engaged with the company in a flexible way while getting financial security, retirement, and medical benefits. The ‘Open2U’ model, introduced specifically for India, allows gig workers, who are not employed with the company, to work on assignments and get a financial safety net and medical benefits. U-Work covers about 8,000 office-based HUL employees. While employees can apply to be a part of U-Work, the final decision is based on a mutual agreement between the company and the staffer. The two models would operate under an overarching thought process of offering flexible ways of working, which the company terms as ‘Flexi-curity’. HUL’s executive director (HR) Anuradha Razdan told TOI, “During the pandemic, a number of people have been introspective on what they want from life and are keen on getting new and more personalised work experiences. Through ‘Flexi-curity’, we would like to provide opportunities to this rich talent pool that doesn’t force a trade-off between flexibility and security. People want flexibility about when they want to work and how they want to work. At the same time, they want the security of structured pay and benefits. Flexi-curity serves that objective.” India is among the key markets where Unilever has rolled out U-Work. Under this, an employee is required to put in six weeks of work in a year. “Employees who choose to opt for U-Work can design their assignments — how much they want to work and when they want to work. And choose experiences that provide them the security of being an HUL employee with structured compensation, retirement and medical benefits, while giving them the flexibility to explore different personal and professional avenues,” said Razdan. Initially, the percentage of employees opting for working on a flexible-basis is expected to be low. But in the long term, the ratio could be 80:20, where 80% would be in the fixed or full-time employee bracket, while the balance could be in the flexible bracket. Commenting on HUL’s move, Abhijit Bhaduri, an executive coach, said, “The traditional 40-40-40 model of employment has been challenged. People worked for 40 hours per week for 40 weeks a year (approximately) and for 40 years of their lives. This is a prototype of the hybrid workplace for the future.” As 2021 has seen the ‘Great Resignation’, Bhaduri said, “Millennials want to travel, study and work on a wide variety of projects. Some experienced people want to slow down without losing access to financial security. Young parents and caregivers have had to take career breaks to look after their loved ones. Instead of losing this talent pool, Unilever retains access to them through the flex arrangements. Permanent employees can come into the office for a few days and work from any other location on the rest.” Not everyone likes working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Globally, organisations have in the past toyed with the idea of offering extended weekends to employees through a 4-day work week. The UAE recently announced a 4.5-day workweek. Going by the trend of people wanting to work out of their hometowns, Axis Bank last year opened its doors to skilled talent to work with the bank from anywhere through gig contracts. There could be more organisations that could challenge traditional status quos as they also benefit from such arrangements. “As an organisation, we stand to gain by getting access to highly skilled talent across diverse groups, who can work with us on priority areas of the future. In order to retain and engage talent in future, flexibility will be key,” said Razdan. Razdan, however, said U-Work and Open2U are not about a volume game, but about getting access to quality future skills and offering high-quality experiences. “We also want to ensure that we offer a consistent employee experience, irrespective of whether you are working with us on a fixed or flexible basis,” said Razdan. People exploring flexible ways of working cuts across age groups. Razdan said it’s not just the young who are keen on having greater flexibility to work the way they would like since employees across age groups are adopting such flexi-models.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/flexi-sop-safety-net-for-staff-gig-workers-hul/articleshow/88194848.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Nagpur||‘Rawat pushed us to make gun part being imported currently’||Nagpur: During a visit to Sandeep Metalcraft’s stall at the Lucknow defence expo, late chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat prompted the Nagpur company to indigenously develop a fuse fitted in anti-aircraft ammunition. The smart and arm fuses, a key component for the 40 PFFC mm rounds fired from L-70 anti-aircraft guns, are imported at present. “Rawat just dropped in at the stall and to our surprise took interest in each of the products. After looking at one of the products, he asked why don’t we take up the development of fuses for 40 mm PFFC ammunition. He also briefed us in detail about the technicalities required, prompted by which we took up the work,” says Shyam Agrawal, director of Sandeep Metalcraft. The development is at an advanced stage, says Agrawal, who remembers Rawat as a rather approachable General. A medium scale industry located at Hingna, the company makes fuses for ammunition of different calibre. The 40 mm smart and arm fuse ensures that the ammunition bursts only after reaching a certain distance. This ensures safety of the personnel, explained a source. “It was only because of Rawat’s insistence that we took up the job,” he says. Rawat spent a lot of time at the stall and discussed about each component in depth. “It was surprising for an officer of such a to remember minute details,” says Agrawal. The fuse would be soon put up for final approval, and may be brought into use by the ordnance factories. Dushyant Deshpande from Vidarbha Defence Industries Association (VDIA) said he had met Rawat twice with former master general ordnance late Lt General Ravindra Thodge. “The participation of medium and small industries would not have been possible without CDS’s contribution. He was always keen to promote private entrepreneurs in this sector.. This eventually led to private sector contribution in making products like swarm drones, loitering ammunition, simulators and other equipment,” said Deshmukh. Deshmukh now heads the VDIA, which was founded by Thodge. VIDA is working on promotion of defence manufacturing sector and creating skilled manpower for it. CDS was also keen to visit Nagpur for VDIA’s inauguration and was ready to extend any help needed by entrepreneurs, Deshmukh said. Former vice air chief Air Marshal Shirish Deo has formed JSR Dynamics, engaged in developing glide bombs and other key equipment. Deo said he had long discussions about his post retirement plans and setting up the industry with the CDS, who encouraged him. The CDS was like a mentor and the entire set up today is due to his motivation, Deo said. Last month, Rawat had also visited Nagpur to witness prototype of indigenous drones and loitering ammunition, and Economic Explosives Limited (EEL), a subsidiary of Solar Group. Chairman of Solar Group Satyanaraan Nuwal said Rawat was keen on reducing dependence on imports by promoting Indian industries. He had a dynamic personality but was ready to help industries and ready to listen to their issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rawat-pushed-us-to-make-gun-part-being-imported-currently/articleshow/88195064.cms||Shishir Arya

Kumar, who had floated Bharatiya Bahujan Parivartan Party in 2006, said his decision to merge his party with RLD was influenced by the latter’s clout in west UP and he felt it was the best party to defeat BJP. “We decided to merge with RLD because we feel it can defeat BJP. All sections of the society are fed up with the BJP. We are from west UP and RLD is strong there. We like Jayant Chaudhary’s attitude, he is a youth leader and respects everyone,” Kumar said. Kumar said that even though his party had supported BSP in 2021 zila panchayat and pradhan elections, he felt somewhere that BSP did not acknowledge their contribution. “We did not field our candidates because we hoped that Behenji would give us some attention, but we felt that BSP did not need us. I have been a member of BAMCEF till 2006 but maybe there was some shortcoming in us because Behenji used to keep saying that no family member would get any post in the party. However, we wanted to work and persisted and are now here,” he said. Our party had contested some seats in 2017 UP assembly elections, Delhi MCD elections and local body elections in UP, Kumar added. He, however, praised Mayawati’s work and acknowledged that she had worked hard to give recognition and voice to Dalits across the country and he had seen her struggle to get to where she is at present. “However, it is now our responsibility to ensure that the voice of Dalits becomes powerful and we are doing that,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mayas-nephew-prabuddha-merges-his-party-with-rld/articleshow/88195540.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Congress pulls out Bhoyar at nth hour, backs independent||Nagpur: In a dramatic twist on the eve of the Nagpur local authority constituency polls (MLC), the Congress party changed its candidate Ravindra Bhoyar, who had switched over from the BJP last month, and decided to support independent candidate Mangesh Deshmukh. BJP has the formidable Chandrashekhar Bawankule, former state energy minister, as its candidate. Congress vice president Mohan Joshi’s release said that Bhoyar, a four-time BJP corporator, has expressed inability to contest the elections. All eligible Congress voters and those from the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituents – NCP and Shiv Sena – have been asked to take a note of the change. Bhoyar told TOI that he was not upset over the development and would vote for Deshmukh as directed by the party. The development comes as a major embarrassment for state Congress president Nana Patole and state animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar. They had snatched Bhoyar, a hardcore RSS worker, assuring the high command of a victory on the lines of the graduate constituency elections last year. Congress had then won a seat held by the BJP for 58 years. Congress netas told TOI that the last-minute candidate switch would severely dent their prospects in next year’s civic polls. “I was given respect by Congress which granted me a ticket 17 days back. Now, if the party tells me to support an independent, I will follow its directives. I am not upset, but not happy as well,” said Bhoyar. Bhoyar refused to comments on rumours that he had failed to win over even a single BJP corporator or bring in the required funds for the polls. At a Congress party meeting on Wednesday, its netas and activists demanded the ouster of Bhoyar. It was attended by Patole, guardian minister Nitin Raut, Kedar, city chief Vikas Thakre and others. After deliberations, the proposal to replace Bhoyar was sent to the party head quarters in Delhi. Patole himself rushed to Delhi on Thursday morning to meet Congress general secretary Mukul Wasnik and All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary and party in-charge for Maharashtra, HK Patil to apprise them of the development. He finally managed to convince the leaders to drop Bhoyar’s candidature and support an independent. BJP netas had been speculating about Bhoyar’s last-minute withdrawal from the day he switched over to Congress which had dismissed it as rumours. BJP city chief Pravin Datke said Thursday’s development is an embarrassment to Congress. “Their leadership needs to introspect as the party was unable to find a suitable candidate and had to depend on a former BJP member. We had expected this to happen,” he said. According to party insiders, the rebellion against Bhoyar started on the day he was given the B form to contest the elections. Everyone was opposed to him and wanted either former minister Rajendra Mulak or senior corporator Prafull Gudadhe to contest the MLC elections. However, Kedar and Patole were confident that Bhoyar would help them turn the tide against BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/congress-pulls-out-bhoyar-at-nth-hour-backs-independent/articleshow/88194901.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Junior doctors across the country have been on protest since November 27 under the aegis of Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) over delay in NEET PG 2021 counselling and subsequent admission of new batch of resident doctors for the current academic session. The JDA-Bihar had joined the stir to express solidarity with the national body of junior doctors. The protest in form of work boycott had hit the OPD services at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH). However, PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur said senior doctors were present in all departments to treat patients. “The emergency and indoor patient units ran as usual. The protesting junior doctors staged demonstration on the PMCH campus,” he added.

---||Patna||Nitish Kumar: Centre has agreed to increase fertilizer supply||PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday said the Centre has agreed to increase the quantity of fertilizer supplied to the state and also keep the fertilizer availability maintained during the rabi sowing season which is at its peak. The rabi crops include wheat, winter maize, pulses, oilseeds and potato. “The fertilizer supply to the state will not only be increased, but remain sustained,” the CM said after reviewing fertilizer availability in the state at a meeting. The CM said he had personally taken up the matter with the Centre, which has assured that supply of fertilizer to the state will be increased. Meanwhile, Nitish has asked the officials of the agriculture department to remain extra cautious to ensure that the farmers do not face any problem in buying fertilizer that they needed. The officials have also been asked to ensure that the retailers sell fertilizer at their proper marked prices and no irregularities are committed in their distribution anywhere in the state. The CM said the rabi sowing season has been going on, and it must be everybody’s concern to ensure that the farmers do not face any problem, as the priority was to keep the production and productivity of crops maintained at the benchmarks that the state has achieved. Earlier, at the review meeting held at the Sankalp auditorium of the CM’s official residence, agriculture department secretary N Sarwan Kumar presented the details about the state’s requirement of different varieties of fertilizer, their allotment and supply and availability during the rabi sowing season. The fertilizer required are urea, potash-based DAP and NPK, among others. The department’s secretary said attempts would soon be made to encourage the farmers to shift to other varieties like the mix of urea and NPK in proper ratio. “Alternatively, they could also shift to the single super phosphate (SSP) variety, which is also cheap. The advertisements to be issued by the department will refer to these and pricing aspects of the fertilizer,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-centre-has-agreed-to-increase-fertilizer-supply/articleshow/88193508.cms||Abhay Singh

The man, around 40 years of age, succumbed to his injuries at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JLNMCH). Panic prevailed in the area after the blast near the rail track on Bhagalpur-Jamalpur railway section under the Nathnagar police station area around 7.45am. Locals said the sound of the blast was so intense that glass windowpanes of nearby premises also got damaged. The railway police and the district administration have started an inquiry into the blast. “The blast occurred at the spot close to the rail track,” said a police officer. GRP in charge Arvind Kumar said investigations have already begun. “The unidentified person, who was grievously injured in the blast, was rushed to the JLNMCH where he died in course of treatment,” he said. Superintendent of railway police at Jamalpur, Aamir Jawed, the incident was being probed from different angles. “It might be the case of hiding of bomb by local criminals.

They claim that the ongoing wedding season has been smooth so far. Nishant Soni, the managing director of a wedding planning agency, told this reporter, “This year’s wedding season has not been affected by Covid yet. However, if the cases rise again, a lockdown-like situation may come. We are in a wait-and-see situation.” Hotel owners and employees are also analysing the Covid situation. Nisha, the employee of a posh hotel near Gandhi Maidan, said, “The wedding business has certainly been profitable this year. We are, anyway, keeping tabs on the Covid scenario.” Saurav, the employee of another hotel in the city, claimed that many wedding-related bookings had been made by people. “We just hope that Omicron does not hit our business,” he said. On the other hand, Pawan Kumar, the manager of a hotel on Fraser Road, claimed that the threat of Omicron had prompted some people to postpone their weddings. “There is a lot of confusion because many of our clients are not giving us confirmed dates for final wedding-related bookings,” he added. Echoing similar views, Bhushan Kumar, who runs a banquet hall in Doctors’ Colony, said, “Omicron has already cast a shadow over the wedding season. Only a few bookings have been made for January so far.” Vikash Kumar, the manager of another banquet hall in Hanuman Nagar, rued, “Almost five customers would make wedding-related inquiries every day before Omicron cases were reported in India. The situation has changed now.” A wedding organizer, Ashwani, pointed out that many people would want their D-Day to be a low-key affair in the post-Covid era. Meanwhile, Madan Mohan Jha, the president of the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee, whose son’s wedding was on Thursday, said, “We are taking all the safety measures.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/omicron-threat-puts-january-weddings-in-a-quandary/articleshow/88193194.cms||---
---||Business||Rupee faces year-end pressure, ends at 75.52||Mumbai: The rupee slipped to a 16-month low of 75.60 against the US dollar in intraday trade as some foreign investors booked profits ahead of the year-end. The domestic currency opened at 75.45 and came under pressure following a sustained demand for dollars. It finally closed at 75.52, down 6 paise from its previous close of 75.46. According to a report by IFA Global, foreign investors are cautious ahead of the release of US inflation data on Friday. A sharper increase in prices in the US increases the risk of interest rates rising there. Higher interest rates would cause money to move back into US treasuries, triggering an appreciation of the dollar. Foreign banks bought US dollars to cover their existing bets placed in favour of the rupee, ahead of the end of the calendar year. This dragged the domestic currency. Dealers are also watchful of the equity markets as some of the large anchor investors in recent mega IPOs complete their one-month lock-in. Results of a survey conducted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which were released on Thursday, indicate that economists expect the Indian rupee to remain stable within the narrow range of 74.70–75.00 against the US dollar till the second quarter of financial year 2022-23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rupee-faces-year-end-pressure-ends-at-75-52/articleshow/88194837.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Court seeks clarity on polls in capital villages||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Thursday directed the state government to clarify whether villages under Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) are being considered as part of urban local body or continue to function as panchayats. If the villages have become a part of urban local body, elections should be held in accordance with the law as the CRDA Act has now been restored, the court said. Hearing a petition filed by one K Koteswara Rao seeking directions to the government to conduct elections in capital region villages, the court directed the government file an affidavit within a week.  Arguing on behalf of the state election commission, senior counsel P Veera Reddy said they have written a letter to the government to conduct elections, which said it is not ready to conduct elections in view of pending cases. Arguing on behalf of the government, Kasa Jagan Mohan Reddy said capital villages by virtue of CRDA Act would come under an urban local body and conducting elections for panchayatas would not arise. He said there are certain deficiencies in the Act as grama sabhas are not held in villages. The government is working on rectifying those mistakes, he added. Considering the arguments, Justice Battu Devanand said the SEC should act independently in conducting elections. The court further observed that the state government cannot postpone the election indefinitely citing technical reasons and directed the government to submit details on the status of capital villages in view of restoration of CRDA Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/court-seeks-clarity-on-polls-in-capital-villages/articleshow/88194057.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The decision comes at a time when markets regulator Sebi has been actively pursuing listed companies to have strict ESG disclosure standards. Ind-Ra will look into 14 different factors under its ESG framework, it said, which include a company’s greenhouse gas emissions, energy & water management processes, community & labour relations, ownership & board structure, and time of financial disclosures. Under this framework, Ind-Ra would “transparently and consistently communicate both the relevance and materiality of ESG elements to the rating decision”, it said in a release. “The E, S and G relevance can be both positive and negative and will be sector based and entity specific. The disclosures are drawn from Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s (SASB’s) Global Sustainability Framework with a total of 14 factors (five for environmental, five for social and four for governance). These factors are fundamental factors in the ESG journey of any entity and would help Ind-Ra to make the disclosures specific wherever these have a relevance to the rating.” In the last few years, Sebi chairman Ajay Tyagi has time and again reminded the business community that ESG compliance for all of its regulated entities is one of its top priorities. On December 3, in his speech at the inauguration of the Arun Duggal ESG Centre for Research and Innovation, IIM-Ahmedabad, Tyagi had said that ESG as a concept was not new. However, a series of climate-driven disasters in recent times, like unexpected floods, wildfires, and economic & social disruptions “emanating from the Covid pandemic appear to have driven home the importance of ESG as a critical component for long-term business resilience, making ESG the buzzword in the investment ecosystem”. As investors have become more conscious about ESG-related issues and the pressure on corporates to focus on ESG has increased, “this has led to increased investor interest and demand for ESG reporting, ESG ratings and ESG-related products”, the Sebi chief had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ind-ra-ratings-to-have-esg-factor/articleshow/88194778.cms||---
---||Business||Record Rs 11,005cr mutual fund SIP inflows in Nov||Mumbai: Monthly inflows through the systematic investment plan (SIP) route reached a new high in November to over Rs 11,000 crore as retail investors continued to put their money in mutual funds (MFs) through this. The record monthly inflows came despite a volatile equity market during the month with the number of outstanding SIPs now at 4.8 crore, also an all-time peak. Since the start of the current fiscal, monthly SIP flows have shown a secular rise, data from MF industry trade body AMFI showed. From Rs 8,569 crore in April 2021, this has now risen to Rs 11,005 crore, a rise of 28%. The number of outstanding SIPs has also shown a similar rise month over month, the AMFI data showed. According to AMFI chief executive N S Venkatesh, despite rising uncertainty owing to the feared third wave of the pandemic and extreme equity market volatility, retail investors continue to benefit and hence also stick to trusting the disciplined SIP mode of savings in mutual funds. Last month’s numbers showed that the total assets of the MF industry had hit an all-time high at Rs 37.3 lakh crore, although the month-on-month rise was a modest Rs 500 crore. November data also showed that equity-oriented schemes recorded a net inflow of Rs 11,615 crore, more than double the October figure of Rs 5,215 crore. This was the ninth consecutive month of net inflows for equity schemes, said Morningstar India associate director (manager - research) Himanshu Srivastava. According to him, the correction in the stock market in November provided investors a good investment opportunity and hence the higher flows in these funds. Most investors found the market correction as a good entry point and many preferred to stay invested, which was evident from the low redemption amount of Rs 17,476 crore, compared to Rs 23,456 crore in October. This highlights the positive sentiment among investors, Srivastava wrote in a note. Industry players also pointed out that net inflows of about Rs 53,000 crore in liquid funds reveals an unease about the equity markets among large investors. “It is no surprise that dynamic funds — the ones which switch between debt and equity based on valuation parameters — got the maximum allocation in November,” said Motilal Oswal MF head (products) Umang Thaker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/record-rs-11005cr-mutual-fund-sip-inflows-in-nov/articleshow/88194766.cms||---

The move by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) comes in wake of a recent incident in Risalagadda where the decomposed body of a man was found inside a water tank. HMWS&SB managing director M Dana Kishore reviewed the security arrangements at water reservoirs on Thursday. “Entry of outsiders has been restricted at all the reservoirs. For round-the-clock security, 600 CCTVs would be installed and 100 private security personnel and 200 HMWSSB officials would be deployed. Flying squads will also be constituted,” said HMWS&SB managing director M Dana Kishore. Of 378 reservoirs located within GHMC limits, 100 reservoirs are located on the premises of HMWS&SB O&M Divisions with round-the-clock security. Security will now be tightened at the remaining 278 reservoirs too. The HMWSSB official instructed officials to keep the gates at the reservoirs locked and to install ‘no entry’ signboards to warn trespassers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-reservoirs-to-have-24-hr-security/articleshow/88194329.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Speedster’s speed-demon sermon after ‘conversion’||KOLKATA: A biker and Instagram influencer, who used to boast on social media about stunts and high-speed rides and was recently penalized by Bidhannagar police for rash driving, is now the face of a safe-driving campaign being carried out by the force. A reformed Md Shakeeb is now a motivational speaker who educates bikers on the perils of rash driving. A second-year student of BCom at Bhawanipur Education Society, Shakeeb who goes by Mad Pilot on Instagram, was booked by Bidhannagar cops last week when he posted a photograph of the speedometer of his Kawasaki Ninja 650 that read 184kmph while riding along New Town’s Main Arterial Road. The cops found his bike’s registration number from a post, tracked him and prosecuted him before counselling him about the dangers of rash driving. “He seemed like a gentleman who had been swayed by the pressure of virtual performance on social media. We made him understand the dangers of rash driving and he promised to never speed again,” said an official. Cops realized he has a large number of followers on Instagram and decided to use that to their advantage — they roped him in as a motivational speaker for the annual road safety awareness campaign. On Thursday, he was seen riding his green superbike with a helmet on at less than 10kmph on the same New Town stretch. Another youth riding pillion held up placards that read “Drive slow, save life” and “Ride bike with a helmet on”. “I have learnt my lesson and will never ride at a high speed again. I am thankful to the cops for giving me the privilege of becoming a part of the road-safety drive. I am excited about it and will continue to spread the message of safe driving on social media,” said Shakeeb (21), a resident of Park Street. Shakeeb’s father is a realtor in the area and he had got the bike as a birthday present from his mother last year. Since then, he has been creating videos on Instagram about his rides across the city and other areas. “I have always been a safe rider and never ride without proper gear. But I occasionally get carried away. During one such adrenalin rush, I rode at a very high speed and shared it on social media. However, I am apologetic for such foolishness and have even deleted the post,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/speedsters-speed-demon-sermon-after-conversion/articleshow/88194267.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The HC has also sought a compliance report for the same. HAM radio operators had played a crucial role in securing his release and ensuring he got adequately compensated. The division bench comprising Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Rajarshi Bharadwaj ordered the state to transfer Rs 5 lakh to the account of Dipak Joshi (official name in court records) within six weeks. “Dipak Joshi remained in detention without trial for almost 41 years. Hence, in view of previous proceedings in this Court, the issue of awarding compensation to the said person who has suffered such a long detention, arises. Counsel for High Court has referred to the West Bengal Correctional Services Prisoners (Unnatural Death Compensation) Scheme, 2019, and has submitted the maximum compensation payable under the said scheme is Rs 5 lakh and, taking a clue from the scheme, the maximum compensation as payable under the scheme should be paid to Dipak Joshi,” the order said. He is currently back in Nepal. A school teacher in Lumbak village, Joshi got embroiled in a murder case during a visit to Darjeeling four decades ago. He had come after being promised a job in the Army, but the person who made the promise allegedly made him commit a murder. Word reached HAM radio operators in Kolkata, especially its vice-president Hirak Sinha, who then contacted Nepal Radio Club. Members located Timsina’s mother Manomaya Devi in Lumbak village. She pleaded with Nepal consulate to be reunited with her son. West Bengal State Legal Services Authority got his mental health evaluated and it was found his IQ was on a par with that of a 10-year-old, following which a conclusion was drawn that he was unfit to stand trial. The division bench of Chief Justice Thottathil B Radhakrishnan and Justice Aniruddha Roy asked he be handed over to his relativeand his return facilitated with the help of Nepal consulate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/62-yr-old-nepal-man-who-spent-41-yrs-in-state-jail-to-get-rs-5l-compensation/articleshow/88194298.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

This expressway is expected to bring down travel time between the two cities to one and half hours. One of the new features of this expressway would be 14 EV charging centres to ensure EV drivers do not face any charging issues while driving on this stretch. The Central government proposed these centres under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicles (FAME) phase II. Officials are confident that the 118-km road will be thrown open for public by the 2022 Dasara. In his reply to questions raised by MPs Rebati Tripura and Anurag Sharma in the ongoing Lok Sabha session, Union minister of state for heavy industries Krishan Pal Gurjar informed that under FAME phase II, 184 EV charging stations are proposed on nine expressways / corridors including Mysuru-Bengaluru expressway. No such stations are proposed on any other highways of the state. According to the documents shared by the minister, till now under FAME scheme, 48 EV charging stations have been set up in the state. Another 172 stations will be set up across the state. Jayavibhava Swamy, MD, Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation Ltd said CESC Mysore has been asked to set up 10 charging stations in its jurisdiction (Mysuru and Mandya districts). “We have written to the National Highway Authority seeking sites to open the EV charging stations,” he said. “We are planning to set up these EV charging stations near restaurants, toll plazas, etc where vehicles stop,” he added. Swamy said CESC Mysore is planning to work with resident welfare associations, clubs, etc to install the EV charging stations. “We are charging just Rs 5 per unit of electricity used for EV charging. We are planning to hold a meeting with all stakeholders on popularising setting up of EV charging stations in their premises in the next few days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/bluru-mysuru-expressway-to-get-14-ev-charging-stations/articleshow/88194029.cms||Shrinivasa M

Government pleader YN Vivekananda sought time to submit additional details over the ongoing developments. Three petitions were filed challenging GO 59 issued by the government allotting police duties to women secretaries. The petitioners alleged that the GO was in contravention with police recruitment board and women secretaries cannot be given police duties. Recruitment of police personnel must be done through the recruitment board as per law, the petitioners said, and also contended decision to give police uniforms to women secretaries. Vivekananda said the government is reconsidering the impugned GO and further details are yet to be obtained. He sought time for clarity to evolve and submit the same before the court. The counsel for the petitioner requested the bench to record the submissions of the government pleader. Vivekananda contended the request, saying he is only seeking time for adjournment and requested not to record any of his submissions as there is no clarity on the issue yet. Considering the arguments, the bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice B S Bhanumati posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-rethinking-its-order-on-women-police-hc-told/articleshow/88194042.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The agency concerned was supposed to pay the corporation Rs 66 lakh from August 25, 2016 to August 24, 2019. An order to this effect was issued by the deputy secretary of UDHD on December 6 to the municipal commissioner M K Meena. Meena said the mayor and deputy mayor were now not entitled to sign papers and the seven members of empowered standing committee have also been unseated with immediate effect. Exemption of such a large amount to the agency put the corporation at a financial loss and it was opposed by a section of ward councillors, who represented before the Darbhanga divisional commissioner on August 1, 2019 demanding action against those involved in the ‘toilet scam’. The then commissioner asked a senior officer to investigate the issue and the officer found the charges true and submitted his report to the commissioner, who forwarded it to the UDHD on October 26, 2019. Later the members were served show-cause notices and asked to explain their position on the issue. They submitted their explanation to the department on September 22 this year. However, the UDHD rejected their explanation and ordered unseating of mayor, deputy mayor and seven members of the standing committee on December 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/toilet-scam-darbhanga-mayor-deputy-mayor-unseated/articleshow/88193283.cms||Binay Kumar Jha

He, however, added children who have so far not been vaccinated and elderly people with comorbidities are more susceptible to the new variant of the virus. Dr Singh said reports coming from the medical world indicated that myalgia (muscle pain) and fatigue were the main symptoms of the Omicron infection, followed by fever, sore throat and cough. “As these are very common health issues mostly neglected by patients, they give the virus more ample of time of incubation and become stronger enough to invade other parts of the body. Elderly people with comorbidities like hypertension and high blood sugar are more prone because their antibody level usually becomes inadequate to fight such mutant viruses,” he said. Omicron is a variant with higher infective ability and it may spread faster than the previous variants of the Covid, Dr Singh added. “However, if the Covid protocols are followed strictly and children inculcated, the impact of this virus will decline considerably. Though there is lack of medical literature on it, the new variant may infect even the vaccinated people due to spike protein mutations. It is thus called the variant of concern,” he said, adding all departments of AIIMS-P have been put on alert and its Covid wards made ready to face the new threat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/children-elderly-people-at-high-risk-from-omicron-doctor/articleshow/88193170.cms||VK Tripathi

Sinha is currently posted in Darbhanga. Four separate teams carried out simultaneous searches at Sinha’s Gola Road and Magistrate Colony residences in Patna, his ancestral house at Ratanpur village under the Mufassil police station in Bhojpur district and office and residential premises in Darbhanga. He was earlier posted as the district transport officer of Aurangabad and also in Rohtas and Chhapra. EOU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan said it was found that Sinha owned assets in excess of his known sources of income. “A case was lodged against him and search orders were obtained from the vigilance court. During the raid on Thursday, the team seized the documents related to his bank accounts, investments and insurances details, which he did not show while giving details of his legitimate sources of income,” he said. Khan added the DA amount amassed by Sinha might increase. “This investigation is connected to an illegal sand mining case. Sinha’s name had cropped up during the inquiry by EOU team when he was posted as Aurangabad DTO,” Khan said. A DA case was lodged against Sinha on Wednesday with the EOU police station in Patna under Section 13 (criminal misconduct by a public servant) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Special teams of EOU were formed under the deputy SP after obtaining a search warrant from the court concerned on Thursday. During the search operation, passbooks and important documents of several bank accounts were recovered. “The team has found that deposits of around Rs 10 lakh had been made recently in the new bank accounts. Evidence of transfer of funds from different sources in his bank accounts was also found,” Khan said. He added around Rs 36 lakh was found deposited in the bank accounts of Sinha’s wife on various dates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/eou-raids-premises-of-former-dto-unearths-da-worth-rs-54l/articleshow/88193211.cms||Faryal Rumi

She was in the city for the release of Chandigarh Congress committee’s chargesheet against “six years of misrule of the BJP at MC” at her party’s office in Sector 35 on Thursday. Speaking on the occasion, Alka Lamba said, “The double engine arrangement of the BJP with government at the Centre and power at MC has crashed. The civic conditions of the city have become miserable.” She further stated that the city was no longer being seen as ‘City Beautiful’ with its ranking slipping to 66th spot. “There is no arrangement of waste disposable. Heavy burden of taxes has been imposed on people. Stray cattle are roaming with absolute freedom on city roads. This was not the Chandigarh that we knew. BJP is leaving no stone unturned to bring a bad name to a city which was known internationally for its beauty and architecture,” she said. The Union government grants to the city have come down significantly. This shows that the BJP government in Delhi is simply not interested in the growth and welfare of the city. The current corporation has failed to get its rightful share and grants allocated by the Delhi finance commission out of the UTs' revenues, she maintained. Subhash Chawla, president of the Chandigarh Congress, said in the last five years the BJP had miserably failed to fulfill the promises it made in what they called their 'vision document'. It has breached the trust of the people of the city. Chandigarh Congress has resolved to bring back the lost glory of the city, he added. .

Chaudhary told this newspaper here on Thursday that the education department is monitoring all the educational institutions in the state and has alerted the officials and heads of institutions to take all precautionary measures to ensure the safety of students. “All private schools have been asked to operate in hybrid mode by conducting classes in both offline as well as online mode,” the minister said, adding that the government would not take any risk with the lives of children, hence, if the situation worsens, the educational institutions would shift completely to online mode. “A final call in this matter will be taken by the chief minister following a meeting of the crisis management group,” he said. Meanwhile, all the educational institutions have been asked to follow Covid-19 protocols and ensure thorough cleanliness and sanitisation of the entire campus, including classrooms, playgrounds, libraries and neighbourhoods. “Students should not come to the school without wearing face masks and must wash their hands regularly and use sanitizers. Social distancing must be maintained at all costs,” the minister said. Noted gynaecologist Dr Punam Raman pointed out that even though Omicron is not as grave as delta variant in causing multi-organ failure, but if mutates again, a very deadly variant may emerge soon, endangering the lives of millions of people. Dr Raman suggested that the government must not allow any relaxation in the safety protocols and take necessary steps for strengthening its oxygen manufacturing and supply system. Paediatrician Dr Arun Shah also observed that since vaccination in children below 18 years of age has not so far been introduced in the country, there are chances of surge in infections among them. “All schools must be shut down if there is an increase in the number of cases and vaccination in children should be initiated,” he said, adding that the government should also think of administering the third booster dose of vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/stay-alert-ensure-safety-of-kids-education-minister-to-schools/articleshow/88193160.cms||B K Mishra
---||Mumbai||Delta’s ‘descendants’ outdo even Delta in Mumbai samples||MUMBAI: It isn’t Omicron or Delta, but Delta’s descendants that are the common Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2 variants in circulation in Mumbai at the moment, according to results of BMC’s fifth genomic sequencing exercise released on Thursday. The sequencing, carried out at BMC’s genetic laboratory in Kasturba Hospital, found the Delta variant in 11% of the 221 Covid-19 patients from Mumbai studied. The remaining 89% showed Delta Plus or A.Y.x sublineages and less than 1% (two cases) had Omicron. In the four sequencing exercises carried out since August, Delta was most dominant, accounting for 70-80% of samples. “But now Delta derivatives appear to be more in circulation in Mumbai. The clinical symptoms of positive patients bear testimony to the fact that Delta is either getting weaker or the population has developed immunity against it,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. None of the 221 patients died, and most of the hospitalised patients had mild symptoms. Experts said phasing out of the Delta variant isn’t surprising. “The proportion of Delta derivatives have been increasing steadily. We can state that the second wave has declined and only the unvaccinated are getting hospitalized,’’ said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19. Vellore-based virologist Dr T Jacob John said the change is unlikely to affect the spread. Mumbai registers 150-200 cases daily. “Delta derivatives have, after all, come from the same base which is Delta. As is the nature of viruses, there are bound to be some mutations, but derivatives are unlikely to cause a huge shift,” he said. Moreover, as the second wave in India was caused by the Delta variant, the majority have “sort of exposure” to the sub-lineages too, he added. However, Dr Rahul Pandit, another member of the state Covid-19 task force, said Delta derivatives weren’t totally harmless as his ICU in Fortis Hospital, Mulund still gets a few critically ill patients. While Omicron had a tiny presence in the fifth genome sequencing exercise, experts believe it will slowly grow in proportion. “Delta will be replaced by Omicron steadily in weeks to come. Whether it will drive people to hospitals or cause mild illnesses remains to be seen,” said John. Dr Joshi said, "The present Omicron cases in Mumbai and the rest of the country are related to travel. If and when the variants gets into the community, we will see newer trends. At present, there is no cause for panic.’’ Incidentally, only one of the 221 patients who received the first dose and only 26 fully vaccinated patients needed hospitalizations. Twelve of the 47 people who did not receive a single dose of the vaccine had to be hospitalized. Almost 64% of the patients were in the 21-60 age group, while 54 (25%) were in the 61-80 age group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/not-omicron-or-delta-more-delta-derivatives-in-mumbai-samples/articleshow/88195071.cms||Malathy Iyer

Water resources department officials were told to ensure that reservoirs are able to handle flash floods without causing damage to properties and lives of people. The recent flash floods caused deaths and devastation in the four Rayalaseema districts and Nellore in south coastal Andhra. The officials told the CM that a high-level committee comprising senior officials from various departments has been set up under the chairmanship of the chief secretary. An expert committee has also been formed with specific domain specialists from top institutions like the IIT and headed by the engineer-in-chief of water resources department, which are looking into reports submitted by previous governments on various projects and their maintenance. The high-level team led by the chief secretary is focusing on automation system that would link real-time data to the command control room, which can alert flash floods and heavy rains. The committee is identifying areas where there could be property damage and loss of life if a large amount of water is released. With regard to recruitments, the chief minister was informed that proposals are afoot to recruit additional staff for the maintenance of all major and medium reservoirs and barrages, as well as for water regulation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/officials-told-to-ensure-safety-of-all-reservoirs/articleshow/88193684.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Business||Flexi sop, safety net for staff, gig workers: HUL||MUMBAI: In what could set a trend among large corporates in India, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has introduced employment models that challenge traditional employer-employee dynamics. In a first, the FMCG major has launched two models that offer flexible work arrangements with benefits to both existing employees and gig workers who are associated with it but are not on its payroll. Under 'U-Work', HUL employees can choose to be engaged with the company in a flexible way while getting financial security, retirement, and medical benefits. The 'Open2U' model, introduced specifically for India, allows gig workers, who are not employed with the company, to work on assignments and get a financial safety net and medical benefits. U-Work covers about 8,000 office-based HUL employees. While employees can apply to be a part of U-Work, the final decision is based on a mutual agreement between the company and the staffer. The two models would operate under an overarching thought process of offering flexible ways of working, which the company terms as 'Flexi-curity'. HUL's executive director (HR) Anuradha Razdan told TOI, "During the pandemic, a number of people have been introspective on what they want from life and are keen on getting new and more personalised work experiences. Through 'Flexi-curity', we would like to provide opportunities to this rich talent pool that doesn't force a trade-off between flexibility and security. People want flexibility about when they want to work and how they want to work. At the same time, they want the security of structured pay and benefits. Flexi-curity serves that objective." India is among the key markets where Unilever has rolled out U-Work. Under this, an employee is required to put in six weeks of work in a year. Initially, the percentage of employees opting for working on a flexible-basis is expected to be low. But in the long term, the ratio could be 80:20, where 80% would be in the fixed or full-time employee bracket, while the balance could be in the flexible bracket. Commenting on HUL's move, Abhijit Bhaduri, an executive coach, said, "The traditional 40-40-40 model of employment has been challenged. People worked for 40 hours per week for 40 weeks a year (approximately) and for 40 years of their lives. This is a prototype of the hybrid workplace for the future." As 2021 has seen the 'Great Resignation', Bhaduri said, "Millennials want to travel, study and work on a wide variety of projects. Some experienced people want to slow down without losing access to financial security. Young parents and caregivers have had to take career breaks to look after their loved ones. Instead of losing this talent pool, Unilever retains access to them through the flex arrangements. Permanent employees can come into the office for a few days and work from any other location on the rest." There could be more organisations that could challenge traditional status quos as they also benefit from such arrangements. "As an organisation, we stand to gain by getting access to highly skilled talent across diverse groups, who can work with us on priority areas of the future. In order to retain and engage talent in future, flexibility will be key," said Razdan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/flexi-sop-safety-net-for-staff-gig-workers-hul/articleshow/88196159.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Pune||Surgeons re-emphasize pre-operative corona test||Pune: Surgeons have reinforced pre-operative RT-PCR or rapid antigen test (RAT) for SARS CoV-2 viral RNA of all patients up for elective surgery amid Omicron concern. “It is vital to ensure the safety of the healthcare workers. Hence, understanding the profile of pre-operative RAT or RT-PCR of patients planned for various non-emergency elective surgeries will help us make better decisions for optimal planning, keeping in mind the current scenario,” said Dr Sanjay Kolte, president of the Poona Surgical Society. The pre-operative Covid test norm has been in practice during the pandemic. “However, it has not been reinforced as Pune has a huge influx of travellers. Besides, it is not possible to trace out the contact history of patients. Hence, pre-operative Covid test is being prescribed,” he said. Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director, Bharati hospital and medical college, said, “In addition to taking travel history, we have also started reinforcing mainly RAT test for elective surgeries.” Dr. H K Sale from Noble hospital in Hadapsar said, “We have also started prioritizing pre-operative Covid test for every patient undergoing surgery.” Besides, Covid-recovered patients’ pre-operative risk assessment should be individualized, by factoring in surgical intensity, co-morbidities, and the risk-benefit ratio, the experts have said. As per the existing guidelines, not everyone should wait for 4-12 weeks for elective surgery after recovering from Covid-19. “The pre-operative risk assessment cannot be generalized. If elective surgery is going to ease the complications, it should be considered an essential surgery, if not an emergency one,” Dr Kolte said. Delay in seeking medical care for various non-emergency medical conditions may complicate things and prolong hospital stay and recovery, the experts said. Pune Metropolitan Region has so far reported seven confirmed cases of Omicron variant so far. The genome sequencing reports of some of the travellers and their close contacts are currently awaited. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Pune, said, “The infection from Omicron has been seen to be very mild. Hence, there is no need to panic. The objective of the current containment measures is to ensure that cases do not spread as Omicron strain spreads faster. Hence, WHO has tagged it as a variant of concern.” The infection from Omicron has been seen to be very mild. Hence, there is no need to panic.

However, the protest march caused a huge traffic jam on the Airport Road. Sea of vehicles could be seen lined up bumper to bumper during the 3-km-long traffic jam and many were seen in anguish as they were stuck up for hours. The union members had organized the protest march from Chhat traffic light point to DC office on Airport Road and back. The union members are sitting on a dharna at the Chhat village traffic light crossing. The Mohali police had made arrangements for diverting the traffic from the Chhat village traffic lights to other possible roads to avoid any traffic jam, but as it was evening time, the traffic jam could not be avoided. Jasdeep Singh, a resident of Sector 70, Mohali, was stuck up in the traffic jam. While talking to TOI, he said, “We need to find a permanent solution to all such protests where the common man is put to stress of dealing the traffic jams. The government must think how to stop the protesters from blocking the roads causing major inconvenience to the commuters and they must be directed to hold the protests at a designated place.” District vice-president of the union Amandeep Singh said, “During the 2017 Assembly elections, all truck unions in the state were dissolved by the Congress-led government. As of now there is Congress government led by Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi in the state. We demand from the Channi government that these truck unions should be revived and rates of transport be increased as truck operators were already suffering from the economic downturn.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cops-foil-truck-unions-bid-to-gherao-dc-office-in-mohali/articleshow/88194349.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Speaking at a meeting held to discuss the projects to be implemented for the city’s development on Thursday, Balagopal said the government will consider all the needs of the city like construction of railway overbridges (RoBs), canal rejuvenation and road development favourably. The government will try to avoid deductions from the plan fund allocation to the city. The government has been making deductions from the plan fund allocation to the city so as to compensate the amount it spent for purchasing land for the corporation at Brahmapuram. The government had to shell out more than Rs 100 crore for providing additional compensation to the landowners. Speaking at the meeting, mayor M Anilkumar raised various demands for the development of Kochi. He asked that the government should provide support for the development of Goshree-Mamangalam Road. “The detailed project report (DPR) of Thammanam-Pulleppady Road is in the final stage,” he said. Anilkumar requested the government to stop deductions from the plan fund. The government should take over around 15 acres at Brahmapuram which is not required for the corporation. “The demand raised by Vinod for expediting the renovation of KSRTC bus station in the city will be considered,” the minister said. “The development of Kochi will be beneficial not only to the state but to the entire south India. So, the government can’t leave the city’s requirements unaddressed,” Balagopal said. K Babu, MLA, and leaders of political parties also spoke at the meeting. Representatives of the tourism sector, chamber of commerce, merchants’ associations, hoteliers, chartered accountants, residents’ associations, etc. took part in the discussion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kochis-devpt-will-be-top-priority-fm/articleshow/88194351.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP MLA Indra Pratap Tewari disqualified, 8 assembly seats fall vacant||LUCKNOW: BJP MLA from Gosainganj assembly seat in Ayodhya, Indra Pratap Tewari, aka Khabbu Tewari, has lost his membership of the UP assembly, nearly oneand-a-half month after being convicted in a 29 year-old fake marksheet case by an MPMLA court. Tewari, who was sentenced to five years imprisonment in October by the court, is the fourth lawmaker after Kuldeep Singh Senger and Ashok Chandel — both from BJP — and Abdullah Azam to lose his membership from the state assembly. His sacking was notified by the UP assembly secretariat on December 7. The case dates back to 1992 when Yaduvansh Ram Tripathi, the then principal of Saket College, had filed a case against three persons including Tewari for taking admission based on fake marksheets. He had alleged that Tiwari, despite failing in BSc second year in 1990, managed to get admission in BSc third year. A case was registered against the three in the police station Ramjanmabhoomi under sections 420 467 468 471 of the IPC. In 2017 assembly elections, Khabbu had defeated his nearest rival, Abhay Singh of SP by a margin of nearly 12,000 votes. With Tewari’s disqualification, eight seats have fallen vacant in the UP assembly. Besides Gosaiganj, the other seven seats include, Suar, Auraiyya, Lucknow (west), Nawabganj, Salon, Charthawal and Didarganj. Suar had fallen vacant since December 2019 after SP MLA Abdullah Azam, who is also son of senior SP leader Azam Khan, was disqualified from assembly after Allahabad High Court had set aside his election saying that he was not qualified to contest 2017 assembly elections as he was below 25 year of age when he filed his nomination papers. The other six seats fell vacant following the death of MLAs. BJP MLA from Hamirpur in Bundelkhand region Ashok Chandel was disqualified from the membership of UP Assembly in April 2019 after the Allahabad High Court upheld his conviction in a murder case of 1998, in which four brothers were killed. After that in 2020, expelled BJP MLA from Bangarmau (Unnao), Kuldeep Singh Sengar got disqualified from Vidhan Sabha, following his conviction in a rape case. Both the seats were, however, won by the BJP in the ensuing by elections. While Yuvraj Singh won from Hamirpur, Shrikant Katiyar won the Bangarmau seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-mla-disqualified-8-assembly-seats-fall-vacant/articleshow/88195552.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai’s first Omicron patient discharged after testing negative||MUMBAI: The city’s first Omicron patient was discharged from SevenHills Hospital in Andheri on Wednesday, after he made a complete recovery and tested negative on RT-PCR. The second patient infected by the new variant is also on the way to recovery and will go home in a few days, doctors said. With no new detections, the state’s Omicron tally has remained at 10. Mumbai’s two recorded cases of the variant were a 39-year-old man, who arrived from South Africa on November 25, and his 36-year-old fiancée, who returned from the US on the same day. On developing symptoms, he was hospitalised on December 1 and found positive for Omicron on Monday. The fiancée tested positive during contact tracing. Civic officials confirmed that the man was discharged on Wednesday, after he tested negative. The fiancé too has tested negative, but she continues to have some mild symptoms and will be sent home after another round of RT-PCR test. On Thursday, three intern-ational travellers, who were ho-spitalised at SevenHills on suspicion of Omicron, were discharged. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said they were found to be infected with Delta, and not Omicron. They were symptom-free, RT-PCR negative and hence could go home, he added. The Andheri hospital has 36 overseas returnees admitted under suspicion of Omicron. Many are symptom-free, but are awaiting their genome sequencing reports. The line of treatment that has been used for Delta is working for Omicron too, said Dr Balkrishna Adsul, dean of SevenHills Hospital. The two Omicron confirmed cases, as well as other symptomatic patients under suspicion, have been treated with monoclonal antibod-ies. Dr Adsul said the Omicron-infected patients “responded well” and didn’t show any changes in their chest scans. “ On that basis, we are assuming the monoclonal treatment as well as other symptomatic treatments worked,” he said. Kalyan doctors, who successfully treated Maharashtra’s first Omicron patient, a 33-year-old merchant navy engineer from Dombivli who had arrived from South Africa on November 24, agreed with Mumbai doctors about symptoms and less severity. Although they were a bit worried initially, their fears faded as the patient didn’t develop any major symptoms. “We were worried since it is said to be a fast-spreading variant. But, we followed all protocols of treatm-ent and prevention by wearing proper PPE kit in the isolation ward,” said Dr Deepali More. The 34-year-old, who was discharged on Wednesday just a day before his birthday, is under seven-day home quarantine. He did not speak to the media but conveyed a message through the medical team at Art Gallery Hospital. “They should come forward and take treatment and co-operate with the administration and health teams,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-citys-first-omicron-patient-discharged-after-testing-ve/articleshow/88195079.cms||Pradeep Gupta

The closure is necessitated due to a 10-day study on the structural stability of the bridge starting on Sunday. It has been decided to allow restricted traffic movement from December 19 to 21. The study is being undertaken as bitumen concrete on both ends of the 57-year-old bridge slip away after every monsoon. When heavy vehicles pass through it, both ends get dislocated. PWD officials feel the dislocation is due to the excessive vibration on the bridge. Current holding capacity of the bridge, current condition, strength of the concrete and defects reported on the bridge will be examined jointly by the Central Road Research Institute, New Delhi, and Kerala Highway Research Institute, Thiruvananthapuram. Vehicles from Muvattupuzha to Angamaly should take Aluva-Perumbavoor KSRTC route, reach Aluva and proceed to Angamaly. Vehicles from Muvattupuzha to Perumbavoor should take diversion from Vallom Junction to right side, proceed via Vallom-Kodanad Road, Malayattoor-Kodanad bridge, Kalady-Malayattoor Road and take right turn from Kalady Junction. Vehicles from Angamaly to Muvattupuzha should travel to Aluva and proceed via Aluva-Perumbavoor KSRTC Road. Vehicles from Angamaly to Perumbavoor should divert either from Mattoor or Kalady Junction, take left, proceed via Kalady-Malayattoor Road, Malayattoor-Kodanad bridge, Kodanad-Vallom Road and take left from Vallom Junction to reach Perumbavoor. Vehicles from Muvattupuzha to Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial) can take diversion from Perumbavoor to left, proceed via Aluva-Perumbavoor KSRTC Road, Mahilalayam-Thuruth bridge, take right turn and proceed via Kalady-Aluva Road, Chovara-Neduvannur-Avanakodam Road to reach the airport. Vehicles from airport should use the same route to reach Muvattupuzha. Vehicles from Perumbavoor to airport can take Aluva-Perumbavoor KSRTC route, Thiruvairanikulam bridge, Kanjoor, Kalady-Aluva Road, Choavara-Neduvannur-Avanakodam Road and reach airport. People’s representatives demanded that the traffic regulation should not cause any inconvenience to the students in the area and Sabarimala pilgrims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sree-sankara-bridge-to-be-closed-next-wk/articleshow/88194361.cms||---
---||Delhi||It may take a few more days for regular traffic to resume on highways||New Delhi/ Ghaziabad: It may take a few more days for the highway stretches on Delhi borders to be opened for both in-bound and out-bound traffic after the protesting farmers leave the sites, sources said. While before allowing Delhi-bound traffic on the Delhi Meerut Expressway the NHAI will carry out an assessment of any damage, the highway carriageways at Singhu border may be opened for traffic within days, TOI has learnt. “Giving any timeline would be premature until the protesters leave the sites and we take control of the stretches. There is a possibility that we may have to carry out some repairs. But those can be done done quickly. We are gearing up for resuming traffic movement at Singhu border,” said a senior NHAI official. He added that they are working on preparations to bring relief to lakhs of commuters who are now forced to take a long detour. On the probability of opening the Delhi-Meerut Expressway for traffic, another official said they can’t take any risk and hence there will be a proper assessment of the damages, if any, caused to the road and structures. “We have been waiting for long. As soon as the sites are back in our control we will complete the assessment and do the needful. If there are no major issues, we may allow cars and other light motor vehicles to use the stretch,” he added. Another official said the NHAI team was not allowed to enter the protest site on Delhi-Meerut Expressway. But they are aware that in the past one year some portions have been damaged. “The farmers have destroyed electric panels and they have also dug up DME to pitch tents. At many places semi-permanent structures have also come up,” he added. As far as barricades that have been set up on the Delhi side of Meerut Expressway, SP (traffic) of Ghaziabad, Ramanand Kushwaha said, “It is up to the Delhi Police when they will remove barricades, but we assume it will be done soon.” He added, “We propose a joint meeting with the Delhi Police in which we will discuss the manner in which the barricades will be removed.” Earlier, the local office of NHAI had written to the Ghaziabad and East Delhi administrations seeking to set up a team for assessment of damage caused to to the expressway portion. It had suggested that the team should have representatives from local administration, police, PWD or any technical wing, NHAI, the private concessionaire and supervision consultant of the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/it-may-take-a-few-more-days-for-regular-traffic-to-resume-on-highways/articleshow/88195562.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Kolhapur||‘Focus on areas with poor vax turnout’||Kolhapur: Administrator of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation Kadambari Balkawade has asked the health staff to focus on the localities with poor vaccination coverage. Four localities — Phulewadi Ring Road, Kasba Bawda, Rajarampuri and More Mane Nagar — have been identified with less vaccination turnout in comparison with other localities. No formal survey was carried out to fix these localities, but they were fixed based on the vaccinations done in the nearby vaccination centres. So far, 92% of the eligible population from Kolhapur city have got the first dose and over 66% the second dose. Around 35,000 eligible beneficiaries are yet to get vaccinated for any doses and most of them are from these four localities. Amol Mane, vaccination nodal officer of KMC, said, “We are going to start door-to-door visits in each of the households from these localities. The reason for vaccine hesitancy of the locals from these areas is not known. We will know during our survey.” He said at they would facilitate the vaccination for the residents. “If someone is ill or old, we will send our vaccination teams to get them jabbed. Also, heads of nearby health centres have been asked to set up additional vaccination centres for the locals as many from outside arrive to get the jab and cause rush outside vaccination centres.” These localities are the most busy areas and there is heavy movement of people. Owing to this, these areas had witnessed high Covid cases in first two waves of pandemic. Therefore to ensure each one is vaccinated, Balkawade has also asked to get the traders, vendors from the market places vaccinated as early as possible. Meanwhile, the KMC had appealed to students to convince their parents and relatives to get vaccinated. Accordingly, 5,492 parents of the students studying in the both public and private schools stepped forward and took the jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/focus-on-areas-with-poor-vax-turnout/articleshow/88192823.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Tallah Bridge gets final nod for launch of girders||KOLKATA: The Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) on Wednesday gave its nod for launching of girders over railway tracks for the new Tallah Bridge. CRS, the autonomous body under the ministry of civil aviation, clears any new railway project across the country. The new Tallah bridge is actually a road overbridge (ROB) under Eastern Railway’s ambit. A 240m section of the 750m bridge will stand over the Tallah railway tracks operated by ER. “The CRS sanction for the work of the re-construction of Tallah road overbridge has been received today. Thus, the last milestone, involving ER for the re-construction of the Tallah ROB, has been achieved at the shortest possible time,” an ER spokesperson said on Wednesday. The 59-year-old Tallah bridge, a crucial link between Kolkata and the northern fringes, was pulled down in April last year because it had worn out beyond repair. In May, L&T started construction work for the bowstring four-lane bridge. The state PWD is chasing an April 2022 deadline to complete the Rs 350-crore Tallah Bridge reconstruction project. PWD officials said the deadline can be met only after the CRS clears launching of the spans over railway tracks. The ER spokesperson said: “The Tallah Bridge is an important ROB connecting Kolkata and its suburb. The state government is executing the reconstruction on a single entity basis. ER is facilitating this utmost important construction work by obtaining necessary clearances from CRS and is involved in coordinating and expediting the work of the bridge as it is built over railway line.” Over the last few weeks, ER approved all drawings in connection with the launching scheme of the ROB’s superstructure and the Sealdah division subsequently made a formal application to CRS. “The CRS raised some issues and queries, which were replied on Monday. As a result of such prompt action, the CRS sanction came within 48 hours,” the ER spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tallah-bridge-gets-final-nod-for-launch-of-girders/articleshow/88173135.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Shirol and Hatkanangle talukas in Kolhapur are known to be the vegetable bowl of the region and usually receive less rainfall when compared to other parts of the district. But last week, these areas received the highest rainfall in the district. The e prices have already gone up by 30-50% for green leafy vegetables, brinjal, peas, tomato etc. Nisar Shaikh, a vegetable seller at Shahupuri vegetable market, said, “The supply has been hit due to heavy rain last week. Vegetables coming from eastern parts of the district like Shirol, Jaysingpur and Hatkanangle were affected largely. In the Navratra period, the prices of veggies had gone and now again the prices have increased.” A vegetable vendor from Laxmipuri market, Jameer Bagwan, said, “The rates had came down after Diwali but with crop damage in Shirol and Hatkanangle region, the prices have again gone up. Green leafy vegetables like fenugreek and spinach are selling at Rs 30 each bunch, tomatoes are Rs 80 a kilo, brinjal Rs 100-120, capsicum Rs 20, lady’s finger Rs 40, simla mirch Rs 60, cluster bean Rs 60, Potato Rs 35, green peas Rs 80-100 in the retail market.” Citizens are feeling the pinch. Manisha Jadhav, a homemaker, who had come to the Laxmipuri vegetable market, said, “All vegetables are very costly suddenly. Brinjal has gone above Rs 100. The month of Margashirsha has started and almost everyone prefers to eat vegetarian food. The entire household budget is going to get affected due to the rise in cost of vegetables.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/vegetable-prices-in-kolhapur-soar-after-recent-unseasonal-rain/articleshow/88192831.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: PM Modi to invoke Atal Behari Vajpayee in his ‘karmabhoomi’ Balrampur||LUCKNOW: Less than a week after inaugurating flagship projects, including a fertiliser factory and AIIMS in CM Yogi Adityanath’s political turf of Gorakhpur, PM Narendra Modi is all set to visit another east UP district of Balarampur — the former karmabhoomi of BJP stalwart and former PM Atal Behari Vajpayee — on Saturday (December 11) to inaugurate the Saryu Canal project. Notably, BJP’s plans to line up Modi’s Balrampur rally comes just a fortnight before the 97th birth anniversary of Vajpayee on December 25. Also, Modi’s visit could once again train the spotlight on politically crucial Purvanchal, which has been witnessing hectic politicking ahead of state polls due early next year. BJP sources said, the party has strategically planned Modi’s rally in a locality, Ikhattar, which is closely associated with Vajpayee, who won the parliamentary elections from Balrampur twice —1957 and 1967 — as a candidate of Jan Sangh, the political precursor to present-day BJP. Modi, not surprisingly, is expected to invoke Vajpayee to send out a message not only in Balrampur, but also in other districts of east UP region. The saffron party is learnt to have rolled out its organizational machinery to dot the district with posters of Vajpayee along with Modi. BJP’s Balrampur district president Pradeep Singh confirmed the area around the rally venue has ardent Vajpayee supporters. “Many people have fond memories of Vajpayee visiting their house and having food with them,” Singh told TOI. He said, scores of BJP supporters are expected to reach Balrampur from neighbouring districts like Shravasti. Soon after Modi inaugurates the project, water will be released in the Saryu canal by opening the Rapti barrage.

The BNMC started the drive on Thursday, checking the vaccination status of staff in 30 shops, said civic chief Sudhakar Deshmukh. In 11 shops, the staff and owners had not taken a single dose. The civic team sealed these premises and told the owners that their shops will not be allowed to reopen till all of them take at least the first shot of Covid vaccine. Deshmukh told TOI, “Despite several requests and orders, citizens are not taking the vaccine, prompting us to take action against shops where the owners and staff are unvaccinated.” Bhiwandi and Malegaon have the lowest turnout for Covid vaccination. In Bhiwandi, 61% of the eligible population have taken the first dose, while only 27 % are fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-bhiwandi-municipal-body-seals-11-shops-as-owners-staff-unvaxxed/articleshow/88195084.cms||Pradeep Gupta

This is one of the biggest drug seizures this year. On specific intelligence, AIU officials intercepted a man and a woman arriving from Ethiopia. Officials said they walked from the green channel, but a search of their baggage resulted in recovery of white powder purportedly to be heroin. The AIU checked the powder with the first test kit and it was confirmed to be naroctics. The suspects were arrested and the samples were sent for further analysis. The accused, who were booked under the NDPS Act, will be produced before the court on Friday. Earlier, on November 22, a mother-daughter duo from Uganda, who had reached Mumbai from Juba via Dubai, was caught with 4kg of heroin worth Rs 20 crore. In September, the AIU had arrested five women smu-ggling in heroin worth crores in separate incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-duo-held-with-rs-240cr-heroin-at-city-airport/articleshow/88195088.cms||Ahmed Ali

Overcoming all odds, district health teams fought their way to reach the people in their homes and administered altogether 10,75,622 doses in each round of the Covid vaccination process. They had set a target of 10,47,502 vaccination which was done on 287 sites. District officials laud the tenacity of their team members who kept the pressure on relentlessly with follow ups and awareness drives to make this goal possible. Help of religious leaders and elected representatives too were roped in to convince people to get their jabs on time. Junagadh district collector Rachit Raj said, “It’s a result of collective efforts, but special mention has to be made of Asha staff and female health workers who had played a pivotal role. We wanted to convert our challenges into opportunities. I, myself, went to Girnar mountain to convince the main religious leader there to take a jab, who later appealed to others to follow his example.” The medical officers were given the responsibilities to continue monitoring the progress of primary health centres (PHCs). The talukas are divided among PHCs and were given deadlines to achieve the targets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/junagadh-achieves-first-100-vax-target-in-state/articleshow/88193596.cms||---
---||Navi-mumbai||Navi Mumbai: Act on wetlands SOS on golf course, Centre tells state||NAVI MUMBAI: Taking cognizance of environmentalists’ concerns over the destruction of the NRI and TS Chanakya wetlands at Nerul for a golf course, the Centre has asked the state environment department to take action on the complaints “on priority”. Meanwhile, a fresh complaint has been sent to the forest department about the destruction of mangroves near Moraj circle, Palm Beach Road.  Environmentalists have reiterated that by saving these flamingo sites, birds will be prevented from diverting their flight paths towards the upcoming Navi Mumbai airport, thereby avoiding accidents. They have drawn the attention of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change (MoEFCC) to the fact that the destruction of wetlands would be detrimental to flights at the upcoming airport. An official of MoEFCC, M Ramesh, has written to the environment department regarding the issue, said director of NatConnect Foundation, B N Kumar. TimesViewThe wetlands and mangroves have evolved to their present state after hundreds of years. It will perhaps take just a day or two to fully destroy these examples of marine biodiversity and build a golf course and accompanying concrete jungle. Acting as natural urban sponges and attracting thousands of wetland birds, these green coastal sites must be preserved for the sake of the environment and our future generations. The government must also inquire if any missteps have happened to push forward the golf course proposal. The MoEFCC gave clearance to the airport project on the basis of certain conditions which included an avifaunal study to be carried out in consultation with the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), said Sunil Agrawal of Save Navi Mumbai Wetlands forum.  BNHS’s repeated studies have warned against the destruction of wetlands, which are the destination for hundreds of thousands of migratory and local birds. Kumar has demanded a commission of inquiry into the “wrong certification” by Cidco that the water bodies are not wetlands, on the basis of which the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) has granted environmental clearance for the golf course project.  NatConnect has obtained a copy of environmental clearance via the RTI route. M Ramesh has now asked the state to take action into the environmentalists’ complaints. He has also asked the State Wetlands Authority to take “necessary action” and intimate the Centre. The forest department had admitted in its affidavit in Bombay high court, during the hearing of a petition by Agrawal and others, that the two wetlands figure in the National Wetland Assessment Inventory prepared by the Ahmedabad-based Space Application Centre, said Kumar. HC had ordered a scrapping of the golf course project, but Cidco and the private developer moved the Supreme Court with separate petitions. Despite the pendency of an SC ruling, the project recently received Rera approval, Agrawal lamented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-act-on-wetlands-sos-on-navi-golf-course-centre-tells-state/articleshow/88195565.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Nashik||MUHS gets in-principle nod for medical college||Nashik: Union ministry of health and family welfare and the National Medical Commission have given their ‘in-principle’ nod to the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) to start a postgraduate medical college. The proposed institute will be known as the Maharashtra Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (MPGIMER). Lt Gen Madhuri Kanitkar (retd), the varsity’s Vice-Chancellor, told TOI they have started the process to recruit 57 faculty members, including the dean. “This is a dream project for the MUHS. The varsity is keen to complete the recruitment process by the end of this month. Thereafter, commission would make an inspection before giving its final nod. MPGIMER is likely to start functioning from 2022-23,” said Kanitkar. Initially, MPGIMER would impart PG medical education in seven disciplines — general medicine, paediatrics, general surgery, orthopaedics, anaesthesia, obstrectics and gynaecology, maternity and child welfare and emergency medicine. “The commission would decide on the seats for PG admissions in all the seven disciplines. I think there would be at least 50 seats for all the disciplines,” she added. The students would be initially attending classes at the Nashik civil hospital. The hostel facilities would be on the MUHS campus. Nashik civil hospital has about 600 beds with six operational theatres. “I was impressed by the medical infrastructure at the Nashik civil hospital during my recent visit there. Seminars and lectures will be held in the hospital itself,” said Kanitkar. ‘CDS's demise is personal loss for me’ The MUHS VC, Lt Gen (Dr) Madhuri Kanitkar, described the deaths of Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat, his wife Madhulika and 11 other IAF and army personnel as her ‘personal loss.’ She said she tried calling Madhulika after the initial information about the crash came in. “Her phone, however, was not reachable. I feared that something serious was amiss,” she said. She said that during her posting as deputy chief Integrated Defence Staff at Delhi, she used to frequently interact with Rawat. “He was extremely productive, clear in his thinking and hardworking. He never used to go home before 8-9 in the night. The deaths are a national loss but for me it is a personal loss,” she said, adding that she was extremely close to Madhulika.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/muhs-gets-in-principle-nod-for-medical-college/articleshow/88192840.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: Kisan jam nears end at UP Gate amid unity message||GHAZIABAD: Slogans of ‘kisan ekta zindabad’ rent the air at UP Gate on Thursday as soon as victory was officially announced, a message from the Samyukt Kisan Morcha that farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders for over a year could now go home. The Centre had accepted all their demands. The agitation was over. The slogans were a spontaneous tribute to farmers’ unity. One voice, then a unison as protesters emerged from their tents, and soon on the loudspeakers – an apogee of the resilience that kept the protest on course through a trying year. In allegiance to this brotherhood, the UP Gate (Ghazipur border) protesters declared they will be the last ones to leave because they want to see off farmers, mainly from Punjab, to show their gratitude. The BKU, which has been leading the agitation here, said the idea was mooted by its protest leader Rakesh Tikait. BKU spokesperson Dharmendra Malik said, “Rakesh Tikait wants that we should see off farmers from Punjab, who are mostly camping at Singhu and Tikri borders and have a long distance to travel, first. Farmers at UP Gate are mostly from western UP districts, which are relatively closer. Tikait has said he will be the last one to leave as he wants to see off the last farmer as a gesture of appreciation for the unflinching support they extended to the agitation.” There weren’t many protesters at UP Gate when word about the agitation being called off came in, but among the 100 or so in the camps were some of its most steadfast. They gathered in a huddle under the Delhi-Meerut Expressway flyover, in front of the police barricades, to mark the moment that had taken some time to arrive even after the PM announced the repeal of the new central farm laws last month. Among the elders was 71-year old Mahendra Choudhary, a farmer from Etah, who insisted this was not a day of celebration. “What is there to celebrate?” asked Choudhary, who said he had stayed at the protest site for a large part of the last eight months. “We have lost so many lives in one year of protest and farmers have faced so many hardships all these months. This so-called victory cannot compensate for what we went through,” he said. Another elderly farmer, Iqbal Choudhary of Haridwar, added, “Shukriya, der se aankh khuli (thanks, but the government woke up late). We were targeted with all sorts of insinuations. We were called ‘andolanjeevi’ and terrorists. Farmers have paid a heavy price.” Showing photos in his phone of him seated in the same tractor as Tikait when the protesters reached UP Gate on November 27 last year, Ashok Ghatayan said, “I was beside Tikait sahib in his tractor when he left for UP Gate from Muzaffarnagar. At that time, I could not imagine this was going to be such a long battle.” Several protesters took selfies, standing at spots on the highway that they will associate with their agitation forever – camp, stage, langar, chai and hookah points, tractors, places with stories of newly forged bonds. In the family loom, these would become the new invaluables. “I will preserve this photo till my last breath and will also show this to my children and grandchildren. I will tell them with pride that I had participated in this historic protest for their future.” said Om Prakash of Etah, who had just taken a selfie in front of the protest stage, from where Tikait’s stirring speech in January turned the course of the agitation. The younger protesters let their emotions flow freely. ‘Kisan ekta zindabad’ was followed by ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’, and ‘ladenge, jeetenge’. The lone presence in Tikait’s office was of his confidant Jagsir Singh Taliwal, a farmer from Nabha in Patiala. “We will take out a ‘fateh’ (victory) march and there is a plan to visit Golden Temple. We will soon start vacating UP Gate but UP Gate will be the last spot after Tikri and Singhu to be vacated,” he said. Except for the occasional selfie-seeker, the stage remained empty. It had served its purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/kisan-jam-nears-end-at-up-gate-amid-unity-message/articleshow/88195579.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Three years on, leaky Ghatkopar pool continues to remain bone dry||MUMBAI: Shut in January 2019, the BMC’s five-decade-old Ghatkopar swimming pool continues to stay non-operational till date. After the structural stability report showed repairs to be unviable it was decided to instead entirely revamp the leaky pool. Locals, however, are upset that almost three years have passed since the pool’s closure and there has been no movement on reconstructing it. TimesViewMumbai has less than a dozen public swimming pools and the blame lies with the BMC for failing to provide more of these recreational facilities to its citizens. That the Ghatkopar pool has remained shut for three years proves the administration’s lackadaisical attitude. The BMC must be held accountable.Local NCP corporator Rakhi Jadhav said that in the 2019 civic budget, she had suggested that the leaky pool be replaced with a multi-oriented indoor sports complex. “An architect was also appointed to draw out the plans for a new sports complex as it is the only one for the easte rn suburbs. But I have been told that the plan has been kept on hold owing to lack of funds. If a sports complex is constructed, it could be a boon for the people in the suburbs,” said Jadhav. When TOI contacted officials from the deputy chief engineer, eastern suburbs office, they informed that the proposal from the garden cell for reconstructing the pool had been submitted last Wednesday itself and that the tendering process is yet to start. “The reconstruction is at a very nascent stage,” said a official. Ghatkopar resident Naresh Mehta, a 74-year-old swimmer who was a regular at the pool, said that since he participates in various competitions, he had obtained special permission for practice at the Chembur swimming pool. “But why should we use the Chembur pool when we have one in our own locality? We could not practice during Covid anyway, and no one is complaining as it was a crisis situation. But at least now the BMC should have moved to reconstruct the pool since it’s shut for long. We hope that the BMC moves fast on repairing and restarting the pool as we anticipate that repairs are going to take a long time,” said Mehta. Many locals also said that the BMC should have used time during the COVID induced lockdown to begin the revamp of it. Former Ghatkopar corporator Pravin Chheda said the BMC spent crores on placing an ozone water treatment plant at the swimming pool just a few years ago. “Soon after that the pool was shut and the regulars have had to do without it. There is no movement as well on reconstructing it,” said Chheda. Valji Bhanushali, another swimmer from Ghatkopar, said he currently goes walking from Ghatkopar to Chembur for his swimming practice. “I have participated in competitions like Malvan Sea Swimming Competition in the past and want to continue with my practice. As there is no pool in the locality, I walk from Ghatkopar to Chembur,” said Bhanushali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-yrs-on-leaky-ghatkopar-pool-continues-to-remain-bone-dry/articleshow/88195584.cms||Richa Pinto

Patil said that the Kolhapur district will be the first to have such public address systems and that too at a large scale. Sixty PA systems will be installed in Kolhapur city alone. During the floods in July this year, GSM-based public address systems were installed at 21 locations in the flood-affected tehsils, which helped the administration evacuate more than 3.5 lakh people in advance. The system includes speakers, a GSM-based module, a sim card for communication, software and other hardware parts. The public address systems will be connected to the monitoring systems, which will be set up at the district, taluka and village levels. The total cost of the project is around Rs 1.80 crore and the funds have been made available through the district planning council. Satej Patil said, “The PA systems will help us save lives during disasters like floods, heavy rains and landslides. It will be a mode through which important messages would be delivered to the citizens promptly. It will also be used for the dissemination of other important communications to the public. Kolhapur will be the only district in the state to have such PA systems installed at such a large scale.” NGO to be roped in to help solve city’s traffic problems Patil said Save Life Foundation will soon be roped in to suggest measures to address the traffic concerns in the city. Recently, the NGO was given the task of studying the accident-prone spots on the National Highway between Pune to Kagal. He added that the Kolhapur municipal corporation will adopt these measures and work to ease the traffic congestion. Decision to nominate Jayashri Jadhav pending Patil further said that he is yet to speak to the family members of the deceased sitting MLA Chandrakant Jadhav regarding the proposal to nominate Jadhav’s wife Jayashri for the assembly by-polls. He said that the family is in pain after Jadhav’s demise and at this juncture discussing any political issue is not appropriate. “In a week or so, I will speak with the family. I have received many suggestions to elect Jadhav’s wife for the assembly by-polls unopposed, which I fully support. However, I am yet to discuss it with his family members,” added Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-dist-to-get-610-public-address-systems/articleshow/88192871.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||BJP ‘Kaam mein zero, prachaar mein hero’: Cong poll coordinator||Chandigarh: Terming BJP’s advertisement strategy as ‘Kaam mein zero, prachaar mein hero’, Congress coordinator for Chandigarh municipal corporation polls Rajinder Rana, in an interview with TOI, said Congress would have its mayor in Chandigarh after MC poll results. Rana, Congress MLA from Sujanpur, Himachal Pradesh, who had defeated BJP chief minister nominee Prem Kumar Dhumal in 2017 assembly polls, says there is anger among public against the BJP, which has already been seen in Himachal Pradesh bypoll results. On AAP, he said it had no presence in Chandigarh. On what issues, Congress is seeking votes from public in Chandigarh MC polls? Chandigarh residents can easily compare city’s overall development during Congress regime and during BJP’s tenure, and the result is in front of everyone. The city has slipped to 66th rank in Swachh Survey and Congress is seeking votes from public to bring back glory of City Beautiful Chandigarh. Is sanitation is only issue with the Congress? No, dip in rankings and poor sanitary condition is one of the main issues. Apart from sanitation, the BJP-ruled government has put profitable electricity department on sale through privatisation. The UT administration, after shortlisting highest bidder, have even send the cabinet note to the Union government. Under BJP rule, India is on sale and UT electricity department’s privatisation is one of such example. Besides, imposition of taxes, including sewerage cess; hike in water tariff; broken roads; no solution of leasehold to freehold of commercial and industrial properties, no solution of dumping of garbage and garbage processing plant, are also issues that directly affects the public. So, Congress will go for MC polls with local issues only? It is municipal corporation elections, which will be mainly focused on local issues only. The Congress will highlight all local problems being faced by the public and also crucial issue like inflation, which has affected the budget of every household, will be highlighted in election campaign. We will appeal to the public to help us defeat the BJP. Even during farmers protest, the city residents supported the movement on every roundabout by protesting against the BJP-led Central government. I am confident that people will vote for Congress for overall development of Chandigarh and there will be Congress mayor after MC polls. BJP is bringing union ministers, chief ministers and other star campaigners for campaigning. What is Congress’s strategy? The BJP is bringing leaders from Delhi, UP, and even from Tamil Nadu, as they are sensing their defeat in Chandigarh MC polls. Otherwise, MC polls are local polls, which are contested on local issues only. The reason behind BJP’s fear is humiliating defeat of the party in Himachal bypolls. Congress will focus on door-to-door campaigning and small meetings. How do you see AAP in MC polls, which is contesting the election for the first time? In Chandigarh, I don’t see the presence of AAP. In fact, the party at present has no base in Chandigarh. There were allegations of favouritism in Congress ticket distribution. Will you be able to pacify party rebels? A: From every ward there were 5-6 ticket contenders, but ticket can be given to only one person. There was no favouritism in ticket distribution and I have personally met with Congress workers, who could not get tickets, and now majority of them are ready to work for Congress again to ensure party’s victory in polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-kaam-mein-zero-prachaar-mein-hero-cong-poll-coordinator/articleshow/88194391.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Now, three people have been deployed per shift, including a sub-inspector. I have instructed them to make sure that there are two people at any point of time,” he said.After 11pm, every in-bound person is being stopped and checked thoroughly. “If any person is found suspicious, he would be scanned using a face recognition camera developed for Tamil Nadu police. It is mandatory for all police stations to upload photos of criminals and missing persons in the crime and criminal tracking network and systems (CCTNS). It is already paying off as we secured a criminal recently. It is also used to scan vagrants sleeping on platforms and footpaths to check if they are on the missing persons list,” Kumar said.Night checking helped to secure ganja peddlers and banned tobacco hoarders. “A biker was found in possession of ganja recently. He led us to a distributor, from whom we seized 1kg ganja. The distributor led us to the wholesaler in Theni district. We seized a few kilograms of ganja from him,” the commissioner said. “We seized more than 1,000kg of banned tobacco products recently,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/surveillance-strengthened-at-checkposts-to-curb-crime/articleshow/88195095.cms||V Devanathan

Three sub-adult lions were spotted in the villages of Jetpur and Gondal talukas in the last fortnight, officials of the forest department confirmed to TOI. Forest officials suspect that the lions have come from the Bhesan side in Junagadh district close to the sanctuary area. Jetpur is very close to the sanctuary and lions have travelled around 35 km to reach these talukas. It has become a corridor for lions. According to forest officials, three sub-adult lions were moving in Jetalsar, Thana Galol and nearby villages and on Thursday they entered a village of Gondal taluka. They also preyed on wild, domesticated animals and stray cattle in one of the villages. The lions are venturing in from both directions of Rajkot. They were spotted on the Bhavnagar Road near Vichiya and Jasdan and Jetpur and Gondal on Junagadh road. According to sources, the lions are coming to the Jetpur and Gondal area from the sanctuary side and to the Jasdan area from Amreli side. Ravi Prasad Radhakrishna, deputy conservator of forest, Rajkot, told TOI: “This is the third consecutive year when sub-adults are venturing Rajkot district. In winter, there is sufficient availability of water as well as prey base due to good crop. Sub-adults are adventurous by nature and they continue to explore new territories and we believe that this is part of that.” The forest officials are not going too close to the lions but are keeping an eye from the distance and sensitizing the villagers about their behaviour. In September, a group of six lions had ventured into the Bordi Samadhiyala village of Jetpur. The lions had entered Halenda village of Jasdan, Sardhar and Tramba near Aji Dam and villages of Jetpur in the last two years at different times. However, the lions have not stayed in the villages permanently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/3-lions-saunter-around-gondal-make-a-killing/articleshow/88193627.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC seeks state, EC, BMC reply on new wards for local poll||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Thursday issued notice to the state government, BMC and Election Commission and directed them to file their affidavits by December 21 to a petition that challenges the addition of nine civic constituencies in Mumbai. Two municipal councillors have filed a petition to challenge the constitutional validity of a November 30 ordinance of the state government which notified increase of nine seats in Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Senior counsel Milind Sathe and Nikhil Sakhardande for the petitioners, Abhijit Samant and Rajashree Shirwadkar, submitted that the ordinance is arbitrary and illegal besides being contrary to constitutional mandate in part 9 which relates to constitution and powers of municipalities and provision Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act. The counsel sought an interim stay, but the HC said it will hear all parties on the next date and decide on interim relief orders. A division bench of justice A A Sayed and justice Abhay Ahuja said since a constitutional challenge is raised, notice be issued to advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni. The HC will hear the matter next on December 22. By a notification, the state amended a provision of the BMC Act and increased seats from 227 to 236. Sathe said the increase was sans any “quantifiable data or latest census population data available”. The statement of objects and reasons of the ordinance merely states that the population must have “exponentially increased with rapid urbanization’’. Sathe said that in 2011 November, on the basis of that year’s census data the boundaries were redrawn the ward boundaries but did not feel it necessary to increase number of wards, because the population of the city from the 2001 census till then had increased by four lakh people only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-seeks-state-ec-bmc-reply-on-new-wards-for-local-poll/articleshow/88195606.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Delhi||‘Recover demolition charges from illegal encroachers’||New Delhi: Flagging that illegal encroachers of government land in Delhi go scot-free, a parliamentary panel has urged the housing and urban affairs ministry to evolve a mechanism for recovery of demolition charges from the offenders after it retrieves such land parcels in future. Flagging its concerns regarding the gaps in implementation of the Delhi Master Plan-2021, the public accounts committee (PAC) has also sought the details on the current status of the implementation of the Master Plan, outlining achievements, failures or delays. It has asked the ministry to give the explanations in detail. The PAC’s report was submitted to both Houses of Parliament on Wednesday. While taking note that the primary objective of the targeted demolition by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is the retrieve valuable government land and to take measures to avoid any future encroachment, the committee observed, “no effort is made to trace the whereabouts of the encroachers and recover the legal charges” as provisioned in the DDA Act of 1957. “The committee is of the view that this amounts to allowing violators to go scot-free...The committee, therefore, desires the ministry to evolve a mechanism for streamlining the measures for recovery of the demolition charges in consonance with the DDA Act, 1957 in future,” the panel said. It has also sought details and status of the demolition and fencing of all encroached DDA land. As far as the progress of implementation of the Delhi Master Plan 2021 is concerned, the PAC in December 2018 had pulled up the DDA for its failure in monitoring the progress of city infrastructure and had asked it for setting up a monitoring unit. The panel in its report has recommended the ministry to ensure that the High Level Committee consisting of all the stakeholders hold their meetings for reviewing, monitoring and managing the execution of the Master Plan. The ministry has been asked to submit a status report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/recover-demolition-charges-from-illegal-encroachers/articleshow/88195615.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Delhi||‘Striving To Fulfil Ambedkar’s Dream Of Quality Education’||New Delhi: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia rued that political parties weren’t actually working to provide students high quality education but only giving lip service to the ideals of Dr B R Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution. At the Delhi Secretariat on Wednesday, Sisodia told TOI that the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi would celebrate the rich legacy of Babasaheb, as Ambedkar was known, by organising a series of musical dramas centred on his life. “Babasaheb wanted the highest quality of education for every child. But political parties aren't providing such education, only making claims,” asserted Sisodia. “If they can’t even provide Dalits basic amenities like electricity and water, how can they be acting on his ideas? In contrast, Delhi government is providing the highest quality of education to all children and free medical treatment to people. We don’t care if it costs Rs 70 or Rs 70,000, if someone can’t afford something, it is our moral duty to support them. I won’t claim that we’ve done everything to fulfil Babasaheb’s dreams, but we are working on them and walking the path he has shown us. It is because of his vision that we formulated policies to benefit all sections of society.” Sisodia said that the AAP government had also worked to uplift the Dalits. “Our policies benefit the Dalits and the backward classes. Everyone talked about helping the community, but if they had done so, they would not still be so oppressed,” said the deputy CM. “The community did not get education, healthcare or financial support. Babasaheb wanted everyone to enjoy equal opportunities and facilities. The Kejriwal government offers free quality education, world-class healthcare, free electricity and water and we cover all basic necessities. Additionally, if anyone from the Dalit community wants to sit for the civil services exams, IIT-JEE, NEET or other professional exams, Delhi government takes care of the coaching costs under the Jai Bhim Yojana.” Asked why AAP planned to celebrate Ambedkar’s life close to the Punjab elections, Sisodia demurred and said the plans were announced at the beginning of 2021 alongside Delhi government’s intention to celebrate India’s 75 years of independence. Ambedkar deserved to be remembered because it is due to him that we today are aware of our legal rights and was thus the creator of a modern India. “But he hasn’t been given the place he deserves. No one has done so much for fellow citizens as Babasaheb has,” claimed Sisodia. Sisodia stressed that Ambedkar’s ideology needed to be taught in a more holistic and effective manner. That was, therefore, the theme of the musical drama that Delhi government is organising. The drama series on Dr Ambedkar's life will begin from January 5 with 50 shows in total. Renowned artists will take part in the retelling of Ambedkar’s life to be mounted on a grand scale. The shows will be free, so people can watch them and find inspiration in the socialist lawyer’s unwavering spirit, said Sisodia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/striving-to-fulfil-ambedkars-dream-of-quality-education/articleshow/88195149.cms||AlokKNMishra

Heavy vehicle operators said the district administration had banned them from using the ghat roads via Gorimedu and Kuppanur to prevent any mishaps after the landslides.The move had hit the residents of Yercaud and surrounding villages, as the movement of essential commodities to the hill-town was affected. Many of them were forced to travel to Salem to purchase essential items.When the collector came to know about the hardships faced by the local residents, he had convened a meeting with the highways department officials on Wednesday to explore the option of allowing heavy vehicles to use the ghat roads.“We then took a decision to allow heavy vehicles to use both the ghat roads by limiting the speed to 30kmph and not overloading them. We have warned them not to overtake other vehicles on the stretch and go close to the edge of the roads,” the collector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/yercaud-ghat-roads-open-up-for-heavy-vehicles-now/articleshow/88195121.cms||---

According to the B division police station, the woman, a resident of Navagam Ghed area, called up the police on Wednesday to file a complaint of three ‘gunmen’ barging into her house and robbing Rs 30,000 in cash besides a gold chain weighing 11 tolas. A team of police along with local crime branch sleuths reached the spot and found things inside the house scattered. The woman told the police that her son had gone after the robbers. The police searched CCTV cameras of the area but found nothing suspicious. They then called the son, Babu Jogal, for questioning who broke down and confessed to his crime. Jogal, a divorcee, had a gold chain that was gifted to his ex-wife by his parents in the house’s safe. “He got a job at Jabalpur where he fell in love with a girl. He wanted to give her a costly gift for which he sold off the chain. When Babu’s elder brother asked about the gold chain two days ago, Babu and his mother concocted the whole robbery story to camouflage his act,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/mother-cooks-robbery-story-to-hide-sons-act/articleshow/88193650.cms||---

The firm currently supplies food processing equipment to manufacturers of frozen potato-based products in Gujarat. Kiremko was part of a 14-firm team led by Marten van den Berg, the ambassador of the Netherlands to India, Nepal and Bhutan, at Agri Asia 2021 in Gandhinagar. “We are looking to set up an equipment manufacturing facility in India. This equipment will be used in food processing, primarily for frozen potato-based products. Gujarat is an ideal choice because it may be easily used as a production hub and supplier for processed potato products,” said Bhavana Vishawanath, the firm’s country director. Kiremko already supplies equipment to frozen-potato based food products manufacturers McCain and Hyfun Foods . Gujarat is already the largest producer and exporter of frozen potato-based products in India. The Netherlands ambassador expressed interest in investing in India in four sectors: healthcare, agriculture, water and energy. “We are looking to work with Indian companies in area of medicines and vaccines for manufacturing as well as research and development,” said Marten van den Berg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dutch-firm-kiremko-looks-to-invest-25m-in-gujarat/articleshow/88194452.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: What GFP alliance, asks Chidambaram, but Gundu Rao calls Vijai Sardesai for talks||PANAJI: Less than two hours after AICC in-charge for Goa and former Union finance minister P Chidambaram questioned the alliance between Congress and Goa Forward Party, the party’s state desk in-charge, Dinesh Gundu Rao, invited GFP president Vijai Sardesai for alliance talks at the party office in Panaji on Saturday. “Vijai Sardesai came to Delhi and said to us that to defeat BJP, his party (GFP) offers support to Congress. Rahul Gandhi said, we accept the support. That is where it stands. Other details have to be worked out,” Chidambaram told reporters when asked about the alliance with GFP. If there will be any talks about seat sharing with GFP, Chidambaram was non-committal. “That I can’t say. They will work it out, but I don’t know when,” he said. When asked when would Congress announce a formal alliance with GFP, Chidambaram said, “we will not do what you want us to. We will do what we want to do”. He also said, “the word alliance is being indiscriminately used”. Soon after his statement, there were speculations if Congress would really have a pre-poll alliance with GFP despite the much-publicised New Delhi meet. However, about an hour and a half after Chidambaram’s statement, Gundu Rao tweeted that he has invited Sardesai for a meeting with Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar on Saturday. Chidambaram’s denial of having had any talks about the alliance left the GFP camp slightly uneasy. Sardesai convened a meeting of the party’s political affairs committee late on Thursday evening to discuss the prevailing situation and chalk out future plans. However, Sardesai said that as some members couldn’t attend the meeting owing to prior engagements, the meeting would continue on Friday. “We are discussing the matter holistically and we will take a proper decision,” Sardesai told TOI. He maintained that talks about an alliance did take place at the recent meeting in New Delhi. “Let them deny it. Chidambaram was also present at the meeting, and he knows very well what was spoken. After Chidambaram’s statement today, people have asked me to clarify. Later, I also got a call from Gundu Rao inviting me for talks on Saturday. Our political affairs committee will decide about the contours of the alliance,” Sardesai told TOI. A week ago, Sardesai, along with GFP MLA Vinoda Paliencar and independent legislator Prasad Gaonkar met Gandhi in Delhi. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat and Rao were also seen in the group photo released after the meet. The absence of Chodankar and GFP’s Jayesh Salgaokar was talked about. Chidambaram, meanwhile, said that he too attended the meet but for a short time, while Chodankar could not attend it due to illness. He had a serious “throat infection,” he said, replying to a query on why the Goa Congress president did not attend the crucial meeting. “We are strong enough to defeat BJP in the 2022 assembly polls. If other parties want to support Congress, they are welcome to do it,” he said. The AICC senior observer also said that “defections have been the bane of Goan politics. It’s a shame. Goans should not forgive those who get elected on one party ticket and shamelessly defect to another party. We must put an end to that disease in the 2022 elections,” he said. “The entire BJP government is the government of defectors.” He also said that it does not matter if a person who had mentally left the party two years ago has quit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/what-gfp-alliance-asks-chidambaram-but-gundu-rao-calls-sardesai-for-talks/articleshow/88195619.cms||---

As per the norms, it is mandatory for private hospitals and maternity homes to renew their licences every three years, but some private hospitals have not renewed their licences yet. The NMC officials said, “We will take action against the private hospitals who have not renewed licences for the past 6 years. We are in a process of sending them final notices before initiating any action. The NMC health department has also warned of action against those clinics or hospitals, which are operating without registrations with the NMC administration. The officials added that they will lodge a police complaint against such hospitals. Over 400 private hospitals and maternity homes are registered with the administration and they regularly renew their licences. However, some failed to do so during the Covid pandemic.

In October, Marine Drive police had registered a second FIR against developer Sanjay Punamia after police found some confidential documents of the home department and call detail reports (CDRs) of a few people, including developer Sharad Agarwal and his friend, Bhayander BJP district president Ravi Vyas, in a forensic audit of his mobile phone. Police stumbled on this while probing an extortion case registered against Singh, Punamia and others on the complaint of Agarwal’s uncle Shyam Agarwal. Police had booked Punamia, his son Sunny and others under IPC sections for theft and criminal conspiracy and under the Indian Telegraph Act and IT Act. The case was recently transferred to the cyber crime cell. In July, Marine Drive police arrested Punamia and his friend Sunil Jain in an extortion case registered by Shyam Agarwal. Police had seized Punamia’s mobile phone, which was sent to forensic experts to retrieve its data. The digital forensic experts sent a report which said Punamia’s mobile had some confidential data of the home department and the CDR. “On May 3, 2021, Punamia had sent one PDF file to his son Sunny Punamia which has 27 pages which had letters from the home department, Maharashtra DGP and CBI New Delhi and a few inquiry reports of the state home department which are confidential, and it should not have been in the hands of private persons other than government officials,” said an officer.  Cyber police have found these confidential documents were given to Punamia by a DCP. They have recorded the DCP’s statement and probe is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cyber-expert-paid-by-singh-probed-in-data-theft-case/articleshow/88195621.cms||Ahmed Ali

Talking to TOI, Jadhav said the schools have to follow all Covid safety protocols without fail. All the schools with Classes I to VII in the city will reopen from Monday. He made this announcement following a meeting with the officials of the civic body’s education department . Earlier, the state government had issued guidelines to the local authorities on reopening of schools for students of Classes I to VII in the urban areas and Classes I to IV in the rural areas rom December 1. However, the NMC commissioner had deferred the plans to reopen schools in the city until December 10 due to the emergence of Omicron. Meanwhile, the NMC’s education department had directed all private and civic schools to furnish details related to number of students in Classes I to VII, the number of classrooms, whether all teachers and staff are fully vaccinated etc NMC’s education officer Sunita Dhangar said: “We had sought the feedback from the schools. About 60% of the parents had already consented to send their wards to schools. Moreover, most of the teachers have been fully vaccinated.” The report on the feedback from the schools was submitted by the education department to the municipal commissioner. Lata Patil, principal of one of the city-based private schools, said they have already started physical classes for the students of Classes VIII to X, and the response has been so good. “We also had parents asking about Classes I to VII. After the NMC education department’s approval, we will reopen for these classes from Monday,” said Patil. Ratan Luth, an educationist and the chairperson of a private school, said “The Christmas vacation will be starting next week. Therefore, we will start from January 3.” At present, there are 504 civic and private schools in the city with 1.85 lakh students of Classes I to VII. There are 4,714 teachers in these schools. There are 101 municipal schools with 23,440 students and 799 teachers. The remaining 403 schools are private with 1.62 lakh students and 3,915 teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-chief-okays-school-reopening-for-classes-i-to-vii/articleshow/88192913.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Delhi||Cops suspect role of lone wolf in IED blast at Delhi's Rohini court||NEW DELHI: Investigators probing Thursday’s blast at Rohini Courts Complex suspect that a lone wolf or a small group radicalised online by terror recruiters, who may have been instructed to execute a terror strike around the Babri Masjid demolition anniversary, could be behind the incident. “As the security at all installations and on the streets was at a maximum on December 6, it appears the plan might have been pushed forward by two-three days,” said a source. The theory of “online radicals” stems from the fact that the IED was not a sophisticated one and left behind unburnt powder. “This generally occurs when the bomb-making instructions are passed on through chats and videos or the maker learns the steps online, so he’s not able to master the intricate details,” said the source in the security establishment. Police also suspect that the man who planted the IED may have been dressed as a lawyer and entered and exited through the basement. Seven of the eight lifts go to the basement, which have metal detectors and are used by court staff, cops and lawyers. Footage of CCTV cameras installed around the court was being analysed to identify any suspicious vehicle having a lawyer sticker. Another theory by an intelligence source suggested that it could be a “mini dry run” and a bigger blast could be in the works. On May 25, 2011, a low intensity blast took place outside Delhi High Court with no casualties or injuries. Police played down the incident calling it a minor one. Three months later, a powerful explosion rocked the premises killing 15 people and injuring dozens. In May, a low-intensity bomb went off in the parking lot of the high court. No one was injured in that explosion, which was possibly carried using explosives laced with PETN (pentaerythritol trinitrate). The blast in May was the second terror strike within a span of eight months, the previous one being in a car on September 19, 2010 near Jama Masjid for which Indian Mujahideen took responsibility. That blast took place after two men opened fire at a Taiwanese media crew ahead of the Commonwealth Games. Investigators also recalled the September 13, 2008 blast that killed 26 and injured around 65 people. Anti-terror Investigators told TOI that such incidents shouldn’t be ignored on the basis of casualties or injuries or the quantity/quality of explosives. They said mischievous elements could be conducting small drills to check either the security preparedness or their own capabilities. The use of tiffin box bomb was extensively used by Indian Mujahideen a decade ago. Before that, SIMI cadres used them. Of late, modules inspired by Islamic State ideology are trying to replicate them. Delhi Police is on high alert and security checks have been escalated at important installations and markets. “A hawk-eyed vigil is being kept to spot any suspicious entity,” said a senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-suspect-role-of-lone-wolf-in-blast/articleshow/88195629.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Nashik||397 villages in rural Nashik achieve 100% partial vax||Nashik: As many of 397 villages in rural Nashik have achieved 100% partial vaccination of beneficiaries who are 18 years or above, said the health department of Nashik Zilla Parishad. There are over 1,920 villages in the district. District health officer Dr Kapil Aher, said this could be achieved not only due to the efforts of the healthcare workers but also with the help of elected representatives, the employees of all other government departments who created awareness among the beneficiaries asking them to take the vaccine. Nashik taluka (excluding city limits) tops the list with the highest numbers of the village having 100% partial vaccination (vaccinated with the first dose). Trimbakeshwar, Surgana, Kalwan are at the bottom of the list. There are some villages in tribal-dominated talukas like Trimbakeshwar, Surgana and Kalwan, where all beneficiaries have received their first dose. In Nashik taluka, 55 of the 71 villages have 100% eligible beneficiaries with their the first dose complete followed by Baglan taluka where 81 out of 172 villages have reached the 100 %- mark. The authorities said most of the villages touched the 100% mark in the past one month when the special drives were being conducted across the district with the people’s participation especially in the villages where the vaccine hesitancy was huge. “Besides mobilizing the beneficiaries, the health department received valuable support from the government departments and the elected representatives. This is being replicated at all places and we are sure the picture will be much different in one month,” said Dr Kailas Bhoye, the taluka health officer and in charge of vaccination. The number of villages across the district to achieve the feat is just 20% and more efforts are being taken to ensure the number increases. Speaking on few villages in the tribal areas witnessing the 100% vaccination mark, Bhoye said it did not mean the vaccination coverage was low in these villages. “It means that few people who do not stay in the village — who have migrated to some other place in search of work — were either yet to get the dose or their registration is yet to be updated. All such villages have at least crossed the 50%-mark,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/397-villages-in-rural-nashik-achieve-100-partial-vax/articleshow/88192919.cms||Abhilash Botekar

This entire area is fairly close to the Kolhapur city. The local farmers tried to shoo away the bison, but the animal has taken refuge in the sugar cane fields of the Bondre Nagar area in the city. The forest department officials are working to send the animal back to the forest. Clement Ben, chief conservator of forests (territorial) said, “As soon as we got information about the bison, our team reached the area, and our foresters are closely monitoring the animal. By night, the animal will be sent back to the forest. The sugar cane season is going on, and this is the favourite fodder of these animals, so they often leave their habitat." The local residents are worried about the bison sighting within the city limits. Satish Patil, a resident of Padali, said, "On Thursday morning when I was working in my farm, I heard the villagers creating chaos after seeing the bison roaming freely. Even after the bison went inside the sugar cane filed, the local villagers were tensed and preferred staying away from the farmlands." Similarly, on Wednesday, 3 bisons were spotted near Nasrapur phata on Pune-Bangalore National Highway where the forest department and police officials stopped the traffic for around fifteen minutes to give a free corridor to the animals to cross the road and reach the other side of the highway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/bison-spotted-near-kolhapur-foresters-trying-to-send-it-back/articleshow/88192926.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

In all, 14% experienced either of the two and 2% both of them. The survey results also showed that sexual and physical violence was reported across the spectrum, and factors such as marriage period and educational status did not change the scenario drastically. For example, the prevalence (out of every 100 persons surveyed) was the highest at 3.8% among women of 25 to 39 years of age. Against prevalence of 3% in urban areas, it was 3.7% in rural. Those who had higher education reported 2.8% prevalence compared to 3.1% in those who had up to primary or secondary education. Liquor consumption emerged as a major factor as 66% of the women victims of physical and sexual violence said that their spouses consumed liquor regularly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/marriage-length-education-doesnt-matter-in-sexual-violence-in-gujarat-reveals-nhfs/articleshow/88194469.cms||Parth Shastri

The key accused in the case came in contact a few months ago while serving their terms, officers from the prevention of crime branch (PCB) said on Thursday. The investigators said that one of the key accused Nitin Kotvani, who was arrested on Wednesday, revealed the modus operandi. In April this year, Kotvani was arrested in a duplicate sanitizer scam. He got a bail in September. “Kotvani met another key accused Bhajanlal Bishnoi and Hanuman Bishnoi in the jail. Bhajanlal and Hanuman were arrested under the Prohibition Act,” the police said. The trio discussed the plan to earn quick money by manufacturing liquor under the garb of ayurvedic syrup unit. While Kotvani masterminded the racket, Bhajanlal took the manufacturing unit in Sankarda on rent. The trio then roped in other people and began making Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) that used to be supplied to different cities in the state. The cops had seized hundreds of litres of ethanol apart from the machines from the unit during the raid over a week ago. PCB officials said that two of the accused Sunil Pariyani and Bhavesh Sevkani have applied for anticipatory bail but the police have filed an affidavit in the court and opposed the bail application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/plan-to-make-liquor-at-ayurvedic-syrup-unit-hatched-in-vadodara-central-jail/articleshow/88193737.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Assistant commissioner of police (city traffic branch) Sitaram Gaikwad said the department has formed four squads to check whether the norm is being implemented and the failure of the estate managers could invite legal action. The officer said commissioner of police Deepak Pandey has started various campaigns in the city areas to ensure the two-wheeler riders wear helmets while traveling  The move started with the non-cooperation at petrol pumps, where the petrol pump owners were told not to give fuel to those two-wheeler riders, who wearing helmets. Those who were caught without helmets were taken to Nashik First centre for counselling sessions. The police also stepped up the campaign by making the helmets compulsory to enter any parking space, government offices, educational institutions, private establishments, etc. “The flying squads will comprise police sub-inspector and three constables, who will first check the CCTV which has been put up at the entry of the premises to see if the people without helmets are allowed to enter the premises,” Gaikwad said. He said all such establishments, in case of the first violation, will be given an understanding for putting up the necessary things to ensure compliance of ‘no helmet no cooperation’ norms. If it is a second offence, they would be issued a notice. In the third violation, the estate manager of such an establishment will be imprisoned or will have to pay a fine, or even both. Currently, the drive has been stepped up where the helmetless two-wheeler riders are asked to undergo written tests. This is resulting in more people being sent for the tests in a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-4-flying-squads-to-keep-check-on-helmet-norm/articleshow/88192925.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala govt warns of action against striking doctors||THIRUVANTHAPURAM: The state government has warned of strict action against a section of post graduate doctors who have been boycotting non-essential services from Wednesday over the delay in NEET-PG counselling and shortage of junior residents. Health minister Veena George on Thursday said the doctors who put the public healthcare system at risk would be taken to task. “Government has held two rounds of discussions with PG doctors. They were on strike with the demand that admissions to first year PG courses should be expedited. But the state government can do little to speed up that process as the matter is pending before the Supreme Court. In order to address the issue of workload, the government has agreed to appoint non-academic junior residents (NAJR) in hospitals. The strike was withdrawn based on such an assurance. The orders in this regard have also been issued. However, a section of PG doctors have been continuing the strike, causing hindrances in Covid and non-Covid treatment,” the minister said. According to George, the government would be forced to evoke provisions of the prevention of epidemic diseases Act if a section of PG doctors were trying to hold the public health care system in ransom. She said the government has taken a lenient stand towards the demands raised by the PG doctors and attempts to thwart the health care system would be viewed seriously. But protesting doctors spoke equally tough and said they have been airing their grievances for a long time but things have not moved as the government is doing nothing. “We have been working nonstop in the past 18 months... at the moment there is a shortage of around 700 doctors and despite assurances, no appointments are being made. Moreover, we have been demanding a pay hike for long and nothing has happened on that front too, and hence we have no other option but to step up our protests,” said a protesting doctor, adding that they will boycott emergency services from Friday. Rs 14.99cr for e-health programmes in 30 hospsMeanwhile, George said the government has sanctioned Rs 14.99 crore for the immediate rollout of e-health programmes in 30 government general hospitals. “We plan to extend the service of e-health to tertiary care hospitals. Steps have been taken to introduce e-health services in around 600 primary healthcare centres that have been upgraded to family healthcare centres and 12 medical colleges and select general hospitals,” George said. The e-health facility would ensure better OP service without the ordeals associated with the traditional queue system.

---||Delhi||Rohini court blast: Everyone ran for cover in second scare in three months at complex||NEW DELHI: A panic-like situation prevailed at the Rohini Courts Complex after an explosion in a courtroom on Thursday morning. This was the second security scare after a shootout there less than three months ago. However, not many people were there in courtroom number 102 of Metropolitan Magistrate Pritu Raj, where the blast took place. “It was chaotic. As soon as we heard people shouting ‘blast hua’, my friend and I tried to reach a safe place,” said a litigant. Someone screamed “firing”, which led people to run towards the gates on the suspicion that a shootout had taken place between police and criminals. Advocate Akshita, who was talking to a client just outside the courtroom, said a loud sound was heard and she thought it was another shooting incident. “All litigants and advocates started running outside. Later, I came to know that it was a blast,” she added. “We heard a loud sound. We just stopped in our tracks as no one could understand what had happened. The incident occurred around 10.30am. There was no rush as hearings were about to begin. There were no casualties, but one police officer of the naib court got injured,” said a court official. The court official added, “After the blast, all court staffers ran to the back of the courtroom. The judge was brought back to his chamber safely. Police then cordoned off the area and vacated the premises.” Lawyers expressed surprise because security at the complex was increased after the shootout on September 24 when gangster Jitender Gogi was killed. Deployment of security personnel was enhanced and metal detectors were placed at the nine gates of the court. “While a majority of the lawyers usually enter from gate number 4, the general public uses gates 5 and 7,” said a policeman posted at the court. Police said the security personnel even checked the ID cards and vehicles of advocates and they were made to pass through metal detectors. However, Rajeev Kumar, an advocate, said, “There is a huge line of cars in the morning and it’s not possible for police to check every vehicle thoroughly. Miscreants may have taken advantage of this.” An inquiry is being conducted by police to ascertain how someone managed to slip the bag with explosives inside the court by dodging the security apparatus. Meanwhile, bar association members said the situation had not changed despite Delhi High Court taking serious note of the security lapse and issuing directions to Delhi Police. Advocate Vineet Jindal, general Secretary of North Delhi Lawyers’ Association, said in a statement that security lapse in district courts was a great concern for litigants and lawyers. “District courts must have a designated security unit with updated gadgets, then only we can ensure security in them. Judges, advocates and litigants must have a secure environment. Everyone is scared due to the recent incidents in the district courts,” added Jindal. The secretary of Rohini Bar Association, advocate Manjeet Mathur, pointed out that though security had been made more stringent after the shootout, the ground reality told a different picture, which the administration refused to see. “The blame is always put on lawyers after such incidents. But one needs to see the whole picture. It’s not possible to thoroughly check every litigant and lawyer entering and exiting the court multiple times. We had requested the district judges to make the canteen fully functional and allot fixed parking spaces outside the premises. Every lawyer tries to park inside as vehicle parts get stolen frequently,” said Mathur. Mathur remarked, “Making the security arrangements more stringent will not suffice due to the glaring lapses in the inbuilt infrastructure of the court. We have restricted the entry of vehicles without stickers provided by the bar. Paramilitary and police forces are present inside and check everyone entering the premises. But if a lawyer, litigant or a court official needs to go out multiple times, how many times can he/she be checked thoroughly?” Recently, a Delhi court had flagged the issue of security and asked the prosecution naib courts or cops on duty to attend the courts unarmed. Advocate DS Kasana, former secretary of Saket District Court Bar Association, condemned the incident and said judicial officers, lawyers and litigants weren’t safe if anyone could enter the premises with explosives. After the September shootout, a Protection Review Group was to be constituted by Delhi Police to review the security arrangements for district and subordinate courts as well as judges. Security audits were to be held regularly and manpower and equipment was to be checked. The ratio of policemen deployed on the premises was to be increased in proportion to the number of visitors. The deployment of forces was to be decided by the security cell of police headquarters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/everyone-ran-for-cover-in-second-scare-in-three-months-at-complex/articleshow/88195653.cms||Usha Das

Apart from “Why only me?” and “Why should I pay for the test?”, the airport officials have got used to international passengers complaining about the long wait they have to endure to get the RT-PCR test results. Similar scenes were played at the Surat international airport after landing of the Sharjah-Surat in the wee hours of Thursday. Teams of airport staff, airline staff, Surat Municipal Corporation’s health team and laboratory staff were ready to screen the 164 passengers of the flight that landed at around 12.15am. Things were going on smoothly till the airline staff announced the names to 2% passengers, six in case of this flight, who were selected to undergo RT-PCR tests. It was not long before the six passengers — two German passport holders, one woman holding an Australian passport and three Indian citizens — started complaining. The passengers questioned the logic behind testing just a few passengers. “If the government genuinely wants to check the spread of the new variant, they must check all the passengers, not just 2%,” a passenger said. Another passenger complained about being made to pay for the tests. “The government or the airline should pay for the test,” he reasoned. The woman with an Australian passport said that she is not from an ‘at risk’ country still she is put through testing. “My kids are suffering as along with me they too have to wait at the airport till the RT-PCR test results arrive,” she said. As per SOP, travellers are required to pay Rs 2,700 for rapid RT-PCR test, the result of which takes roughly one hour. Passengers can also opt for a regular RT-PCR test that costs Rs 400 but the result of which takes around six hours. When TOI contacted airport officials for their comments, they said, “We have already discounted our 13% royalty. Many passengers protested about the 2% rule and the RT-PCR charges, but they must understand that we are just implementing the SOPs issued by the government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/intl-fliers-question-rt-pcr-charges-new-2-testing-rule/articleshow/88193724.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra government to file plea for local body polls to be deferred||MUMBAI: Concerned about a backlash from the OBC community after the Supreme Court stayed the state’s 27% quota for the community in local body polls, the MVA government has decided to file an affidavit asking for the polls scheduled for December 21 to be held for all seats in all categories or postponed completely. “The view of the Mahavikas Aghadi government is clear. Elections should be conducted for all categories or all elections should be postponed. It will be wrong to hold elections for non-OBC category seats,” said deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.The SC on Monday stayed local body polls in seats reserved for OBC candidates and allowed polls for the rest. A two-judge bench questioned the state for bypassing verdicts on OBC reservation by a Constitutional bench and a three-judge bench. It rapped the government for taking the ordinance route without fulfilling criteria as enumerated by the top court, under which a committee had to collect data on OBC representation and ensure reservation does not breach the 50% ceiling. The bench had said, “Your political compulsion cannot be the basis to undo our judgement” when the state’s counsel argued that no one from OBC community would get representation if the SC ordered a stay. The state election panel has now declared elections in non-OBC seats in 106 nagar panchayats, the zilla parishads of Bhandara and Gondia and 15 panchayat samitis. The next date for hearing in the apex court is December 13. “We will not wait for that date. Instead, we are in the process of filing an intervention application before the court. I am sure we will get justice,” Pawar said. Pawar said a similar situation was witnessed in four to five states, but then the SC had given a different verdict. Food and civil supplies Chhagan Bhujbal also demanded that the Centre provide the state with empirical data in regard to the OBC quota. “If data provided by the Centre can be used for Central schemes, then why can’t it be provided to the state?” he asked. He said it would take 6-8 months for the state backward class commission to gather empirical data on OBCs. Pawar said in a coalition government, one has to take all parties together and it would be wrong to exclude OBCs from the poll process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-to-file-plea-for-local-body-polls-to-be-deferred/articleshow/88195643.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Dinesh Kumar granted the relief to Imam on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 25,000 with one surety of like amount. Imam had moved the court seeking bail after it took cognisance of the chargesheet filed against him in the matter. “Considering the nature of offence, and the fact that he was not arrested during investigation, the application is allowed,” the court said in the order. Imam was booked in the case for the offences of rioting and unlawful assembly. Jamia Millia Islamia students Safoora Zargar and Asif Iqbal Tanha are also accused in the matter. They were granted bail in the case earlier.

Hande is a native of Vadodara in Gujarat. The couple has an eight-month-old son. Tamhane added, “The Handes would pose as customers and pick up two or more chains at a time. His wife used to wear them all at one go to check in a mirror, and would then show that she was returning all the chains. In between, Hande would swiftly collect one of the chains while returning the rest to the salesperson.” On Thursday, the police released Hande after a local court granted him bail. “Hande committed these thefts last month. During questioning, he told us that he had fallen into bad times due to the lockdown and had exhausted all his savings,” said Tamhane.

---||Hyderabad||Shift to pulses, oilseeds: Telangana minister to farmers||HYDERABAD: In a significant move, agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy has written an open letter to farmers of the state, requesting them not to cultivate paddy during the ensuing rabi season and instead shift to less expensive, high-income generating pulses and oilseeds. Training his guns at the Centre in the eight-page letter in Telugu, he stated that the NDA government is issuing inconsistent statements on paddy purchase and the staple’s cultivation in the state on different occasions. “TRS government has recognised the central government’s and the state BJP unit’s double standards, thus we have been sensitising farmers for the past six months to move to alternate crops,” he said in the letter released on Thursday. Taking note of Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s written reply and food and civil supplies minister Piyush Goyal’s statement, the state agriculture minister stated, “At one point, the Centre says it will not take parboiled rice, and agriculture minister says there is no embargo on farmers not to cultivate paddy, confusing the farmers in the state.” According to Niranjan Reddy, the Centre has not lifted the stock from the state for the past one year. “FCI is creating obstacles by not sending rail racks,” he said. “I appeal to the farmers in the state to kindly note these discrepancies in the central government’s statements and attitude and convert to more income-generating crops instead of expecting the Centre to buy paddy,” he said.

---||Hyderabad||Outstanding government guarantee max in Telangana||HYDERABAD: At 9.4%, Telangana has the highest outstanding government guarantee as a percentage of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) at the end of 2019-20 fiscal. Neighbouring Andhra Pradesh is a close second with 8%. The latest State of Finances Report-2021 shows that apart from the two Telugu states, Rajasthan (8%), Chhattisgarh (5.4%) and Punjab (5.1%) make the top five states with high outstanding guarantee. The average guarantee given by states was 3.3% of their aggregate GSDP at the end of 2019-20. At least 16 states are expected to guarantee discoms’ borrowing of Rs 1.36 lakh crore in 2020-21. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has observed that these liabilities are a risk to the state governments owning to the large outstanding debt and losses to state public sector enterprises (SPSEs). State governments issues guarantees to state public sector enterprises’ borrowings from financial institutions for a variety of reasons, including when such a guarantee makes it simpler for SPSEs to get loans. Also, as there are fiscal constraints on freedom for borrowing by states in order to meet requirements of financing infrastructure and compensate for the decreasing capital expenditure, states resort to issuing guarantees on behalf of PSEs undertaking developmental activities. When a state government raises loan directly, it attracts the provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility Budget Management (FRBM) Act. State governments need the central government’s consent to raise any debt if the permission is based on expected GSDP estimates. Earlier, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Centre had allowed states to raise their budget deficit limit from 3% to 5% of GSDP in 2020-21. But even the 2% increase was conditional, including completion of reforms in four areas such as universalisation of ‘One Nation One Ration card’, ease of doing business, power distribution and augmentation of urban local body revenues. While at one level states have been allowed to stretch deficit, the rising guarantees, which are not exactly loans, pose issues of sustainability of state finances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/outstanding-govt-guarantee-max-in-t/articleshow/88194509.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The 22-year-old student, Nikhil Jain, who resided in Undri but hails from Aurangabad, used to visit jewellery shops to purchase gold coins. “After selecting the coin, Jain used to scan the QR code of the jewellery shop for payment through the app,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said. He said, “Such apps show the phone number, the amount sent, a transaction ID, time, and other important details just like authentic apps. However, no money was sent to the jewellery shop owner’s wallet or app.” The commissioner said that by misusing the app, Jain had duped six jewellers from Pimpri Chinchwad, 17 from Pune and two from the district in the last two-and-a-half months. “We have recovered 105gm of gold coins, cellphone and a scooter collectively worth Rs 5.77 lakh from Jain,” he said.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Doctors put agitation on hold for a week after Centre’s assurance||NEW DELHI: The Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) has decided to put their agitation on hold for a week after Union health ministry officials assured them that NEET-PG counselling would be fast-tracked in the court. For the past three days, patients have been suffering outside various hospitals as doctors have suspended OPD and emergency services. FORDA said if their issues were not resolved by December 16, then they would be forced to go for a complete shutdown of all services, except Covid-19, in healthcare institutions. Dr Manish, president, FORDA, said, “A meeting was held with the health minister on Wednesday and he assured us of a positive response. So, we are suspending the protest for a week and all resident doctors will resume work immediately.” He added that they would restart the protest from December 17 if no concrete steps were taken over the reported delay in NEET-PG 2021 counselling. “A plea was issued by MoHFW for fast-tracking the court hearing. We were assured by the Union health minister that the Prime Minister’s Office was also looking into the issue and the process would be completed within a week. Considering the above and looking at the security situation of the nation owing to the untimely demise of Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and other army personnel in a tragic accident, FORDA has decided to hold the agitation for a week after discussing with state RDA representatives in a virtual meeting today,” FORDA said in a statement. Resident doctors of three central hospitals — Ram Manohar Lohia, Safdarjung and Lady Hardinge — on November 27 suspended OPD services in protest against the repeated delay in conducting NEET-PG 2021 counselling. Admission to various courses has been delayed indefinitely following the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/docs-put-agitation-on-hold-for-a-week-after-centres-assurance/articleshow/88195190.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Curbing vehicle emission tops Maharashtra climate change plan||MUMBAI: Maharashtra’s City Action Plan for Climate Change submitted under the National Clean Air Programme on Thursday has suggested that mitigating vehicular emissions is the state’s top challenge in managing air pollution, especially in Mumbai. Of the 806 measures listed to control air pollution, vehicular emission measures comprise the major chunk at 314. This is followed by industrial emissions with 139 measures and resuspended dust 108. Among all the measures, those for Mumbai that are likely to cost Rs 17,000 crore top the list. These measures include 21 actions to reduce vehicular pollution, 11 to tackle industrial pollution and 7 to reduce resuspended dust. The measures are intended for 17 cities and Vasai-Virar. Around 4 actions each to make construction activities dust-proof and arrest biomass and waste burning, and 2 to reduce pollution due to diesel generation sets have also been listed out for Mumbai.  Experts, though, said the measures differed based on their impact and location and do not give the estimate of actual reduction in carbon emissions as per national targets. “All city action plans have categorised control options into high, medium or low impact without a definition, measure or uniformity. For instance, black-topping of roads is expected to have a ‘high impact’ in Pune but ‘low impact’ in Solapur. Similarly, implementation timelines of short, mid and long term are not defined either. Use of LPG in hotels and ‘dhabas’ is listed as a ‘long term’ control option in Vasai-Virar but a ‘short term’ action in Thane and Navi Mumbai and ‘mid term’ in Amravati,” stated an analysis of the plan by Climate Trends, a research and communications agency. On the ground, even officials point to the need for systems for better coordination. Mangesh Dighe, environment officer, Pune Municipal Corporation, said, “There are many action plans at the state and the Centre level, and we should integrate all in the city action plan but it is very challenging. Thus, participation of urban agglomerations is important to create a ‘project implementation unit’ which can collect data from all departments and put it on Prana (Portal for Regulation of Air pollution in Non-Attainment cities).”  Tanushree Ganguly of Council on Energy, Environment and Water said now 80% of the funds received under 15th finance commission grant will go to promoting e-vehicles. Professor Abhishek Chakraborty, IIT Bombay, said, “We need digitised emission inventories that are updated annually.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/curbing-vehicle-emission-tops-maharashtra-climate-change-plan/articleshow/88195687.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

---||Ahmedabad||Farmers call off strike, Gujarat State Petronet Ltd's cross-country pipeline project back on track||AHMEDABAD: The farmers protesting at borders of the national capital deciding to call off their year-long protest comes as a major relief to Gujarat State Petronet Ltd (GSPL) for its ambitious cross-country gas pipeline project linking Mehsana in Gujarat to Bathinda in Punjab. The 1,625-km pipeline, with an estimated project cost of Rs 5,500 crore passes through Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab. It was stuck in the three states outside Gujarat for about a year, as some farmers in these three states refused to part with their land for the project till their pending demands with the Centre were met. In all, work on 50-60km of the underground pipeline could not be completed due to the farmers protests, said a state government official with direct knowledge of the project. A major part of the incomplete pipeline project, about 45km in Punjab, has seen fresh discussions starting with farmers over the last few days, the official added. At Sirsa in Haryana, some 100-150 farmers who were protesting had set up a base close to the 6km stretch near the highway where the pipeline is to be laid. “They have all agreed to extend support the project after Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month announced the repealing of the three farm laws that were enacted in September last year. In Rajasthan too, problems have been resolved. In fact, the work on the pipeline in these two states will be completed very soon,” said another Gujarat government official. The natural gas trunk pipeline project, which passes through Ajmer in Rajasthan, also faced delays in implementation near Jaipur during the second wave of Covid-19 due to labour issues. A consortium led by GSPL has formed a special purpose vehicle called GSPL India Gasnet Ltd to implement the project. GSPL has a 52% stake in the SPV, with Indian Oil Corp Ltd holding 26%, and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd having 11% each. The project comprises a 840-km main line of 36 inches diameter and a 785km spur line with 24 inch, 18 inch, 12 inch and 8 inch diameters. The pipeline project is part of Prime Minister Modi’s plan for the National Gas Grid. The pipeline will supply gas to fertilizer companies, refineries and city gas distributors along the route, who have already signed gas offtake pacts. The Rajasthan government recently said it plans to facilitate industrial growth along the Mehsana-Bathinda gas pipeline project in sectors like ceramics, glass, metal casting, textile and others. “In Punjab, GSPL will have to re-negotiate the compensation amount offered to farmers through whose land the pipeline will pass. The revised prices will have to be on lines of compensation offered by GAIL recently for their project in the same region,” said an industry expert. Ushering in Change: The pipeline will traverse through Gujarat (47km), Rajasthan (1,334km), Haryana (200km) and Punjab (66km). It will connect operational LNG terminals in Gujarat at Dahej, Hazira and Mundra and upcoming ones at Chhara and Jafrabad in Gujarat It will supply gas to fertilizer companies, refineries and city gas distributors along the route, who have already signed gas offtake pacts. It will connect Indian Oil Corp’s Panipat refinery, HPCL-Mittal Energy’s Bathinda refinery and HPCL’s under-construction refinery at Barmer, among others||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/farmers-call-off-strike-gujarat-state-petronet-ltds-cross-country-pipeline-project-back-on-track/articleshow/88194545.cms||Maulik Pathak

Water minister Satyendar Jain visited the site on Thursday and said that the trapping and treatment processes had started at a sewage treatment plant in Narela for this purpose. Delhi Jal Board plans to increase the capacity of the Narela sewage treatment plant from 10 million gallons per day to 20 million gallons per day, allowing for the treatment of sewage water flowing in from Haryana into the Yamuna. With this treated water, the government will revive a lake in Tikri Khurd and the remaining treated water will be discharged back into the drain, which further meets the Yamuna. In 2018, the National Green Tribunal had directed the city government to take up the restoration work of the lake, which was falling victim to unauthorised encroachments. “Revitalising the lake will not only save the environment from contamination but will also help in improving the depleting groundwater level in Delhi and simultaneously improve the natural ecosystem,” said Jain. “The neighbouring states are continuously diverting sewage water and industrial waste into the Yamuna, which is condemnable and worrying,” the minister further stated.

---||Vijayawada||Vijaywada: Pump station sends home muddy water||VIJAYAWADA: Dirty water pumped through pipelines of the Rural Water Supply scheme has raised concerns among residents of Kanchikacherla and Veerlapadu mandals. The water, brown in colour and with a foul smell, is being supplied through water connections and is unfit for use. Locals of Kanchikacherla complained that the problem started from the third week of November. Sources at Kanchikacherla panchayat claim that a newly constructed approach road for the sand ramp beside the Munnaluru water pumping station at the Krishna river has affected the quality of water. Kanagala Ravi Kumar, EO of the panchayat raj department, said, “A stream was diverted and as a result the water level at Chevitikallu and other pumping stations reduced significantly. A minimum of seven feet is needed at a water pumping plant. But the level fell to three feet after the road for the sand reach was constructed. Stagnant water is entering the pump and there will be a total lapse in water supply if this continues for another 10 days.” Meanwhile, locals in the area fumed at the mining authorities for constructing a barrier obstructing the flow of the river. “Around 1.5 lakh people are dependent on drinking water at Kanchikacherla and Veerlapadu. Mining authorities are neglecting us for the sake of making money by selling sand. We are facing problems with sand mining. Though the government took charge of sand mining, it is ignoring the guidelines of the National Green Tribunal and obstructing the natural flow of the river. Government should take immediate action,” Chanumolu Saidulu, Left leader and environmental activist from Kanchikacherla, told TOI.

---||Vijayawada||AP reels from shortage of forensic docs||Visakhapatnam: Shortage of forensic doctors in Andhra Pradesh has become a major problem as each year more than 25,000 autopsies are conducted at different government hospitals and Vaidya Vidhana Parishad hospitals. The number of forensic experts is not sufficient so that medical authorities are availing the service of MBBS doctors and others. The entire state has around 50 forensic doctors in government sector who are eligible to do autopsies. Though the state has 21 PG seats in 11 colleges in forensic medicine (FM), disinterest of medicos leads to fewer number of takers. The situation is more or less same not only in Telangana, but across nation. A retired professor in forensic medicine said there are 551 forensic medicine PG seats in 192 colleges in the country but only 30% of the seats are filled every year. Students are not opting for the FM branch in many colleges. “If you take the case of Andhra Medical College (AMC), only 17 forensic medicine PGs joined and completed the course while 40 seats were available in the last one decade,” says the head of the department of forensic medicine and toxicology, AMC, Dr. V Chandra Sekhar, who is a retired major of Indian army. Presently, Telangana has 27 PG seats in seven colleges in the FM branch. Out of the 21 seats in AP, seven seats are in private colleges and the remaining are in six government medical colleges. Out of 27 seats in Telangana, Osmania Medical College has 10 seats, and Gandhi college has five seats. But, only 25% to 30% of seats are filled every year. “The AMC in Vizag did not have a professor in the wing for almost six years from 2014 to 2020. Forensic medicine doctors should be given extra incentives like in a few other states which are giving Rs 1000 to Rs 2000 for each autopsy. Because there will not be any private practice for them unlike other doctors,” Chandra Sekhar said. “The government should appoint more FM doctors in district hospitals. They appointed one doctor each in all 13 districts on a contract basis recently. When there is no scope for an FM doctor to grow up financially, nobody would take up this branch,’ a PG student commented. No one wishes to get branded as ‘Savala Doctor’ (mortuary doctor) unless they get a better salary and better facilities, because it’s a risky job as they deal with dead bodies, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-reels-from-shortage-of-forensic-docs/articleshow/88193776.cms||Siva G

This unique concept was implemented in primary schools on the directions of EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand to highlight academic achievements, infrastructure facilities and other details. “Each school’s website has information related to online teaching, students, employees and infrastructure. Anyone can access this information at any time. All websites are being updated regularly and their links provided on the newly established EDMC Management Information System portal,” said a senior EDMC official. There are 368 schools under EDMC out of which 11 are aided. They have 2.3 lakh students now compared with 1.6 lakh students enrolled last year. “During the pandemic, many private and model schools closed down and the children transferred to our schools. We assured the parents to provide better facilities. The initiatives taken in the recent past include opening of one English section in each class,” an education department official. The EDMC website will have all details, such as number of classrooms, washrooms, playground, teachers, their qualifications, students, activities performed (with pictures), class-wise syllabus, circulars issued, performance and history. “This will help parents compare the schools and make their choice for enrolling their child accordingly. They need not visit the school every time,” the official said. “It will also become easier for the education department to get updated information without pursuing it with the zonal offices or the schools,” added the official. The new system would also give details of online classes taken by teachers every day and allow more participants to connect. The official said, “We have around 2.2 lakh students taking online classes. To trace the remaining 10,000, we carried out a drive in September but only 3% could be found.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/all-edmc-schools-now-have-their-own-websites/articleshow/88195667.cms||Vibha Sharma

The district health department said 44,000 vaccine doses were delivered on Thursday, taking the total vaccination score of Thane district to 1,00,36,649 compared with Mumbai’s 1.69 crore and Pune’s 1.39 crore so far. Officials said as many as 60.6 lakh first doses have been delivered till date while 39.7 lakh residents are fully vaccinated. Around 14 lakh residents of the total 74 lakh target population scheduled for vaccination are still to take the first shot of the vaccine in the district though, said officials. “We are delivering an average of 50,000 doses daily at around 500 centres across the district,” said officials. The pace of vaccination had slowed in the past few weeks, following which several corporations here started door-to-door vaccination facilities, adding numbers. The ratio of fully vaccinated residents here is higher than the state. “While the state records a 47.8% full vaccination ratio, the same in Thane district is 52.1%,” said the district health administration via a press statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/after-mumbai-pune-vax-in-thane-crosses-1-crore-mark/articleshow/88195229.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Kin of 60,000 Covid victims apply for Rs 50,000 compensation||PUNE: Relatives of nearly 60,000 people who died of Covid-19 have so far submitted applications on a recently launched state government website seeking an ex gratia payment of Rs 50,000 each. The Maharashtra government had last week launched the website, mahacovid19relief.in, for Covid victims’ kin to apply for ex gratia payment. A senior official in the state disaster management department said, “The applications have come from all districts. After scrutinizing the applications, the respective local authorities will start releasing the amount. We should be able to start releasing it soon.” Maharashtra has so far registered around 1.4 lakh deaths due to Covid and has to allocate a little over Rs 700 crore towards disbursal of the ex gratia amount. Earlier, the government had suggested the applicants could approach the collectors’ offices for the ex gratia. However, on realizing this would delay the process, the state government launched the website for the Covid victims’ kin to directly apply for the ex gratia. The applicants can log on to the website with the cellphone numbers and must fill up the details of the deceased, along with their Aadhaar numbers. There is also an option to upload the death certificates and hospital details on the website. The centralised website is directly linked with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “With the Aadhaar card numbers, the government will get all the details of the deceased person. This will ensure that the process is transparent and fast,” the official said.. Families without RT-PCR and RAT results and Covid death certificates would also get the ex gratia if the person for whom the ex gratia is being sought, died within 30 days of being clinically diagnosed with Covid in a hospital. All claims must be settled within 30 days of submission of documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-kin-of-60000-covid-victims-apply-for-rs-50k-compensation/articleshow/88195236.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||Days that turned into a year: Farmers at Delhi's Singhu border dismantle protest||NEW DELHI: An engineer by education and farmer by profession, Basant Singh of Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab inspected the small house he had erected in the middle of GT-Karnal Road at Singhu border a year ago. Then with a sigh, he began dismantling it. He had erected 2-feet tall brick walls and joined them with light cement.  Within this space, he had put up awnings over a tractor trolley. This became his cabin with an air conditioner. There was space enough for a small lawn with two chairs and planters with hibiscus and roses. “We came here thinking it would be a matter of few days and we would make do with the tents and tractor trollies. But the blame-game began and we realised it would take a long time for the central government to agree to our demands,” said Basant. “The day has finally come when we will leave this place. We will return home on Saturday and have started winding up here.” The 30-year-old farmer isn’t dismayed by the year-long wait for the government to accede to the farmers demands on repealing three central laws. But he said the issues raised by the farmers needed to be given more attention. “I am a farmer by choice. But I also know there is a dearth of other jobs,” said Basant. “If the agriculture sector is not rewarding, where will the youth go?” As the farmer leaders formally announced the termination of their protest on Thursday and called upon the agitators to leave Delhi from December 11, the task of dismantling the micro town that had risen up at Singhu border began. “We have been told to start moving out from December 11. We will, of course, have a celebration before that, but not on Friday because that day, the last rites of the chief of defence staff general Bipin Rawat, and others will be performed,” said Jaswant Singh, 60, of Ludhiana. On Thursday, big speakers atop tractors played Punjabi songs louder than usual and the protesters happily danced through the day. “We have suspended the protest but will come back if the government reneges on its promises,” warned Karnal Singh, a farmer in his 60s from Ludhiana. “It won’t take us man days to set up an entire city here again.” Many farmers were relaxed for the first time in many months. Octogenarian Amrik Singh of Moga was joined by his comrades, among them Jagroop Singh, 62, of Fazilka and Maluk Singh, 59, of Moga, in a card game. “Don’t think we simply sat here playing cards,” smiled an emotional Amrik. “The rains were challenging and the summer was harsh. Many people returned to the village in the summer, but we sustained the protest. This victory is for the next generation.” Meanwhile, Saroop Singh, a young kabaddi player, detailed the arrangements made for boarding, lodging and fooding for over a thousand protesters at the deserted KFC Tower, a shopping mall at Singur. “The kabaddi league players received help from sponsors and we had over a thousand volunteers coming every day to look after he needs of the protesters, including setting up a langar at a cost of Rs 4.5 lakh,” said Saroop. The thought in their minds, as they brought down the huts and tents that stretched for kilometres was that Delhi wasn’t so far after all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/days-that-turned-into-a-year-farmers-at-singhu-border-dismantle-protest/articleshow/88195241.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Delhi||AAP, BJP spar over ‘sale of hospital plots’ by corpn||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party functionary Dilip Pandey on Thursday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led North Delhi Municipal Corporation has marked plots for sale meant for building hospitals, toilets, and night shelters for the poor. Delhi BJP, however, said the allegations are baseless. “The BJP-led north corporation is planning to sell about 132 plots of land in Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar at abysmal, throwaway prices — selling them off at circle rates,” Pandey said. Pandey claimed that out of the 132 plots, 94 had been carved out of larger pieces of land that had been dedicated to community facilities like toilets, parks, food joints, etc. “They sold the land of Novelty Cinema, which was valued at Rs 150 crores in the market, for a mere Rs 36 crores. The civic bodies want to sell off and profit from the land in places like Gandhi Market, Shiva Market, and others since it knows it cannot return once it’s ousted from the corporation,” he said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that the party “strongly condemns the daily diatribe of AAP leaders” against north corporation to level “unfounded” corruption charges. Kapoor said that AAP leaders had levelled the same allegations earlier, too, and if they believe that there is any irregularity in any property deal of the civic body, they should ask Delhi government to order an inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-bjp-spar-over-sale-of-hospital-plots-by-corpn/articleshow/88195679.cms||---

---||Trichy||NEP a revolutionary document: Guv||Trichy: The National Education Policy is a revolutionary document aimed at creating an India of the dreams of Bharathidasan and his mentor Subramaniya Bharathi, governor and chancellor of Bharathidasan University, R N Ravi, said here on Thursday.Addressing the 37th convocation of the university, the governor said NEP 2020 lays thrust on clearing certain hurdles in the present education system. “It envisions an education system rooted in the Indian ethos enabling the transformation of Bharat into an equitable and vibrant knowledge society. All educational institutions, primary to tertiary, must commit to providing affordable, high-quality education to all,” he said. “Bharathidasan dedicated his life to the freedom of India from colonial rule and also for eradication of evils that had permeated our society and perverted it. Through his revolutionary writings for freedom and justice, he inspired the youth and galvanized society. His dream was to build a “Puthiyathor Ulagam Seivom” which means “a new world, a new India,” he added. The governor rued that a large number of freedom fighters still remain unknown and unsung. “Bharathidasan University should survey the area of its coverage, dig up those heroes and build profiles of their contributions lest they are lost forever,” Though India had done well in managing the Covid situation under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi and with the cooperation of the state governments, he asked people to be more vigilant. The governor had some advice to offer to the graduates. “I urge you to ‘Perisaa Yaoseenga’ (think big), ‘Perisaa kanavu kaanunga’ (dream big), ‘Kashtapattu velai seiyunga’ (work hard), ‘Thannambikkaiyoda Irunga’ (be confident). If you do so, ‘Ulagam ungal vasamaagum’ (the world becomes yours),” he said. Earlier, the governor gave away graduation certificates to 2,139 students who completed PhD, 42 PG and 44 UG rank holders. In all, 1.04 lakh graduates including 70,520 women were also given away graduate certificates in absentia for two academic years. Due to Covid-19, last year's convocation did not happen.Speaking on the occasion, higher education minister K Ponmudi batted for a two-language policy in states and urged the Centre to support it. In Tamil Nadu, he said students should learn two languages such as Tamil and English. At the same time, they can also learn a third language as they wish. But that should not be compulsory, he said. “So, I appeal to our governor to kindly support the policy. Let us have two languages – English for international knowledge and Tamil for local understanding. Let the students choose their third language, whether it is Hindi, Telugu or Malayalam,” he stated. He said a total of 1,06,231 were conferred convocation certificates. Among them 71,774 (68%) were females and 34,457 (32%) males. “That is why I say the Sangam period is back. In the Sangam period, both male and female poets were there. However, due to various invasions during the middle age period, everything turned upside down. Again, women are very much interested in education of their wards, particularly girl children,” he said. The minister added that the government has exempted students from remitting fees in government arts colleges to encourage more to pursue higher education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/nep-a-revolutionary-document-guv/articleshow/88195245.cms||---

Ravi paid tribute to General Rawat by placing a wreath before his portrait on the Bharathidasan University (BDU) campus before attending the convocation of the university in the morning. Ravi, who was serving in the prime minister’s office (PMO) then, said the question before the government was how to respond. “GoI used to have a policy of giving a protest. PM in his characteristic way of functioning said no to it. The political decision was backed by the military planning and strategy of General Rawat,” said Ravi. Expressing shock and sadness at his death, the governor said India has lost a great military leader. Higher education minister K Ponmudi, school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, Trichy collector SSivarasu were among others who paid homage to Rawat at BDU. The governor had a darshan at Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple in the morning.

---||Delhi||Commuters relieved as highways all set to get ‘wider’ again||New Delhi: With the farmers now packing up to leave the protest site at Singhu after a year, the local residents are heaving a sigh of relief for the ease they hope will now come in commuting. However, the passages there — both National Highway 44 and the local Kundli road — have to be repaired after over 12 months of non-maintenance due to the farmers sit-in. NH44 is a six-lane highway with two service lanes running parallel to it. With the protesters occupying much of it, vehicles especially the heavy trucks, were able to use only a tiny portion of the width. Sachin Kumar Singh, who lives in Kundli, commuting had been hit by this and affected the businesses along NH44. The heavy commercial vehicle took to the narrow village lanes to reach Delhi and this has taken a toll on the local roads. Singh said, “The only motorable route through Singur border is now heavily damaged. There are huge craters filled with water. In some places, the road is so decrepit that the dust makes it difficult to keep the eyes open. I hope repairing the roads gets come attention now.” Another local, Satender Sangwan, pointed out that more than the highway, it was the service roads that required urgent repairs. “These always had craters and portholes, and when in a matter of time these lanes began taking on the road load after the main road was closed by the protests, its condition only worsened. The authorities know this lane was being used during the protest but didn’t take care to have it fixed up,” alleged Sangwan. At Singhu village, people are hoping for a change. “There was a 1-km gap between the police barricades on NH44 and the protest dais. So there was always traffic jams on the roads passing through the village,” noted Arun Gupta, a Singhu local. “We hope that with the protest ending, the government will quickly restore the village roads that bore the load of the highway for a year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/commuters-relieved-as-highways-all-set-to-get-wider-again/articleshow/88195248.cms||Kushagra Dixit

Around 50 girl students shared their ordeal of having faced abuses, including sexual, through the questionnaires handed over to them. The district administration had launched the programme on November 26 with five teams of officers fanning across the 201 schools in the district. The teams issued a questionnaire seeking personal details of the students — name, class, school, address, parents’ mobile number — and information on sexual abuse faced by them or their friends at school or near their houses. It also asked them if they faced abuses through social media and mobile phones besides asking them if they need any counselling.The teams collected questionnaires from 26,085 children of Classes IX to XII in 201 schools. After perusing the replies, collector Dr T Prabhushankar said the replies of 49 girls were found significant. Nine girls revealed that either they or their friends were subjected to sexual abuses. Four others insisted on bringing the perpetrators of child sexual abuses before the court of law. The scrutiny found that 19 girls were in need of psychological counselling to rid them of various issues weighing them down. Six girls revealed that they were being harassed by some people on their regular route to school. A girl raised apprehension over the likely child marriage awaiting her and appealed to save her from it. A team comprising the collector, superintendent of police P Sundaravadivel, officials of the district child protection unit (DCPU), ChildLine helpline and other stakeholders had a meeting to discuss the next course of action on Thursday. “We discussed as to how to take it forward carefully to provide solution to the girl children who raised the issues. In some cases, the team needs to enquire further to get a clear picture,” the collector told TOI. Beyond the complaints of sexual abuse and harassment, the children also raised social problems also. Two girls appealed to the district administration to sort out the lack of basic amenities in their area. A Class XI girl even expected the district administration to help her financially in pursuing plus-two. The questionnaire informed the girl students to send ‘Hi’ message to 8903331098 through WhatsApp if they need the help of the district administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/schoolgirls-in-karur-reveal-instances-of-abuse-in-survey/articleshow/88195240.cms||Gokul Rajendran
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat high court reunites interfaith couple||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday reunited an interfaith couple who had eloped last year, but were separated after they were tracked down. The Hindu man was arrested on charges of rape and violation of the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act (Pocso) and the Muslim girl was put in a shelter home in Junagadh for more than a year. According to the case details, the couple are from Kodinar block in Gir Somnath district. In August last year, they eloped and the girl’s father lodged an FIR against the man accusing the 22-year-old of rape and violation of the Pocso Act, because the girl was a minor at the time. Police nabbed them in November. As there were criminal charges against the man, police arrested him and sent him to judicial custody. They sent the girl to a shelter home in Junagadh, Shraddhar Gruh. For nearly 10 months, the couple could not communicate because the man was in jail and girl was at the shelter home and was not allowed to meet anyone. In September, the high court granted bail to the man, who tried to contact the girl but did not succeed. He moved the high court through advocate Prashant Chavda and filed a habeas corpus petition, stating that his beloved was an adult and had been kept at the shelter home illegally and against her will. He also cited the girl’s statement during the trial, showing that she told the sessions court that she was in love with this man, but as they are from different religions, their families were averse to their union. She was engaged to a man she did not like and therefore decided to elope with her boyfriend. She wanted to marry the accused. After perusing the documents, the high court summoned the girl and asked what she wished. She told the judges that she would like to go with the man and they would get married. The HC ordered to free her, “…considering her age and willingness, we set her free to join the company of petitioner”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-reunites-interfaith-couple/articleshow/88194592.cms||---

Priya Parikh, a resident of Subhanpura, told the police that her husband Bhavin Parikh took loans in her name and didn’t pay the instalments. Priya also alleged that Bhavin married her without divorcing his first wife. According to her complaint, she met Bhavin when she was working for a firm in Ahmedabad. Priya, who was previously married, had divorced her first husband in 2014. Bhavin told her that he too was a divorcee and proposed to her for marriage. The couple tied the nuptial knots in August 2014. After staying in Ahmedabad for a year-and-a-half, they shifted to Bhavin’s house in Vadodara. But Priya didn’t get along with Bhavin’s mother and sister so they shifted to rented accommodation in Subhanpura. Priya alleged in her complaint that Bhavin started his own business and told her to open a bank account in her name. He then took credit cards in her name and took loans worth lakhs of rupees. But he couldn’t pay back the loans and Priya said that he spent the money for some personal purposes. Bhavin then convinced her to mortgage her family’s house to take a loan of Rs 15 lakh. He paid some instalments and then didn’t pay the loan EMIs. She learnt that he had used the money again for some personal purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/woman-files-rs-29l-cheating-plaint-against-her-husband/articleshow/88193772.cms||---

Top officials in the APSRTC have told the officials at Vizag not to give the huge building in front of the complex on long lease as there is a plan to build new terminal with smart facilities. The RTC complex is well known as Dwaraka Bus Station (DBS) complex, which is one of the major bus stations in AP. Apart from buses to various cities across the state, the bus station also operates services to major cities in Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. The complex has a separate city bus terminus. Regional manager of APSRTC, Visakhapatnam, A Appala Raju, told TOI that there is a proposal for a modern bus terminal as part of Smart Cities Mission. “Around 1,911 buses including 904 city buses and 1,014 rural buses to various destinations pass through the complex every day with passenger number crossing 60,000,” Appala Raju said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/new-smart-bus-terminal-at-dbs-in-next-five-years/articleshow/88193813.cms||Siva G

It was supposed to be the first public event with 90-100 students following strict Covid protocols. Last year’s convocation was held online on account of the pandemic. The circular, issued on Thursday morning, mentioned that the convocation was postponed due to unavoidable circumstances and a new date would be announced soon. University officials claimed that they were informed about the postponement from ‘higher authorities’ without attributing any reason. An official said that it was anyway supposed to be a low-key affair due to the pandemic. Around 18 medallists and one parent were called along with 60-70 PhD holders for the convocation. While two doses of vaccination was mandatory for all invitees, those with one dose were asked to get a RT-PCR negative report. A few senate members speculated that the postponement could be because of vice-chancellor Suhas Pednekar’s ongoing quarantine period. A member said Pednekar returned from Europe last week and was asked to follow strict quarantine. “This is his last convocation as a vice-chancellor. He is set to retire next year,” said the member. An official, however, claimed that the directive probably came from the governor’s office, who was chief guest at the event. But a source from the governor’s office said that all other events on Friday are on schedule. Another official attributed the postponement to mark respect to General Bipin Rawat, whose funeral will be held on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mu-postpones-convocation-at-11th-hour/articleshow/88195244.cms||---

He got admission to the University of Adelaide in July 2020 but could not be on campus as the country closed its borders due to Covid pandemic. After waiting for over 17 months during which he began online studies by opting for two subjects per semester, Mistry is now ready to fly and start on-campus education. “Earlier, the Australian government said that the borders will reopen from December 1, but due to omicron variant, the plan has been revisited. As per the latest government guidelines, the border will now reopen from December 15,” said Mistry. Thousands of students in the city, hoping to study in Australia, are working on their travel plans. From December 15, fully vaccinated international students can travel to participating states and territories in Australia, quarantine-free without needing to apply for a travel exemption, according to the official website of Department of Home Affairs, Australian government. Bhavin Thakker, a visa consultant, said that there are about 22,000 students from India who are expected to travel to Australia this year. Ritesh Desai, also a visa consultant from the city, said students from India have started looking to other overseas options like the US, Canada and the UK after Australia closed its borders for such a long time. The ticket prices from Ahmedabad to Australia have soared from about Rs 50,00 per ticket to Rs 1.25 lakh following the announcement to reopen borders from December 15, he further said. Harsh Prajapati, who took admission at Southern Cross University, in June 2020 has attended three semesters online. He is now ready to fly on December 19, and fulfill his dreams to study on campus in Australia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/students-prepare-to-fly-as-oz-opens-borders/articleshow/88195689.cms||---

---||Delhi||Faulty answer key in CBSE Hindi paper, rectified after complaint||NEW DELHI: A wrong answer key was sent to schools by Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Thursday for Term 1 Hindi test of Class X. As teachers found the results of a particular question paper set unusual during evaluation, they complained to the board, following which a revised key was sent. According to a principal, the board had to send the revised key for one set. “Such a thing has never happened. The keys are sent when evaluation start. Obviously, teachers had to re-evaluate and upload the papers, so it was extra work,” said another principal. With the Term 1 examination being multiple-choice questions, the students fill in the answers in an OMR sheet, and the evaluation takes place on the day of a test itself. “As we were doing the evaluation, the performance of students was below average. Not a single student scored above 15 in the bundle I had. We kept insisting that the answer key is problematic, it needs to be rechecked,” said a teacher who is part of the evaluation at a private school. “Once we had finished, the coordinators came running and asked us to stop the evaluation. This was because the answer key issued by CBSE was wrong.” The teacher added that CBSE then uploaded a new answer key. “We did the evaluation all over again. The student who got 11/40 earlier now scored 39/40. Just imagine if there was no human intervention in between!” CBSE did not respond to the query on the matter. Some principals also claimed there was a delay in sending the code for downloading and printing the question papers. “In my school, it was not a problem because just around 150 students took the exam. But in schools with over 300 students, it is a time-consuming process, adding to the stress,” said a principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/faulty-answer-key-in-cbse-hindi-paper-rectified-after-complaint/articleshow/88195683.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Amid Omicron concerns, threefold rise in mask sales||AHMEDABAD: As the new cases of Covid-19 begin showing a steady rise along with the added concern of the new Omicron variant, people have surely pulled their guards up. Clearly, the sale of masks as well as immunity boosters has increased threefolds in the past one week, according to estimates by Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists’ Association (FGSCDA). In the past week, an estimated 10 lakh disposable masks and 3 lakh N95 masks were sold across Gujarat on a daily basis, suggest FGSCDA estimates. Gujarat is home to at least 24,000 chemists and pharmacies. Alpesh Patel, chairman, FGSCDA, said, “With a steady rise in cases, people have their guards up. Especially with fewer restrictions on gatherings and public movements in place, people are exercising caution and are becoming increasingly careful and are choosing to wear masks at offices and other public places. As a consequence, the sales have gone up.” Gujarat reported some 70 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Friday till 5pm, according to data provided by the state government. Even the demand for sanitisers has gone up by at least 50%, according to estimates by chemists. “In November, the sales of both masks as well as sanitisers had drastically dropped with barely any demand. However, over the past week to 10 days, the demand has once again begun picking up. People come asking for N95 masks as well as sanitisers,” said Ankur Aggarwal, co-founder, Medkart. The sale of immunity boosters is also seeing a marginal increase. “So far, there is no exceptional demand for Covid-related medicines. However, some customers who had stopped purchasing immunity boosters such as vitamin C have once again begun placing orders for these medicines, ” said an Ahmedabad-based chemis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/omicron-concerns-threefold-rise-in-mask-sales/articleshow/88195685.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: V Vijayasai Reddy seeks Centre’s nod for additional borrowing||VIJAYAWADA: YSRC Parliamentary party leader and Rajya Sabha member V Vijayasai Reddy on Thursday requested the Central government to give permission to Andhra Pradesh for additional borrowing to meet the welfare and development agenda. Making a special mention in Rajya Sabha, the MP said Andhra Pradesh is a different state with revenue deficit caused by bifurcation. “The unscientific bifurcation of the state had left huge burden of revenue deficit,” he said and asserted that it could not be treated on par with the rest of the states. While stating that “every state strives to achieve higher growth trajectory” Vijayasai Reddy asserted that Andhra Pradesh, under the leadership of Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, is second to none. However, since bifurcation, injustice has been done to residuary Andhra Pradesh, he said. He further added that most revenue sources have gone to Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh is still reeling under deficit due to the unscientific division. Despite these hurdles, Vijayasai Reddy said, the chief minister has been able to steer the state, with little help from the Centre, towards welfarism through Navaratnalu, the state’s nine flagship schemes focusing on welfare and development. He said the Union finance minister allowed 7 states to additionally borrow 0.5 per cent of GSDP since they completed 45 per cent of capex in the first half of current fiscal. “This condition of capex investment is highly unjustified for Andhra Pradesh, considering that it faces a deficit since bifurcation,” he observed. He welcomed the statement of the finance minister that she would hold discussions with states to address the state-level challenges and help create more opportunities for boosting investments. Vijayasai Reddy requested the finance minister to treat Andhra Pradesh distinctly and permit its government to borrow additional 0.5 per cent of GSDP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vijayasai-seeks-centres-nod-for-addl-borrowing/articleshow/88193827.cms||Gopi Dara

---||Kochi||Common mental disorders not linked to incident diabetes: Study||Kochi: There is no direct relationship between common mental disorders and incident diabetes, shows a study from Kerala. Presence of moderate to severe depression and anxiety symptoms in individuals, who are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, were studied over a two-year period. Researchers also examined the relationship between depressive symptoms, anxiety and incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. For the study, data from the Kerala diabetes prevention program, a cluster-randomized controlled trial for diabetes prevention among 1,007 high-risk adults was used. They were tracked for two years from 2013 to 2015, and the results of the study was published recently. Though researchers couldn’t establish a direct relationship between common mental disorders and incident diabetes (new-onset diabetes in individuals without prevalent diabetes at baseline), the findings suggest that the prevalence of depression and anxiety were higher than those previously reported in the general population. “What is concerning is that there are mild depression and anxiety symptoms in those at high risk to develop type 2 diabetes, which may turn to moderate or severe over the years. However, we don’t know whether there is a direct relation between mild common mental disorders and incident diabetes as we also have other risk factors such as obesity and physical inactivity here,” said Dr K R Thankappan, department of public health and community medicine, Central University of Kerala, who is also part of the study. Realizing that longer follow-up is needed to understand this, now the researchers have undertaken a eight-year follow-up with the same patients to understand the relationship between common mental disorders and incident diabetes. “In 2021, we have now started follow-up of the same population to know their present status now and data collection will be over by 2022,” said Dr Thankappan. Globally, there is now a significant body of research examining the relationship between diabetes and common mental disorders, with robust evidence indicative of a bidirectional relationship between diabetes and depression in population-based samples or among people with type 2 diabetes. There is also some evidence showing anxiety as a predictor for incident Type 2 diabetes.  However, the majority of these studies were conducted in developed and high-income nations and therefore there was a need to examine the relationship between diabetes and common mental disorders in low and middle income countries. This is key as current projections estimate that by 2030 developing countries will see a 69% increase in the number of people with diabetes, compared to a 20% increase in developed countries, with India having the largest number of adults with diabetes in the world. Diabetes prevalence in Kerala is around 19.2%, while the prevalence for depression and generalized anxiety disorder are around 2.7% and 0.6% respectively. “Our findings suggest the need to enhance screening of mental health conditions in patients who are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes as well. Integrating mental health care into primary healthcare would improve early diagnosis, identifying at-risk adults before common mental disorders could affect glycemic control and before the development of diabetes and any accompanying diabetes-related emotional stress could worsen anxiety and/or depressive symptoms,” added Dr Thankappan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/common-mental-disorders-not-linked-to-incident-diabetes-study/articleshow/88193832.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Delhi||Monuments not fit as place of worship: Delhi court||NEW DELHI: Stating that historical wrongs couldn’t be the basis for disturbing the peace of our present and future, a city court rejected a suit seeking restoration of Hindu and Jain deities and the right to worship within what the petitioners claimed was a temple complex inside the Qutub Minar compound at Mehrauli. Quoting from the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya judgment, Civil Judge Neha Sharma said, “Cognisant as we are of our history and of the need for the nation to confront it, Independence was a watershed moment to heal the wounds of the past. Historical wrongs cannot be remedied by people taking the law into their own hands.” In its November 29 order, the court said, “India had a culturally rich history. It has been ruled by numerous dynasties. The counsel for the plaintiff vehemently argued on the point of national shame. However, nobody has denied that wrongs were committed in the past, but such wrongs cannot be the basis for disturbing the peace of our present and future.” While noting that the purpose of Places of Worship Act, 1991 was to maintain the secular character of the nation, the court said our country had a rich history and had seen challenging times. “Nevertheless, history has to be accepted as a whole. Can the good be retained and bad be deleted from our history? A harmonious interpretation of both the statutes is required to give full force to the objective behind the Act,” it added. The court said such ancient and historical monuments couldn’t be used for some purpose that runs counter to its nature as a religious place of worship, but it could always be used for some other purpose not inconsistent with its religious character. “Once a monument has been declared protected and is owned by the government, then the plaintiffs cannot insist that the place of worship must actually and actively be used for religious services,” said the judge. The suit was filed on behalf of Jain deity Tirthankar Lord Rishabh Dev and Hindu deity Lord Vishnu through advocates Hari Shankar Jain and Ranjana Agnihotri, respectively. A lawsuit filed by advocate Vishnu S Jain had claimed that the short history displayed by Archeological Survey of India narrated that 27 temples were demolished and the materials reused to construct the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque inside the complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/monuments-not-fit-as-place-of-worship/articleshow/88195270.cms||---

Khalid's counsel told Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat that it was only natural for people to have called each other at a time like that (riots). “Didn’t we all call each other when yesterday CDS Bipin Rawat went missing? We all called each other… When violence erupts in Delhi why won't people call each other?” Senior advocate Trideep Pais, appearing for Khalid, said. The senior counsel claimed that no protected witness statements showed that Khalid had incited violence. “The witness’s statement under Section 161 (examination by police) CrPC stated that there were 250 Bangladeshi women present at a protest site and Khalid happened to be there. He waited for two months and then said the Popular Front of India (PFI) was present and Khalid had said that the Bangladeshi women ought to be sensitised… By taking PFI’s name, you can make it murkier. That’s what it looks like,” he alleged. He further claimed that the witnesses had improved their statements at different levels. Adding that the police allegedly “cooked up” the statements of the witnesses, Pais submitted that they should be shamed for cooking up a witness like this. Pais argued that another protected witness had in one place said that he witnessed Khalid’s alleged inflammatory speech and in another, he said he was told about it. “I recently watched a movie called Chicago 7, where witnesses of the state had already decided to be witnesses of the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/natural-for-people-to-call-each-other-during-riots-says-khalids-counsel/articleshow/88195688.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Relief on its way from erroneous water bills||NEW DELHI: Bringing relief to scores of consumers, the Delhi government has put a cap on water bills generated monthly. “Delhi Jal Board has updated its billing system today. Now, your bill cannot be more than 1.5 times the previous month. If it exceeds this, an explanation will be provided to the customer and he or she may file a complaint. Delhi Jal Board will be held accountable and responsible for any errors,” water minister Satyendar Jain said in a tweet. From now on, there will be an automatic system check to stop billing from the meter reader tablet if the consumption variance is more than 50 times higher or lower in comparison to the previous bill. In such a case, the bill will only be generated by the zonal revenue office if the meter reading image confirms the consumption. This step will curb the erroneous reading bills that were being generated, said the Delhi government in a statement. According to the government, certain grievances were received by the officials wherein the meter readers either did not upload a picture of the current meter reading or uploaded a random image and put a reading as deemed fit by them. Jain who is also the chairman of Delhi Jal Board held a meeting with the officials over changes needed to make the billing system more accurate. “The department will strengthen its vigilance system. In case of improper images of the meter readings, meter inspectors will visit the site and recheck the images and make sure the images are taken properly by the meter readers. This incorrect image feeding will also call for strict action against the meter readers concerned,” the water minister stated. At present, there are about 900 meter readers taking readings of about 26.5 lakh consumers in 41 zones of DJB. Out of these consumers, about 18 lakh consumers avail zero bills under free water scheme. To further strengthen the billing system, daily random meter reading image audit by revenue officers will be conducted. “This step will enhance the transparency and keep a check on any discrepancies prevailing in the billing system,” stated the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/relief-on-its-way-from-erroneous-water-bills/articleshow/88195264.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||It’s official: No track-doubling on Manmad-Parbhani route||AURANGABAD: The Railway ministry has said that no track-doubling is required on the entire 291-km stretch between Manmad and Parbhani via Aurangabad due to issues related to capacity utilisation. Replying to a question in Lok Sabha, Union Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said a survey, however, has been taken up on a 98-km stretch between Manmad and Aurangabad for carrying out doubling of track. “Doubling works are prioritised as per the (Indian) Railways’ operational requirements including line capacity utilisation. Currently, line capacity of Parbhani-Manmad has not been fully utilized. Doubling of complete section is not required as per traffic requirement. But sanction for survey of this section from Ankai (near Manmad) to Aurangabad has been taken up,” Vaishnaw said while responding to a query from Nanded MP Pratap Patil-Chikhalikar. Amid the long-pending demand of doubling of rail track on the entire Manmad-Parbhani route, the official stand by the railway minister to consider only partial work has rattled many. Veteran railway activist Omprakash Varma said it is betrayal by the railway authorities towards people of Marathwada by denying track doubling on the entire Manmad-Parbhani section. “The railway top-brass, since the beginning, was saying that it was in favour of entire track doubling. The region is denied the desired railway infrastructure despite the minister of state for Railways (Raosaheb Danve) hailing from Marathwada,” he said. Notably, top zonal authorities from the South Central Railway (SCR), during their recent official visit to Aurangabad, had expressed hope that the desired doubling work of track would get a nod from the Centre. Danve could not be reached for his comments. BJP leader Shirish Boralkar said the sanction of survey for track-doubling on Manmad-Aurangabad route was a milestone. “Any track doubling work is completed in phases. We hope that the entire stretch gets double track in phases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/its-official-no-track-doubling-on-manmad-parbhani-route/articleshow/88192347.cms||Prasad Joshi

Last minute developments in the Congress camp led to the party replacing its official candidate Ravindra Bhoyar and deciding to support an independent, party leaders told TOI. They had been expecting this development, as Bhoyar was neither financially strong nor had any support from BJP corporators, as claimed by him. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said, “With or without Bhoyar, our candidate Chandrashekhar Bawankule would be winning the election with a record margin when counting takes place on December 14.” Both Fadnavis and Bawankule met about 334 voters at three camps – at Tuli Veerbag and two Olive resorts – at Pench late on Thursday night, and addressed them about various aspects of the polling process. “Since the voting would take place in preferential format, the leaders explained to them the nuances and how to mark their preference. They were also apprised of the dos and don’ts of the voting system, so that they do not make any mistake while exercising their fundamental right and avoid invalidating their vote,” a leader told TOI. BJP city president Pravin Datke told TOI that all three camps were already in a jubilant mood and their joy was doubled after hearing of the developments in the opposition camp. “The Congress party has lost the right to ask for votes after today’s debacle. It should have totally withdrawn from the fray after being badly exposed. With today’s development in the opposition camp, we are not only going to win by over 400 votes, but will do really well in next year’s Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) polls. Now, even the public has realised how unreliable the grand old party is,” he told TOI. The saffron party leadership conducted a series of meetings with the workers to finalize their duties during Friday’s polls. Their deployment at the city’s three booths and even outside was finalized during the meetings that were conducted throughout the day. Even activists from rural areas were also instructed in the same way, as per the saffron party top brass. BJP leaders said Bawankule was also camped at Pench along with other voters and would arrive in the city on Friday morning with the corporators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-camp-in-jubilant-mood-after-cong-debacle/articleshow/88194631.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra former home minister Anil Deshmukh's PS Sanjeev Palande aided in bribe collection: Court||MUMBAI: Saying PS Sanjeev Palande and PA Kundan Shinde were actively assisting and collaborating with Anil Deshmukh, special judge M G Deshpande said, “They were giving instructions to Sachin Waze at the instance of Anil Deshmukh and monitoring work of collection of money from bar owners. These are the allegations in the complaint, which are supported by statements of Waze, Palande and others.” While the bail pleas of Palande and Shinde were rejected on Tuesday, the former’s detailed order copy was made available on Wednesday. The two were arrested by ED on June 25. The court refuted defence arguments that Palande was Waze’s victim. “There is nothing to show that applicant had any past enmity with Waze or against whosoever, either ‘No.1’ Deshmukh or Param Bir Singh,” the court said. The court said even if it is assumed Waze has tried to implicate Palande, the fact stated by him regarding meetings at Sahyadri guest house and official residence of the (former) home minister are fully corroborated by statements of others. It is ED’s case that at the meetings, collection of money was discussed. “It is clear that the statements recorded under Section 50 by the officers of ED play very important role at the stage of hearing bail application. There are many documents which prima facie corroborate the facts stated by above persons,” the court said. It noted Waze in his statement had alleged Palande was close to Deshmukh, and this is evident from the special appointment order issued on January 20, having its retrospective effect from January 7, 2020. “He further stated he had given Rs 20 crore cash to Deshmukh through Palande. On February 24, Anil Deshmukh held meeting along with Palande... Statement of Palande clearly indicates he admits the said meeting, but (sic) contends the same for official purpose. This fact cannot be overlooked,” the court said. The court said the retrospective order spoke volumes. “Why such retrospective effect was given. Is a fact within the special knowledge of Deshmukh, the applicant, Waze etc, Param Bir Singh and ‘No.1’ whosoever he may be,” the court said. The court also took note of witness ACP Sanjay Patil’s statement about a meeting at the residence of the then home minister in March. He said Palande met both him and DCP Raju Bhujbal there and they discussed about collection of Rs 3 lakh each from 1,750 bars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nothing-shows-deshmukh-ps-waze-enemies/articleshow/88195284.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The body has been taken to Delhi and from there it will be brought to Thrissur, Pradeep’s brother Prasad said. “The military authorities have informed us that the body will be brought to Thrissur in three days maximum,” Prasad said over phone from Sulur. Thrissur MP T N Prathapan said Union home minister Rajnath Singh has assured that the body of Pradeep would be brought to Thrissur, for performing the last rites. “The home minister gave this assurance when Hibi Eden and I met him at his office on Thursday. We communicated to him that the family of Pradeep would like to perform his last rites in Thrissur. The minister then promised us that the body of Pradeep would be sent to Kerala in a special flight,” Prathapan said. He, however, said the time of arrival of Pradeep’s body was not yet known. As per the latest reports, the DNA test result of Pradeep is expected on Friday. The body is likely to be airlifted after receiving the test results and completing other formalities,” Prathapan said. Revenue minister K Rajan and district collector Haritha V Kumar visited Pradeep’s family at Ponnookkara near Puthur. “The government has asked the state resident commissioner in Delhi to personally approach the military officials and get an update on the time of arrival of Pradeep’s body,” Rajan said. The collector said the district administration is making all arrangements to conduct the last rites of Pradeep with full state honours. Pradeep’s wife Sreelakshmi, son Dakshinndev, 7, and daughter Devaprayaga, 2, returned to Thrissur from the Air Force Station, Sulur, near Tamil Nadu on Thursday evening. Pradeep’s father Arakkal Radhakrishnan, who is ailing and is on oxygen support, has not been informed about the death of his son. Meanwhile, the people of Ponnurkkara are yet to reconcile with the tragic death of Pradeep, and there was a steady flow of visitors to his house. Many fondly remembered the affable, unassuming and helping nature of Pradeep. Congress leader V M Sudheeran was among those who visited the house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/body-of-jwo-pradeep-to-be-brought-home-in-special-flight/articleshow/88193838.cms||T Ramavarman

---||Kolkata||Robo-surgery hope for cancer patients||Kolkata: Minimally invasive, more precise, less painful robotic surgeries that ensure faster recovery are increasingly being used by doctors and gaining wider acceptability among patients. Till about a year ago, only two hospitals in Bengal—Tata Medical Centre and Apollo Hospitals—had the facility. Now, Narayana Superspeciality Hospital Howrah is equipped with a fourth-generation robot, Da Vinci surgical system, while Medica Hospital is set to acquire this latest version of robotic surgical system. “Surgeons control everything sitting on a console. With the help of robotic arms, stereoscopic 3D vision and endowrist instruments, they can get access to any possible target organ and remove cancerous organs with precision, yet causing little collateral damage. Post-operative recovery is much better under this, compared to other conventional methods. Patients can resume normal activities the very next day,” said Suman Mallik, clinical director of Narayana Superspeciality Hospital. Consultant uro-oncologist and robotic surgeon Abhay Kumar of Medica Superspecialty Hospital (MSH) said this robot-assisted surgery allowed a surgeon to go deeper inside the body because of refinement in optics, vision and the camera. “This technique facilitates better cure rate, improved functional faster recovery and minimal blood loss, apart from faster recovery. This technique is suited for surgeries in prostate cancer as well as that for cancer of kidney, bladder, GI, and head and neck,” said Kumar, one of the foremost surgeons to start robotic surgeries in Kolkata. Robotic surgeries are slightly more expensive than open operations. An open surgery for prostate cancer could cost around Rs 2.50 lakh, while a robot-assisted one can cause about Rs 3.25 lakh. But, doctors said, advantages, like fewer days of hospital stay and minimal chances of post-surgical complications, make robotic surgeries much viable. “A patient with early uterine cancer can be discharged the same day of the surgery or may be the next day and no blood transfusion will be required. The patient can return to table job in seven days,” said gynae-onco surgeon Arunava Roy who has conducted around 300 robotic surgeries at Tata Medical. The state’s IPGMER wanted to acquire the robotic surgery system, but sources in the health department said the pandemic had postponed the plan though they might initiate the process again. Medica Group of Hospital chairman Alok Roy said the hospital’s fourth generation Da Vinci system would arrive in the next few weeks. “For head-and-neck cancer, this robotic system will allow access to inaccessible or difficult-to-access parts, like the base of the tongue and tonsil. Robotic surgery will be effective for thyroid surgeries,” said Medica head-and-neck onco surgoen Sourav Datta. Mostly used for urology and gynaecology cancer, surgeons are expanding its use to target cancer in other parts of the body. With the pandemic improving, a multidisciplinary team at NSH Howrah, comprising doctors Kaustav Basu, Tarun Jindal, Shreya Bhattacharya, Amitabha Chakrabarti, Sumit Sanyal, Shubhayu Banerjee, Neelesh Tiwari, Manujesh Bandyopadhyay and Abhimanyu Kadapathri, hope to conduct more robot-assisted surgeries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/robo-surgery-hope-for-cancer-patients/articleshow/88194675.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Pinning absolutely no hope on the former RSS activist Bhoyar as a Congress candidature, the bookies are offering odds of Rs10 on him against hot favourite Bawankule. Despite speculation of an upset with undercurrent of horse-trading, the bookies feel Bhoyar stands no chance at the hustings, and also as per the ongoing political drama. The BJP camp is far ahead in numbers in the 560-vote constituency, and looks better poised for the fight, said the bookies. They also feel that the once well-known die-hard RSS activist Bhoyar’s awkward bonhomie with rival-turned-allies Congress leaders seemed to be more for the photo-op than gearing up for a real political turf war. According to an insider, bookies have opened the odds for some die-hard punters in this lop-sided poll. “The volume of betting is very low due to the pre-poll events running up to the D-day,” said an insider. “The withdrawal rumours damaged the Congress prospects even more before the real fight had began, and overall there were no real efforts made by the Congress camp,” said the source, explaining why Bawankule had raced ahead in the betting fray. According to a punter, “Let alone strategies, it’s still a mystery whether the Congress leaders actually back Bhoyar for the party or are quietly supporting the independent candidate as a mark of dissent against leaders for importing an outsider just for the ticket and ignoring their deserving candidates.” An insider said there would be some bets placed on Bhoyar too by the over ambitious punters, expecting a last minute miracle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/at-10p-odds-bookies-say-bawankule-set-for-a-landslide-victory/articleshow/88194665.cms||Soumitra Bose

On Thursday, buses operated from Igatpuri, Sinnar and Yeola depots, besides Nashik, Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon depots that were already operational. Buses are now plying both within and outside the district along with carrying passengers to remote villages. The buses that undertook the journey belonged to the Shivshahi and Hirkani classes besides ordinary services. The number of passengers travelling on MSRTC buses was still low as many are still unaware about the resumption of services and they were not confident if the services would continue even by the end of the day. “They (passengers) are not to be blamed hence it would take some time before the passengers gain confidence and return to MSRTC for the services,” an MSRTC official said. “The hike in salaries announced by the government and delivered to the staff who were on duty during the month of November has created a sense of assurance among other employees who have decided to resume work. There are inquiries about resuming duties from employees across the district and the number of the employees picking returning is now increasing,” he added. There were 742 employees on duty out of the total workforce of 5,290 on Thursday. The number on Monday was 500. In all about 47 buses rolled out of the depots to various destination on Thursday. The MSRTC administration also transferred 16 employees on Thursday taking the total numbers of employees transferred to 81, while more than 40 have been suspended till date. “There are signs of things easing and we are hopeful of early resolution of the strike by the employees,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-bus-services-resume-from-3-more-msrtc-depots/articleshow/88192374.cms||Abhilash Botekar

She ended up losing Rs 7.71 lakh. Bhavika Shukla, a cable operator from Naranpura, in her complaint said that her mobile banking application developed some issues on November 1. She googled the customer care number for her bank, SBI, and found a cellphone number of a customer care executive. She dialled the number and the person at the other end introduced himself as a customer care executive of the bank. The man told her to download the ‘Anydesk’ application from the Google Play store. As she downloaded it, he also took a nine-digit code from her. When he finally took access of her phone, he told her to open the mobile banking application and follow his instruction. The man told her that if she received any message while he was fixing the mobile banking issue, she should delete it. She followed his instructions and after a while he told her not to open her net banking app for 24 hours after which it would start automatically. As she suspected something fishy, she opened the app and found Rs 7.71 lakh had been debited from her account in eight transactions on November 1 and November 2.

---||Delhi||E-waste doorstep collection catching up in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Collection and disposal of electronic waste from households in the city has shown encouraging results, data provided by the four civic agencies has revealed. So far, New Delhi Municipal Council, South Delhi Municipal Council, East Delhi Municipal Council and North Delhi Municipal Council have together received 955 calls and requests on an app from residents to get e-waste picked up from their homes. The agencies have paid about Rs 70 lakh to those whose requests were processed. Most of the calls were received from those staying in south Delhi. SDMC, which started the e-waste collection initiative in June this year, received 613 requests, attended to 521 of them and paid Rs 67.7 lakh to residents. The calls mostly pertained to collection of old mobile phones, laptops, central processing units, speakers, printers and batteries, which were picked up by agencies registered with Central Pollution Control Board and Delhi Pollution Control Committee. NDMC, first among the agencies to introduce the concept in 2017, received and processed 239 requests and paid Rs 1.67 lakh for the e-waste. “We pioneered the project in the city but have only 52,000-54,000 households in our jurisdiction, explaining why the number of calls is less. We are still encouraging residents to use the platform to avoid inappropriate handling of e-waste,” said an NDMC official. EDMC, meanwhile, received 71 requests and processed 39 of them since end of July, when it launched the project. The agency paid a little over Rs 23,000 to residents. North DMC, which launched the project this September, received the lowest number of calls — 32. “Though the response is lukewarm, we have been pursuing departments to popularise the concept and contribute individually as well,” said one of its officials. He added, “Three concessionaires are currently collecting items from the doorstep. They have specified their rates on the app and collect 60 types of e-waste free of cost. Residents can select the option that works for them and fix timings for collection.” The official urged residents to dispose of old, unserviceable and obsolete IT equipment through the agency’s e-waste management app, rather than sell to waste collectors in unorganised sectors. E-waste contains complex combinations of highly toxic substances that pose dangers to health and the environment, according to officials. “The old and traditional methods, used by unregulated backyard operators to reclaim and recycle e-waste material, expose workers and citizens to toxic substances due to improper dismantling, wet chemical processing and incineration,” said an SDMC official. He added that the agency had called meetings with RWAs and market associations in this regard. “We motivated them to discard their e-waste properly and sell it to mitigate health hazards,” said Col BK Oberoi (retd), standing committee chairman, SDMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/e-waste-doorstep-collection-catching-up/articleshow/88195715.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Just one textbook for Std I from June in state schools||PUNE: The state school education department will introduce a single textbook formula from 2022-23 onwards to reduce the weight of school bags carried by students every day. This will be introduced in Std I and will be implemented for all primary classes later. The four subjects taught in Std I, English, Marathi, maths and play and learn, have been integrated into a single textbook per four semesters. Hence, instead of carrying all four subject textbooks, the student needs to carry only the integrated textbook, part 1, 2, 3 or 4, as per the semester. “At the moment, a Std I student, who is about six years of age, carries in his or her bag, at least 830gm worth of just textbooks, daily to his school. Add to it the weight of a water bottle, tiffin and notebooks, and the weight goes beyond 1kg. But with this method, the weight of textbooks reduces to 210 gm. On a pilot basis, the textbooks have been introduced in 488 model schools across the state, and the feedback has been good,” Vivek Gosavi, director of Balbharati (Maharashtra State Bureau of Textbook Production and Curriculum Research), said. Gosavi said that from the academic year 2022-23, the integrated bilingual textbook would be rolled out for Std I students in the entire state. “This will then be done for Std II and so on. We will also incorporate the changes as per the New Education Policy, whenever it is implemented. We have received excellent feedback from teachers using this textbook. The integrated activities are also loved by the students,” he added. Rekha Varpalliwar, a zilla parishad school teacher from Chandrapur district, who joined in 1998 says this has been a great initiative, especially for children in remote areas, where schools are far and students have to walk long distances carrying the heavy bag. “The weight of the bag has reduced. The activities mentioned in the book are also very helpful,” she added. Manjeeri Khambe, another zilla parishad school teacher from Raigad, said that each part of the book has a theme. “The first part is ‘Me and My family’, followed by water, animals and finally the fourth part is transport and people who help us. Currently, we are teaching the second part. The activities in the book are very easy to perform that do not require anything that is not already available. The book is also written in such a way that the students can do everything themselves. The focus is on how to learn and also increasing the curiosity in children so that they become lifelong learners,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/schools-bags-get-lighter-for-std-i-from-june-with-single-textbook/articleshow/88194657.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Ashish Shelar in HC says Kishori Pednekar FIR bid to gag dissent in democracy||MUMBAI: BJP MLA Ashish Shelar on Thursday approached the Bombay high court to seek quashing of an FIR lodged against him on Wednesday by mayor Kishori Pednekar for allegedly making “derogatory remarks”. His plea is that the FIR lodged at the Marine Drive police station is “politically motivated” and based on “conjecture and ulterior motive to silence the voice of dissent in a democracy”. His petition says that he had held a press conference on December 4 about “improper, irresponsible and insensitive governance of municipal corporation” over various issues. In his petition, which is yet to be heard, the MLA from Bandra (west) for two consecutive terms said the FIR under Section 354 A(iv) for an offence of sexual harassment by allegedly making sexually coloured remarks is “orchestrated only to fuel political mileage of the original complainant and to suit the political agendas of the State government — the Maha Vikas Aghadi”. Shelar (49) made the state and Pednekar (59) parties to the petition. Denying all accusations and allegations made against him, his petition termed the FIR “blatantly false, vexatious, frivolous, concocted and a product of abuse of process of law”. His petition says his political opponents are blowing his statement completely out of proportion by distorting its meaning to “maliciously target” a senior politician of the opposition party. Speaking to the media on Thursday, Shelar said he went to court as the FIR is based on misinterpretation of what he said. Shelar said that for two years there had been abuse of power and police force by the present government against those trying to expose its “corrupt practices”. “It is not my nature to insult women, nor is it our culture,” he said, adding that the mayor and he had been “friends for many years”. His press conference from which the controversy arose is still available on YouTube and it would be brought before the court, said Shelar. BJP politicians condemned the action against Shelar. State BJP president Chandrakant Patil said the government’s achievements were “corruption and vasooli” and if anyone speaks against it they are trapped in false cases. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis said this was being done to silence Shelar, who was speaking against the government. Praveen Darekar, opposition leader in the legislative council asked why no case was registered against Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut for using abusive language.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shelar-in-hc-says-pednekar-fir-bid-to-gag-dissent-in-democracy/articleshow/88195720.cms||---

Kapadiya had created 21 bogus firms and opened bank accounts in their names as well. He started putting up fake bills and later claimed ITC as well on those fake bills. “The accused opened 21 bank accounts for an equal number of firms but put up fake transactions and bills in only 11 firms to claim ITC. Had he used the remaining 10 firms and their accounts, he would have cheated the government of a much bigger amount,” a senior CGST official told TOI. “Accused Kapadiya has been sent to judicial custody for 14 days. Further investigation is being done by CGST department,” said Nayan Sukhadwala, district government pleader. “CGST’s minute data analysis and trailing of transactions exposed the racket,” another senior official who is part of the operation said. “We have developed a strong data analysis and investigation mechanism of financial frauds that weakens our economy. The generated black money further finances other crimes,” he added. Of the total Rs 26 crore, Kapadiya had taken ITC of Rs16.5 crore suo motu without any ITC available to them. Investigation by the anti evasion unit revealed that Kapadiya was running a garment showroom in Chowk Bazaar area of the city. The showroom was closed a few months ago. “Meanwhile, Kapadiya made money through the racket,” the official added. During investigation, it was found that these dummy firms were created by using Aadhaar card, Pan card and bank details of different persons. “Those who provided their identity details were poor people who were paid a few thousand rupees,” said a senior official. “He did not purchase any goods and hence, sold nothing but only fake bills were put up to prove a transaction. Entire trade was shown on paper upon which ITC was claimed,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/rs-163cr-igst-refund-fraud-busted-in-surat/articleshow/88193886.cms||---

We are the first government-enabled single window system for installing private EV charging points. We've also released a workplace charging guidebook to enable this,” Gahlot tweeted on Thursday. The government’s single window facility was launched exactly a month ago with the aim of making the process of installing private EV charging points at commercial, institutional or residential locations easier. On the directions of the Delhi government, power discoms have empanelled 12 vendors to facilitate the installation of slow and moderate chargers. According to the government, installation and operationalisation of EV chargers would be completed within seven working days of submitting a request. The Delhi government is providing a subsidy of Rs 6,000 to the first 30,000 applicants for the installation of EV chargers in Delhi. The tariff rate fixed by the government for the electricity consumed through these EV charging points is Rs 4.5 per unit. A consumer can apply through the single window facility by either going to the respective discom’s portal or by calling at 7011931880 or 19123 (BRPL), 19124 (TPDDL) and 011-35999808 (BYPL).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gahlot-meets-discoms-in-push-for-ev-charging-stns/articleshow/88195306.cms||---

The claimants, which include the widow, three daughters and aged parents in their claim, told the tribunal that the death of the only breadwinner has cast a shadow of gloom on the family and sought compensation. The legal team appearing for the claimant told the court that the deceased at the time of accident was aged 40. It was on an ill-fated day January 25, 2017, at around 3.15 p.m. he was proceeding on his motorcycle towards Satara, and on the Old Mumbai-Pune highway near Takave, village Lonavala the trailer came from behind and dashed him. As a result of the accident, he sustained severe injuries and died while being treated at a hospital in Khandala. An offense was registered against the driver of the trailer with the local police station. The claimants told the tribunal that the deceased worked as a clerk in a finance institute (Pathpedi), also doubled up as an estate agent and earned Rs. 4.12 per annum and that such a big family was totally dependent on him. While the insurance company contested the claim on various grounds,the trailer owner involved in the accident did not appear before the tribunal. After hearing both the sides, the tribunal member MACT member RN Rokade ordered the two opponents - the offending trailer truck's owner and the insurer - to jointly and severally make the payment to the claimants along with an interest of eight per cent per annum from the date of filing of the claim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-mishap-victims-family-awarded-rs-52-6l-payout/articleshow/88195320.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

The appalling status of nutrition of tribal children, unemployment among the tribespeople, and alienation of tribal land key areas requiring critical interventions remain still unaddressed, they say. “The government is trying to put the blame on the Kottathara Tribal Specialty Hospital and some of its doctors for the failure of the various departments to co-ordinate and take steps to solve the problems faced by the tribelspeople,” said M Sukumaran of Attapadi Protection Committee. “It is the contractor-official-politician nexus that runs Attapadi and the marginalized and the starving tribespeople are the victims of their apathy. Most of the development works are mired in corruption and miss the target group–the tribes,” he said. Meanwhile, minister for welfare of scheduled caste and scheduled tribes K Radhakrishnan will visit Attapadi next week to review the steps taken to tackle the problems faced by the tribespeople. Kerala Women’s Commission chairperson and members will visit the tribal heartland on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/attapadi-key-issues-remain-unsolved/articleshow/88193892.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||No security deployed at historical Himayat Bagh||Aurangabad: Amid demand for improving vigil at the historic Himayat Bagh, authorities concerned have surprisingly removed two security guards manning the Mughal-era garden. Known for its rich flora and fauna, Himayat Bagh was already at the receiving end of different nuisances, including tree-cutting and unwanted visitors, calling for extra security measures. Honorary wildlife warden for Aurangabad Kishor Pathak said it is shocking that Himayat Bagh does not have any security at all. “While the official apathy in the past has already caused irrevocable damage to the historical place, more official neglect will lead to erasing of the site from the map of Aurangabad. The authorities concerned cannot shrug off their responsibility of protecting the heritage site,” he said. Spread over nearly 400 acre, Himayat Bagh comes under the Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and the forest department. The agricultural university owns the majority of the premises that houses its fruit research centre and nurseries, and was, so far, providing security guards at the Mughal-era garden. Notably, Aurangabad bench of Bombay High Court, earlier in August, had admitted a PIL seeking “biodiversity heritage status” for Himayat Bagh under Biological Diversity Act 2002. “Amid growing official apathy, we all have hopes on the judiciary for protecting Himayat Bagh. We hope the litigation concerned reaches its logical end and Mughal-era garden gets conserved amid growing official neglect,” Nilesh Dharashivkar, a nature-lover said. M P Patil, in-charge of Himayat Bagh for the university, said the authorities headquartered at Parbhani were expected to give sanction for deployment of new security guards. “We have already issued a letter to the authorities reminding them about the need of security at the earliest,” he said. K K Dhawan, vice-chancellor of Parbhani-based Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, could not be reached for his comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/no-security-deployed-at-historical-himayat-bagh/articleshow/88192391.cms||---

---||Chennai||Films, campaigns start the talk around menopause||Priya.Menon@timesgroup.comA middle-aged woman steps out of a car after a drive with her husband. As she steps out, the camera follows the man’s gaze to the empty seat, which is soaked in blood. In another household, a woman splashes water onto her face to battle the wave of heat engulfing her body, while her husband enjoys a drink oblivious to her plight. In a factory, a woman bathed in sweat turns a table fan towards her, but an irate boss quickly turns it towards himself.These are scenes from ‘W@40’, a 11-minute musical film on perimenopause, which was released online earlier this year by Thrissur-based filmmaker Smitha Sathish. "People think menopause happens at 50, but perimenopause begins in the 40s. Many women go through physical and psychological changes that cause anxiety and depression, but people around them fail to understand what they are going through. I wanted to create conversations around it in the public sphere," says the 44-year-old, who is also a psychologist, counsellor and former Juvenile Justice board member.While there has been a lot of discussions around menstruation, menopause still remains a topic that’s not often spoken about. Women often struggle to find understanding and support from friends and families. That’s why several initiatives, including short films and campaigns, are trying to create awareness and a sense of normalcy about this difficult stage of a woman’s life. The Malayalam film, ‘Star’, dealt with the subject though its portrayal of the issue has been criticised. ‘Painful Pride’, a short film starring Pallavi Joshi and Rituraj Singh, also highlighted the issues faced by women during menopause.Earlier this year, Smitha released another film, ‘Hot Flash’, which revolved around a homemaker in her 40s who experiences a hot flash for the first time. "As a counsellor, I have women talking about the issues they face such as mood swings, low self-esteem as their body changes, relationship problems as intercourse becomes painful or they lose interest in sex," says Smitha, who soon plans to release ‘Hot Flash’ in Tamil.This year, during Daan Utsav, Chennaiite Aarti Madhusudan, along with volunteer Susmita Chakkungal launched #hotflush as part of a larger campaign, Menophase, which aims to break the stigma around menopause. Some NGOs organised Hot Flush camps for underprivileged women."Such an initiative is needed as we celebrate everything in a woman’s life — puberty, marriage and pregnancy — but there is no conversation around menopause," says Susmita. "Though it is a difficult time when a woman goes through hormonal, physiological and emotional changes, the aim is to stress that it’s a temporary phase, and approach it in a positive manner."Gynaecologist and fertility expert Dr Geetha Haripriya says women can experience a gamut of symptoms during perimenopause onwards. "As hormone levels go down, there can be memory loss, lack of concentration, fatigue, joint pain, urinary incontinence and some may get palpitations," says Dr Geetha. "It also has a big psychological impact as they feel no one understands them. That’s why the family needs to offer support. With vitamins, physiotherapy and psychological counselling, they can lead a normal life."Family support plays a big role in how soon women attain a sense of normalcy, says psychiatrist Dr Thara Srinivasan. "Varying levels of hormones can cause depression and anxiety. It can also lead to diminished sex drive, which makes women feel less attractive to the opposite sex. And it’s the age when children leave home, so the empty nest syndrome aggravates the psychological impact," she says. "If a woman is moderately severe to severely depressed they may need antidepressants and counselling."While the symptoms ease for some women post menopause, the issues may linger. "It takes about two to three years after the termination of periods for women to get used to the idea. How soon a feeling of normalcy sets in varies depending on the support they get from their partner, children and family," says Dr Thara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/films-campaigns-start-the-talk-around-menopause/articleshow/88183080.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Fatehpuri Masjid on road to revamp||NEW DELHI: Delhi Waqf Board plans to conserve Fatehpuri Masjid, a 17th-century mosque located in Chandni Chowk, and has approached the World Monuments Fund (WMF) in this regard. According to Waqf section officer Mehfooz Mohammad, the project is in its initial phases and repair work on wuzu hauz, or ablution pool, has begun. The mosque was built in 1650 by Shah Jahan’s wife Fatehpuri Begum. Historical records indicate that the structure and its courtyard were damaged by the British after the 1857 uprising. A spot visit by TOI revealed considerable damage to its domes, minarets and slabs. The front minaret of the mosque, which is an unprotected monument, has started tilting and is in danger of collapsing. “Given the significance of the structure, WMF would like to prepare a comprehensive conservation of Fatehpuri Masjid before initiating work at the site,” WMF project consultant Annabel Lopez said. WMF describes itself as a “private, non-profit organisation dedicated to preservation of historic architecture and cultural heritage sites around the world”. The Shahi Imam of Fatehpuri Masjid, Mufti Mohammad Mukarram Ahmad, said the mosque was in urgent need of repair. “It is good to note that the Delhi Waqf Board has initiated it. But the masjid is of historical importance and a beautiful specimen of history and deserves to be protected by the Archaeological Survey of India. The repair work undertaken by Waqf will progress at snail’s pace. The masjid has not got its due from the government,” he added. Asked why the responsibility of the mosque’s restoration has been shifted to Waqf, an ASI official declined to comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fatehpuri-masjid-on-road-to-revamp/articleshow/88195314.cms||Zumbish

He also accused the Centre of sidelining the basic issues and problems faced by the citizens. “It’s a planned strategy of this government to impose its school of thoughts on citizens,” Kumar said at a Congress rally, titled ‘save democracy’. “The extreme school of thoughts should not be promoted. The nation will not accept extremism. The nature of the country is to believe in balanced thoughts. The Congress has such a balanced attitude and approach. The BJP-led government at the Centre is trying to sell establishments such as BSNL, Air India and LIC, as it had no contribution to making these companies,” Kumar said. “Pune, which was known as the city of cycles, is suffering because of traffic issues. It has become a major concern for the citizens. But those running the show in Pune (civic body) are busy with their political publicity,” he said. Addressing a meet-the-press programme organized by the Pune Union of Working Journalists, Kumar said, “Petrol has become costliest since Independence. But such issues are not taken to the forefront. Frauds at the central-level have gone up ever since the BJP-led alliance has come to power. The friends of the government have left the country with the public money.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centre-diverting-attention-from-real-issues-kanhaiya/articleshow/88194672.cms||---

The murder is yet another episode of tragic incidents at the jinxed Empress Mall, which has seen more than its share of untoward incidents, accidents, litigations and disputes. Ansari, a garage mechanic, had summoned Farzana to the mall to settle the dispute between them. He wanted her to agree to his wish of marrying her. Farzana, a Std X dropout, had refused to marry Ansari as his mother had earlier rejected her. A reality check by TOI by accessing the abandoned section of the fourth floor where the body was found, was nothing short of spine-chilling. There are no guards to control access to the fourth floor. TOI reached the place by lift, crossing an office in the other section and then walking through the corridor of the other wing of the desolate fourth floor. The corridor is lined with broken furniture and construction material. Structures of rooms and compartments, with unplastered walls at most places, stretch on either side of the dusty ramshackle corridor. The ceiling is even now incomplete. Each room has heaps of construction material and garbage stacked up. Ganeshpeth police, which arrested Ansari a day ago and procured five-day custody from court on Thursday, have procured CCTV footage of the third floor. This shows Ansari and Farzana proceeding towards the exit staircase, from where the fourth floor was accessed by them. “This side of the wing was to be developed as a hotel and the rooms were erected, but construction was discontinued for some reason,” said an employee. “Stray dogs are there in this wing and hence we avoid it. We heard dogs barking continuously two days back but did not know what it was then,” said a representative of the mall management. Ansari allegedly strangled Farzana with her odhni in a room on the fourth floor. He was miffed as Farzana wanted to marry someone else. The decomposed body remained at the spot for a week before Ansari led cops to the spot. The mall management’s office is in the other wing of the fourth floor, but employees there had no clue about the crime. Though several labourers and workers have died here in the past, this was the first murder. The mall had been in the news after Enforcement Directorate (ED) sealed the place until the owners got relief from the court, it’s learnt. Sadarppolice had cracked the missing complaint lodged by Farzana’s family to discover the role of her boyfriend in her murder. The case was later handed over to Ganeshpeth police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gf-murder-cops-unsure-why-farzana-went-to-malls-spooky-4th-floor/articleshow/88194686.cms||Soumitra Bose

Deputy Commissioner of police (EOW) Bhagyashri Navatake told TOI, “We are investigating the case and a formal complaint has been registered against the four men.” Apart from the complainant, the suspects, who are speech-and-hearing impaired, have cheated 509 other speech-and-hearing impaired persons in the city, police said. “In October 2020, these four members of the group floated an investment scheme among the members. The scheme promised to double the investors’ investment in five months,” police said.

Nobody will surely miss that, or at least that’s what traffic department and Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) authorities think while toying with the new idea. While signal lights are common and jumped with impunity across cities, diamond city is experimenting with illuminated traffic signal light pole for better visibility. One such illuminated pole changing its colours as per signal light at Chowpati crossroads at present highlight the experiment in progress. On a trial basis LED lights with reflectors have been installed at the one traffic signal and if the attempt is successful it will be replicated at other locations. A Mumbai-based agency has proposed the concept to SMC and the traffic department of SMC is working on it. “The agency’s concept was innovative as it is in use at a few locations in Mumbai. Hence, we started the trial at one of our city’s locations. No charges have been paid for it, but if the attempt is successful it will be developed at other locations too,” said a traffic department official in the SMC. At present SMC is managing traffic signal lights at 36 major crossroads in the city. On one pole at the Chowpatty traffic junction, multiple panels of LED lights have been installed. These lights use electricity and its illumination is visible from a long distance. Apart from illumination, it is also cost effective, as installing it on an existing pole does not require much changes. “Considering the visibility it encourages commuters to follow the traffic signal. It was installed around a week ago and if it is approved more such poles will be developed,” the official added. A senior traffic police official said that the new attempt by SMC is yielding good response from commuters. “People develop a tendency to follow traffic signals due to the entire illuminating pole. SMC should try this at other locations as well,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/led-lit-traffic-signal-pole-for-better-visibility/articleshow/88193916.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Amreli man held for objectionable Facebook post on CDS General Bipin Rawat||AHMEDABAD: City police on Thursday arrested a man from Amreli for his objectionable Facebook post on Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat after his death in a chopper crash on Wednesday. The city police officers said that they have come across numerous sensitive posts made by the accused Shiva Ahir, 44, a resident of Bherai village in Amreli district. Ahir was arrested on Thursday. Cops said that Ahir, who was deputy sarpanch of Bherai village from 2010 to 2014, had put objectionable posts on his social media account in the past too. “On Wednesday evening after the news of the demise of General Bipin Rawat was confirmed, Ahir posted defamatory and objectionable posts against him and also against former defence minister late Manohar Parrikar. Ahir, who is known for gathering cheap publicity with such posts, also made an objectionable mention of national security advisor Ajit Doval,” said a police officer. General Bipin Rawat, wife Madhulika Rawat and 11 others died when an IAF Mi-17V5 helicopter crashed in Katteri-Nanchappanchathram area near Coonoor in the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu. A statement by the city police said that Ahir had also made objectionable posts about Hindu Gods and tried to incite sentiments of Hindu community in the past. Apart from that, he used to make objectionable posts about various leaders and public figures and thus made attempts to breach the peace and harmony of the society and also tried to instil hatred amongst communities. During primary questioning, Ahir said that he wanted to contest the election of sarpanch for which he wanted some publicity. So, he began putting up objectionable posts on social media. Cybercrime police booked Ahir under the charges of IPC sections for promoting disharmony or enmity between two communities, for deliberate and malicious intentions of outraging the religious feelings of any class and for writing which causes fear or alarm among a group along with the charges of the Information Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amreli-man-held-for-objectionable-post-on-cds-rawat/articleshow/88194690.cms||---

Merugula Nagaraju reached the peak of Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, East Africa, on November 28 and reached his village on Wednesday. ‘This is the biggest achievement in my life. Now, I am aiming to scale the highest peak in the world, 8848.86 meter Mount Everest. For this, I am joining an advanced mountaineering course at Darjeeling in a couple of months,” Nagaraju told TOI. Nagaraju of Unukuru in Regidi Amudalavalasa mandal is the only child of a single parent as his farmer father passed away a few years ago. He wishes to conquer all seven summits if he gets sponsors. “Adventurous sports and expeditions are my passion since childhood, but money is a problem. I come from a poor farmer family and my sole breadwinner is my mother. I work in the farm field whenever I get time,” he said. Nagaraju took one of the toughest routes to Kilimanjaro, the 34-km Marango route, and scaled it in four days. He started on November 25 and reached the peak by 12.25 am (IST) on November 28 along with eight others, including two Indians. “I planned to create a record by scaling Kilimanjaro in eight hours. But weather conditions were not favourable. But I will definitely create a record next time. In fact, I scaled 5,450 meter Lakakhansai peak in Sikkim on November 3 and conquered Kilimanjaro within 25 days,” he said. More than Rs 3 lakh was spent for the expedition, he added. A few teachers in his village, sarpanches G Venkateswarlu, G Bala Murali, MLAs Kamabal Jogulu, and Kalavathi, and doctors D Sridhar, G Ravi Prasad, BV Ramana, and Lakshmi Chaitanya offered him support. Now, he is seeking the help of the government in conquering Mount Everest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/skulam-youth-scales-kilimanjaro-everest-next/articleshow/88193897.cms||Siva G

---||Hyderabad||Birth pangs: No room for singles in surrogacy bill||HYDERABAD: Now, single men and women in India can no longer become parents through surrogacy, thanks to the new Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2020 cleared by the Rajya Sabha on December 8. The revised bill – it had been referred to a select committee for approval after being passed by the Lok Sabha – has also shut the door on members of the LGBTQ+ community and live-in couples, leading to tremendous heartburn among prospective parents and doctors who term the clause as “discriminatory” and “regressive”. Rough estimates suggest that about 20% of all surrogacy cases being handled across India comprise single men and women. But the bill – soon to become an act – has dashed all hopes of parenthood, for many of them. Among them is 30-year-old Rohith R* a senior manager with a leading MNC in Hyderabad. “This clause makes no sense. If a man is able bodied and can provide for his child, where is the problem? Also, this fear of a man exploiting a baby (especially if she is a girl), and hence denying him the right to become a parent through surrogacy is ridiculous. Don’t married men exploit girls too,” asked Rohith, who separated from his wife eight months ago. “I could have gone for adoption too, but the wait there is very long. And even there, men can only adopt a boy and not a girl -- for the same reason,” he added, distraught at having to let go off his dream. Rohith is now planning to write to the government of India, to re-consider this clause. Equally unhappy is Rekha*, a paramedic, who went through two unsuccessful IVF cycles. “Examinations revealed there was a problem with my uterus and surrogacy was my only option. I was all set to go through with it when this bill came into play. Should I give up on my hope to be a mother?” the 33-year-old asked. Doctors too are at a loss. “While I am happy the draconian clause of surrogate mother being a close relative has been dropped, the bill is discriminatory towards single men and women. If a single woman can have a baby through IVF, why can’t she have a baby through surrogacy, especially if she has been diagnosed with conditions where she can’t carry a baby?” said Dr Samit Sekhar, owner and director of Kiran Infertility Centre Pvt Ltd.

The arrested accused have been identified as Manish (22) and Ravi (32), both residents of Wazirabad. Earlier, the driver reported to police that on Monday, three people booked his cab from Nehru Vihar to Greater Noida. After the ride, the passengers paid him the fare through a reputed digital mobile wallet. However, they kept on sitting in the cab of the complainant on the pretext that one of their friends was coming. After about 10 minutes, the passengers asked him to drop them back to Nehru Vihar. While approaching a deserted place near a drain, one of the passengers pointed a country-made pistol at the complainant, snatched his mobile and forcefully transferred Rs 20,700 into a digital mobile wallet. Later, police identified one of the accused, Manish, and nabbed him from Mathura in UP on Tuesday. During interrogation, Manish said that Ravi planned that they would book a cab online and after gaining the faith of the driver, they would rob him at a deserted place.

The case was registered after the parents, Munni Sahani and her husband Chotu, residents of Kalyan, approached the Kalyan sessions court, which in turn directed the cops to file an FIR. Munni, in her complaint, said that on July 5, her daughter Neha had a fever, so she visited Hasan clinic at Suchak Naka in Kalyan. There, Dr Mohammed Taj Ansari (45) prescribed medicine. However, the next day, when Neha got worse, her parents went back to the clinic. Dr Ansari and his staff R L Alam (57) gave Neha some medicine. After two hours, girl’s health deteriorated and she died. The mother, Munni, told TOI, “Initially, when we approached the local police, they refused to file an FIR. We also approached the health department, but they too did nothing.” Munni alleged that the doctor even offered a bribe of Rs 8 lakh, but they refused, saying they only wanted justice for their daughter. The father, Chotu, said, “Since I am poor and do not have money to fight my case, a lawyer from Kalyan, Satyendra Dubey, offered to fight the case without taking a single penny. He filed a private case in court and got the FIR registered in the case.” An official from Kolsewadi police station said, “The FIR was registered after the court order. We will take the opinion of the civil surgeon on whether there was medical negligence in the case. As per the findings, further action will be taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-5-months-after-toddlers-death-doc-booked/articleshow/88195723.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Pune||Pune: Rs 50,000 penalty for illegal advertisement hoardings||PUNE: The civic body has planned to fine advertisers and advertising agencies Rs50,000 for erecting illegal hoardings. If the fine is not paid, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will bill the amount to the property owners, on whose plot the illegal hoarding has been erected. If the errant advertiser fails to pay up the fine even then, the civic administration will recover the penalty amount by adding it in the property tax of the owners. “Directives in this regard have been issued. The ward offices will have to ensure that they are following the orders. The ward office staff has to go on ground and do the survey of the advertising materials placed at public places. The illegal publicity materials will be identified and action will be taken against those who are responsible for installing these advertising materials,” said Vijay Landge, head of PMC’s sky sign department. According to the PMC officials, the civic body had started drives against illegal publicity materials in August. Actions were paused because of the pandemic. Actions have been carried out at some of the 11 merged villages too. The civic administration has also planned to expand the drive in the recently merged 23 villages. According to data, the civic body has taken action against 40,000 illegal materials in the last four months. They included hoardings, boards, banners, flex, flags, posters, kiosks and other materials. “The civic administration should make sure such publicity materials are not installed at public places. The roads are filled with illegal hoardings. Many of them belong to politicians. The civic body should act against them too otherwise this directive will prove to be a shallow promise,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizens’ group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rs-50k-penalty-for-illegal-advertisement-hoardings/articleshow/88194691.cms||---
---||Bareilly||After 50-year court battle, Rampur nawab’s Rs 2,700 crore assets to be split among 16 heirs||BAREILLY: After nearly five decades of court battle, properties of the erstwhile nawab of Rampur, Raza Ali Khan, worth over Rs 2,650 crore, will finally be divided among his 16 legal heirs. It will be done according to Shariat rules. The court of Rampur district judge has now given the verdict on the “partition scheme”, following the Supreme Court’s order of July 31, 2019. “The file has been sent to the apex court for the final decree,” said advocate Mukesh Saxena, counsel for one of the heirs, Kazim Ali Khan. Nawab Raza Ali Khan — who let Rampur join India in 1949 — was survived by three wives, three sons and six daughters after his death in 1966. The government recognised the eldest of his three sons, Murtaza Ali Khan, as the sole inheritor according to the customary law. This was challenged in court by his siblings in 1972. And from there a long, bitter battle for the riches had begun. The heirs include late Murtaza’s daughter Nikhat Bi, son Murad Mian and late Zulfiqar Ali Khan Bahadur’s wife Begum Noor Bano (a former MP), her son Naved Mian and others. The share of Syeda Mehrunnisa Begum, descendant of the late nawab and wife of Pakistan air marshal Abdul Rahim, will be handed over to the custodian of enemy property -- which is the Indian government -- as she is now a national of the neighbouring country. Though under Shariat, she was entitled to 7% of the property, it will now go to the Indian government. Her plea against it has been dismissed by court. In February 2020, the strongroom of the family at Khasbagh palace was opened as part of the exercise to evaluate the royal treasures. When the locks of an armoury in the palace, sprawled over 450 acres, was broken the evaluation team found guns with intricate designs, gem-studded swords and hand-crafted knives. A garage had vintage cars imported from the US and Europe -- among them a Plymouth (1957), Dodge convertible (1954), Austin convertible (1956), Buick (1939) and Willys Jeep (1956). Immovable properties to be divided among 16 claimants include the 200-acre Benazir Bagh palace, Sarhari Kunda palace, Shahbad Bagh palace and a private railway station. Besides, valuable items such as jewellery and weapons are also up for grabs. District government counsel Arun Prakash Saxena told TOI, “I had earlier done valuation of the immovable properties of the nawab, and his assets are worth Rs 2,650 crore. A partition scheme has been made as per Shariat law in compliance with directions of the Supreme Court by district judge Gaurav Srivastava. The proposed partition scheme was drawn after all efforts to divide the properties through mutual agreement failed.” Saxena added: “As per the partition plan, all 16 legal heirs will get a share. Two of the legal heirs have died during the long court battle, and their heirs would be entitled to get their share after producing the required documents in court.” The Muslim law recognizes two types of heirs, sharers and residuaries. Sharers are those who are entitled to a certain share in the property, and residuaries would take their share in the property that is left after the sharers have taken their parts. Muslim law does not create any distinction between the rights of men and women. On the death of their ancestor, nothing can prevent either a girl or a boy from becoming legal heirs. However, it is generally found that the quantum of share of a female heir is half that of the male heir. The reason behind this is that under the Muslim law a woman shall upon marriage receive mehr and maintenance from her husband whereas men will have only the property of their ancestors as inheritance. Also, males have the duty of maintaining wives and children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/after-50-yr-court-battle-plan-ready-for-rampur-nawabs-rs-2-7k-cr-assets-to-be-split-among-16-heirs/articleshow/88193899.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Recently, a leopard had fallen into a six-foot-deep pit. Earlier, other animals had fallen into it,” said Anil Patel, Bijnor divisional forest officer (DFO). Patel expressed fears that leopard cubs that live amid the sugarcane stalks come out in the open as harvesting has begun and fall into these dried open wells dug up by farmers to irrigate their crops. While many have installed submersible borings, no efforts have been made to cover the abandoned open wells. “We have launched a campaign to cover the deep wells with plastic or bamboo shields to prevent animals from falling into them,” the DFO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/plug-dry-wells-pits-to-save-wild-animals-bijnor-villagers-told/articleshow/88193934.cms||Harveer Dabas

Interacting with the media on Thursday after reviewing arrangements for the polling day, Vimala said Sushma Kawale cannot cast her vote due to some discrepancy in her eligibility criteria. It means the total number of voters would be 559. Vimala, the returning officer for the elections, informed that the voter must bring a photo identity card issued by the Election Commission of India (ECI) or by the local authority of which the voter is a member. No other proof would be accepted. “Polling stations have been set up at Nagpur City Room No. 2 and 4 at collector’s office for voting by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) corporators in the city. Members of zilla parishad will be able to cast their vote in tehsil office room No. 1 (MLA residence premises) at Nagpur rural. The other polling stations are in rural areas.” Elaborating on the counting arrangements, the collector said it would be held in Bachat Bhavan, where ballot boxes would be kept in a strong room till the counting day on December 14. “Police officers inspected the Bhavan today with me from the security point of view. Section 144 will come into force in this area tomorrow. The counting of votes will take place at four tables from 8am till the process is completed.” Vimala informed that Covid-19 preventive measures were taken for each polling station. “Every voter would be subjected to thermal scanning. If the body temperature is found to be higher than normal, such voters will be able to cast their vote in the last one hour. Sanitizing facilities have been arranged at all centres.” She added since all polling stations were in the vicinity of the tehsil office, the Setu centres there — in the city, Nagpur rural office, Narkhed, Katol, Ramtek, Umred, Mouda, and Parshivani will be closed on Friday. “As Section 144 is applicable on polling day, people have been barred within 200 meters of the polling station. We appeal to citizens to cooperate in this process. Mobile phones, spy cameras, spy pens, cameras, tabs, as well as any electronic devices are prohibited in polling centres,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mlc-polls-hingna-councillor-prohibited-from-voting/articleshow/88194699.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The court directed the additional government advocate N Vernekar to communicate the order to GCZMA as well as police so that “commercial activities which are taking place at the aforesaid property are stopped immediately”. The court recorded the contents of the affidavit tendered by Shrem Resorts sworn by Mohd Modmeen Saifi, where it was specifically stated that no commercial activities were being carried out in the property, and it was further stated that the live music event promoted by Toy Beach Club scheduled from December 9 to 11 is at an open air venue situated at Vagator, and not in the petitioner’s property. Advocate Anamika Gode representing the petitioner Roshan Mathias, submitted photographs of the event which is to take place from Thursday. “In the said photographs, Toy Beach Club has advertised an event which is to take place on December 11. The photographs also reveal the construction, which is happening at the moment at the said spot,” Gode said. Gode submitted that GCZMA had in 2019 ordered demolition of the deviation/illegal structure, and had ordered that no commercial activity would take place in the said survey no 146/4- E, and that the said order passed by GCZMA in 2019 had attained finality. She added that it was incumbent upon the authority to demolish the illegal construction/deviation constructed by Shrem Resorts, and added that from the face of it, the event is to take place at the property at Calangute and not Vagator as stated in the affidavit. “Prima facie, there appears to be some substance in the petitioner’s submission. In the photographs tendered today, by the petitioner’s counsel, the venue shown is Toy Beach Club, Candolim, which is contrary to what was stated by the respondent no. 6 in his affidavit tendered yesterday. It is shocking that respondent no 6 should file a false affidavit, misleading the court,” the division bench stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-directs-gczma-to-seal-candolim-club-premises/articleshow/88194700.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It is the money that I got from surrogacy that helped us through this tough time,” the now eight-months-pregnant surrogate mother said. She quickly added: “If I could opt for it one more time, I could have made enough money to invest some of it —maybe in a small piece of land — and secure my child’s life to some extent. It is very sad that I cannot it, despite being healthy and capable.” The 30-year-old is among scores of women who will no longer be able to become surrogate mothers because of a cap brought in by the Surrogacy Bill. According to it, no woman can opt to become a surrogate more than once and these woman have to be between 25 and 35 years of age. Further, the bill has also created ambiguity around the compensation. At present, they earn about Rs 4 lakh to Rs 5 lakh for every delivery. “My husband recently abandoned me and my eight-year-old. I was feeling helpless when a friend told me about surrogacy. While I came to the centre in Hyderabad feeling very hopeful, I am now being told that I cannot do it since I am 36 years old.How do those people know if I can do it or not?” said Sheela. The bill has extended the insurance cover of surrogate mothers — from 12 to 36 months— but provided no clarity about whether this would be over and above the compensation package they get.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/surrogates-fret-as-cap-on-age-pregnancies-limit-income/articleshow/88194705.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

He identified the bird as the Himalayan vulture (Gyps himalayensis) or Himalayan Griffon vulture, which is listed as “near threatened” in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list. The vulture is, perhaps, the largest and heaviest bird found in the Himalayas and Tibetan plateau. The Himalayan Griffon is one of the vulture species that has survived the diclofenac scare as compared to other species found in India. Hifazat Ali told TOI, “We received a call from Nagalia Akil village and immediately rushed there. To our surprise, we found a vulture wriggling in pain and unable to fly. We immediately rescued it and handed it over to the forest department. It had deep injuries in one of its legs and neck.” A local veterinarian provided first aid to the bird. The nature of injuries indicates that the vulture had probably got entangled in a Chinese manja while someone was flying a kite, said Rajiv Kumar, divisional forest officer of Rampur. The Chinese manjha was banned in the country several years ago but is still sold and used by kite-flyers. The bird would be sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute in Bareilly for treatment on Friday. “We will also register a departmental case against an unidentified person as the Himalayan vulture is protected under the Wildlife Act,” said DFO Kumar.

Sanjay Jain, a resident of Vikas Nagar, said to get the guarantee card, people have to give a missed call on a mobile number issued by the party, following which they will get the guarantee card which they will have to keep with them. When the party forms the government in the state, this card can be used to get 300 units of electricity free of cost, according to the petition. Jain termed the scheme “unconstitutional”, saying the party is not in power in the state and therefore, offering people such a guarantee card is against Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act. During the hearing, the single bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Tiwari was told that apart from the EC, Jain has made AAP’s CM candidate Col Ajay Kothiyal and the election commission of Uttarakhand also a party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pil-in-ukhand-hc-against-kejriwals-free-electricity-card-court-asks-petitioner-to-approach-ec/articleshow/88193940.cms||---

Karkala town municipal council (TMC) member Shubhada Rao recalled that Captain Agnes Prafulla Menezes, daughter of Phillips Menezes and Mary Menezes of Salmara, visited her house along with her husband Lt Col Singh regularly. Phillips Menezes, a social worker and politician, who served as the vice-president of Karkala municipality, died recently. Meanwhile, Mary Menezes is a homemaker, he said. “I visited their house on Thursday and consoled Prafulla’s mother and sister,” Rao said, who happens to be Prafulla’s batchmate in college. “It was Prafulla who spoke to her family over phone after the unfortunate accident was confirmed. She asked them to remain strong,” he added. Lt Col Singh married Captain Agnes Prafulla Menezes about 15 years ago, and the couple were blessed with a daughter. The family members who are in a state of shock, said they first heard the news about the crash on television. Terming the couple as tough individuals with a soft heart, they said that they never behaved as officers when at home, and Harjinder was loved by everyone. “They used to visit home regularly. Every visit was a memorable one, and we also met them at Rajasthan, Dehradun and other places,” he said. “We can’t believe that we can’t talk to Harjinder anymore. He came here about three years ago. We were looking forward to seeing him soon. It’s a big loss to the nation and family,” said a family member Another family member who was in tears, said that he has not been able to sleep ever since the news broke.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/karkala-mourns-death-of-its-son-in-law-lt-col-harjinder-singh/articleshow/88193944.cms||---

The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by K K Ramesh, a resident of Madurai district. The petitioner stated that several temples in the state are in a bad shape and their properties are not being maintained properly. He stated that the government should constitute a trustee committee headed by a retired judge for all the temples. The committee should comprise an advocate, a woman representative, a person from a scheduled caste community, a social activist and a devotee. Constituting such a committee would not only prevent irregularities but would also be helpful for proper maintenance of the temples and to safeguard its properties, he said. Though the petitioner submitted a representation, no steps were taken. Hence, he moved the HC Madurai bench. The advocate general R Shanmugasundaram appearing for the state submitted that the government has called for applications for appointment of temple trustees. The appointments would be made after scrutinizing the applications. He further submitted that even as per the statutory provisions every board of trustees shall have one member from scheduled caste or scheduled tribe community and a woman representative. Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan said that since the statutory provisions itself provides for a prayer sought for by the petitioner, no further adjudication is required in this petition and hence dismissed it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-plea-to-constitute-panel-for-all-temples/articleshow/88194724.cms||---
---||Nagpur||No proof against Deshmukh, will be out of jail soon: Patil||Nagpur: Nationalist Congress Party state president Jayant Patil on Thursday hoped that former home minister Anil Deshmukh would come out of the prison soon as there “is not an iota of evidence as alleged by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh” against him. Speaking to media here, Patil said the Katol MLA was “unnecessarily” being kept behind bars and central agencies “were making all efforts to extend his custody”. “We will make some alternative arrangements to thwart their attempts and bring him out as soon as possible. There is nothing substantial to keep him in jail after police inspector Sachin Waze and his accomplices had cleared Deshmukh’s name from all allegations mentioned by Singh,” said Patil. Singh, in his letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, had claimed that Deshmukh used to direct police officers for collecting hafta of over Rs100 crore from bars, restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai. In the city to attend a party meeting in Chandrapur, Patil said the NCP would support the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) candidate for MLC local authority constituency elections in Nagpur. “We have already extended the support to the Congress party and whatever the decision taken by them, we would abide by that. Being in a coalition government, we respect our partner’s choice of candidate, as the seat was allotted to them.” Patil said the death of chief of defence staff (CDS) general Bipin Rawat was a “very unfortunate incident”. “We are deeply saddened by the death of the highest ranked soldier in India along with others. We think an inquiry should be initiated to ascertain the cause behind technical fault in the helicopter that is being frequently used to carry VVIPs. Some said the mishap took place due to bad weather while others attribute it to a technical fault, but truth must come out,” he said. Patil refused to comment on the selection of the speaker in the Maharashtra assembly during the winter session from December 22 in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-proof-against-deshmukh-will-be-out-of-jail-soon-patil/articleshow/88194732.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The employees of the OOAT centre, affiliated with de-addiction centres, are on a strike in support of their demands, which include regularisation.A large number of patients had reached OOAT centre to get their medicines. As the on-strike centre employees didn’t serve them, the patients staged a protest and raised slogans against the state government and the civil hospital authorities.A protester, who works as a labourer and is in his 20s, said, “I stopped taking drugs about a year ago. Since then, I have been taking anti-drug medicines from the centre. On Thursday morning, the centre officials told us that they cannot give us medicines as they are on strike. A few days ago, too, we had faced a similar problem.”Another protestor, 40, said, “I was hooked to poppy husk and didn’t work. I decided to quit drugs due to the poor financial condition of my family. After I started undergoing de-addiction treatment, I got a job too. If the centre employees are on protest, the authorities should have made alternative arrangements.”Senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Amarjit Kaur said, “As the staff are specialised in giving medicines to these patients, other employees cannot be deputed for the task. The contractual staff, who are seeking regularisation, had given a representation last week about going on an indefinite strike. The patients are being given symptomatic treatment for withdrawal symptoms.”The health department officials said patients faced problems at Khanna, too, where OOAT centre contractual staff are on strike. Khanna SMO Dr Satpaul said, “As the staff of the centre are protesting, I have deputed a psychiatrist to give medicines to the addicts undergoing treatment.” Jagraon SMO Dr Pardeep Mohindra said, “We have deputed regular staff, who are trained in dealing with these patients, to give medicines to them. The service provision is smooth at the centre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/de-addiction-patients-fail-to-get-medicines-protest/articleshow/88193935.cms||---

But the chairman still approved the agenda, saying the quorum was complete. He refused to postpone the meeting. Meanwhile, as a mark of protest against the LIT, JP Singh, a resident of Dugri, sold groundnuts outside the trust office in Feroze Gandhi market.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court upheld the Bombay high court’s order granting default bail last week.  Dressed in a blue kurta, she waved and smiled at those waiting outside before boarding a vehicle waiting for her. Among those present to pick her up were her daughter Maaysha and friend Smita Gupta. Bharadwaj hugged her daughter. Two women inmates she had helped inside the prison were also present. “We are very happy as friends and family of Sudha Bharadwaj that she is walking out today, but our hearts are heavy that the other co-accused are not walking out with her,” said Gupta. She said Bharadwaj is happy to be out and to meet her daughter, but is concerned about her co-accused who remain in jail and the plight of other undertrials. “She would really like the system of criminal justice to become more humane. She is especially concerned about those who have no legal representation, no recourse to any lawyers.”. When asked what Bharadwaj was looking forward to, Gupta said, “Just to smell air of freedom and have some curd rice and filter coffee.” She added that arrangements relating to her residence in the city are being worked out. Imposing about 16 conditions, the special NIA judge DE Kothalikar had said she would have to reside within the jurisdiction of the Mumbai court and “not leave” without permission. The court also advised against “gathering of visitors, other than near relatives” at her residence. Bharadwaj should not indulge in activities akin to those she is accused of and “not try to establish communication with co-accused or any other person involved …in similar activities...” The court said she would have to attend the trial regularly and ensure it does not get delayed due to her. The court also said that she should desist from making any statements about the proceedings in the media. Among the 15 accused, she is the second to get bail. Poet and activist Varavara Rao is out on interim bail on health grounds. The 16th accused, Jesuit priest and tribal rights activist, Fr Stan Swamy (84), who was lodged at Taloja jail since his arrest on October 8, 2020 died in July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bharadwaj-out-after-3-yrs-looks-forward-to-curd-rice-filter-coffee/articleshow/88195343.cms||Rebecca Samervel

A youngster in Sangareddy climbed a tree in a bid to escape from the health staff who had come to administer the vaccine on Wednesday. As he had not taken the vaccine, the staff who identified him went to his house but Mohammed Ghousuddin escaped from there and perched himself on a tree branch. The staff tried to convince him to come down but he was unrelenting. When his father told them that his son was not in a proper mental condition, staff left. In some public places, officials are stopping those who are still refusing to take the vaccine and trying to convince them on the need to take the jab. A vaccination team at Nirmal bus stand identified some to administer vaccinations. Nirmal district collector Musharraf Ali Faruqui himself motivated two passengers and they agreed. In Adilabad, cultural teams have been active, singing songs at public places to capture the attention of the public. At the places where the teams perform, a vaccination team is also part of the effort. With chief secretary Somesh Kumar expressing that public representatives should do their bit, recently, Sabitha Indra Reddy stopped by the road in Vikarabad municipality and enquired from people if they had got vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/youth-climbs-tree-to-avoid-taking-jab/articleshow/88194772.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The film has no dialogue,” said Suresh, as he explained to TOI how he moved from making a film on eradication of child labour to ‘Ray’s Camera Point of View’. The Ray documentary had a different approach, he said. The idea is to analyze Ray’s films’ cinematography through Ghosh’s prism and instead of not using dialogues, Suresh wants to go in for interviews. “Prompted by TOI’s article on Ghosh, I proposed to Films Division of India to make this film. It being accepted, I want to begin shooting from early next year,” he said. Anil Ghosh along with Ray during the shooting of his filmsGhosh is happy to be a part of the documentary. “I am an octogenarian but I would want to contribute my bit on Manik-da. I have given my consent to Suresh. There are many untold stories from his sets, including my experiences of feature films and documentaries, like ‘Sikkim’, with the legend. Those stories are revelations of Ray’s technical brilliance and the kind of a human being he was,” he said. According to the plan, Ghosh will share his on-location experiences. “This will bring out the aesthetics of the master in image-making. The film will consist of a combination of interviews, on-location working stills and clippings from Ray’s films. As an assistant cameraman, Anil-da will share Ray’s relationship with his camera crew,” Suresh added. He wants Ghosh to share details on Ray’s use of Mitchell and Arriflex camera, the lenses used and his lighting. “The idea is to take him to Technicians’ Studio and NT1 studio, where he can share his memories. I want him to recollect how a close shot of a tiger was shot in ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’ and the final scene of ‘Sadgati’,” Suresh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/award-winner-to-film-docu-on-rays-camera-magic-with-his-focus-puller/articleshow/88194751.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Goa||Goa: IIT Madras seeks more information on Atal Setu||PANAJI: IIT Madras has asked the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) and L&T for additional details about the waterproofing and asphalting process utilised for the Atal Setu to try and determine the cause for the frequent potholes. IIT Madras has also asked GSIDC to provide a core cut of the surface layer of the bridge to find out why the adhesive layer fails to adhere with the tar or asphalt. GSIDC had approached IIT-Madras for help to identify why the asphalt laid on top of the adhesive bond coat fails to hold the hot-mix, and if Goa’s rainfall, humidity, salinity and temperature variations could be factors that hamper proper bonding with the bitumen. “IIT Madras has asked for more details. They sent us a mail and also asked for a core cut of the road on the bridge to study the various layers,” a GSIDC engineer said. Even as GSIDC gathers the requested information, several massive potholes have erupted all along the bridge constructed at a cost of Rs 546 crore. The bridge, which was hastily inaugurated on January 27, 2019, has seen several defects emerge since then, prompting GSIDC to rope in IITMadras to find a solution. “The adhesion bond between the waterproofing membrane and the asphalt is slipping and not holding. That is the problem. We need a solution for it,” a senior GSIDC engineer said. In October, GSIDC had submitted data to the Chennai-based institute, which would conduct a peer-reviewed study to identify the cause for the frequent potholes. GSIDC officials said that L&T is likely to patch up the craters that have developed on the 3.1km-long cable-stayed bridge while laying asphalt for the Merces-Porvorim ramp. “The ramp which is closed will also be thrown open soon,” the GSIDC official said. Based on the results obtained by IIT Madras, L&T may be asked to take corrective measures. Also, given that the same adhesive bond will be used for the Zuari bridge, engineers are keen to find a solution immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/iit-madras-seeks-more-information-on-atal-setu/articleshow/88194718.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Kochi||Kerala HC moved over approval for ‘Churuli’||KOCHI: The high court has admitted a petition seeking an enquiry on how the Malayalam movie ‘Churuli’ got censor board’s approval despite containing excessive use of abusive language. Considering the petition filed by advocate Peggy Fen during admission hearing, Justice N Nagaresh issued notice to the film’s makers. The court remarked that the movie was atrocious in nature. The petitioner has alleged that excessive use of foul language in the movie is intentional and is aimed at garnering more attention to it. The movie contains obscene and filthy language that is opposed to public morality and tranquillity, it is alleged. Words used by characters in the movie are not those used by the public and such language is not used by people even within the privacy of their homes, the petition said while contending that the words and phrases used outrage the modesty of women and children equally. Chances of the public imitating the language of the movie as it is an art form is also highlighted by the petitioner. Allowing it to occur would affect the public morality and tranquillity, the petitioner argues. Children, especially teenagers, could copy the deviant behaviour of the characters, the plea said. As the movie was released through ‘over the top’ (OTT) channels, even children have access to it, the petitioner points out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-moved-over-approval-for-churuli/articleshow/88193946.cms||---

Speaking at a conference organised by the Goa startup promotion cell (SPC) and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Prabhu said that legacy norms and dated laws stymie startups from doing business in India. Interestingly, chief minister Pramod Sawant gave the event a miss. Prabhu also said that Goa can become the startup capital of the country if it can address challenges of access to funds and markets. “Is it so easy for a startup to do business? Not really. You can always tell people to enter business as a startup, but once you enter it is very difficult to survive,” said Prabhu. “Therefore, regulatory issues need to be addressed properly. Regulation should also change as the startups change.” This is not the first time that Prabhu has highlighted the hurdles posed by archaic legislation for Indian startups. As the minister for commerce and industry, and civil aviation minister, Prabhu had repeatedly stressed on the need for legislation to keep up with the changing times. “Regulators need to understand startups better, their challenges better. Otherwise, you will have an 11th century regulation for the 22nd century startup. Therefore regulatory authorities need to change their thinking,” he said . Director for information and technology Ankita Anand said that of the 116 certified startups in Goa, at least 21 have availed of Rs 1.42 crore in incentives under the Goa startup policy. Prabhu said that Goa offers the right platform to promote startups and an efficient way to do so will be to promote work-ations. “There needs to be a regular event in Goa for startups every December. Let this become the beginning to make Goa the startup capital,” said Prabhu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/regulatory-issues-for-startups-need-to-be-resolved/articleshow/88194736.cms||---

Although a part of the herd crossed Vainganga river from Gadchiroli side to enter Chandrapur, it returned the same night. Forest officials have upped their vigil and are keeping a close eye on the movement of the herd in coordination with Gadchiroli counterparts. The herd of elephants moving from Odisha had entered Dhanora and Murumgaon ranges in Gadchiroli district on October 17. The herd of 22 elephants ravaged crops in Gadchiroli and continued to move south for two months. In the meanwhile, a female elephant delivered a calf in Gadchiroli forest and their numbers grew to 23. The herd moved for around 50km through the forests and fields to reach the bank of Vainganga river in Wadsa forest division a few days back. The herd was seen on the bank of Vainganga River that divides Amori forest range in Gadchiroli from North Bramhapuri range in Chandrapur on Tuesday and Wednesday. “A part of the herd comprising 8-10 jumbos crossed Vainganga river on Wednesday night. After staying for a few hours in North Bramhapuri range, the elephants rejoined their herd in Armori range. However, we have sounded an alert and taken up intense monitoring along the river bank anticipating the return of elephants to our side,” said deputy conservator of forest, Brahmapuri forest division, Dipesh Malhotra while talking to TOI. He claimed there are three calves in the elephant herd. Two of them had crossed the river in the night with elder jumbos, but returned. “It is likely that part of the herd had crossed the river for reconnaissance of their further travel. Hence, we are not taking any chances and have alerted villagers, while intensifying our vigil,” Malhotra said. DCF Malhotra did not reveal the point where the herd crossed the river, but maintained that the river has around 10 feet deep water and the jumbos can easily cross it. He claimed they have sounded an alert with the help of dawandi (public announcements) and warned people about dos and don’ts in case the elephant herd crosses the river. “We are also going to put up boards and banners about precautions to be taken if the pachyderms enter our area,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/some-elephants-cross-river-into-brahmapuri-division-go-back-same-night/articleshow/88194761.cms||Mazhar Ali

The incident is most likely the first-ever mid-air emergency involving a SpiceJet Boeing 737 MAX aircraft after the fleet returned to service on November 23. The three-year-old aircraft (VT MXE), which had departed Mumbai at 6.55pm, was eastward-bound and had climbed to around 33,000 feet when a problem with hydraulics and ‘oil filter bypass’ forced the pilots to divert, said a source. The aircraft landed in Mumbai around 7.50pm. In its previous avatar, the Boeing 737 MAX had suffered recurring problems, which had the aircraft system overriding the pilot’s inputs to repeatedly push the plane’s nose down post takeoff. The repeated downward pitching had led to two fatal accidents, one in Indonesia and the other in Ethiopia, killing a total of 346 people. Then, from March 2019, the aircraft was grounded worldwide till November 2020 when the US cleared it for resumption of flights. In India, though, SpiceJet brought it back to life again only last month. A SpiceJet spokesperson said: “SG- 467 operating Mumbai-Kolkata returned to Mumbai after takeoff due to a technical issue. The aircraft landed safely in Mumbai.” SpiceJet is currently the only Boeing 737 MAX operator in India.  On the day it resumed Boeing 737 MAX operations, SpiceJet said the Boeing 737 MAX had operated more than 2,35,000 commercial flights since it returned to service in the US in November 2020. The flights had totalled over 5,75,000 flight hours. More than 32 airlines have returned their Boeing 737 MAX fleets to service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/b737-max-to-kol-returns-to-mumbai-over-technical-glitch/articleshow/88195360.cms||Manju V

The order revoking his suspension, issued on Thursday, observed that the suspension review committee constituted by the government had already cancelled the order that was issued by Thomas and no tree was cut down on the basis of that order. Also, disciplinary action has already been initiated against the officer. Under these circumstances, there is no need to place the officer under suspension. On the basis of the recommendation of the suspension review committee, the government decided to revoke his suspension order. The government had cited that the order – permitting Tamil Nadu to cut down 15 trees from the vicinity of the baby dam in Mullaperiyar – concerned inter-state matters and was issued without a consultation at the ministerial level. The government had also observed that the order went against its stand in the cases on Mullaperiyar dam issue that was under consideration of the SC. The government concluded that the acts of Thomas, prima facie, amounted to official misconduct and violation of All-India Service Conduct Rules, 1968. He was subsequently placed under suspension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-revokes-suspension-of-bennichan-thomas/articleshow/88193962.cms||---

Prestige BioPharma will be responsible for sustainable commercial supply of the biosimilar from its manufacturing facilities at Osong in South Korea, while Dr Reddy’s will be responsible for local registrations, marketing and sales in licensed territories. Prestige BioPharma’s trastuzumab (HD201) is a proposed biosimilar to Roche’s Herceptin that is used for treatment of HER2 positive breast and metastatic gastric cancer. In some types of cancer cells, HER2 is overexpressed and stimulates growth of cancer cells. Trastuzumab, which targets human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), works by selectively binding to HER2, stopping growth of these cancer cells. Lisa S Park, CEO, Prestige BioPharma said Dr Reddy’s was the ideal partner to commercialise the company’s lead biosimilar in these territories and strengthen its biosimilar programmes in global markets. Terming the move as part of company’s efforts to accelerate access to affordable and innovative medicines, MV Ramana, CEO-branded markets (India & emerging markets), Dr Reddy’s, said the partnership will help the company combine Prestige’s expertise in biosimilars with Dr Reddy’s commercial strengths and growth ambition in these markets.

Covidengue is a new medical terminology that denotes coinfection of dengue and Covid-19 in a person. Out of 1,700 dengue cases diagnosed in one laboratory in the last three months, 47 are Covidengue cases, doctors said. They said the incidence of Covidengue is around 3%, but it could be much higher as only a few people undergo both Covid-19 and dengue tests at the same time. The good news, however, is the coinfection has not resulted in increased severity of either dengue or Covid-19. Treatment is symptomatic for Covidengue patients. Dr P Ranganadham, senior neurosurgeon, Sunshine hospitals, Gachibowli, said since Hyderabad and other parts of Telangana are endemic to dengue, there’s a possibility of a patient being infected both by dengue and Covid-19 at the same time. “We have analysed data of Covid-19 and dengue infections from a leading diagnostic laboratory. In a span of three months, the laboratory got 29,200 Covid-19 cases and 1700 dengue cases. As many as 47 patients tested positive for both Covid-19 and dengue,” Dr Ranganadham told TOI, adding that one should go in for diagnosis of seasonal and endemic diseases along with Covid-19 if one comes across Covid-19 symptoms along with those of dengue, malaria or chikungunya. Dr K Seshi Kiran, consultant physician, Yashoda hospitals, Somajiguda said the confection of Covid-19 and dengue are being seen more frequently in dengue-endemic areas, especially in Telangana. “The significance of this problem is the fact that the treatment protocol for the diseases is different. Hence the need for definitive treatment for both conditions. The possibility of cross-reactivity of the diagnostic tests was considered but is very unlikely,” he said. Dr Seshi Kiran said dengue presents with a biphasic fever, haemo-concentration (increase in RBC) and low platelet counts. “The diagnostic difficulty may arise when there is a lung injury due to dengue as well as Covid-19. Hence proper evaluation is essential. Mortality and morbidity are high in confections,” he added. Referring to Covidengue cases in Hyderabad, Dr M Shaeq Mirza, consultant physician and diabetes specialist, Apollo Hospitals, Hyderguda, said in clinical reports the outcome of a coinfection with both viruses was not worse than having one infection. He said the symptoms of both diseases may be similar initially with high grade fever, malaise (discomfort), weakness, rashes and lethargy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covidengue-cases-newworry-for-docs-in-city/articleshow/88194745.cms||Syed Akbar

Justice G R Swaminathan said that during the previous hearing, the investigating officer had produced CCTV footage which indicates that the deceased was going to a pesticide shop and was walking to the spot where he was later found dead. The judge said that the evidence prima facie indicates that the death of the petitioner’s brother was a suicide. The court passed the order while hearing the petition filed by S Suman Anand, a man belonging to the scheduled caste community and a resident of Thovalai in Kanyakumari district. The petitioner stated that his younger brother Suresh Kumar, 27, was in love with a woman from another caste for eight years. He stated that the woman’s parents refused to marry her to Kumar .

The two accused, both residents of Kausa area in Mumbra were acquitted by the special The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS) judge RS Gupta in its recent order on Saturday. The prosecution told the court that on August 25, 2016, a police party was patrolling in the Mumbra area, they received a tip-off that the two persons were consuming Ganja with the help of Chillum or pipe near a ground which is located near religious place in Kausa area. Subsequently, the police called panch and the duo were apprehended and booked under various sections of NDPS act and were sent for medical examination. The defense counsel punched holes in the prosecution story and pointed out several lacunas in the prosecution. The judge in his order noted, “..It is worth to be taken note that no substance was seized from the possession of accused persons nor the Chilim containing tobacco was sent for chemical examination to verify whether it contained a contraband substance purported to be Ganja.” It is pertinent to note that the mandatory provisions of NDPS Act in regard to search and seizure is also completely overlooked by the prosecution. Accused persons were not informed about their legal rights before gazetted officer or Magistrate, this itself creates a doubt on prosecution case.” The judge further added, “..the certificate clearly states on medical examination no smell of Ganja was detected i.e., accused persons was not under influence of ganja at the time of medical examination. It is pertinently to noted the medical certificate does not support the prosecution case in regard to consumption of contraband substance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-two-let-off-as-holes-found-in-ndps-case/articleshow/88195748.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No cogent proof, says cruise drug case bail order||MUMBAI: Granting bail to 40-year-old Okoro Uzeoma from Nigeria in the cruise drugs bust case, the special NDPS court has held that the prosecution failed to bring any cogent evidence that he was a peddler and consumer of drugs. Uzeoma was arrested on October 10, allegedly with 14 grams of cocaine. The court said that except for the statement of his co-accused, an alleged peddler named Abdul Qadir, there is no prima facie evidence to show that he committed the offence as alleged by the prosecution or that he dealt in drugs at commercial quantity. “In the case at hand, though prosecution claimed that applicant is peddler and he used to supply contraband to accused no 9 (Qadir), prosecution failed to bring on record any cogent evidence in that regard,” special NDPS judge VV Patil said. Accepting his advocate Shalaka Hatode’s argument, the court held that in the absence of any proof, the recovery made from Qadir cannot be connected to Uzeoma. The court made similar observations in a separate order granting bail to alleged supplier Vikrant Chhokar (33) from Noida. The NCB had alleged that Chhokar was found in possession of 5 grams of MD (mephedrone), 10 grams of cocaine and 10 grams of charas. So far, 18 of the 20 arrested accused have been granted bail in the case. While Uzeoma and Chhokar were granted bail on Saturday and Monday respectively, the detailed order copies were made available on Wednesday. “Except statement of accused there is no prima facie evidence on record to show that applicant (Chhokar) hatched conspiracy with co-accused. Further, so far as recovery of contraband at the instance of applicant is concerned, it is non-commercial quantity and rigours of Section 37 of NDPS Act would not apply,” the court said in the bail order. Under Section 37 of the NDPS Act, no person accused under certain sections or for offences involving commercial quantity can be given bail unless the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe he is not guilty and that he is unlikely to commit an offence while out on bail. The court said there is no evidence on record to show that Chhokar was in any way involved in financing of illicit trafficking or harbouring of offenders.The court said that since Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha were granted bail by the Bombay high court, he can also be released on bail on the grounds of parity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-cogent-proof-says-cruise-drug-case-bail-order/articleshow/88195368.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change posted the information on Twitter on Thursday. Ramsar is a wetland site designated under the Ramsar Convention, an intergovernmental environmental treaty established in 1971 by Unesco, which came into force in 1975. The convention was held in Ramsar, Iran, and hence the name. The convention facilitates national action plans and brings in international cooperation for the conservation of wetlands,along with wise sustainable use of their resources. Haiderpur Wetland covers an area of 6,908 hectares and is situated on the Muzaffarnagar-Bijnor border in Uttar Pradesh. It was formed in 1984 by the construction of Madhya Ganga Barrage at the confluence of Solani and Ganga rivers and is a part of Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary. A source of freshwater and groundwater recharge, Haiderpur Wetland supports a variety of plant species, and is home to numerous animals, including swamp deer, otters, gharial and fishing cat. It plays host to more than 300 species of birds, many of which come for wintering. Terming the Ramsar site designation as a boost to wetland conservation, Suresh Babu, WWF-India, director, rivers basins and water policy, said, “The work that has been initiated by UP forest division, district administration, WWF-India and others, gives us hope that Haiderpur can be a great model for wise use of wetland. We hope a community-led co-management approach will help enhance the health of Haiderpur wetland.” Former divisional commissioner of Saharanpur, Sanjay Kumar, under whom the wetland was developed into a tourist spot and opened formally on November 14, 2019, said Haiderpur is one of India's finest birding hotspots. “The bird species count jumped from 146 in July, 2019 to 324 now. It has one the largest congregations of Bar Headed goose, Greylag goose, Ruddy Shelduck and Ferruginous Pochard. Now, its a Ramsar site. This is a really great achievement for the wetland,” said Kumar, who is currently finance secretary, UP government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/haiderpur-wetland-in-up-is-new-ramsar-site/articleshow/88193986.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Rush for RT-PCR as pax make beeline||HYDERABAD: The number of people going for RT-PCR tests at hospitals has seen an upswing over the last two weeks. While many opting for the test are those who want to travel out of the country and essentially need a certificate, others are people who had recently travelled back and suspect having contracted the Omicron variant of the virus. The number of RT-PCR tests being done at big hospitals were around 50 per day even a fortnight ago, but has now gone up to 80 to 90 per day, as per hospital sources. Many people turning up for tests had come back from high-risk countries but via other countries, say sources. In one such case, a nervous citizen underwent tests three times since his return at a city-based private hospital as he returned from London via Dubai. “He had spent two days in Dubai, but since Dubai is a prominent connecting airport, the risk of contracting the virus there is high. We have seen a few such people opting for tests this week,” said a laboratory head of a diagnostic service centre in the city. Doha-Hyderabad and Dubai-Hyderabad are important routes for people coming from Europe and US to Hyderabad, said travel agents. “We are witnessing a jump in numbers and some people have come two to three times for repeating tests within days of the first one. When we tried to understand why, they said they have taken connecting flights to India, but have actually come from a high-risk nation. Having landed from countries not listed as a high risk, they did not undergo mandatory test and are worried about having got the virus,” said a source at the King Koti hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rush-for-rt-pcr-as-pax-make-beeline/articleshow/88194755.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Former Union min accused of threatening 2 sadhvis, booked||Haridwar: Two sadhvis (women seers), Tripta Saraswati and Sukhjit Saraswati, have filed a complaint accusing former Union minister, Swami Chinmayanand, of threatening them with "dire consequences" if they continue to stake a claim on the private property of Swami Sahaj Prakash, the former mahant of Pawan Dham Ashram in Haridwar. Chinmayanand has denied the allegation. The duo claimed that the seer's private property was bequeathed to them through a will. Chinmayanand, however, questioned the validity of the will. "According to a Supreme Court verdict, all private properties of a seer go to the institution to which he belonged. He does not have the power to transfer it to an individual," he told TOI. After the death of Swami Sahaj Prakash on November 14, 2020, his disciple, Vedant Prakash, was anointed as his heir on November 29, 2020, by the Mahanirvani Akhara and other seers in Haridwar. He assumed his role as the caretaker of the ashram. In 2021, the Gita Bhawan Trust Society was reconstituted. Chinmayanand was appointed the trust's patron. "He now holds all executive powers of the president, which were earlier held by Swami Sahaj Prakash," Vedant said. With the advice of a forensic expert, Vedant filed a criminal case in a court at Moga, Punjab, against the sadhvis for a "fake will." He has requested the court to cancel the will on this ground. A criminal case has been registered against the sadhvis and their supporter, Sandeep Vajapeyi, for forcibly trying to occupy the property at the Rajpur police station in Dehradun. The sadhvis, on the other hand, filed an application in a Haridwar court for succession based on the will. They also filed a criminal case against Chinmayanand, Vedant, and Sagar Muni, who is a member of the ashram, in a Haridwar court for selling off 36 bigha land of the Ashram. "That case was dismissed a couple of months ago. Likewise, another police complaint that they filed against us was rejected. The police said that it was a civil case related to a property dispute," Vedant said. The sadhvis, before joining a public school at Moga as yoga teachers, had been with Ram Rahim for several years. They taught Sahaj Prakash yoga and pranayam at his ashram. The mahant fell sick and was admitted to a hospital on September 19, 2021, where he tested positive for Covid-19. On October 23, 2020, he was discharged from the hospital but continued to be on oxygen support. He was again hospitalised at Apollo Hospital in New Delhi on November 12, where he died two days later on November 14, 2020. Those questioning the validity of the will brought attention to the fact that it was registered on November 2, 2020, eight days before the Sadhvis were initiated as disciples of the mahant. The seer died merely 12 days after the will's execution. "This is suspicious. It is also proof that he did not get proper treatment," Chinmayanand alleged. As for the alleged threatening call by Chinmayanand, Vedant Prakash dismissed it as baseless. In a video produced by Tripta, a copy of which is with TOI, Chinmayanand is seen promising Tripta of an important role in the ashram's management. However, Tripta asks, "Why can't I be the president?" Chinmayanand said that he alone is suitable for the post, and added that his influence as a politician would ensure that he gets it. The sadhvis say they are unhappy with the police's response. "We complained against Chinmayanand to the DGP and the SSP of Haridwar on September 15, 2021 and again on November 21, 2021, but to no avail," Tripta told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/former-union-min-accused-of-threatening-2-sadhvis-booked/articleshow/88194004.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

A cyber fraudster impersonated a private bank’s executive on phone, stole Kambli’s bank details on the pretext of updating his Know Your Customer (KYC) details and withdrew more than Rs 1.1 lakh in multiple transactions on December 3. Bandra police, with the help of cyber police and the bank, managed to reverse the transaction.

On December 3, Kambli received a call from the bank’s “executive” who told him to download a quick support app to update his KYC details. A police officer said: “After he downloaded the app, the fraudster got remote access to his phone and was able to view his bank details and one-time password. Ev-en as the call was on, money was transferred out of his account.” Kambli said“On receiving alerts on the phone, I immediately called my bank’s customer care number and blocked the account.

M Arumugam, attached to the Madurai mofussil bus depot, has been a driver with the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) for 13 years. He was driving on the Madurai-Kodaikanal route and left the Arapalayam bus stand in the city at 6.20am. “The bus reached Guru Theatre Junction, that is about a kilometre from the bus stand, around 6.30am when he felt discomfort. He thought it could be indigestion,” the depot manager told TOI. Arumugam waited for a two-wheeler and a car to cross the signal when the amber light was on and then took the vehicle to the left side of the road after crossing the junction. He informed bus conductor S Packiaraj that he had a burning sensation in the chest and asked him to get a digestion tablet and a water bottle. While Packiaraj walked to a nearby pharmacy, Arumugam turned off the engine and shifted to a passenger seat close to the front steps. On returning to the bus a couple of minutes later, the conductor found the driver motionless, and alerted the EMRI 108 ambulance service. He was declared dead by the ambulance staff. The body was taken to the Government Rajaji Hospital for autopsy. His superiors said that Arumugam was a punctual driver with a clean record. Hailing from Kottaiyur in Chellapatti, he is survived by his wife and two schoolgoing daughters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tnstc-driver-dies-of-heart-attack-after-parking-bus/articleshow/88194773.cms||---

However, unlike the pre-pandemic times there will be restrictions during these 12 hours to reduce the chances of a Covid-19 spread. The Tenkasi district administration has issued a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure the same. A maximum of only 16 people including 10 men and six women will be allowed at a time at Courtallam main falls and Five falls. At the old Courtallam falls, it will be 15 people comprising five men and 10 women. Those in the queue should be made to stand at a distance of two metres. Tourists as well as frontline workers attending them should be screened for fever with thermal scanners. Arrangements will be in place to temporarily isolate people with suspected symptoms. Those from containment zones are advised not to come to the falls. The district administration has also formed four crisis management teams, each comprising representatives from the revenue, police, health and forest departments and as many rapid response teams. Officials have also been asked to display the SOPs at public places and to keep adequate stock of disinfectants. Respective executive officers of local bodies and block development officials should ensure that shops follow SOPs. Local traders who primarily depend on tourism for their livelihood said that it has been completely affected since the lockdown came to effect in the third week of March last year. After remaining locked till last December, it was opened for a few days before it was once again closed.

Sharma, who is the only UGC emeritus fellow in defence studies in the country, said, "I am extremely proud of his achievements. He was one of the brightest students I taught." Sharma is an expert in studying defence strategies against Pakistan and China. He retired from Meerut College in 1999 and was the PhD mentor of over 30 senior defence personnel including former Army chief General V K Singh, Lieutenant General N S Malik, vice-chief of Army staff Lieutenant General V K Sood, and Major General S C Kashyap. "General Rawat was one of my favourite students. He put in a lot of hard work, and had a very sincere nature," the professor told TOI. The General had completed his PhD in military media strategy over three years, in 2011. He was posted in Delhi at the time as a Lieutenant General and would travel to Meerut to meet his mentor almost every week. "He always behaved like a sincere student, despite his stature," Sharma said. The professor later received a letter and was awarded a medal as "tribute for all-round excellence" by the General in February 2013. In the letter, the General had requested the professor to deliver a lecture on Chinese strategy in Pakistan. According to the General, China was providing “extraordinary support to Pakistan in 2013 and it was important for the Indian Army to understand the reasons behind the move and its implications for India.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/gen-rawat-was-one-of-the-brightest-students-i-taught-phd-guide-of-cds/articleshow/88194010.cms||Ishita Mishra

Former TRS minister and now BJP Huzurabad MLA Eatala Rajender has taken the initiative to get the saffron party to support TRS rebel candidate Sardar Ravinder Singh in Karimnagar. Singh, a former mayor, is touted to be close to Eatala and had quit the party recently. “We have decided to back independents with a view to defeat TRS. Our local representatives were told vote with this mindset,” a senior leader closely monitoring the MLC elections told TOI. Both Congress and BJP, which lack the necessary numbers to challenge the ruling TRS, are rallying behind independent candidates. Sources said Singh is all set to secure the backing of Congress too. Party MLA and former minister D Sridhar Babu as well as party MLC T Jeevan Reddy have been in touch with MPTC, ZPTC members and other elected representatives. The BJP has 108 votes and Congress 50 votes. By managing some more votes, the parties want to spring a surprise and defeat the TRS candidate, sources said. With four of its 108 local representatives from Karimnagar defecting to the TRS, the BJP set up a camp in Hyderabad to keep its flock together ahead of the crucial polling. The contest in Nalgonda is also going to be tough for the TRS. Six independents are running for MLC seat and five have thrown their lot behind K Nagesh. All the parties held a mock voting session for elected representatives on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-rallies-voters-for-trs-rebel/articleshow/88194776.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Before starting the drive, the authorities asked shopkeepers to keep inside their stuff spilling on the roads. The drive started from BL Kapoor Hospital, and passed through Daresi, Books’ Market, Kesarganj Mandi and then reached the Railway Station Road. Near the Railway Station Road, officials had heated arguments with the shopkeepers, who even blocked the road for almost an hour. Initially, there wasn’t much resentment, but by the time the officials reached the Railway Station Road, a number of shopkeepers gathered. The shopkeepers alleged that the MC officials lifted one counter with the till from inside an electronics shop and mobile phone covers, headphones and other things were thrown away. This enraged the shopkeepers and they started raising slogans against the MC and the Congress government. The cops tried to pacify them, but they refused to relent and blocked MC’s vehicles. One of the shopkeepers alleged that he was pushed away and his turban tossed. When the cops lifted one of the protesters from the road, shopkeepers blocked the way with autos and sat there for almost an hour.Senior deputy mayor Shyam Sunder Malhotra arrived at the site and told the shopkeepers that the drive was being carried out to resolve the traffic issue and they needed their support. He convinced them to end the protest and cops from Kotwali police station also reached there, after which the protest ended. When asked about the drive, Malhotra said, “Public complaints about traffic jams in Old City markets were pouring in, so we had started this drive. If shopkeepers behave like this, how will we manage the situation? I will talk to mayor Balkar Sandhu about it.” However, he denied the allegations of shopkeepers and said the MC staff lifted material from roadside and not from the shops. For removal of temporary encroachments, there was no need to serve notices, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/old-city-markets-shopkeepers-lock-horns-with-officials-stage-protest/articleshow/88194012.cms||---

These bills were later produced as evidence to Kumbh Mela's health department. Police said Ashish Vashishth, owner of Delphia Labs, one of the labs sub-contracted to conduct Covid tests, prepared fake bills and officials of Max Corporate Services submitted those. Investigation officer of the case, inspector Rakendra Singh Kathiat, told TOI, “We examined the bills submitted by Max Corporate Services with the help of experts and found that they were made after tampering with the letterhead of Nalwa Laboratories. Administrative inquiry conducted by IAS officer Saurbh Gahrwar also confirmed the illegality in his report.” Meanwhile, Dr Navtej Nalwa, owner of Nalwa Laboratories, against whom an arrest warrant has been issued, continues to be absconding. “We have not given a clean chit to Nalwa and are trying to arrest him,” added Kathiat. Earlier, the STF probe had revealed that Max Corporate Services, which is not approved by the ICMR, had signed an MoU with Nalwa Labs and Dr Lalchandani Labs to become eligible as one of the agencies for conducting Covid-19 tests during the Kumbh. Last month, Mallika and Sharat Pant, owners of Max Corporate Services were arrested in the case. Besides, a probe is also ongoing to ascertain the role of Dr Lalchandani Labs in the scam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/letterhead-of-nalwa-lab-used-to-forge-covid-bills-during-kumbh-cops/articleshow/88194038.cms||MS Nawaz

They have filled all the deep potholes and will lay bitumen from Friday. The residents of nearby villages said the road has not been constructed since 2008 and from over five years they have been demanding its reconstruction.They said it is only a two-km-long stretch to the gurdwara, which is visited every month by lakhs of devotees who come from far and wide. For the construction of the road, the public works department had prepared estimates of Rs 1.72 crore in November 2020. But till date, they have not started the work.Manpreet Singh Dhami from SBS Kartar Singh Memorial Youth Club, Katani Kalan, said, “We knocked on all the doors in the past four-and-a-half years to get this road reconstructed, met MLAs, MP and officials of various departments, but to no avail. We had protested at Ludhiana-Chandigarh Road on December 5 to make ourselves heard, but nobody listened to us. Therefore, the devotees collected money and started the road work. On Friday, bitumen work will be done on the stretch.”Another member of the club Jagjit Singh said, “This stretch connects Southern Bypass with Ludhiana-Chandigarh Road and leads to Deg Sar Sahib Gurdwara. Usually in a day, too many vehicles pass through it. With the authorities and the government failing to provide basic amenities, people have to spend from their own pockets. Devotees have come forward and joined hands to build this road.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/where-theres-a-will-theres-a-road/articleshow/88194035.cms||---
---||Meerut||DU tiger panel chalks out plan to make ATR eco-tourism zone||Bijnor: A three-member team that was on a two-day visit to Amangarh Tiger Reserve (ATR) for chalking out a plan to develop it, has suggested setting up of three entry gates, watch towers, roads and a rescue centre among other proposals to make it an attractive eco-tourism spot. The team was led by Rajesh Gopal, serving as secretary general of the Global Tiger Forum, Delhi University, who has contributed in developing several tiger reserve areas as tourist places. Taking up the suggestions made by the team, Patel told TOI, “There will be three entry gates to ATR -- one from Kehripur, second from Pili Dam area and the third gate will be opened from Jhirana side, Kalagarh area, in Uttarakhand. Besides, roads will be repaired. Some watch towers, a rescue centre for wildlife, forest pickets and a surveillance system will be set up here. We plan to open ATR for tourists from next year.” Amangarh Tiger Reserve was carved out of Corbett National Park about 20 years ago when the state of Uttarakhand was created. The ATR is a buffer zone of Corbett National Park. It was designated as a tiger reserve in 2012 but remains dependent on Corbett for poaching surveillance, wildlife veterinarians and rescue centres. It has none of its own. Over the years, the 90-square kilometre Amangarh remained largely neglected due to paucity of funds. Despite several proposals to develop the ATR as an eco- tourism spot, nothing moved forward. Its wildlife, meanwhile, has multiplied. In 2013, it had 13 tigers. Now, the number has gone up to 27. The number of elephants has also gone up from 33 to 105 in the same period. Now, foresters hope that things will change. The development of eco-tourism will help generate employment for locals, who can get work as cooks, waiters, guides and drivers,said a forest official. This will also benefit the 15 villages around the Amangarh reserve. All of them are in remote areas with few basic facilities. If the area becomes a tourist spot, the villages can expect better infrastructure, specially roads, and, even schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/du-tiger-panel-chalks-out-plan-to-make-atr-eco-tourism-zone/articleshow/88194040.cms||Harveer Dabas

Inaugurating the event, which was attended by thousands of people and almost all leaders from Panakkad Thangal family, Panakkad Sadikali Shihab Thangal took an indirect dig at CM Pinarayi Vijayan saying that IUML had always stood with religious leaders and that persons at Cliff House need not harbour false hopes of creating a wedge between party and religious scholars. He was purportedly referring to the talks between the CM and leaders of Samastha Kerala Jem Iyyathul Ulema, the body of Sunni scholars who were traditionally aligned with IUML, over the Waqf board issue. Samastha had withdrawn from the decision taken at the meeting of Muslim Coordination Committee, convened by IUML, to conduct an awareness campaign in mosques after Friday prayers. This said campaign was mooted to protest against the government decision to entrust Waqf board appointments to PSC . “IUML always stood with religious scholars and they too sided with IUML leaders after realizing that the party will safeguard the unity of the community like the retina in one’s eye,” Thangal said, adding that IUML will continue the agitation on Waqf issue until the government took legislative steps to revoke the decision passed in the assembly. Thangal said that the government’s claim that it was entrusting Waqf board appointments, which had only 106 staff, to PSC to increase efficiency isn’t convincing as only two lakh of the five lakh employees under the government were appointed by PSC. In his keynote address, IUML national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty said CPM and LDF will burn their fingers if they touch minority rights. He said the unity and organized nature of Muslim community should be maintained and the League has always used the organized bargaining power of the community for good deeds. “We have used it to maintain peace in society after the demolition of Babri Masjid. People had rallied together in this agitation on realizing that there are some moves going on against the organized power of the community,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/waqf-protection-meet-draws-huge-crowd/articleshow/88194039.cms||---

Chauhan alleged that officials had filled forms, attached manipulated documents and sent them to block-level officers (BLOs) to get the names of the minority community voters removed from the poll list. The former minister submitted a memorandum to district magistrate Umesh Mishra, demanding strict action against erring officials who helped the ruling party. Chauhan told TOI, “The Election Commission had started a special summary revision of the electoral rolls in November that concluded on December 5. It came to my notice on December 6 that Dhampur tahsil officials had filled more than 15,000 forms known as format 7 under the Electoral Registration Rule, which is used for removing the names of voters who had died or changed their residences, to get the names of the minority community voters removed. We have thousands of filled farms to support our claim. I met the DM and demanded that the voters’ names should not be removed illegally, and strict action should be taken against erring officials.” The DM, however, rejected the charges, saying, “Chauhan’s allegations are not true because the entire process is online.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/attempts-being-made-to-remove-minority-community-voters-from-list-ex-minister/articleshow/88194068.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Madurai||Chaos outside new-look Periyar bus stand||Madurai: A day after the redesigned Periyar bus stand was thrown open to public, traffic snarls and chaos reigned supreme on routes leading to different places from the bus stand on Thursday. This has strengthened the widespread charges hurled against the previous regime that the redesign undertaken under the smart city programme was flawed. With traffic coming to a standstill, police had a tough time making managing vehicle movement. The junction where buses from Periyar bus stand and vehicles from Ellis Nagar, Arapalayam and Simmakkal meet, near the Kattabomman statue, was chaotic. “All this when the shopping complex and bus stand adjacent to it have not been opened. If the shopping complex is also completed, it is going to be extremely difficult to use this route,” said Joseph Raj, a teacher.  ``I decided to take it easy on Thursday thinking that traffic will be lesser from now, but I couldn’t believe what I saw. It was chaotic and I was late for work,’’ said K Sugumar who works in a private company in Palanganatham. While it was announced through the public address system that people should come into the bus stand and take their buses, many continued to stand by the roadside near the fire station. What is worse, buses also stopped there causing traffic to come to a standstill. There were traffic snarls in West Veli street and Ellis Nagar bridge in the morning.  Such a big complex should have more toilet facilities, said Josephine Raj, a resident of Palanganatham. “When more people start using it, more toilets are a must, but only one toilet complex is operating. Physically challenged and elderly people would have to cross the road to use the toilets,” she said.  Though there were traffic signals to guide vehicles coming on the Ellis Nagar bridge towards the city, there were none to control the buses coming out of the bus stand. “As this is a complex structure, there should be a separate traffic signal for the buses,’’ said S Damodaran. Though city buses have to be operated on 21 routes, at present they ply only to Melur, Thiruvathavur, Alagarkoil, Pudur, Thiruparankundram, Kariapatti, Thirupuvanam, Alanganallur, Chekkanoorani and Thirumangalam from the new bus stand while buses for other destinations continued to start from outside. TNSTC sources said they were organising schedules and routes and full operations would start in a week or so. With parking lots inside the bus stand complex going to handle nearly 1,000 vehicles, people say the vehicles going in and coming out of the parking lot would add to the traffic congestion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/chaos-outside-new-look-periyar-bus-stand/articleshow/88194797.cms||---

Thousands of vehicles ply daily on this road, which connects the city with Ahmednagar and Aurangabad. Commuters said though the road has been widened, measures need to be taken to make commute safe and accident-free. “Failure to implement the BRTS project effectively has been a major concern,” said Vaishali Harshe, a regular traveller on the road. Harshe said that BRTS lanes are used by buses and private vehicles. At the chowk, vehicles enter and exit the BRTS lanes, risking lives of travellers. There has been absence of traffic safety measures like crossings for walkers and speed breakers, among others. “An over bridge is long awaited on Nagar road. Same was highlighted by Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari. Long distance travellers can commute via the over bridge,” said Deepak Patil, chairman, Kharadi Housing Societies Welfare Association. He said, “A parallel road to Nagar road will avoid unnecessary blockage of the road. This needs to be considered on priority. A separate RTO office is required for Kharadi.” Habib Shaikh, an autorickshaw driver, said, “Commuting has become risky over the years. The road used to be quiet two decades back, but now it is among the busiest in the city. The Metro work has made commuting difficult on some stretches. Over speeding and lane cutting have become rampant despite marking of lanes.” Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch said that the administration and traffic police should work at chronic spots to prevent accidents and traffic jams. The safety aspect should not be ignored on BRTS lanes, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/commuters-rue-lack-of-safety-on-nagar-road/articleshow/88194816.cms||Sarang Dastane

In a statement, president of Agrofood Chamber of Commerce and Industry, S Rethinavelu said it will facilitate the trade and industry to recover from the paralysis caused by the corona pandemic and promote industrial development in Tamil Nadu. He said that the slashing the price of plots has been done for the first time in Sidco’s service history of more than 50 years. “Tamil Nadu stands third next to the states of Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal in the distribution of MSMEs and 8% of India’s MSMEs are located in Tamil Nadu,” he said. Those in the food industry are mostly from small and micro enterprises. This reduction in the prices of plots in industrial estates would enable those in the food industry to expand their business and motivate new entrepreneurs to invest, he said. Vice-president, Laghu Udyog Bharati, Tamil Nadu, K R Gnanasambadan thanked the chief minister for reducing in price. “It was a much-awaited announcement. It will promote entrepreneurial activities, but sadly there are no plots available in the Sidco industrial estates in Madurai,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/trade-bodies-thank-cm-for-reducing-price-of-sidco-plots/articleshow/88194806.cms||---

Senior inspector Bharat Jadhav of the Airport police told TOI on Thursday that the sports utility vehicle (SUV), driven by Chandannagar resident Sanket Ramchandra Bhujbal (22), had entered the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) track and proceeded in full speed towards Wagholi when its driver could not control the four-wheeler and crashed into the bus stop. Movement of private vehicles is banned on the BRTS corridors. “Bhujbal and Om Pawale (17) of Kasba Peth, seated next to him, died on the spot. Their friends, Gaurav Sanjay Sathe (22) of Wagholi and Prafulla Ankmanchi (21) of Chandannagar, seated in the rear, sustained critical injuries. They are undergoing treatment at a private hospital on the Ahmednagar road,” he said. When asked if it was a case of drink-and-drive accident, Jadhav said, “We are yet to receive the post-mortem and blood sample reports from the medical experts. As of now, there is no way we can confirm if the victims were in an inebriated condition.” Sathe’s father, a farmer, owned the SUV, the police said. A senior officer said the victims’ family members told them that they had no idea what the four youngsters were up to on Wednesday night. “In fact, none from Ankmanchi’s family has yet contacted the police. We are yet to record detailed statements of the parents and family members of the victims,” the officer said. Bhujbal’s father is a supervisor with a private firm at Lonikand, while Pawale’s father runs a business unit that supplies packaged drinking water to commercial establishments across the city, police said. A neighbour of the Bhujbals told TOI, “The (Bhujbal) family owns a hostel in the Talegaon Dhamdhere area. Bhujbal himself used to look after this hostel, occupied mostly by workers from the nearby industrial area.” Senior inspector Jadhav said, “The family members are yet to provide us the documents of the youngsters, including the driving licence of deceased Bhujbal. The four friends had gone for a dinner on Wednesday night and were later headed for Wagholi.” At the accident site, a local resident told TOI, “My friend and I had gone to meet another friend on Ahmednagar road around 12.15am. After a while, we saw the SUV moving at a high speed along the BRTS corridor and it just went ahead and hit the bus stop. We went to the spot and found all the youngsters in an unconscious state. Within a few minutes, the police came and took them to the hospital.” The TOI had on Thursday afternoon visited the private hospital located at Kharadi, where the two injured youngsters are admitted. But their family members were not available at the hospital for comment. Instances of private vehicles entering the BRTS lanes are too frequent across the city and accidents on the corridors meant only for buses are not uncommon. On February 21, a 25-year-old biker had sustained injuries and subsequently died in hospital after ramming a PMPML bus headed for Wagholi on the BRTS lane near Kharadi Bypass Chowk, on Monday. The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) bus had caught fire in the accident. But all passengers and staffers on board the bus managed to exit on time before the vehicle was engulfed in flames, along with the two-wheeler. The PMPML had issued a statement saying the two-wheeler rider illegally entered the BRTS lane and was approaching bus from the opposite direction. The vehicle skidded and went under the bus. The biker was thrown away from the spot. The two-wheeler’s petrol tank exploded and caught fire. The rider later died in hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/suv-rams-brts-ramp-in-kharadi-teen-passenger-driver-killed/articleshow/88194795.cms||Gitesh Shelke

Justice Devan Ramachandran raised the query after considering the report of Kochi city police commissioner that assistant sub inspector Vinod Krishna collected Rs 25,000 as bribe from the missing girl belonging to a migrant family based in Kochi after locating her at Delhi. A counsel representing the state government has submitted to the court that a case cannot be registered on the basis of the report alone and without a separate complaint. Following the submission, the court appointed to two high court advocates as amici curiae in the case to ascertain whether the police officers facing the allegations can be booked for criminal offences. The court is considering a case registered suo motu on the basis of a news report that police demanded bribe of Rs 5 lakh for locating the missing girl who belonged to a family selling footwear. The family had also alleged that they were forced to buy flight tickets for a five-member police team to got to Delhi and bring back their missing girl. The court asked whether the police officers can be booked for extortion. The court will consider the case again in the first week of January. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/can-cops-be-booked-for-extortion-asks-hc/articleshow/88194072.cms||---

---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: 750kg sea cucumber worth Rs 50 lakh seized||TUTICORIN: Forest department personnel attached to the Gulf of Mannar marine national park arrested three people and recovered 750kg of processed and semi-processed sea cucumber from them in the wee hours of Thursday. The three were caught when they were boiling the sea cucumbers in a shed belonging to a sea food making company close to a crematorium near the East Coast Road at Gomaspuram in the outskirts of the city. Forest department personnel valued the sea cucumber at Rs 50 lakh in the international market. Forest range officer for the marine national park R Raghuvaran said that after completing their routine night rounds they were on their way to the range office when a distinct pungent foul smell that emanates while boiling sea cucumber drew their attention around 1.30am. The team reached VSF enterprises, a sea food company that is located about 50ft from the East Coast Road.  They surrounded the tin sheet shed in which the sea cucumber was being boiled in big vessels and detained K Senthil Kumar,48, of Thiruvadanai in Ramanathapuram district, A Sathikbatcha, 37, of Thondi in Ramanathapuram district, and Nanthakumar, 21, of Thainagar in Tuticorin district, who were inside. Senthil Kumar is a second time offender who was last detained by the Sivagangai district police last year for smuggling sea cucumber last year, while the two others are first time offenders. Inquiry revealed that they were engaged by habitual offenders Mansoor Ali and Meera Shah who have five and six such cases against them, respectively, and the owner of the sea food company Vijayakumar. Raghuvaran said that the six have been booked under 14 sections of The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and search was on for the three others who were at large.  They were to take the sea cucumber to Vedalai in Ramanathapuram district and smuggle it to Sri Lanka by boat. Process is underway to seal the sea food company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/750kg-sea-cucumber-worth-rs-50l-seized/articleshow/88194817.cms||---

Her father, Harishankar Sharma, filed a missing complaint. On the basis of her call records, police on Wednesday arrested one Rohit Kumar (age yet to be determined), who turned out to be Kanchan’s boyfriend. Two of his friends -- Saurabh Singh and Rahul (full name not known) -- were also arrested. During interrogation, police said Rohit confessed to kidnapping the woman from outside her coaching institute on the evening of December 6 and later killed her with the help of two of his friends. The trio told cops that they had burnt the body before throwing it into a river near the town. Hastinapur police station SHO Dinesh Yadav told TOI the were arrested and booked under IPC section 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder). “We will add the section of murder to the FIR, once the woman’s body is recovered,” said the SHO, adding that “several police teams and divers have conducted search operations in and around the river, but to no avail.” Rohit had been in a relationship with Kanchan for some months. He told police that he owns a grocery shop near Kanchan’s college and that they had met just four months ago. SHO Dinesh Yadav said, “The two were in a relationship and the woman had been putting pressure on Rohit to marry her. To get rid of her, he planned to kill her.” “Rohit took her for a drive after her coaching classes. He parked the car on the outskirts of the town, where his two friends were also present. The three then strangulated her to death and dumped the body into the river,” the SHO said. Police told TOI that the three accused gave different statements. One of them said they strangulated her to death and dumped her body, while another said that they had first burnt her and then threw the remains into the river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/3-held-for-killing-bba-student-in-hastinapur/articleshow/88194077.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Agra||Bipin Rawat chopper crash: Hours before crash, Wing Commander called mom, planned dad's birthday party on December 31||AGRA: Susheela Chauhan will remember for the rest of her life every word, letter and pause of her son's last conversation with her. Hours before Wing Commander Prithvi Singh Chauhan took off on the fateful chopper flight that would crash over the hills of the Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu, killing him, CDS Gen Bipin Rawat and 11 others, he had called up his mother in Agra. After the initial exchange of pleasantries, he quickly came to the subject that had him all excited. His father Surendra Singh Chauhan's birthday was coming up on December 31 and there was planning for the party to be done. For as long as anyone in the family could remember, Prithvi had never missed the senior Chauhan's New Year eve celebrations. “It's been two days that my son hasn't called me now. He would call me everyday," Susheela, 70, told TOI on Thursday. "That day, too, he ended the call by saying he will talk tomorrow. But he never did. What he said that day has been playing in my head ever since. I can't think of anything else." She added, “Prithvi always wanted to achieve something big in life and that’s why I allowed him to stay away from me for 31 years, so that he could fulfill his dreams. “Maine dil par patthar rakh kar use jane diya… yeh soch kar khush thi ki woh apna dream pura kare.. khush rahe... (With a heavy heart I let him stay away from me all these years so he could do what he wanted, be happy). Now he has gone forever.” Prithvi's sister Neeta Rana, who came to Agra from Badaun in UP after being informed about her brother’s death, said, “He never missed visiting his family in Agra for papa’s birthday. This time, too, we were waiting.” Neeta said this year had been special for the family as Prithvi had managed to be home for Raksha Bandhan after almost 30 years. "How were we to know this would be the last time that I'd be tying rakhi on his wrist." Prithvi was the youngest among five siblings and the beloved brother of four sisters. The officer had studied at Sainik School in Madhya Pradesh's Rewa and got selected for the National Defence Academy thereafter. He joined the Indian Air Force in Hyderabad in 2000 and was currently posted at the Coimbatore station in Tamil Nadu. He was married to Kamini, a resident of Vrindavan, in 2007 and the couple have a daughter Aaradhya, 12, a student of class VII, and son Aviraj, 7, who is in class II. “How do I express my grief,” asked Surendra Singh, who received information about his son’s death through news channels. “He was such an affectionate boy, with everyone. His mother has some eye problem and Prithivi had fixed an appointment for her at the military hospital on Saturday. He was like that, caring and thoughtful."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/hrs-before-crash-wg-cdr-called-mom-planned-dads-bday-party-on-dec-31/articleshow/88194092.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Soon after the deaths of the CDS and other officials were confirmed, the academy had cancelled its Commandant’s Parade, regarded as a precursor to the POP. The parade was scheduled to be held on Thursday. A total of 319 Indian and 68 foreign gentlemen cadets (GCs) will graduate from the academy after the POP in which President Ram Nath Kovind is the chief guest. There were speculations that the President’s visit may be cancelled in the aftermath of the air crash tragedy. However, a communique from the IMA on Thursday evening confirmed that the President will be reviewing the parade. Incidentally, General Rawat was also scheduled to attend the event, a source from the academy confirmed, adding that the IMA lost three officers associated with it, in the crash. “Besides General Rawat, who graduated in 1978 and received the Sword of Honour for the best cadet, the two officers on his staff who died in the tragic accident, Brig LS Lidder and Lt Col Harjinder Singh, were also associated with the academy. Brig Lidder had served as Adjutant while Lt Col Harjinder had served as an instructor here,” said the source. Meanwhile, academy authorities said that they have reformatted the schedule of events that would have led to the POP. “There would be no celebrations. The entire affair will be simple and sombre in keeping with the scale of the tragedy and as a mark of respect to the departed souls,” said an official. As part of the re-formatted line-up, the multi-activity display that was to be held on Friday evening, featuring performances by GCs, has been cancelled. Also, uncertainty looms over the state-of-the-art sound and light show to be held on the POP eve on Friday, sources privy to the developments told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/as-mark-of-respect-to-bipin-rawat-others-killed-in-crash-ima-passing-out-parade-to-be-curtailed-affair-sans-celebrations/articleshow/88194083.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Kolkata||S’pore off red list, RT-PCR no longer a must||Kolkata: Flyers arriving by Singapore Airlines flights will no longer be required to mandatorily undergo RT-PCR tests after Singapore was removed from the list of countries categorised as ‘at risk’ from Omicron. With this, only flyers arriving from the UK in the direct flight operated by Air India on Sundays must undergo the tests. In addition, 2% flyers among other international flight passengers, including those from Singapore, Thailand, Bangladesh, Dubai and Doha, will be randomly selected at the airport for Covid test. “Passengers from Singapore no longer need to mandatorily get themselves tested at the airport and follow the seven-day quarantine protocols. However, a large number of passengers from Dubai, which is a hub airport, may still be tested daily based on their travel history if they have visited the ‘at risk’ countries in the last 14 days,” said airport director C Pattabhi. The nations that are currently on the ‘at risk’ list of India are European countries, including the UK, South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Ghana, Mauritius, New Zealand, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Hong Kong and Israel. While Singapore’s exit from the red list is expected to lead to more travellers flying into India, the travel trade industry in Kolkata are trying to get the Kolkata-Singapore route recognised as a vaccinated travel lane (VTL) so that the flyers do not have to quarantine for seven days on reaching there. “At present, the load on incoming Singapore Airlines flights is around 80% but the return flight has very poor load of 15%-20% because it is a non-VTL flight. We hope that after December 15, Kolkata-Singapore is also recognised as a VTL sector so that the passenger load can increase and the flight is viable,” said a travel agent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/spore-off-red-list-rt-pcr-no-longer-a-must/articleshow/88194106.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Dehradun||Send your kids to jail to see how bad it is: HC to Uttarakhand bureaucrats||NAINITAL: Hearing a bunch of PILs regarding installation of CCTV cameras and other facilities in jails across the state, the Uttarakhand high court pulled up state home secretary Ranjit Sinha and director-general (prison) Pushkar Jyoti over the condition of prisons and said that senior officials will realise how bad it is in jails "if their kids are made to stay there just for a day". The HC had earlier directed the two officials to take stock of facilities in jails and present a report with photographs. An affidavit presented by them on Thursday fell "far short" of the court's expectations. The affidavit, in fact, made some shocking revelations about overcrowded jails with lack of proper facilities. Haridwar jail, for instance, with a capacity for 870 prisoners had 1,400 lodged there. For 65 women prisoners there was just one barrack. And there was no doctor on duty. It was worse in Roorkee, where 625 inmates were crammed in a space meant for 200. At Haldwani, there were 1,736 prisoners instead of 535. With no proper utensils available, rotis here were prepared on the floor. In Nainital jail, inmates were forced to sleep on the ground while in Chamoli 114 inmates slept under tin sheds. The condition of Dehradun jail was no different. The court came down heavily, particularly on the situation in Lohaghat jail. The prisoners here were stuffed like animals in the barracks with their food prepared in the bathroom. "We are in the 21st century," the court remarked. The division bench headed by chief justice RS Chauhan and Justice NS Dhanik then ordered the two officers to constitute a committee to oversee facilities in the jails. The court said the committee will need to submit a report every month. The HC also laid down some key guidelines for the state. It said there must be construction of new jails and open jails, a budget for repair, factories for employment of prisoners, schooling for juveniles, adequate staff, recruitment of permanent medical staff, hygienic kitchens and proper bathrooms. In its order, the court said those involved in petty crimes may be released on parole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rotis-in-loos-bed-on-floor-shocked-hc-tells-babus-send-your-kids-to-jail-to-see-how-bad-it-is/articleshow/88192563.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||HC orders Haryana to maintain status quo on HCS 2004 matter||Chandigarh: In what can be seen as a huge relief to the Haryana Civil Service (HCS) officers selected in 2004, the Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday ordered the state government to maintain status quo on the show-cause notices it had issued on their dismissal from service. With this, these HCS officers would continue to work till the matter is decided by the high court. The HC has also asked the Haryana government to file its reply on the issue by January 27. Justice Arun Monga passed the order while hearing a petition filed by Inder Jeet and some other HCS (executive branch) officers selected in 2004. The petitioners sought directions to quash the Haryana notices dated November 27, 2021 asking them as to why their services may not be dispensed. They argued that the government’s show-cause notices were totally against the earlier vigilance report and the stand taken by the state in a letter dated February 26, 2016. They claimed these notices were based on a report that has been obtained without their knowledge and without even associating them. They also argued that the notices were merely a formality as a perusal of the notices would reveal that the decision to dispense with their services has already been taken and thus the issuance of the show-cause notices and further proceedings are in complete violation of the settled principles of law. The petitioners also urged the high court to direct the Haryana government to place on record the inquiry report on the basis of which the show-cause notices were issued to them. They urged the HC to quash the said report being obtained behind the back of the petitioners without ever associating them to the said inquiry or making them privy to the same or taking into consideration the earlier vigilance reports and orders that had declared the petitioners as untainted candidates after which they had been offered appointment. Recently, the Haryana chief secretary had informed the HC that the entire process that selected HCS (executive branch) and allied services in 2004 was vitiated and suffers irregularities. The selection of these Haryana Civil Services (executive branch) and allied services was held in 2004 during the Om Prakash Chautala-led INLD regime. Haryana had issued the show-cause notices on dispensing with the services of 19 HCS (executive branch) officers and two Haryana Police Services (HPSC) officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-orders-haryana-to-maintain-status-quo-on-hcs-2004-matter/articleshow/88194892.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Festive rush back at Kolkata airport despite new Covid strain jitters||KOLKATA: After the initial knee-jerk reaction to the variant-of-concern Omicron that witnessed large-scale cancellation of international flight tickets, the dust has settled and various flights are operating at near capacity levels with nearly all sectors other than Singapore recording high bookings through the Christmas-New Year period. According to airlines, flights to and from Dubai are operating at nearly full capacity. Emirates, Fly Dubai and IndiGo officials said bookings were at a high 80%-90% through December till mid-January. So is the lone weekly flight between Kolkata and London and the twice-a-week flight to Bangkok and back. “The initial jitters over Omicron have subsided and seats that had fallen vacant have all been filled up. Health articles on the mildness of Omicron despite its high transmissibility appear to have soothed frayed nerves,” said an Air India official who saw 10%-12% cancellation in the weekly flight between London and Kolkata in the last week of November before demand soared again. The remaining three flights in December have 90% load. The airline’s Bangkok flight too has near-capacity bookings. The inaugural flight on Wednesday has just a few business class seats left. The second flight on Sunday also has 90%-plus booking. Singapore Airlines, which has a daily service, appears to be on a sticky wicket with poor loads in both outbound and inbound flights as tourists are wary of travelling to the country that had shut early and opened very late fearing that they can get stuck in case the government there re-introduces tighter controls. Travel agents said Singapore was an exception but people had otherwise reconciled to the fact that Covid was here to stay and planned to travel between the waves. “There are some reports that the third wave could come in February-March. So people want to make full use of this window and do a holiday before they hunker down,” said Travel Agents Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni. Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi felt a section of travelers was still on a wait-and-watch mode as countries were introducing new Covid test norms by the day. “Had there been a uniform norm, travel would have been easier and a lot more people would have travelled,” he said. Kolkata airport continued to witness traffic growth with 13.6 lakh who travelled in 9,942 flights, up from 12.5 lakh passengers in 9,404 flights. December will be busier still with carriers deploying more flights. In fact, the traffic growth has led to concerns over lengthy queues. “Between 6 and 11 in the morning, the wait time at the entrance is now 7-10 minutes while that at the security check is 20-25 minutes. The more the wait time, the more difficult it is to maintain distancing norms,” said an airline official. A representative of the Airlines Operators’ Committee said reduction of wait time can happen only when security checks are speeded up through deployment of more manpower and machinery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/festive-rush-back-at-airport-despite-new-cov-strain-jitters/articleshow/88194109.cms||Subhro Niyogi

It has asked the state to respond to the issue by January 12. The new law would come into force from January 15. Haryana advocate general (AG) Baldev Raj Mahajan, who was present in the court during the hearing of the case, accepted the notice on behalf of the state. Division bench comprising Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli passed these orders while hearing a petition filed by Faridabad Industries Association. This is the third petition filed by an industrial body in the state, challenging the Haryana government’s new statute. The earlier two petitions are yet to come up for hearing. The main grievance of the industrial bodies is that by introducing ‘sons of the soil’ policy, the Haryana government wants to create reservation in private sector which is infringement of the constitutional rights of the employers because private sector jobs are purely based on skills and analytical blend of mind. It has also been alleged that the act is an attempt to introduce a domicile methodology to get a job in private sector rather than on the basis of education skills and mental IQ, which will create a chaos in the current industrial employment structure for industries in Haryana. As per the law, 75% jobs in new factories/industries or already established industries/institutions would be given to the domiciles of Haryana. The new law provides for 75% employment to local candidates at salary of less than Rs 30,000 per month in various privately managed companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms and partnership firms among others situated in Haryana employing 10 or more persons. The Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, was passed by the Haryana legislative assembly on March 2, 2021, and approved by the governor on November 6. A notification was also issued by the state’s labour department regarding its applicability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/after-ggn-rewari-faridabad-indl-body-moves-hc-against-75-job-quota-for-locals-in-private-industries/articleshow/88194905.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Chandigarh||Hooda sold farmers land in Cong rule: Ajay||Rohtak: Targeting former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda during a rally held in Jhajjar to mark the third anniversary of JJP, Ajay Chautala on Thursday accused him of forcing farmers to sell their agriculture land at dirt cheap prices during the Congress rule in the state. Those who looted the farmers during their rule are today claiming to be their well-wishers, he said. Reacting to Rajya Sabha member Deepender Hooda’s claim that the airport in Jewar was to be made in Haryana, the JJP leader said he (Deepender) should answer why it did not happen when his father was in power. He accused former CM Hooda of running a family-centric agenda in politics instead of working for public welfare. Speaking on the occasion, deputy CM Dushyant Chautala lauded the people for showing patience during the farmers protest, saying the opposition had tried at every level to disrupt the law and order situation in the state. He claimed during the pandemic, the government made additional 200 mandis and bought every single grain of wheat from the farmers. He said that even for paddy the number of mandis was doubled so that the farmers do not face any problems. The deputy CM claimed that during the Congress rule, farmers would have to wait for months for the payment of crop sold, but the incumbent BJP-JJP had ensured that it was paid directly into the farmer's account within 72 hours of procurement. In case the payment took more time, interest at the rate of 9% was paid to the farmers, he said. Dushyant claimed that nearly 40% of the promises made in the party manifesto have been fulfilled and the remaining would be fulfilled in the remaining three years time. He said the old age pension was increased by Rs 500 in 500 days and 50% reservation made for women in panchayat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hooda-sold-farmers-land-in-cong-rule-ajay/articleshow/88194916.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Gajendra Chauhan’s appointment as SUPVA V-C raises eyebrows||Rohtak: The appointment of former television actor Gajendra Chauhan as the vice-chancellor of Pandit Lakhmi Chand State University of Performing and Visual Arts (SUPVA) in Rohtak has disappointed many a varsity students and ex-students who were waiting for a notable film personality to head their institution. The students said that when the search was underway for the full time V-C of SUPVA, they were expecting the names of iconic personalities like Anupam Kher, Satish Kaushik or even Randeep Hooda but to their disappointment, Gajendra Chauhan got the appointment at the coveted post. Raising concern on the issue, Yogesh Vats, former students of SUPVA and Bollywood director said that varsity has been turned into a place of “adjusting political personalities.” “The institute of film and television was established as an autonomous body, but now appointments are done on political recommendations, sometimes on caste consideration and sometimes for ideological reasons,” he alleged. On the appointment of Mahabharat fame Gajendra Chauhan as VC, he said that notwithstanding the party affiliations, Chauhan is at least from a film background.  “I sincerely hope that he would not let his political leanings get in the way of fixing long-pending varsity issues in the larger interest of the students,” he added. Ranjeet Chauhan, another former 2012-13 batch student from SUPVA, said that the varsity needed a full-time vice-chancellor as presently Prof Rajbir Singh was holding additional charge along with Rohtak’s MDU. He said that there are apprehensions in mind about Gajender Chauhan due to his controversial period at FTII, Pune, but still students feel that he should be given a chance to run the varsity for sometime before arriving at any conclusion.  Another student, who is in his final year, told TOI on anonymity that the students are concerned about their creative freedom in film making.  “We have heard his views and seen his tweets about his right wing ideology, which shows that there is narrow space for creative freedom in films,” he said.  He said that the students create films as their project which sometimes are on controversial topics of LGBT community or have issues which are suppressed or silenced by right wingers.  “With Gajendra Chauhan as the head of the institute, the students are worried if their film projects need funding and space would get approvals or not and whether a film promoting government’s interest would only be considered on the VC table,” he questioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/gajendra-chauhans-appointment-as-supva-v-c-raises-eyebrows/articleshow/88194914.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Coldest night yet, dense fog delayed||NEW DELHI: The city recorded the coldest night of the season as the minimum temperature at Safdarjung, its base station, dropped to 8.4 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal, on Thursday. The minimum temperature dropped further to 8.3 degrees Celsius at Lodhi Road. Officials at India Meteorological Department (IMD) said dense fog formation had been delayed this year. Both maximum and minimum temperatures are predicted to dip in the next few days. The minimum temperature may touch seven degrees Celsius by December 12, while the maximum temperature is likely to hover around 22 degrees from December 13-15. On Thursday, the maximum temperature at Safdarjung settled at 23.5 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal. A Met official said the city had been witnessing a gradual fall in temperatures. There have been clear skies and the absence of cloud cover makes the day warm while the heat quickly dissipates at night, which causes a fall in the minimum temperature, the official said. IMD data shows that the night temperature touched 8 degrees Celsius in the first week of December last year. The lowest minimum temperature recorded in December 2020 was 3.3 degrees Celsius in the last week of the month. This season, the lowest temperature before this was 9.2 degrees Celsius on November 24. According to the IMD forecast bulletin for the next two weeks, December 9-22, a gradual fall of 2-4 degrees Celsius is expected from the second half of the week. “We usually record one or two mornings with dense fog by this time of the year, which has not happened this time. For instance, dense fog was recorded on December 7 last year. Unlike November, December and January are dominated by low temperature and fog formation. High moisture content in the atmosphere causes dense fog formation,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. He added that no significant western disturbance was predicted to impact the region for the next seven days. The IMD forecast says mist or shallow fog is likely to be formed during morning hours over the next seven days. A dense fog is considered when the visibility remains between 50 and 200 metres, while the criteria for “very dense fog” is when the visibility dips below 50 metres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/coldest-night-yet-dense-fog-delayed/articleshow/88194951.cms||---

Living in a remote corner of the mango belt in Bada Kasmandi, Malihabad, the entire family had symptoms of the infection. With no oxygen-supported bed in the nearby community health centre, the family took Lal to a ‘clinic’ run by a quack, where he took his last breath. The quack neither gave them any medical summary nor a Covid death certificate for Lal. Similarly, Ajay Kumar (34), a sales executive in an IT firm, succumbed on April 17 due to suspected Covid-19. His widow Ankita Maurya said, “Our entire family was affected. On April 15, Ajay’s condition deteriorated and we ran from pillar to post for an oxygen-supported bed, but didn’t find one. Two days later, he succumbed at a private hospital. I don’t have a Covid certificate to prove his cause of death. I have a seven-year-old daughter and need every possible help. The authorities say they can’t help us without a Covid certificate.” In another example, Sunit Singh (43) died in the third week of April after symptoms of coronavirus. His wife Sunita and three children have been trying in vain to get government aid. With no report confirming a Covid death, they are losing hope. His two minor daughters have become bread earners for the family. “Like Sanjeevan, Ajay and Sunit, there are scores of victims who lost their lives during the peak of the second wave of Covid-19 that hit the country. Many died at centres run by quacks or in their homes following the government advisory of home treatment. Such families have no proof to ascertain the cause of death. This means they may not get government aid,” said Sangeeta Sharma, coordinator of ChildLine Lucknow unit. According to government officials, one must provide proof of Covid death to apply for Rs 50,000 compensation. Additional district magistrate, finance, Bipin Mishra, the nodal officer for disbursal of the compensation, said, “We are aware of the issue. There may be genuine cases in which victims died of suspected corona infection. But the challenge is how to prove it. We will try to raise the matter with state authorities to help such families.” “In Lucknow, we are allowing families without Covid death certificate to submit other medical documents for the compensation. However, a decision on granting financial aid would be taken after consulting state government and medical experts,” he added. According to a recent government order, medical summary or symptomatic treatment record is acceptable for the compensation plea. In Lucknow, officially 2,651 Covid deaths were reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tough-to-prove-covid-deaths-without-docus/articleshow/88195483.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The agitators alleged that the state government’s hurry to implement NEP 2020 from this academic year at the degree level caused a lot of problems for students and teaching staff. They alleged the state government implemented NEP 2020 amid opposition from the stakeholders including students, experts, and educators. As the preparation for the implementation of four-year degree course is not completed, students are now facing problems, they said. AIDSO leaders including district president Subhash, secretary Chandrakala and others alleged that in many subjects, the syllabus is not ready till now. Even though classes started two months ago, students and teachers are not able to hold full-fledged classes due to confusion related to syllabus, non-availability of learning materials in many subjects, confusion over elective subjects, etc. The agitators alleged that through NEP, the state government is trying to impose new subjects instead of making the learning selective for students. The students also raised the issue of a huge number of vacancies in colleges. “There is an urgent need off appointing over 14,000 teaching staff in government-run first-grade colleges,” they said. Later students submitted a memorandum to UoM authorities demanding postponement of the implementation of NEP this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/implementation-of-nep-2020-dogged-by-issues-says-aidso/articleshow/88194129.cms||---
---||Delhi||How Delhi can reduce PM2.5 by 35% in 8 years||NEW DELHI: A new study released by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) says that in the ‘business as usual’ scenario, PM2.5 concentrations in winter may fall by 9%, 21%, and 28%, respectively, in 2022, 2025 and 2030 against the level in 2019, the base year considered by the study. If more stringent steps were taken to curb emissions in the airshed, the winter PM2.5 concentrations could reduce by 35% by 2030. In both cases, however, the pollutant concentration will still remain significantly higher than the safety norm of 60 micrograms per cubic metre. In TERI’s study, supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies and titled ‘Cost effectiveness of interventions for control of air pollution in Delhi’, the ‘business as usual’ scenario considers the growth trajectories in various sectors and the already notified air pollution policies and interventions. But controls across the airshed — the geographical area in which the air is confined —can reduce winter PM2.5 by 35% by 2030, said the study. Vibha Dhawan, TERI director-general, said, “Focus on air pollution as a problem should be year-round, not only in the winter.” Anju Goel, co-project investigator and fellow at TERI, added, “Local city sources of pollution in Delhi are worsened by regional sources. That is why airshed-based air quality controls are necessary.” The study said it was necessary to curb ammonia release in farms, enforce full ban on refuse burning, convert coal-based power plants to clean energy, have stringent dust suppression control, shift to cleaner technology for brick kilns and shift to induction cookstoves. It estimated that an airshed programme could prevent over 14,000 mortalities in 2022 and 12,000 in 2030 in Delhi-NCR, resulting in economic benefits of around Rs 48,000-43,000 crore in 2022-2030. Dialogue and Development Commission vice-chairperson Jasmine Shah, while addressing a webinar on the release of report, confirmed, “Air pollution in Delhi is a regional airshed problem, not a Delhi problem. Delhi has shown maximum political will to act on sources of pollution, but the same is not true of other states in north India.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-city-can-reduce-pm2-5-by-35-in-8-yrs/articleshow/88194965.cms||---

---||Nagpur||NMC violates norms, suffers Rs23cr loss in garbage biomining project-I||Nagpur: Apart from causing financial loss of Rs23 crore, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has violated its own and state government norms in the Rs101.5 crore garbage biomining project. The administration allegedly floated expression of interest (EoI) for engaging a contractor without approval from the standing committee and without provision of funds in the annual budget. The violation came to fore during scrutiny of files by some BJP corporators. Former mayor and BJP city president Pravin Datke had alleged financial loss in two contracts related to biomining of garbage in NMC’s general body meeting in September. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari had directed the administration to submit a report on the Datke’s allegations in the next meeting. NMC’s pench project cell has submitted a report to the mayor’s office. A corporator said on condition of anonymity, “Any new project is launched if there is provisions of funds in the budget. In the budget for 2017-18, the then chairman Sandip Jadhav had mentioned his plan for biomining of garbage. But he made no provision of funds for the work in the budget. Still, administration floated EoI for the work costing over Rs100 crore. It is a brazen violation and done to benefit some people.” Congress corporator Sanjay Mahakalkar said, “Action should be taken against the concerned officials and standing committee chairman who approved work order. It is mandatory to get approval of standing committee for floating EoI or tender. Chairman of standing committee of 2018-19 gave approval for allotting the work to Zigma Global Environ Solutions Pvt Ltd. The chairman should not have approved work order as EoI was floated without approval. Chairman should have cancelled the EoI.” NMC officials said there were no violations in the project. “It is the practice at NMC to take approval from standing committee only for floating tender and not for EoI,” they said. Apart from this, the cash-strapped civic body has incurred loss of Rs23 crore. As per NMC, work for biomining of 10 lakh metric tonne (MT) garbage was issued to Zigma at the rate of Rs1,015 per MT in 2018-19. Total cost of the work comes to Rs101.5 crore. NMC’s special purpose vehicle for developing Smart City Project — Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) floated a tender for biomining of 6 lakh MT garbage at the same Bhandewadi dumping yard. The same company went on to get the work at the cost of Rs788 per MT a couple of months ago. Mahakalkar said, “Cost of all components have increased in last two years. Still, the company took phase-II work at lower cost compared to phase-I. It means cost of phase-I should have been even lower than phase-II,” he said. Cost of phase-I would have been Rs78.8 crore had NMC given contract of 10 lakh MT at the rate of Rs788 per MT. Thus, NMC incurred loss of Rs22.7 crore. Zigma director Nagesh Prabhu said, “We got phase-I two years ago, which required investment in terms of machineries, management etc. We completed 6 of 10 lakh MT and remaining will be done within a year. We will shift machinery to phase-II. Also, management and IT infrastructure would be same for phase-II, which is hardly 200 meter away from phase-I. Also, we have identified market to sell our product, which will be the same for phase-II. Also, we are likely to get big companies under extended produce responsibility (EPR). Therefore, we have quoted less for phase-II.” BOX IN A NUTSHELL * NMC allotted work of biomining of 10 lakh MT to Zigma at cost of Rs1,015 per MT in 2018-19 * Smart City SPV issued tender for biomining 6 lakh MT at same Bhandewadi dumping yard * Same company took work at cost of Rs788 per MT couple of months ago * Rates of almost all components have increased in last two years * Instead of rise in cost, it reduced by Rs23 crore * Former mayor Pravin Datke demanded inquiry * Some BJP corporators checked the files * They learnt administration did not take approval from standing committee for EoI of phase-I * Also no provisions of funds were in budget for phase-I * This is violation of norms||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-violates-norms-suffers-rs23cr-loss-in-garbage-biomining-project-i/articleshow/88194969.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Besides, the latest week ending December 7 registered only 33 deaths due to the contagion, A senior official of the state health department told TOI, “This is the first time in at least the past 13 months that Maharashtra, which was registering thousand-plus deaths due to Covid each month since November last year and during the second wave of the pandemic, that the number of deaths has dropped below 500 this November.” He said, “The total disease burden and Covid cases in Maharashtra continue to reduce, with the number of serious Covid patients drastically decreasing. The severity of Covid has also lessened due to high vaccination rates.” At present, the state has 1,409 patients with severe Covid infection. In October, the number was 3,845. Dr Sanjay Pujari from the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) National Task Force on Clinical Research for Covid, told TOI, “When a new variant comes in, in this case Delta (since it mainly drove the second wave), there would be a spike in cases. There is a lag of two-three weeks before the rise in cases starts showing an impact on mortality. This is because it takes this much time for patients to develop severe disease. In contrast, when Covid cases start declining, there is a lag of two-three weeks before the death rate also starts declining.” Dr Pujari, who is also director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases, Pune, said the level of infection in the community was currently low, and thus, fewer people were falling sick from Covid. “Most Covid deaths now are being reported from severe unvaccinated cases or elderly patients with higher numbers of comorbidities, who took their vaccine shots many months ago. Also, we now have a variety of therapeutics to treat Covid, which is helping in reducing deaths. Even in mild illness, we have started giving monoclonal antibodies. This can prevent severe disease.” Dr Sanjay Oak, the chairman of the Maharashtra State Covid-19 Task Force, said, “Mortalities continue to drop in Maharashtra, more so since the vaccination coverage increased in the state. This has provided the population with some level of immunity against Covid and protection from severe disease.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-casualties-in-mahadown-61-in-nov-from-oct/articleshow/88194967.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court relief for hotelier’s son in mishap that claimed cop’s sons||MUMBAI: In a relief to Rohan Abbot, an accused in a Vashi vehicle crash in which two sons of a police officer died, Bombay high court (HC) held that its earlier direction for him to surrender after an additional and graver offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder was added, did not preclude his right to seek anticipatory bail. The HC also directed the sessions court to hear his plea for such pre-arrest bail on merits and till then police said they would not take him in custody. The high court last month upheld a magistrate order, directing Abbot (32), a hotel owner’s son, to surrender within 10 days before it, as the police invoked the more serious and non-bailable offence under section 304 II of the Indian Penal Code, after his release on bail in the February 7, 2021 case. The accused, allegedly driving at high speed, crashed into a bike on Palm Beach road, dragging the rider and flinging the pillion rider, before stopping 400ft away and fleeing, surrendering himself the next day when he was granted bail. Justice Sandeep Shinde, in his mid-November order, said that the magistrate’s order of March 26 required no interference but continued a stay on it since April 5, for three more weeks to enable Abbot to go in appeal. Abbot applied for pre-arrest bail instead in sessions court which was declined. The accused then approached HC and a single judge bench of justice Nitin Sambre on December 8 heard the matter. The HC said Abbot is at liberty to approach sessions court which it directed would decide pre-arrest bail plea uninfluenced by the earlier findings. Abbot’s counsel Aabad Ponda and Omprakash Parihar counsel for the original complainant by consent said the hearing in sessions court would be on December 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-relief-for-hoteliers-son-in-mishap-that-claimed-cops-sons/articleshow/88195490.cms||Swati Deshpande

Though the boat was completely gutted in fire, the fishermen were saved by those in other fishing boats in the vicinity. Neendakara coastal police have registered a case in this regard. The police said that the mishap occurred during the early hours of Wednesday. The boat involved in the mishap is named Velankanni Amma owned by Augustin of Anu Bhavan of Dhalavapuram. There were nine fishermen on board. They set off into the sea around 12.30 am. The boat caught fire around an hour later when it was around three nautical miles from the coast. The escaped fishermen told the police that fire is suspected to have broken out from a leak in the LP gas stove on the boat as the fire broke out when they turned on the stove to make tea. As soon as the fire spread, all the fishermen on board dived into the sea. Fishermen on other boats nearby rushed to their aid and pulled them out of water.

The second patient infected by the new variant is also on the way to recovery and will go home in a few days, doctors said. With no new detections, the state’s Omicron tally has remained at 10. Mumbai’s two recorded cases of the variant were a 39-year-old man, who arrived from South Africa on November 25, and his 36-year-old fiancée, who returned from the US on the same day. On developing symptoms, he was hospitalised on December 1 and found positive for Omicron on Monday. The fiancée tested positive during contact tracing. Civic officials confirmed that the man was discharged on Wednesday, after he tested negative. The fiancé too has tested negative, but she continues to have some mild symptoms and will be sent home after another round of RT-PCR test. On Thursday, three international travellers, who were hospitalised at SevenHills on suspicion of Omicron, were discharged. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said that the patients were found to be infected with Delta, and not Omicron. They were symptom-free, RT-PCR negative and hence could go home, he added. The Andheri hospital has 36 overseas returnees admitted under suspicion of Omicron.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mumbais-first-omicron-patient-discharged/articleshow/88194971.cms||Pradeep Gupta

---||Pune||Amid Omicron concern, Maharashtra government extends free Covid-19 treatment scheme||PUNE: The state government has extended the period to avail free treatment for a host of ailments, including Covid-19, under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana amid Omicron concern. Every resident of Maharashtra, irrespective of financial status, are eligible for the benefit. A government resolution would be released soon defining the exact period of extension of the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY). The government had earlier extended this scheme until October 31 this year. “We have intimated the empanelled private hospitals to continue extending the free treatment benefit to Covid patients and others for a few more months through an email. An official government resolution will soon be issued announcing the extension,” said the scheme’s regional manager, Amol Maske. Mildly infected patients are not included in the scheme. “Moderate to severely ill patients needing oxygen therapy — with blood oxygen saturation below 94 — and those requiring intensive care can avail the benefit of the scheme at empanelled hospitals,” Maske said. Confirming the development, Dr Jitendra Oswal, the deputy medical director of Bharati hospital in Dhankawdi — one of the biggest Covid hospitals in Pune, said, “The scheme is in force. We have been asked to extend it to Covid patients fitting the illness criteria.” Activists had earlier sought the extension of the scheme, stating that scores in the state had suffered financially during the lockdowns. The losses, they claimed, warranted the need for free treatment for a host of illnesses, including Covid-19, at least for one more year. On May 1, 2020, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope had announced that all citizens would be covered under the state government’s health scheme, MJPJAY, irrespective of their financial status. Rules were amended during the lockdown to include all ration card holders under MJPJAY, so that financial constraints did not become an obstacle in accessing timely Covid treatment for anyone. Health activist and medical practitioner Abhijit More said, “The government should make more efforts to popularise the scheme as many families from the middle- and lower-middle-class households have financial constraints.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-government-extends-free-ncov-treatment-scheme/articleshow/88194976.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Unlike in the past, the membership drive will be entirely online, transparent, and error-free,” he said. “Each of the roughly 34,000 polling stations in the state will have one enroller,” he added. On Thursday, the drive officially began in Kodangal, where AICC leader Praveen Chakravarty and other leaders attended the event. “Instead of holding a large meeting to kick off the membership campaign, I chose a small dalit basti in Kondangal to get a sense of how the membership drive should be carried out at the booth level,” he added. He further said that everyone who joins the Congress party as a member will receive a Rs 2 lakh life insurance policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-begins-30-lakh-membership-drive/articleshow/88194975.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Southern flank from Ganesh Talkies to Girish Park to reopen||Kolkata: There is good news in store for thousands of commuters going from central Kolkata towards Girish Park and further north. After remaining shut for several months since August this year to allow dismantling of the Vivekananda flyover (Posta flyover), a single flank of the stretch between Ganesh Talkies to Girish Park will finally reopen to traffic next week. “The southern flank will be reopened for now. A legal tangle has stalled demolition on a section of the northern flank which will continue to be fenced off. Though the road will be handed over to us by this weekend, we expect vehicles to resume on this stretch from December 16 after it is readied for vehicular movement,” said a traffic department officer at Lalbazar. The Jorabagan traffic guard have requested both KMDA and KMC to arrange for three crucial things before the stretch gets reopened. “Primarily, we have requested the road surface be relaid after all the heavy digging and machines has left its top surface completely battered. We have asked KMC to set up the uprooted streetlight pools so that the road has enough illumination. Finally, we have also requested KMDA to ensure at least some fencing (on the northern lane) is removed near the important crossings. All the lanes and bylanes like Balaram De Street are shut. Unless that is opened, there will be very limited gain in running traffic on this stretch. A decision on allowing buses will be taken after studying the traffic volume once the road reopens,” said an officer who attended the coordination meeting at Lalbazar on Wednesday. The move is set to bring relief in the Posta-Jorabagan-Malapara-Rabindra Kanan-Beadon Street stretch, and ensure that traffic flow will be smoother all through the day. KMDA plans to initiate the third phase work of dismantling the flyover from December 20 on the stretch from Ganesh Talkies and Malapara, a distance of about 160 meters on KK Tagore Street. KMDA engineers and Jorabagan traffic guard officers did an inspection on the work progress of pulling down the flyover stretch earlier last week. Police had requested KMDA to ensure that a portion of the Girish Park-Ganesh Talkies stretch is reopened before beginning the third phase. “Some minor work is still left in the second phase of dismantling from Girish Park to Ganesh Talkies. Three more piers have to be pulled down which would take another fortnight but work has got stuck as a resident of the area filed a court case, stating that his building’s balcony should not be affected or damaged while pulling down the flyover structure. The case is going on in court even as we have decided to take up the next phase of demolition work. The portion of the flyover yet to be pulled down in the second phase of work will be fenced off,” said a KMDA official.

The protest was organised at Student's Centre. Listing their demands, SFS member Gagan said they wanted resumption of pre-Covid mess and canteen rates and regulation food rates at Students Centre. Sandeep from SFS said that increase in food prices on campus would make education inaccessible for students from marginalised sections of society. “We must condemn privatisation of a public institution like Panjab University and resist scuttling of our democratic space by BJP-RSS and their student wing, ABVP,” he said. During a meeting with the student leaders, Ashok Sabharwal, associate DSW, assured that a committee would be formed to consider the issues. He added that after they arrived at a conclusion, student representatives would be invited and further discussions would be held.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Survey to curb monkey menace, identify hotspots||HYDERABAD: In a first-of-its-kind initiative in Telangana, the agricultural department has initiated a ‘monkey menace survey’ in villages across the state to identify hotspots of monkey movements and the number of monkeys.  The survey is being conducted because the monkey problem has been identified as the main hindrance to crop conversion from paddy to groundnut. According to officials, Telangana, like Himachal Pradesh, is dealing with this issue and the northern state used a sterilisation technique to limit monkey movements. Agriculture officers around the state were requested to submit the details of monkeys in a five-question format and a special web provision was provided in the department’s crop booking system with the name ‘monkey menace survey’. The questionnaire includes how many monkeys are in the village, whether they move in groups, how much crop damage has occurred due to the monkey problem, where do they live (old buildings, roadside, forest areas, or elsewhere), and what tools the villages are using to combat the menace, such as monkey guns and solar fencing. The field officers must also note whether there are any tourism attractions nearby. According to reports, each officer is responsible for entering crop booking and other details of every 10,000 acres and the same officers are in charge of the monkey menace survey. The survey will reveal the number of monkeys and their hotspots, and the sterilising operation may begin later. The animal husbandry department has a theatre facility in the Nirmal district where one monkey was sterilised some time back “We can initiate a similar process in all the districts of the state,” Dr S Ramchander, animal husbandry director said. Many farmers in the state have informed officials that monkeys are damaging their crops, primarily groundnut and that they would like to be relieved of the threat. Following that, the government held a high-level review meeting.

The judge heard the plea of the IAS officer, who was urging the court to quash the case against her, and reserved his orders. CBI counsel K Surender opposed any relief to the officer and argued that she was part of a conspiracy that enriched Gali Janardhan Reddy of Obulapuram mining company and caused loss to the state exchequer. Her role should be seen along with the roles of other accused in the case. Isolated depiction of individual roles might not unravel the whole picture, Surender said. “An order from a court or from the state is enough for us to probe,” he said, citing the GO issued by AP, in this case, to inquire into the illegal mining scam. “This case is not about mineral rules or mining norms. This case is about taking bribes and granting mining leases that enriched private companies,” Surender said. The judge reserved his orders. Responding to the repeated requests of the counsel for the petitioner seeking a stay on trial court proceedings, the judge said there was no question of staying the proceedings. However, he advised the counsel to brief the trial court about the ongoing hearing at the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/srilakshmi-gets-no-relief-from-hc/articleshow/88194240.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N Tukaramji, while resuming hearing in a 2019 PIL filed by Vijay Gopal of Secunderabad, heard petitioner’s counsel Y Sheelu and was not convinced about the averments made by the petitioner. Mahendar Reddy was appointed as in-charge DGP on November 12, 2017, and as a full-fledged DGP (HoPF) on April 12, 2018. The petitioner’s main contention was that the appointment was not in tune with the mandate of the Supreme Court laid down in the Prakash Singh Versus Union of India case. Advocate general BS Prasad said that they followed the procedure laid down by Prakash Singh’s case judgment. “We made a special Act in tune with this judgment for appointing Mahendar Reddy as the DGP (HoPF). The Supreme Court is seized of the matter,” he said. The bench expressed its disinclination to look into a matter which is currently under examination of the apex court. “The PIL is not maintainable here on this ground,” the AG said. “Moreover, PILs in service matters are not maintainable,” the AG said, citing judgments of the Supreme Court and the high court to support his argument. The bench agreed with him and dismissed the PIL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-junks-plea-on-appointment-of-mahendar-reddy-as-hopf/articleshow/88194250.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The teachers’ body alleged that since the hiring of Cyclops, a security agency, in 2019, “the security on campus had only deteriorated” and that the security service was only available for the vice-chancellor. “The only time that university members see the Cyclops security service in action is when their guards flank the vice-chancellor in his public performances of ‘leadership’. Other than that, one only sees them when the administration instrumentalises them to intimidate students, campus workers and faculty members into implementing their highhanded policies,” the JNUTA said in a statement issued.

Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that the second dose vaccination rate at present was around 65%, which came to roughly 55.74 lakh beneficiaries taking both the shots against the target population of 83.42 lakh. Deshmukh said they had a stock of around 4 lakh doses across Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and Pune rural units, while the state offered around five lakh more doses if required. Deshmukh said the Omicron-related concerns had resulted in surge in the second dose vaccination in the past few days. “To achieve 70% target of double vaccination in December, we have to vaccinate around four lakh more people with second shot. Considering the current vaccination rate, we might surpass the 70% mark,” he said, adding that around 13 lakh people were due for the second dose of Covishield and Covaxin by December 2 in the district. Ayush Prasad, the chief executive officer of Pune Zilla Parishad, said, “Few pockets in the district are lagging in the completion of the first dose despite crossing 100% first dose vaccination across the district. The district health office will focus on these areas. We shall ensure that unvaccinated people get their doubts cleared about the vaccine by increasing the awareness drives.” The district recorded vaccination of around 73,762 beneficiaries across 665 government and private sites till 8pm on Thursday. The district now has administered 1.39 crore doses of Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V.

She added that all admissions be made through Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, Faridkot. According to her, the hindrance of recruiting faculty for the college had been sorted out. “We hope that by the next hearing in Supreme Court, slated for January 13, we will be able to get a free hand in students’ admission and the academic session will be commenced by January or February. Modalities have already been worked out to cover up syllabus loss by holding extra classes,” she said. In September this year, the Medical Assessment and Rating Board (MARB) of National Medical Commission (NMC) approved 100 MBBS seats for Dr B R Ambedkar Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the 2021-22 session. The college was also asked to inform the board after filling 8% deficit faculty seats. Besides, the NMC sought increase in the number of seats, subject to conditions. The National Medical Commission has issued a letter to the Punjab government, establishing that Dr B R Ambedkar State Institute of Medical Sciences has been approved by the Commission. In view of the approval of 100 MBBS seats, the commission has decided to obtain essential documents for issuance of Letter of Permission for increase in seats for the academic year 2021-22. According to the notification, the conditions are that the college should provide all infrastructural facilities in terms of teaching and non-teaching staff, buildings, equipment and hospital facilities as per National Medical Commission norms. No student should be admitted in the above courses till formal permission of the Medical Assessment and Rating Board (MARB) is received. The medical colleges will provide undertaking to implement the decision regarding payment of stipend during the internship of UG students, similar to UG students of government medical colleges in their state. MARB reserves the right to withdraw, cancel, revoke the letter of intent or letter of permission if it comes to notice that permission has been obtained by misrepresentation of facts or fraud. It shall be incumbent upon the medical college that the information relating to admission should be submitted within the time specified in the circular. Any failure to do so would be taken to mean that the admissions were not in accordance with statutory requirements, thereby enabling the commission to proceed against the college in accordance with the law. Meanwhile, Punjab medical education and research minister Dr Raj Kumar Verka has said that all vacancies in Class D should be filled on regular basis instead of outsourcing at B R Ambedkar State Institute of Medical Sciences, Mohali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/first-academic-session-in-mohali-med-college-may-start-in-jan-feb/articleshow/88194265.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

---||Pune||1.6cr doses pending, another 1.5cr to come from Centre||Pune: The state is all set to utilise 1.6 crore pending Covid-19 vaccine doses to scale up vaccination before it receives another 1.5 crore doses from the Centre later this month. The state public health department officials stated that they were planning to scale up daily vaccination to 10 lakh in Maharashtra to utilise the pending doses. Of the 1.6 crore pending doses, 1.2 crore have been distributed to nearly 3,500 cold chain points and 40 lakh doses are in reserve stock at the regional offices at seven locations. Officials cited two reasons for the pending doses in the state’s kitty. First, the festive season. Second, the long gap between two shots of Covishield. A health department official said, “The festive season had slowed down the vaccination in the state. Now, with the emergence of Omicron variant, the pace has increased. Also, those skipping the second dose, maybe because of long gap between the two jabs of Covishield, would be covered under the Har Ghar Dastak initiative.” State health minister Rajesh Tope issued a directive to ensure that Har Ghar Dastak programme was implemented properly to ensure that all beneficiaries were covered at the earliest. The Centre recently said over 10 crore doses were pending with Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Bihar and Rajasthan, while overall 20 crore vaccine doses were available with the states for December. In a recent meeting, the Centre asked all the states, especially the five holding the maximum doses, to scale up vaccination and finish the balance doses. A central government health official said, “Some of the states holding the highest inventory are also the ones that have registered a slow pace in vaccination. The focus should be on completing all first doses in time and ensure that all those who skipped the second dose were urged to take it at the earliest.” The Centre’s report stated that Uttar Pradesh had around 3.5 crore unvaccinated people, followed by Bihar, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. A senior health official of Maharashtra state said, “Many districts have fared well, but some are lagging in vaccination. All of them have been asked to cover the remaining beneficiaries at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1-6cr-doses-pending-another-1-5cr-to-come-from-centre/articleshow/88195011.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Dehradun||CDS found similarities in Kashmir & U'khand, worked at addressing migration through walnut cultivation||Dehradun: Chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, who died in a chopper crash in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday, wanted to bring about a change for good in inner line border areas of Uttarakhand by reversing migration and providing employment to the youth of these areas. Locals recall that he always said Kashmir and Uttarakhand are alike in many ways and wanted to make Uttarakhand's economy robust like Kashmir's. Three years ago, he had engaged Army personnel and villagers in planting walnut trees in the border villages. The state horticulture department followed the initiative and walnut grafted plants which were 21,000 in number per year are now 24,600, as per data available with the horticulture department. Recalling the initiative, former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat, in whose tenure the project was undertaken, said that Gen Rawat distributed walnut saplings in Chamoli and Pithoragarh to local villagers through the Army and his dream was to see villagers generating sufficient income through walnut cultivation.“Gen Rawat had set up two nurseries in Pithoragarh and Chamoli. The nurseries witnessed almost 60% germination of walnuts. The idea was to stop migration from the border villages by creating job opportunities for the locals, thereby bringing about a cohesion between Army and villagers,” the ex-CM said, adding, "At 12,600 feet, Jadun village in Uttarkashi emptied in 1962 will witness reverse migration thanks to Gen Rawat's suggestions." Brajesh Gupta, a walnut expert in the horticulture department, added, “In the past few years, the farmers in the hills received saplings and grafted plants of dry fruits, which have the potential to augment their incomes.” Villagers, too, expressed happiness at the initiative. “I have five sons. All of them have moved out in search of jobs. One of them was in the Army and he died while on duty. At home, it is just me and my husband. We hope the walnut plantation will change the future of this state and bring back its young people,” said Meera Devi, 67, a resident of Chamoli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cds-found-similarities-in-kashmir-ukhand-worked-at-addressing-migration-through-walnut-cultivation/articleshow/88193507.cms||Shivani Azad

However, 24 hours after the incident, Mohali police are clueless about the identity of the carjackers. The car of PCS officer Rajesh Tripathy was snatched at gunpoint by three armed and masked men on the road dividing sectors 86/87. He was on his way back home in Purab Premium Apartments, Sector 88. Investigating officer, inspector Amrik Singh said the incident took place at around 11pm on Wednesday night when Tripathy was returning to his official residence. When he reached near Purab Premium Apartments in his Maruti Ertiga Car, another car overtook him, forcing him to stop. At this, the carjackers took a pistol and sword and forced him to step out of the car at gunpoint. Then they fled with his car. A resident standing outside his house noticed the officer in despair and came to help. He called the police and took the officer to hospital. Investigating officer, inspector Amrik Singh said they are yet to ascertain the identity of the robbers and three teams have been dispatched to various directions to search for them.

He was a visionary who took reformative and futuristic decisions in the interest of the service without bothering about the criticism,” said Baijal, who shared his regiment of Gorkha Rifle with General Rawat. “Apart from General Rawat, his staff officer Lt Col Harjinder Singh and PSO Havildar Satpal Rai too belong to Gorkha Rifle. Therefore on the behalf of Lt Gen Atulya Solankey, Colonel 11 Gorkha Rifle & Sikkim Scouts and all ranks of the regiment, I pray to Durga Mata to grant eternal peace to the departed souls and give strength and fortitude to the bereaved families to bear this irreparable loss,” said Baijal, who lives in Lucknow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gen-was-humane-fearless-commander/articleshow/88195527.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Covid-19 Omicron variant concern keeps people away from OPDs||PUNE: The fear of Omicron has caused a drop in OPD footfall in Pune hospitals, with some patients also rescheduling their planned surgeries. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune, told TOI, “Patients are postponing their treatment, with OPD footfalls reducing, following the emergence of Omicron. One of my patients had taken a cataract surgery appointment on December 15, but now wants the surgery to be done on Friday.” He said people should not fear Omicron, and instead take due precautions, such as adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Patients are also delaying routine visits to doctors for various ailments like diabetes and hypertension after reports of the new variant,” he said. Dr Sanjay Lalwani, medical director of the Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical Hospital and Research Centre, said, “Planned surgeries have been getting postponed, while we are also seeing a dip in operative surgeries as people are in a wait-and-watch mode following the emergence of Omicron. Though emergency surgeries are going on as usual, there has been a 30-40% drop in planned surgeries at the hospital. However, we feel that the fear should settle down in a month’s time once more information is out on the new variant’s transmissibility and virulence.” Dr Madhav Chavan, managing director - Phoenix Hospital, told TOI, “Paediatric OPD footfalls have reduced by 25-30% as parents have been avoiding getting out with children for fear of contracting the new variant.” General practitioner Dr Santosh Gosavi said, “There is almost 60% drop in footfalls, the new variant being one of the causes. Those with issues such as allergic rhinitis and sinus are also delaying visits to doctors as they fear that they would be asked to do an RT-PCR test.” Dr Arati Shahade, consultant physician and diabetologist said while Omicron could be one of the reasons for reduced footfalls at OPDs. “December being a healthy season usually sees a dip in viral infections, which could also be a factor,” she said. Doctors themselves have started taking precautions after reports of Omicron, paediatrician Dr Dilip M Sarda told TOI. “We have been asking patients and their parents about their travel history when they visit the clinic and also insisting them to wear double masks during their interaction with us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-variant-concern-keeps-people-away-from-opds/articleshow/88195017.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Ahmedabad||Don't hold drives to please political bosses: Gujarat HC tells Ahmedabad civic body||AHMEDABAD: Reeling from the angry lashing by the Gujarat high court, the AMC claimed there was no discrimination against any group during its recent campaign to remove food carts and termed its actions ‘just an anti-encroachment drive’. The civic body’s counsel submitted that only carts that were creating hurdles to traffic movement and blocking footpaths for pedestrians were confiscated. Several vendors moved the HC after the recent drive of the AMC where food carts — primarily those selling non-vegetarian food and eggs — were removed. The vendors are seeking the return of the seized carts and that they be allowed to do business as usual. During the hearing in the HC on Thursday, the AMC’s counsel submitted, “This is a simple drive against encroachment. They (petitioners) are giving it a colour of non-vegetarian food items.” To this the judge quickly replied, “You are giving it a colour of encroachment (drive) to remove non-vegetarian food vendors.” The judge further commented that the AMC did it under the guise of implementing the law and asked further, “Around Vastrapur lake, hawkers are selling eggs and omelettes. Overnight you decide because the party in power says that they don’t want people to eat eggs, you will pick them up and send them away? Today somebody had a nightmare and said that from tomorrow there will not be any sale of non-vegetarian food. Ask your commissioner to remain present and answer. How dare you indiscriminately pick up people like this and seize their assets?” The judge asked the AMC not to undertake such drives to please their political bosses, but asserted that if there is encroachment, it has to go. The AMC maintained that this was not a case of singling out any group of hawkers, but merely enforcing the law. Justice Vaishnav asked the AMC to return the seized carts and stalls to vendors in accordance with the law upon receiving their applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dont-hold-drives-to-please-political-bosses-gujarat-hc-tells-ahmedabad-civic-body/articleshow/88194369.cms||---
---||Delhi||Looking into ‘extortion’ by jail officials in Ankit Gujjar case, says CBI||NEW DELHI: Central Bureau of Investigation on Thursday informed the Delhi high court that its probe is “going beyond” the death of inmate Ankit Gujjar in Tihar Jail and also examining the aspect of extortion by jail officials. The agency’s submission came before Justice Mukta Gupta, who had earlier transferred the probe from Delhi Police to CBI. Investigation in the case is at a crucial stage and likely to be complete within a month, the agency stated. The judge granted time to CBI to file a status report in a sealed cover and asked the investigating officer to “take measures” in case of threat to any witnesses. “We are examining extortion and murder. We are going beyond the case and looking into the larger conspiracy... We have sought the bank accounts (of relevant persons),” the CBI counsel submitted, adding that the agency was “linking the chain” and “within a month, the grievances raised by the petitioner would be sorted out.” He added that statements of 60 witnesses have been recorded and sought the court’s permission to file a status report in a sealed cover. Gujjar was found dead inside his cell in Tihar on August 4. Following the death in judicial custody, Gujjar’s kin moved court seeking a thorough probe, alleging he was harassed by jail officials for not meeting their demands for money. In September, the court had transferred investigation into the death of Gujjar to CBI after opining that the deceased “lost his life to custodial violence”. Observing that it was “unfathomable” that the jail doctor failed to see the multiple injuries on the deceased, the court had said that an investigation was needed into not only the offence of brutally beating the deceased but also into “the role of jail doctors in not providing proper treatment at the right time”. The matter will be heard next on January 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/looking-into-extortion-by-jail-officials-in-ankit-gujjar-case-says-cbi/articleshow/88195034.cms||---

The PIL was filed by social worker Perala Shekhar Rao from LB Nagar. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N Tukaramji sought replies from the state, GHMC, and DCHL within six weeks. Petitioner’s counsel T Sudhakar said that the allotment was made to DCHL at a cheaper price to carry out media-related work. However, the company has now given it to TNR Constructions for building flats. They had even put up a board that the flats would soon be available for sale. Since they were not using the land for the projected purpose, the state should take resume the land, he said. The land could be used to build a park or a government hospital instead, Sudhakar said. He sought a probe into the allotment of land to DCHL. GHMC counsel Sampath Prabhakar Reddy said the civic body did not accord any permission to the media house to raise any structures at the site. “We have also issued a notice to DCHL asking it to explain why it is attempting construction there without any permission,” he added. The bench posted the case to February 23, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/resume-land-allotted-to-media-house-pil/articleshow/88194273.cms||---

Devprayag legislator Vinod Kandari moved a proposal to name the under-construction Sanskrit University at Devprayag after the CDS, which was approved by the House. Haridwar MLA and state BJP chief Madan Kaushik also tabled a proposal to name the Sainya Dham, being built in Dehradun in memory of those who died in the line of duty, after Rawat. Remembering General Rawat, chief minister Puskar Singh Dhami said, “This a big loss for the entire country as well as me personally. I would always cherish our association. He was a simple person but firm in taking decisions.” Former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said that General Rawat took major steps to check migration from the border areas. “He started walnut plantations in Chamoli and Pithoragarh with the vision of providing employment to locals and stopping migration from hill villages.” The former CM, who is also a native of Pauri district like General Rawat, said he shared a special bond with him. “He gave special attention towards border areas and the people living there.

---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Part of Maharaja’s College ground to be used to rehabilitate street vendors||KOCHI: In yet another case of alienating the land owned by Maharaja’s College, the authorities are planning to use a portion of the college ground for rehabilitating vendors from Fashion Street on Mullassery Canal Road. If the area earmarked for basketball-cum-netball court is used for such a purpose, it will deal a blow to the college’s plan to scale up its sporting facilities. The vendors are being relocated for facilitating the renovation of Mullassery Canal. At a meeting held at the district sports council office on December 4, 2021, authorities proposed the idea of rehabilitating the vendors to the college ground. District collector Jaffer Malik, T J Vinod MLA, mayor M Anil Kumar and college authorities took part in the meeting. Though college principal Mercy Joseph, vice-principal Jayamol K V and physical education department head Reena Joseph raised strong objections, others decided to go ahead with the move. Later, the college principal wrote to the director of collegiate education, district collector and Kochi mayor, asking them not to take over the land. Corporation officials acted swiftly, and the very next day after the meeting, started developing the land for shifting the vendors. “The college authorities have already submitted a proposal for setting up a basketball-cum-netball court before the directorate of collegiate education. The move by the district administration and the corporation authorities will thwart the efforts of the college officials to set up new facilities in the ground,” a source said. The authorities claim they are taking over only a portion of a bushy area adjacent to the ground. “Renovation of Mullassery Canal is part of Operation Breakthrough. The project is monitored by the high court. So, we can’t delay the work. We can start the renovation of the canal only after the vendors are rehabilitated,” district collector Jaffer Malik said. “We are taking over only small portion of the land which is a bushy area and full of garbage. Once the canal renovation is completed, we will return the land,” he said. A section of students has already threatened protests against the move. “The land taken for such purposes would never be returned. If they go ahead with the plan, we will start protests,” said Amal Tomy, vice-president, KSU’s Maharaja’s college unit. Maharaja’s College has already lost its land parcels for various projects. The government set up the KWA office on the college premises. Another area on the college premises was allotted to Kerala History Association. Now, there is a three-storeyed building in the said land. “While a private lab and other firms occupy the building, the history association, to which the land was allotted, is functioning from the terrace with a roof truss above it!” a source said. Similarly, 16.4 cents from the college ground was handed over for constructing the Metro station in 2013. “The then collector who headed the land acquisition had promised to arrange compensation from Kochi Metro Rail Limited. But, the officials wilfully stayed away from signing an agreement and later, the KMRL denied that there was such an agreement. This is how the college is alienating its land parcels,” an alumnus of the college said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/part-of-maharajas-college-ground-to-be-used-to-rehabilitate-street-vendors/articleshow/88194306.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The municipal commissioners have been asked to check permissions of major constructions, especially apartments and gated communities, that were granted by erstwhile gram panchayats which are now part of new municipalities. Commissioner of municipal administration N Satyanarayana on Thursday directed the municipal commissioners to furnish the report before December 25. Official sources said that several hundred gram panchayats were merged to create new municipalities in 2018 with the intention to develop the areas. While gram panchayats have powers to grant permissions up to ground and two floors, many sanctioned plans for five floors and gated communities, especially on the city’s outskirts and HMDA jurisdiction. Officials suspect that panchayat secretaries, sarpanches and commissioners of some new municipalities colluded with the builders. In some cases, fake permissions were found for new constructions with old dates when the areas were under gram panchayats. “Municipal commissioners have to detect unauthorised constructions in their respective areas which were started without permissions and initiate stringent action against them. The commissioners have to gather information and maintain stock register of building permissions accorded during the panchayats and also take over all registers with approved plans and endorsements from them,” Satyanarayana said. Apart from buildings, the municipal administration also decided to focus on illegal layouts and permission year, owner, plinth area and other details.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-to-check-building-permissions-in-74-new-municipalities/articleshow/88194292.cms||Koride Mahesh

The classroom was a dream for many like Dolly in Ambedkarnagar district. However, the men in khaki ushered a paradigm shift for kids wallowing in the fringes of society by pledging to sponsor their education under community policing scheme. Dolly, 14, who is now in class 8, told TOI she would become a teacher one day and teach everyone for free in her village. Daughter of a mason, she’s pursuing her studies with zeal. Her neighbour, Ajay, a class 6 student, too considers himself blessed. Not just the duo, Ambedkar Nagar district police has identified 26 children from underprivileged families for sponsoring their education till class 12. These children study in Ashok Smarak School, whose administration has chalked out an agreement with police to ensure free schooling. Superintendent of police, Ambedkarnagar, Alok Priyadarshi, said, “The school has also inked an MoU with PK Charitable Trust to provide students with paraphernalia like school bags, books and stationery. “We have also pooled in resources to buy school essentials to these 26 students,” he said. Priyadarshi also said, families of these children live in thatched houses and earn their livelihood by rag picking or making bamboo baskets. Nobody in their families has ever gone to school. Their parents had to be counselled for months on the need for education. “Education is the best tool to fight poverty. A mechanism to bear recurring cost is being worked out so that the kids don’t drop out,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/paradigm-shift-community-policing-helps-ragpicker-kids-go-to-school-in-ambedkarnagar/articleshow/88195532.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

A pamphlet, allegedly left by CPI Maoist between Kondapur-Allubhaka villages, was recovered by locals and passed on to district police. It accused police of luring villagers through different means to weaken CPI Maoist. In the pamphlet, they named five persons, including women, belonging to Bollaram, Sitarampur and Kalipaka villages and accused them of being police informers. The Maoists accused police of luring the villagers to share information about their movement or new persons coming to their villages. “By making phone calls or through WhatsApp, information is being shared with police by some villagers,’‘ CPI Maoist Venkatapuram-Vajedu area committee said in the pamphlet. However, Mulugu superintendent of police Sangram Singh Patil was non-committal about any security upgrade to be provided to specific persons and villagers whose names were declared by the Maoists. “There is always a threat to police and para-military forces. Whatever advisory is given to government officials and villagers, we will be issuing the same by telling them to take precautionary measures. Apart from that, we will make them stay in a secured location,’‘ Sangram told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/maoist-drop-pamphlet-warn-villagers-in-mulugu/articleshow/88194303.cms||---
---||Delhi||Participation of students in social causes down since liberalisation: CJI||NEW DELHI: The Chief Justice of India on Thursday flagged “diminished” participation of students in social causes as an area of concern, noting that it had been decades since a big leader emerged from students. “Any keen observer of Indian society would notice that in the past few decades, no big leader has emerged from the student community. This appears to be correlated with diminished participation of students in social causes after liberalisation,” CJI N V Ramana said in his convocation address at National Law University (NLU) Delhi. “The importance of students’ participation in modern democracy cannot be played down. It is necessary for you to take part in current debates,” he added. Encouraging students to “emerge as leaders in public life”, the CJI said more and more students must become “socially and politically conscious”. Addressing a gathering in the presence of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi High Court Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Siddharth Mridul, apart from vice-chancellor Srikrishna Deva Rao, the CJI also spoke his mind on the condition of education. “In an anxiety to secure highly remunerative and profitable job opportunities, children are sent to exile in privately run residential schools and coaching centres. The formative years of budding talents are spent in a suffocating atmosphere, which unfortunately resembles prisons. Holistic development of a child cannot be achieved in such a restrictive environment,” he observed. Prepping them for life outside campus, the CJI, who is also Visitor of NLU, said, “Do not get shocked when you see the conditions outside. Courtrooms are not like those represented in movies or moot courts. Cramped courtrooms, judges sitting on broken chairs, stenographers and court masters having to attend court without adequate arrangements, absence of restrooms, etc. would be a common sight.” The head of the judiciary also appreciated the role of the Delhi chief minister, saying he has been a pillar of strength for NLU Delhi. “I am told he honours every request that is made in the interest of this institution. He is known for his commitment and hard work for the welfare of the people of Delhi. His work in the field of education and healthcare are highly appreciated,” the CJI added. He also flagged concerns about status of NLUs, saying that these were perceived as “elitist and detached from social realities”. He said it was “a little troubling” that most students from these universities ended up in corporate law firms, adding “it is unfortunate that a comparable addition is not being made to the ranks of lawyers practising in courts” from the NLUs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/participation-of-students-in-social-causes-down-since-liberalisation-cji/articleshow/88195059.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Hyderabad||Fee hike in colleges triggers protests by ABVP||HYDERABAD: A fee row is brewing across the state with private and government institutions increasing the tuition fee for the academic year 2021-22. This, even as the Telangana State Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee (TAFRC) is yet to initiate the process for fixation of fee for several courses. Colleges such as Chaitanya Bharati Institute of Technology (CBIT) and Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Technology (MGIT) are among those who have issued notices informing students about the fee hike. “Students admitted in regular courses and under lateral entry in B.E/B.Tech courses in the academic year 2021-22 are put on notice that their annual fee is liable to be enhanced to Rs 1,86,733 instead of Rs 1,34,000 as fixed by TAFRC, based on the outcome of the petitions/appeals before the courts of law,” read a notice issued by CBIT to all the students. The constituent colleges in various state universities have also hiked the fee of undergraduate and post-graduate courses, triggering massive protest by members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). “Fee for some self-financing courses have been doubled by the state universities. Education has become a completely money- making sector with no affordability,” said Javvaji Dileep, general secretary, ABVP, Telangana unit, that held a massive protest in many state universities on December 7. The TAFRC fixes the fee structure for all the professional colleges once in three years. It was last in 2019 that the TAFRC had fixed the tuition fee for all professional colleges such as engineering, management and pharmacy. With the TAFRC due to fix the fee structure in 2022, some colleges have already started to issue notices to the students to inform them of the decision. Meanwhile, the TAFRC is expected to issue notification this month following approval from the state government to proceed with the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fee-hike-in-colleges-triggers-protests-by-abvp/articleshow/88194308.cms||---

Sharing the information at a seminar on trafficking and domestic violence, Sanjay Mishra of Bal Kalyan Sangh, a non-government organisation that was associated with IRRC till recently, said that out of the thousands of girls who migrate to other state for jobs, 12% go missing. He said these hard-to-reach children are subjected to extreme levels of exploitation. He added that the high number is also indicative of large scale human trafficking that happened during the Covid period as well. He said that between January 2021 and October 2021, 95 cases — involving 85 girls and 10 boys — of trafficking has come to light. Loss of employment and means of livelihood were the main reasons why girls are forced to move out to other states for jobs. Commenting on the issue, Additional Director General of Criminal Investigation Department, Prashant Singh, said that human trafficking was a serious problem for Jharkhand, adding that all sections of the society must join hands to curb it. He added with many women losing their jobs during the pandemic, domestic violence has also increased. Several other speakers, including former chairperson of state commission for women Mahua Majhi, country head of The Asia Foundation Nandita Das and president Action Against Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation of Children Manvendra Nath Mandal also spoke on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/more-than-500-trafficked-kids-rescued-in-over-2-years-data/articleshow/88194148.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Taking part in the concluding-day of the dharna on Thursday, CPI (M-L) MLA Binod Singh said, “It is wrong to reject the people who were quite active in agitations like road blockade and economic blockade during the fight for a separate state of Jharkhand but were not caught. In many of the related FIRs, the police simply did not mention the cause of the agitation. It would be difficult for the participants to show any documentary evidence.” President of Jharkhand Andolankari Sangharsh Morcha Raju Mahto pointed out that there is no mandatory condition of serving jail to be termed as revolutionary in the Government of India rules as well. He further stated, “The process for selection of revolutionaries for the benefits is very slow. A commission comprising leaders of Jharkhand movement should be formed to speedily identify the actual participants in the agitation.” Mahto said that now they plan to stage a demonstration before the chief minister Heman Soren’s residence on December 11 to press for their demands. The other demands of revolutionaries are pension at par with either freedom fighters or former MLAs, provision for another chance for filing applications, special recruitment drive for their dependents, sons, daughters and wards of revolutionaries, naming of important roads and crossings after them, allotment of five acre of agriculture land and 20 decimal for house and free travel within the state. The participants said that revolutionaries who fought for Jharkhand in Odisha, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh be provided similar pension and facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/statehood-movement-activists-hold-sit-in-over-eligibility-rules/articleshow/88194135.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The direction from the school management was prompted by instructions from the government at a time Omicron variant cases have been detected in Karnataka and schools have reopened. DDPI Ramachandra Raje Urs said the attendance for offline classes between Class I and X is 86 per cent. Parents have been told that they must send the certificates to school through their children. “Friday is the last day to submit the vaccination certificate of parents,” Urs said. According to Santosh Kumar, the Mysuru district representative of the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools (KAMS), the attendance to offline classes continued to be good even after the reports on Omicron emerged in the state. “There was no drop in the attendance,” he said. In all districts in the old Mysuru region, the number of students who tested positive for Covid-19 is low, except Chikamagaluru where a cluster case was reported last Saturday. According to data, on Tuesday no one below or of the age of 18 tested positive in Mysuru district. Earlier, in Chikamagaluru, 94, Hassan, 4, Kodagu, 11, Mysuru, 2, and in Shivamogga 1 student tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mysuru-schools-tell-students-to-show-parents-vaccine-certificate/articleshow/88193998.cms||Shrinivasa M

They also demanded the arrest of Quasim Mian from the same village from whose well the body of the deceased, Sunil Thakur, was found. Hazaribag SP Manoj Ratan Chothey said, “A tractor was returning to Peto Chowk carrying straw when a car carrying six persons hit the tractor on the night of December 7. Thakur tried to rescue the tractor driver but around 15 to 20 persons attacked Sunil and others. In order to protect themselves, Thakur and others ran. While the rest returned home, Thakur was found dead in Quasim’s well.” The protestors on Thursday broke the boundary wall of Quasim’s house and set a portion of the house ablaze. SP said relatives of Sunil lodged an FIR on Thursday against Quasim and five others. “Efforts are on to arrest the culprits,” said SP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/barkatha-mla-leads-protest-against-murder/articleshow/88194585.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Activists slam Hemant govt for neglecting human rights in state||Ranchi: Representatives of various civil rights group have expressed their discontent over the ‘government’s apathy in honouring basic human rights in the state’. The Hemant Soren-led coalition government has turned a blind eye to the Constitution and functioning of most of the constitutional bodies that guarantee constitutional remedies, they claimed. As of date, the state human rights commission, state commission for women, state commission for protection of child rights, state commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, state consumer grievance redressal commission and information commission are lying defunct. While most of the constitutional bodies do not have a chairperson, many of them do not even have members, depriving people of their fundamental right to be heard and their complaints redressed. The state unit of People Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) has planned to form a human chain at Albert Ekka Chowk on Friday to mark International Human Rights Day, which is on December 10. The head of PUCL’s Ranchi unit, Anand Kumar Singh, said, “Atrocities against common people have continued unabated. But what is worse is the absence of any forum where people can raise their voice. What exactly is the government’s intention for keeping the state human rights commission non-functional and not appointing its regular chairman and members?” The commission has remained without a regular chairperson since May 2018 and retired IAS officer Santosh Kumar Sathpathy is currently functioning as the acting chairman. One position of a member is also vacant resulting in delayed disposal and non-disposal of cases. Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha’s member Siraj finds the current situation in Jharkhand no different than what existed prior to the election of the current dispensation. “Police atrocities during the Raghubar Das-led BJP government were one of the main reasons that people voted them out of power. The crackdown of police machinery on Pathalgarhi activists was one of the main reasons why people chose an alternative but things did not change at all,” he said. Citing the example of an innocent tribal Brahmadev Singh, who was killed by security forces in Piri forest of Latehar district, Siraj said that the ugly face of the administration was exposed when police portrayed the victim as an extremist. “It is even worse when the widow had to run from pillar to post to lodge an FIR against the security forces and still, she was denied her basic right,” he added. State consumer grievance redressal commission has been lying without a head since Justice Tapen Sen vacated the post in August last year. In the absence of a chairman, consumers are being denied the basic right of being heard against exploitation and no cases are being heard. Describing the situation as anarchic, state BJP president Deepak Prakash said that the condition of women, children, tribals and Dalit have deteriorated under the present dispensation. “The commissions are constitutional bodies and by letting them go headless the government is trying to shy away from its accountability,” he said. Citing NCRB data, Prakash said that more than 3,000 cases of rape, several among them being instances of gang-rape, have been reported in the state during the last 23 months of governance. “But where will the victims go when police fail to nab the culprits and the women of child protection commissions are non-functional,” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/activists-slam-hemant-govt-for-neglecting-human-rights-in-state/articleshow/88194210.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The policemen also returned fire. No none was injured in the incident. On Thursday, SP Ehtesham Waquarib went to the spot to take stock of the situation. Police sources said around 10.30pm, a group of Maoists were spotted marching towards the building by cops who were staying on the first floor. When the police asked them to stop, they fired a few rounds. The policemen also retaliated, after which the rebels escaped in the jungle. Police suspected that the rebels were led by their new zonal commander Chhotu Kherwar, who was also instrumental in planting and exploding the IEDs in the newly constructed building last month. “After the blast, a contingent of policemen were camping in the building and carrying combing operations led by ASP (operations) Manish Kumar,” an official said, adding that a few blank cartridges were found at the spot in the morning. Another official added, “We had information about gun fires near the new damaged police station at about 11pm on Wednesday.

---||Ranchi||Cong MLA urges admin for site change in central school project||Ranchi: Fearing political backlash in his constituency, Mandar MLA and Congress party’s co-working president Bandhu Tirkey on Thursday wrote to Ranchi deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan, urging him to shift the site of a proposed school project for tribals to some other place to avert a law and order situation in the area. Titled as Eklavya Adarsha Vidyalaya, the district administration had earmarked about 52 acres of land for the Union government-funded project in Silgai village, which is considered as the birthplace of freedom fighter Veer Budhu Bhagat. While some section of tribals hailed the school when it was announced, stating that it will usher in proper education for the locals, others had been vehemently protesting against it, claiming that the school will be a threat to the native place of the freedom fighter. Also, the protesters claimed that the portion of the place where the school has been proposed will allegedly damage their religious site located in the area. While Bandhu initially ruled out any such fears, claiming that the protests were politically motivated, but considering the recent event of lawlessness in the past few months owing to several rounds of protests, he said that he was forced to write to the administration asking for a change of site. Earlier this week, too, when the district administration planned a gram sabha in the area for formally getting the school project passed amid heavy security, clashes broke out between protestors and administrative officials. Last month, in a similar agitation, protestors demolished the boundary wall of the upcoming school. Bandhu said, “The school will benefit the tribal students here but going by the kind of false propaganda that is being flared up by a certain section of people due to some political agenda, it is better to shift the site to another place to avert a law and order situation. I don’t want any kind of tension or problems for innocent tribals in my constituency. Hence, I have urged administration to reconsider the site for this school.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cong-mla-urges-admin-for-site-change-in-central-school-project/articleshow/88194162.cms||ASRP Mukesh

So far, the district has achieved 70% coverage for the first dose and a mere 32% for the second dose. The health officials have cited multiple reasons for the dismal figures. Explaining the low number of second dose coverage in the district, the chief medical officer of the Seraikela Kharsawan district, Vijay Kumar said, “A considerable number of the first dose beneficiaries have taken their shots at Jamshedpur in East Singhbhum. They took their second dose in their hometown in Seraikela-Kharsawan resulting in the mismatch of the first and second dose figures.” The official added that the exercise to trace and update the mobile numbers and addresses of those who have taken their first dose in Jamshedpur is. “Those who have taken the second dose in the walk-in mode without online registration are missing from our records," he said, adding, “Once the data is generated, the second dose figures will improve.” Kumar also claimed that there is some degree of laxity on part of the local beneficiaries, resulting in low coverage of the second dose. “We have launched awareness drives at town, suburb and village levels. Recently, we have received a stock of 60,000 vaccine shots and there is no shortage. The vaccination data of the district health department said 5,42,382 people have received the first dose against a target of 7,78,818 while 2,50,362 received the second dose till December 7. In the district, Seraikela block has recorded the highest — 88% — and Rajnagar the lowest at 62% in the first dose category. In terms of the second dose, Seraikela and Gamharia recorded the highest at 40% and Kuchai recorded the lowest at 21%. So far, 7205 cases reported were reported in the district of which 67 died while the remaining recovered. There is no active case in the district at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/seraikela-kharsawan-district-records-dismal-vax-figures/articleshow/88194219.cms||B Sridhar

Shingal and the trade union leaders sat down for talks around 1pm and continued till 7pm. After the meeting, the union leaders said the talks failed as HEC’s management failed to come up with a concrete roadmap to clear all outstanding wages. Nearly 3,000 HEC workers are on an indefinite strike since December 2 morning demanding clearance of their wages outstanding for over six months. The strike has halted production at the sick PSU’s three units — foundry, forge plant and heavy machine tools plant, and heavy machine-building plant. The strike has also affected the HEC’s deadline of delivery orders from railways, defence, space and other sectors. Talking to TOI after the meeting, the president of the Hatia Mazdoor Union, Bhawan Singh, said, “The HEC management offered to pay one month’s wages but it failed to specify by which date the payment would be made. It was also unclear on the remaining months’ wages. The CMD could only assure resumption of the canteen allowance that was discontinued earlier this year. From our side, we had assured that the workers would ensure smooth execution of all work if the timely payment of wages was guaranteed.” He added, “We are now left with no option but to continue with our tool-down strike till our wages are paid in full.” Sources said HEC’s monthly bill for wages runs to over Rs 7 crore. With the workers unpaid for the past six months and executives, too, going without salaries for the past seven months, HEC needs around Rs 45 crore to clear all its outstanding wages and salaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hec-workers-talks-fail-to-end-deadlock-strike-to-continue/articleshow/88194604.cms||Tapas Biswas
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand government to take Rs 1,552 crore loan for paddy MSP||RANCHI: The Jharkhand government has decided to take a loan of Rs 1,552 from two PSU banks to procure paddy from the state’s farmers this Kharif season. The state cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal in this regard by the department of food, public distribution and consumer affairs. The loan amount — Rs 776 crore each — will be taken from the State Bank of India and the Bank of India in the ongoing financial year. The government aims to procure eight lakh tonnes of paddy from nearly two lakh farmers under the minimum support price (MSP) scheme. Normal paddy will be procured at Rs 2,050 per quintal while grade A paddy will be procured at Rs 2,070 per quintal, cabinet secretary Vandana Dadel said after the meeting. State food and civil supplies minister Rameshwar Oraon, who also holds the finance portfolio, did not respond to TOI’s query on why the government needed a loan for the purpose. In another decision, the ministerial council approved a proposal to do away with its own Kuber Integrated Financial Management System and switch to the National Automatic Clearing House for direct benefit transfers from the treasuries. “The existing system was posing hindrances in making bulk payments,” Dadel said.

---||Ranchi||Hemant Soren sets January 20 deadline for 100% vaccination coverage in Jharkhand||RANCHI: Chief minister Hemant Soren on Thursday instructed the health officials concerned to ensure 100% vaccination coverage in the state by January 20 next year. The revised deadline is reportedly set as it became imminent that Jharkhand is most unlikely to meet the Centre’s target of meeting the 100% vaccination coverage by December 25 this year. As of Wednesday evening, only 35.58% of the state’s 2.41 crore beneficiaries (all adults above 18 years) have been administered both doses while 70.45% have received their first doses. Soren, who reviewed the health, medical education and family welfare department’s preparation to tackle a possible third wave of the pandemic, asked the officers to set up vaccination centres at every panchayat and hire manpower to boost coverage. He also asked the department to expedite its ongoing door-to-door surveillance programme in rural areas, where health workers are identifying and inoculating adults who are still missing out on the vaccine shots. There are over 4,000 panchayats in the state. The meeting, which was held at the Jharkhand Mantralaya, was attended by health minister Banna Gupta, chief secretary Sukhdev Singh, health secretary Arun Kumar Singh and senior bureaucrats. Soren was briefed about the new Omicron strain and the state’s preparations to tackle another wave. The health department officials also informed Soren that Jharkhand has 23,601 Covid beds for adult patients. Of them, 14,863 are oxygen supported while 8,738 are normal. “Moreover, over 3,000 are ICU beds. There are 1,456 ventilators available,” the department informed the CM. Besides adults, there are close to 1,800 oxygen-equipped beds for children, 1,147 ICU beds and 234 ventilators. The department also informed the CM that 80 medical oxygen production plants are currently functional statewide while 13 more will become operational by January 25 next year. Later, Soren asked the officials to step up screening of incoming passengers at railway stations, bus stands and Ranchi’s Birsa Munda International Airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-sets-jan-25-deadline-for-100-vax-coverage-in-state/articleshow/88194197.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Nagpur||Doctors seeking RT-PCR -ve certificate only in certain cases||Nagpur: Several doctors in the city now screen patients for Sars-Cov-2 virus only if they are unvaccinated, didn’t have prior Covid infection and currently show upper respiratory symptoms. The situation is like pre-Covid times not only for elective or emergency surgeries but also ante-natal cases (ANCs). During the last three months, when the district recorded a steep decline in new cases, testing centres also observed that few pregnant women were coming for testing. However, Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB) has gone for a toss at public and private hospitals. TOI visited a couple of hospitals to find staff, patients and relatives hardly caring for CAB and moving around without mask. Two days back, the state government had slashed the Covid RT-PCR testing rates in a bid to encourage more people to take the screening test amid threat of the Omicron variant which is said to be highly transmissible. Medical microbiologist Dr Sarfaraz Ahmed said that earlier it was presumed that everyone is Covid positive. “As the disease burden decreased and people started feeling safe, now everyone is considered to be negative. For many days after the second wave started receding, pregnant women used to be advised the test before delivery. But few have been tested in the last three months,” he said. Officials from both government medical colleges said not all admitted patients are tested but only those showing symptoms or coming for planned surgeries. Critical care specialist Dr Imran Noor Mohammad said that prescribing a Covid test during admission depends on different factors. “If a patient is young, needs minor surgery, is vaccinated or had been already infected, then there is no sense in asking for an RT-PCR. Over 80% population has antibodies. But in case Covid is suspected or the surgery is for oral cavity, or in case of a major surgery like cardiac then it is advisable to get the patient tested. There are chances of legal complication if such patient turns out Covid positive,” he said. Dr Anup Marar, convenor of Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA), said that RT-PCR was being done for most of the elective cases. “Exceptions were done for emergencies. In such cases, triage needs to be done to segregate the non-tested patients from negative ones. Currently, even though fully vaccinated, most patients posted for elective surgeries are advised RT-PCR for Covid along with other preoperative tests in larger interest of other admitted patients who have tested negative,” said Marar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doctors-seeking-rt-pcr-ve-certificate-only-in-certain-cases/articleshow/88194382.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Goa||Goa: Poll panel starts delimitation process for panchayat wards||PANAJI: The Goa state election commission (SEC) has started the process of delimitation of wards for 186 panchayats ahead of the local body elections mid-next year. This initial delimitation proposal has to be submitted by December 15. This is the first time the SEC is finalising the delimitation of wards for panchayat elections. Earlier, the process was carried out by the state government. However, the state has now entrusted the commission to do the job, in order to avoid allegations of political interference in the process, and to ensure that the election is held in a free and fair manner. “As per the recent amendment to Section 7 of the Goa Panchayat Raj Act, 1994, the task of dividing the panchayat area into wards and reservation of seats is assigned to the commission in consultation with the government,” a senior official said. To carry out this task, the commission has trained electoral registration officers (EROs) and assistant electoral registration officers (AEROs). EROs are mamlatdars and joint mamlatdars, and AEROs are awal karkuns and head clerks. By December 15, EROs will submit the initial delimitation proposal to the collector or election officer in the district in which the panchayat lies. After this is done, the collectors will submit the proposals to the commission for further action. To prepare the proposal, EROs and AEROs are expected to utilise the draft electoral roll of the Goa legislative assembly published on November 1 to form panchayat wards at first instance. Thereafter, using the final published assembly electoral roll with qualifying date as January 1, 2022, voters will be assigned to wards, and wards, if required, will be reformed. State election commissioner, retired IAS officer W V Ramanamurthy, reviewed the work done by EROs so far, and guided them on the delimitation process. Recently, the high court had rapped the state government over the reservation of wards over the recently-held municipal elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/poll-panel-starts-delimitation-process-for-panchayat-wards/articleshow/88195135.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Two-laning through Chorla Ghat will damage ecology, say environmentalists||KERI: Concerns have been raised among environmentalists over the two-lane road planned on the Chorla Ghat route from Sakhali to Belagavi under the Bharatmala Pariyojana. The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has floated a tender for twolaning with/without paved shoulders on engineering procurement and construction basis. As per the tender, the route will pass through Machhe, Piranwadi, Navage, Kinaye, Kusamalli, Jamboti, Kalmani, Kankumbi, Poriem and Sakhali. Already, 75% of the four laning on the Belagavi-Khanapur section of NH 748 has been completed. A decade ago, when the plan for a four-lane road from Panaji to Belagavi was proposed via Chorla Ghat, environmentalists had filed a petition before the Karnataka High Court and a stay was granted to the road expansion and widening plans on the grounds that it would submerge the under damming Kalasa diversion pro- road would cost more than ject in Kankumbi and a new the actual cost thereby causing loss to public exchequer. Apprehensions were also raised by environmentalists that it would pose a serious threat to the area's forests, wildlife and ecology. However, now the NHAI has floated a tender for twolaning works with a proposed estimate of Rs 229.2 crore. As per the tender condition, the contractor has to complete the work within two years. Nyla Coelho, an environmentalist from Belagavi, told TOI, “Existing roads, if properly repaired, will cater to the needs of public and private transport. Under the guise of two laning, the NHAI has proposed expansion of the existing road, which will have serious implications on the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in Goa as well as the Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka. Already frequent incidents of landslides are taking place on existing roads thereby causing a lot of inconveniences in the area.” Presently, the decision of the Goa government to divert heavy traffic through this route has been responsible for causing traffic congestion and raising hurdles for wildlife crossing. Now a new threat will intensify loss of wildlife as well as manifold felling of trees, wildlifers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/two-laning-through-chorla-ghat-will-damage-ecology-greens/articleshow/88195140.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

She said that if the victim woman files a police complaint she should definitely get justice. Chodankar told reporters that if anyone has any proof regarding the sex scandal then they can also come forward and file a police complaint. “We also demand that the minister be sacked if there is a complaint filed by the victim.” Questioned as to whether the party is keen on giving tickets to women workers for the upcoming elections, Chodankar said that winnability will be an important factor in deciding the tickets. “The winnability criteria is very important and those women who have the winnability factor will definitely get justice and will get a ticket,” Chodankar, who was a BJP candidate for the 2007 polls, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sack-minister-only-if-victim-files-plaint/articleshow/88195147.cms||---

Fatji had complained in September 2019 that Shaikh, a New Delhi resident who was then staying at Benaulim, and Ravi Yadav of Thane, Maharashtra, enticed him into lending a vehicle to them for running a passenger transport business at a monthly payment of Rs 25,000. He stated that the accused paid him for a few months and later disappeared with the vehicle, and failed to clear dues amounting to nearly Rs 3 lakh as well. An offence of cheating and criminal breach of trust was registered against the accused under provisions of the Indian Penal Code. The accused evaded arrest by shifting his location since the day the offence was registered. On November 21 this year, police nabbed the accused at Benaulim and placed him under arrest. The court ordered his release upon furnishing his own personal bond of Rs 25,000 with one surety in the like amount. The accused was ordered to furnish permanent and temporary addresses along with mobile and telephone numbers, not to tamper with evidence, to report to the investigating officer every Monday till the end of the month, and thereafter as and when required for investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/delhi-man-gets-bail-in-duping-case/articleshow/88195166.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: SIT finishes initial report in over 50% mining leases||PANAJI: The special investigation team (SIT) probing the Rs 35,000-crore mining scam in the state has completed a preliminary report of over 50% of the mining leases. In all, it is probing alleged violations in 126 leases. The report consists of verification of documents of mining leases, whom the leases were allotted to and who was operating them, and whether valid environment clearances were obtained, among other details. Based on this report, a final decision pertaining to the investigation will be taken by the SIT. A senior crime branch officer said the preliminary report of over 60 mining leases has been completed following scrutiny of documents submitted by the mines department regarding environment clearances, dump-handling and fresh extractions. Based on the reports, police are expected to take necessary action. The SIT had filed 16 first information reports (FIRs) in the illegal mining case, of which eight have been chargesheeted, three have been closed, and three have been transferred to the police stations concerned. A senior police officer said three other cases have been quashed by the court. Incidentally, not much progress has been made in the investigation despite the SIT having probed the case for six-and-a-half years now. As part of its investigation into the Rs 35,000-crore scam, the senior officer said that the investigating team had sought answers from the mines department to 19 questions pertaining to leases that were operational from 2007 to 2012.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sit-finishes-initial-report-in-over-50-mining-leases/articleshow/88195175.cms||Murari Shetye

The company is currently engaged in consumer product segment (CP) (which includes appliances, fan and consumer lighting products) and engineering procurement and construction segment (EPC) (power transmission and power distribution and illumination projects). “Considering the varied nature and potential opportunities of each of the business segments and the need for a focused approach to unlock these opportunities, the board of directors of the company has decided that the company should undertake a comprehensive review of the existing corporate structure. This will encompass an evaluation of full range of options and alternatives (including demerger(s), subsidarisation(s), strategic partnerships,” the company has said. Accordingly to BEL, the board of directors has authorised the management to evaluate and recommend such options and alternatives, and subject to such detailed evaluation, consider housing the power transmission and power distribution business verticals as a standalone/independent legal entity. The review would include streamlining of the business structure to enhance market positions and deliver long-term growth. Attracting right talent and providing enhanced growth opportunities to existing talent in line with a sharper strategic focus on each business segment under separate entities and tailored capital structure and capital allocation policies based on business-specific dynamics. It has stated that the ompany intends to appoint various advisors/consultants to assist the board in evaluating the options. It is anticipated that the Board and advisors will complete their evaluation and consider the way forward as soon as practically possible. Shekhar Bajaj, CMD, said: “Over the past couple of years, the power transmission and power distribution business verticals, have sharpened their operational focus, ensuring project closures, increased cash flows, reduction in receivables and repayment of most of the debt, whilst simultaneously focusing on health and safety and ESG in general. We believe the time is now ripe to build further on this and review our structures to enable unconstrained business growth for each business segment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bajaj-electricals-to-review-its-corporate-structure/articleshow/88194532.cms||---

Phal Dessai said that Savitri being an “outsider” and considering the party leadership’s avowed stance against giving more than one ticket to a family, “the question of Savitri getting the ticket doesn’t arise”. He said that he has been associated with the party for a long period and that he has been entrusted with its organisational work in Sanguem. “If the party is happy with my leadership qualities, it will give me the ticket,” he said. “As regards Savitri, she doesn’t even have voting in Sanguem. What has she contributed to the party’s organisational work? My supporters are unfazed over that issue, as chief minister Pramod Sawant and general secretary Satish Dhond have repeatedly told us at party meetings and vistarak meetings that two tickets will not be given to one family, and that nobody from outside the constituency can stake claim for the ticket. However, if anybody from within the party organisation (apart from Savitri) is given the ticket, all of us will work unitedly for the party’s victory.” Phal Dessai also hit out at incumbent independent Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar for his failure to do development work in the constituency. “He has also failed to maintain a connection with the people. If anything, Gaonkar has only managed to take Sanguem backwards by five years,” he said. Phal Dessai further said that the Sanguem BJP mandal has intensified its campaign in the constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dy-cms-wife-an-outsider-cant-get-bjp-ticket/articleshow/88195172.cms||---

Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar welcomed advocate Hrudaynath Shirodkar and Mahesh Mhambrey into the Congress fold. The party’s working president Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco said that the joining of the two youth leaders will strengthen the party. Chodankar said that the two prominent youth leaders have taken the bold decision to join Congress even as they were given lucrative offers by two parties — one from Kolkata and the other from Delhi. They have joined Congress with the sole aim of defeating BJP, which they were associated with five years ago, he said. “Their joining Congress will encourage others who desire to see the defeat of BJP,” Chodankar said. Shirodkar said only Congress can offer a true alternative to BJP. Mhambrey said he worked for BJP for over 20 years but quit the party in 2015 after seeing the ‘U’ turns and misrule of the BJP government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/two-from-bbsm-join-congress/articleshow/88195191.cms||---

At present, deputy chief minister Manohar Ajgaonkar, who is from Margao, represents the constituency. “On the lines of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s concept of vocal for local, we request the BJP state unit to give us a local candidate for the 2022 assembly election.

For the long-term sustainability of the industry, tea prices must consistently remain materially higher than the cost of production,” the study added. According to Kaushik Das, vice president, ICRA, the bulk tea industry has to cope with continued rise in labour cost over the decade while prices of teas have largely remained flat owing to oversupply and paucity of quality leaves. “Increased production by small tea growers and uncontrolled rise in bought-leaf units have led to pressure on price of tea as export stayed in range. This has led to a decline in operating profitability of bulk tea players to 2% in FY 2020.” Assocham, too, is facilitating dialogues and partnerships to build a strong economic agenda for the tea industry, said Perminder Jeet Kaur, director (east), Assocham, adding that the industry body had taken a pivotal role in taking up the sector’s problems with Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal. “Educating customers of quality tea, rise in per capita domestic demand and exports to new geographies could be beneficial for the industry,” added Das. Manish Dalmia, chairman, Assocham Tea Sector Council, too, said that the immediate need is to increase the level of domestic consumption. The report said that FY2021 proved to be one of the best years of the Indian tea industry in recent times for the bulk tea industry fall in output.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/quality-scan-sustainable-output-key-for-tea-inc-report/articleshow/88194562.cms||---

---||Mumbai||4 subjects in one textbook for standard 1 in Maharashtra from 2022||PUNE: The state school education department will introduce a single textbook formula from 2022-23 to reduce the weight of school bags carried by Std 1 students every day. The system will be implemented for all primary classes later. The four subjects taught in Std 1-English, Marathi, Maths and Play and Learn-have been integrated into one textbook per semester. Instead of carrying each subject textbook separately, a student needs to carry only the integrated textbook, be it part 1, 2, 3 or 4, as per the semester. "At the moment, a Std 1 student, who is about 6 years old, carries in his/her bag at least 830gm in textbooks. Add to it the weight of a water bottle, tiffin and notebooks, and the weight goes beyond 1kg. But with this method, the weight of textbooks reduces to 210gm. On a pilot basis, the books have been introduced in 488 model schools, and the feedback has been good," said Vivek Gosavi, director of Balbharati (state bureau of textbook production and curriculum research). Gosavi said from the academic year 2022-23, the integrated bilingual textbook would be rolled out for Std I students in the entire state. "This will then be done for Std II and so on. We will also incorporate the changes as per the New Education Policy, whenever it is implemented. We have received excellent feedback from teachers using this textbook. The integrated activities are also loved by the students," he added. Rekha Varpalliwar, a zilla parishad school teacher from Chandrapur district, says this has been a great initiative, especially for children in remote areas, where schools are far and students have to walk long distances lugging heavy bags. "The weight of the bag has reduced. The activities mentioned in the book are also very helpful," she added. Manjeeri Khambe, another zilla parishad school teacher from Raigad, said each part of the book has a theme. "The first part is 'Me and My family', followed by water, animals and, finally, the fourth part is transport and people who help us. Currently, we are teaching the second part. The activities are very easy and do not require anything that is not already available. The book is written in a way that the students can do everything themselves. The focus is on increasing curiosity in them so they become life-long learners," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/4-subjects-in-one-textbook-for-standard-1-in-maharashtra-from-2022/articleshow/88196473.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Delhi||Delhi: Couple killed as dumper crushes car, child saved||NEW DELHI: In a grim tragedy that again underlined how Delhi's roads become death-traps at night, a couple lost their lives when a dumper overturned and crushed their i20 car near Hyatt Regency Hotel on Ring Road around midnight Wednesday. Their six-year-old daughter had a miraculous escape and was rescued by cops and firemen. Manish Sharma (37), a senior legal adviser at a private company, and his wife, Shipra (33), were returning home to Noida after visiting relatives in Bhiwani, Haryana. They had celebrated their eighth marriage anniversary on Tuesday. Police said the dumper was carrying gravel for the Central Vista project. Fatal crash: Dumper overturned trying to give way to another carThe dumper's driver, Arvind Yadav (25), was trying to give way to a speeding car when it accidentally rammed the divider. Such was the impact was that the dumper overturned and fell on the i20 car. The driver's cabin also caught fire. Yadav was arrested on Thursday evening. When the police responded to a call about a vehicle catching fire and reached the site - the carriageway for traffic going towards AIIMS from Dhaula - they found the family trapped in the car. DCP, South West district, Gaurav Sharma, was at the spot with his men and the fire brigade, too, arrived soon after but the heavy dumper could not be removed. "The couple's six-year old daughter, Mishika, was lying on the rear seat with her feet stuck," recalled Sharma. "Manish was completely crushed under the truck and could not be moved and his wife Shipra was also trapped. Their daughter was conscious and constantly asking for her mother. Since the rear side could be accessed with great difficulty, we tried to create space. We could not see the condition of her legs, but to ensure that her feet weren't crushed, we put some wooden logs inside". It took the police around one-and-a-half hours to rescue the child and around two-and-a-half hours to get the couple out. Meanwhile, the team also tried to remove the construction material to reduce load on the car. Later, the cops arranged for a hydraulic crane, stopping the traffic for a while. All three were shifted to AIIMS where the couple was pronounced dead while their daughter was treated for her injuries and later discharged. She has been handed over to her grandparents. A case for rash and negligent driving causing death has been registered against the driver. The family members of the couple said they received information about the accident around 3am after a person on the spot picked up the phone, apparently belonging to the Sharmas, and called the numbers listed there. Vivek Pathak, Manish's cousin, said: "I was shocked to see the condition of the car. It was completely damaged. We don't know what to tell their daughter. Manish was a well-read guy and fond of books, a very bright person. The police must investigate what caused the dumper to overturn."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-couple-killed-as-dumper-crushes-car-child-saved/articleshow/88196521.cms||---

However, following the crash of an Indian Air Force Mi-17v5 helicopter, the village witnessed a sudden surge in movement of local administration, media and other scores of people. The sole survivor of the crash, Group Captain Varun Singh hails from here and is fighting for his life at the Air Force command hospital of Bengaluru. Elder of the two siblings, the ace test pilot Varun visited Kanhauli nearly five months ago for a family function. Following the news of his helicopter crash, villagers have organised prayers and chanting hymns and holy verses for his speedy recovery. On Thursday, Varun was brought via road to Sulur from Wellington military hospital and then airlifted to Bengaluru command hospital. Special prayers for Group Captain Singh’s recoverySpeaking to TOI over the phone, his eldest uncle Dinesh Pratap Singh said, "Varun is a fighter by nature, death won't come near to him. After dodging death during a test sortie of LCA Tejas last year in October, he came to the village this July to attend his cousin Deepanshi's wedding. He had no sign of stress or fear but was lively and humble. Such men are made of steel." "His father Colonel (retired) Krishan Pratap Singh, mother Uma Singh, younger brother Lieutenant Commander (navy) Tanuj Singh, wife Geetanjali and two children have reached Bengaluru. We are told that his condition is stable," added Dinesh. Group Captain Varun Singh was on board the ill-fated helicopter as he was the liaison officer for the visit of CDS General Bipin Rawat to the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington. He's currently posted as an instructor there. Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh who is the youngest uncle of Varun told TOI: "We are saddened by the helicopter crash but have not given up. We are praying for Varun's recovery. CM Yogi Adityanath has also conveyed to provide every possible support in our difficult time." On Thursday, district magistrate Ashutosh Niranjan and superintendent of police Shri Pati Mishra reached Varun's ancestral home and conveyed CM Yogi Adityanath's message. "CM Yogi Adityanath asked us to visit the family and convey that the entire state is standing behind the family and we pray for speedy recovery of Group Captain Varun Singh," said Deoria DM. It's worth noting that, Varun was among the top ten candidates for Gaganyaan Mission as astronaut. "He was among the top ten for the space mission program, but couldn't make into the top four. I don't know the procedure about the selection for astronaut, but I wish after Varun is recovered completely he may become astronaut to touch new heights of glory," added Dinesh Pratap Singh, the eldest uncle of pilot. Varun joined defence services after he got selected in NDA in 2004. He is a test pilot with the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Squadron in IAF in Bengaluru and was appointed the Wing Commander on June 19, 2017 before being recently promoted to IAF Group Captain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/east-uttar-pradesh-village-soars-high-on-hope-for-its-fighters-safety/articleshow/88196548.cms||Arvind Chauhan

SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal immediately appointed Chhotepur as senior vice-president of the party and announced his candidature from Batala segment for the upcoming assembly polls. Chhotepur had initially joined the SAD and remained cabinet minister in the Surjit Singh Barnala government. However, he had quit the cabinet in protest against the police entry into Harmandar Sahib in 1986. Later, in 2002, he had contested the assembly elections from Dhariwal constituency as an independent candidate and defeated Sucha Singh Langah of the SAD. In 2012, he lost to Congress candidate Charanjit Kaur Bajwa from Quadian assembly segment as an independent candidate. After joining the AAP, he had unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha elections from Gurdaspur in 2014. But the AAP had sacked Chhotepur from the post of party convenor in Punjab in August 2016 on charges of corruption. There were allegations against him of accepting money from ticket aspirants for the 2017 assembly polls. Welcoming Chhotepur back in the party, the SAD president said his return to the Akali fold symbolised the strengthening of the Panthic forces and the sentiment of peace and communal harmony in Punjab. Chhotepur said the Congress, the BJP and the AAP want to create divisions, hatred and misunderstandings not only between two brotherly communities, Hindus and Sikhs, but even by engineering a civil war within the Sikh quom in Punjab. He also slammed AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal, saying he was only interested in becoming the chief minister himself. Chhotepur said all money collected from NRIs abroad had been deposited into accounts in Delhi and that an ED inquiry should be conducted into how these funds had been embezzled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ex-aap-punjab-convener-chhotepur-joins-sad-to-contest-from-batala/articleshow/88195039.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Stop squabbles and work together, Didi tells Nadia TMC leadership||Krishnanagar (Nadia): Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday sternly asked the party’s Nadia leadership to bury the hatchet and “work together”. Banerjee told Krishnanagar municipality administrator Naresh Das at an administrative meeting that elections to the municipality will be held soon. “I want you all to work together,” she said. The CM then turned to TMC’s Krishnanagar MP and said: “Mahua, I want to send out a message from this meeting. I don’t want to know who all are for, or against whom. The politics of staging made-up protests with some people and feeding news to the media or social media may work for some time but not for ever. It is also not acceptable that one person remains in the same position forever. When there is a vote, the party will decide whom to field. No dissent will be tolerated. Everyone has to work together.” The immediate trigger to Banerjee’s statements appeared to an incident weeks ago when some women protested over distribution of rural houses under Prime Minister Awas Yojana at Krishnanagar Post Office More, heaping allegations against newly appointed TMC Krishnanagar (North) organisational president Jayanta Saha. Mahua Moitra, the Krishnanagar Lok Sabha MP, was dropped as party Nadia president during the organizational shuffle on August 16. She has been appointed the TMC in-charge in Goa, the first state beyond Bengal where the party will contest the assembly polls in February. “I have knowledge about the entire incident. Who is Jayanta? Why did it happen?” the CM said. Saha said that it was an act of “sabotage”. Banerjee endorsed the view. “I have cross-checked with the ADG (law and order) and CID. It was a made-up protest. I also know who was behind it,” she said. The CM then asked Moitra if she had something to say. The Trinamool MP remained silent. “The CM’s remark validated my claim that there was a conspiracy. But we will work together as the CM wanted us,” Saha said later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stop-squabbles-and-work-together-didi-tells-nadia-tmc-leadership/articleshow/88195299.cms||Ashis Poddar
---||Kolkata||Cabinet gives nod for cycle factory to aid Sabuj Sathi||Kolkata: The state cabinet on Thursday gave its nod for setting up of a bicycle factory so that students from Class IX-XII could be provided transportation under the Sabuj Sathi scheme. The Bengal government has already distributed around 1 crore free bicycles under Sabuj Sathi and plans to give out 20 lakh more. The factory got a go-ahead as a large number of bicycles are now required every year. The state had asked for expression of interest from bicycle companies a month ago and got many positive responses. The government is likely to buy back 50% of the vehicles manufactured in the unit. The factory will also get several exemptions as it will help generate employment. Bengal will now look to finalise the project through a tender. During the meeting, CM Mamata Banerjee asked ministers from Kolkata and adjoining areas to concentrate on the KMC poll campaign, as no one would be coming from outside the state. She asked the ministers to stay in their constituencies during Christmas and supervise law and order. Approval was also given for the creation of 486 posts, most of which will be at the panchayat level. Banerjee had launched the Sabuj Sathi scheme in 2015. It was awarded by the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), out of 800 global projects, in September 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cabinet-gives-nod-for-cycle-factory-to-aid-sabuj-sathi/articleshow/88195267.cms||---

Jaiswal was made the Howrah mayor in 2008 by CPM. Speaking to TOI, Jaiswal said, “I still believe in Leftist ideology of pro-people work and struggle. But I see CPM, both in Bengal and Howrah, has deviated from this. They have lost people’s trust. On the other hand, CM Banerjee has started several developmental schemes, which are helping people in all spheres. While CPM has failed to fight back this rabid communal politics by BJP, CM Banerjee has upheld the country’s secular fabric and is taking the fight for a secular opposition at the national level. I have therefore joined TMC.” CPM didn’t attach much significance to this. The party’s Howrah district secretary, Biplab Majumdar, said: “She is not even a party member now. For a long time, Mamata Jaiswal has no links with the party. So, what she says or where she goes has no relevance to the party.” State minister and TMC’s Howrah president Arup Ray said, “Mamata Jaiswal had approached the party some time back. After weighing all aspects, we have decided to take her in the party.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/howrah-ex-mayor-mamata-jaiswal-joins-trinamool/articleshow/88195317.cms||Rupak Banerjee
