As the threat of the Omicron variant looms and clusters spike in the state, public spaces and events are allowing only those people who have had both doses of vaccination after temperature checks. Malls turn extra vigilantSince malls are a big draw for crowds, they have been among the first to ensure that they do not allow any breaches. A regional manager of a chain of malls shares, "It starts right from the parking lot and the vehicle checks, where people are reminded of the same. All entry points of the malls have people being checked for their vaccination certificate and temperature. This is to ensure that the smart ones, who think they can slip in, are filtered out. It is important to prevent any further waves and ensure everyone is safe. People have been cooperative." Basavaraju S, a driver who was spotted near a mall in Rajajinagar, told us, "I have had only one dose of vaccination, so I was allowed entry only till the parking lot after a temperature check. The people who employ me had work in the mall." People have tried using others’ certificatesSavitha, who works as a security guard at a city mall, says that they have had instances where people have tried entering using certificates of others, especially in groups. "We have ensured that we take a couple of extra seconds to see the name and age, to ensure there is no repetition or suspicion. We have had instances where we have had a bunch of people using the same certificates trying to enter, which led to us taking more precautions," she points out. Single dose? No entry in cinema hallsThe manager at INOX cinemas, Bengaluru, reveals, "We only issue tickets for people who have a certificate that says they are fully vaccinated. Even portals that allow booking have a pop up that reminds people about this mandate. We have sent back people with just a single dose of vaccination. Since those under 18 don't need vaccination as yet, they are being allowed inside." Clout won’t work at concerts, eventsThe recently held India Cocktail Week was one of the first public events after the scare. A security guard there shared, "We have mandates from the authorities to ensure only people with two doses of vaccination be allowed. There were many who tried to throw some clout and enter without a certificate. We politely denied them entry." Tips to ensure a quick, seamless entry in the mall- Ensure you have a copy of your vaccination certificate handy on your phone - Keep a copy of your government authorised ID proof, just in case - Ensure you have your mask on - Cooperate during temperature checks||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/catch-a-movie-go-mall-hopping-but-you-need-to-be-double-vaxxed/articleshow/88209390.cms||Sunayana Suresh

Terming such arrests as sheer violations of human rights, BKU Ekta Ugrahan used the last session of the farm protest in raising voice for the activists arrested under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in Bhima Koregaon Elgar Parishad case and Delhi riots cases. The farm outfit demanded that as the central government has repealed the farm laws, it should also make way for release of such people who are lodged in jails for long. The protesters waved photos of arrested Gautam Navlakha, Roma Wilson, Varvara Rao, Surendra Gadling, Soma Sen, Sudha Bhardwaj (who recently got bail) and Stan Swami (who died on July 5). The outfit president, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, said that the central government continued to crush the opposition voices. “Many intellectuals have been put behind bars for raising voices in favour of the rights of the people. The government is scaring people by laws like AFSPA. The massacre in Nagaland has unmasked the face of the government.” Last year too, BKU Ugrahan had observed the day on December 10 amid the farm protests, saying the violations of human rights are on the rise in the country for the last many years. The farm outfit had to face flak from the government as they were branded Naxalites and Maoist sympathisers. Even other protesting farmer groups had distanced themselves from BKU Ugrahan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/day-before-ending-yearlong-farm-protest-bku-ugrahan-demand-release-of-jailed-activists-on-human-rights-day/articleshow/88214215.cms||Neel Kamal

Vishal Garg, the 43-year-old CEO of mortgage finance company Better.com attracted worldwide infamy for the mass sacking of nearly 10% of the company's workforce last week. On Thursday, Better.com's Board of Directors said Vishal will be "taking time off effective immediately" while revealing it has engaged an independent 3rd party firm "to do a leadership and cultural assessment". "The recommendations of this assessment will be taken into account to build a long-term sustainable and positive culture at Better. We have much work to do and we hope that everyone can refocus on our customers and support each other to continue to build a great company and a company we can be proud of," the board said in an email first reported on Vice.com The board said during this interim period CFO Kevin Ryan will be managing the day-to-day decisions of the company and reporting to the board. Garg faced workplace outrage across America last week not only for the peremptory manner, in which he fired 900 employees over Zoom during the holiday season, but also for the language he used, including accusing staff of stealing. "You guys know that at least 250 of the people terminated were working an average of 2 hours a day while clocking 8 hours+ a day in the payroll system? They were stealing from you and stealing from our customers who pay the bills that pay our bills. Get educated," he wrote on the professional network Blind. Garg later expressed some remorse in a follow-up message posted on Better.com. "I want to apologize for the way I handled the layoffs last week. I failed to show the appropriate amount of respect and appreciation for the individuals who were affected and for their contributions to Better. I own the decision to do the layoffs, but in communicating it I blundered the execution. In doing so, I embarrassed you," he said. "I realise that the way I communicated this news made a difficult situation worse. I am deeply sorry and am committed to learning from this situation and doing more to be the leader that you expect me to be," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/indian-american-ceo-who-caused-outrage-firing-900-employees-over-zoom-eased-out/articleshow/88214304.cms||Chidanand Rajghatta

It wasn't much: The official measurement at the Denver International Airport was three-tenths of an inch (7.6 mm), according to Jim Kalina, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boulder.  Before Friday, the Mile High City's latest first snow was on November 21, 1934.  Kalina said the Denver metro region is experiencing extended La Nina weather patterns, which tend to produce drier weather. And much of the US West is experiencing a megadrought that studies link to human-caused climate change.  Climate scientists and meteorologists warn that the prolonged drought and lack of snow could threaten water supply and agriculture.  In Utah, where Salt Lake City went snowless through November for only the second time since 1976, the first snowstorm hit this week to ensure the city didn't match the record for the latest snowfall on record. That was set twice on Christmas Day in 1939 and 1943.  As the winter storms start dumping snow, states may see the effects of a lack of snowplow drivers due to the nationwide labour shortage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/denver-sees-first-snowfall-after-breaking-87-year-old-record/articleshow/88214521.cms||---

Headed by the secretary, social welfare department, the seven-member committee is to deal with adoption and related matters in the Jammu & Kashmir under the guidance of the Central Adoption Resource Agency constituted in terms of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. It has been also tasked to function as the executive arm of the Jammu and Kashmir government for promotion, facilitation, monitoring and regulation of the adoption programme in the Jammu and Kashmir. J&K administration was prompted to take such measures for the safeguard of the recently rendered Covid orphans when reports of “sale” of such children surfaced at different social media platforms and also in a section of media. Two persons from Srinagar and Pulwama districts were arrested for making deals with the several persons from other parts of the country for selling orphans.

In an audio message, Mufti Noor said that his fighters reserve the right to resume attacks wherever they are after Thursday midnight since the TTP has not heard back from the mediators or the Pakistani government. The month-long ceasefire had come into effect on November 9. Announcing an end to the ceasefire on Thursday night, the TTP in a statement blamed the Pakistan government for reneging on its promises made to the terror group in the initial stages of consultations in Afghanistan. It said the Pakistani authorities had not released their 102 prisoners. According to the statement, the initial agreement had guaranteed that the released prisoners would be handed over to the TTP through the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan on November 1. The TTP further stated that both sides had agreed to initiate formal talks and will finalise five names of negotiators from each side. While the TTP said it had formed a five-member committee, the Pakistani government had not appointed a negotiating team to conduct talks. The group also said that security forces had carried out raids in many parts of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing and detaining a number of militants while the ceasefire was in place. “Under these circumstances, it is not possible to extend the ceasefire,” the TTP statement said. Pakistan’s talks with the TTP were deemed to fail since some of the demands of the outfit, like implementation of Shariah and the demerger of the volatile tribal districts, were not possible for Islamabad to meet. The tribal districts were merged into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through a constitutional amendment in May 2018. Since 2007, the TTP has carried out some of the deadliest attacks on Pakistani soil, targeting political leaders, civilians and security forces in suicide bombings, IED attacks and targeted killings. In 2014, the group claimed responsibility for attack on Army Public School in Peshawar, killing about 150 people, including 132 schoolchildren. The number of TTP attacks had significantly dropped after Pakistan launched a military operation in 2014, pushing the group out of its erstwhile stronghold of the North Waziristan tribal district. Sporadic attacks, however, continued to take place. After the Afghan Taliban took over control of Afghanistan in mid-August, the TTP had intensified their attacks, targeting civilians and security forces, prompting the authorities in Islamabad to demand from Kabul not to allow its soil for terrorist attacks on Pakistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/ttp-chief-asks-his-fighters-to-resume-attacks/articleshow/88214601.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The evacuees are now in secure accommodation in Islamabad waiting to be resettled in a third country. The sisters, one of whom lives in Gibraltar and the other in India, felt a deep connection with the plight of the Afghan refugees as their late mother had fled Pakistan for India during Partition. They paid more than half of the £300,000 (Rs 3 crore) to help evacuate the group to honour her. Funds for the mission also came from other private individuals. In an evacuation dubbed "Operation Magic Carpet", the 92 evacuees — including 30 women, 32 children and six pets — were transported across land from Kabul to Islamabad using the services of American-Israeli rescue specialist Moti Kahana. They stayed in safe houses for different periods of time until it was safe to cross the border at different times and places before being met by Kahana’s team in Pakistan. "We are lobbying a number of countries to see who can take them," said British animal welfare campaigner Dominic Dyer, who played a leading role in the operation. Thirteen of the evacuees are vets who had been working for animal welfare charity Mayhew in Kabul, of which Meghan Markle is the patron. In addition to 60 former Mayhew staff and dependants, the group involved 32 business executives, former security specialists and their families. A 90-year-old woman was part of the group and a baby girl was born during the evacuation. "The pets are all alive and well and provided unconditional support to the families throughout the ordeal," Dyer said. A spokesperson for Mayhew Afghanistan, which carries out a rabies and neutering programme for strays in Kabul, said: "Some of Mayhew’s staff took the decision to leave the country, but we have fully supported all our employees throughout this time and their safety has been our priority. Mayhew’s mission is to deliver animal welfare programmes where they are needed most, regardless of the challenges. Mayhew was able to resume its programmes in Kabul in September."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/indian-sisters-pay-rs-1-5crore-to-help-92-people-pets-flee-afghanistan/articleshow/88214634.cms||NAOMI CANTON

These auspicious days mark the return of the city’s big fat wedding season and have spelt good news for the wedding industry. However, with so many weddings and few resources at hand, those getting married in Gurgaon this wedding season are realising they need to ‘import’ a lot of things from neighbouring cities, chiefly bandwallahs. We are double-booked for most days in December: BandwallahsElaborate baraat processions had been curtailed over the last eighteen months or so due to the rules put in place by the administration in light of the pandemic. Those restrictions have been lifted now, and the baraats are back – complete with band and baaja. But this means overbooking of the bandwallahs in this busy wedding season. “We are double-booked for most days in December. On busy days, we even have three bookings a day. Anything more becomes impractical. But we have queries for as many as five weddings on some days. We have to turn away a few as a result,” says a wedding band operator from Gurgaon. 'Delhi’s bandwallahs can charge you almost 50% more than Gurgaon’s'Many Gurugrammers chose to wait for clarity in rules, and did not start booking bands until very late, and they realised all of them were pre-booked. Nikhil Sharma, whose brother is getting married at the end of this month, tells us, “We only started looking at bands and ghodi late last month because we were uncertain of the rules in place. But we soon realised, neither were available. Some told us they can get bands from Pataudi or Manesar for an extra charge. In the end, we turned to Delhi.” But getting a band from Delhi for your Gurgaon wedding isn’t easy or cheap. Bands charge extra to travel, particularly in the busy wedding season. “The situation in Delhi is same, but for some extra money, one can still get bandwallahs to come to Gurgaon. They can charge you almost 50% more but many people are willing to pay to have that grand wedding,” says Manoj, who operates a wedding band in Gurgaon. Bandwallahs in the southern part of the capital say that almost 15-20% of all their queries and bookings these days are from the Millennium City. However, many people had put their weddings on hold till things became ‘normal’ and they do not want to compromise on anything, even if it means paying larger sums for the band. Akarsh Raj, Gurgaon’s South City resident who is getting married next week, tells us, “We have only had low-key moderate weddings in the family for the last 18 months due to the pandemic, but I want mine to be ‘normal’ if rules are allowing. Hence, spending a few grands extra is not that big a deal. Shaadi mein toh kharcha hota hi hai.” Read AlsoAn evening for vintage car lovers in GurgaonA recent event in Gurgaon saw some vintage cars lined up, and among those marvelling at them were members of royal families and diplomats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-weddings-importing-band-baaja-from-delhi/articleshow/88211791.cms||Abhimanyu Mathur
---||India||32 Omicron cases in 5 states, all have mild symptoms: Govt||NEW DELHI: A total of 32 Covid-19 cases of the Omicron variant have been detected from five states so far, accounting for less than 0.04% of the total variants detected, and the patients have so far reported mild symptoms. While the health ministry had received reports of 25 cases, seven more cases were reported from Maharashtra later in the evening on Friday. While Maharashtra (17) and Rajasthan (9) have reported the maximum number of Omicron cases so far, Gujarat has three, Karnataka two and Delhi has one such case. “All detected cases have mild symptoms,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the Union health ministry, said while underlining the need to maintain increased compliance of public health measures and ramp up coverage of full vaccination. The government said Delta continues to be the dominant variant even in places where clusters of cases have been found. However, the government is watching the trend and will be able to draw an assessment only after mid-December, given the manifestation time of the virus, officials said. "Clinically, Omicron is yet not posing a burden on the healthcare system. However, vigil has to be maintained," Indian Council of Medical Research director general Balram Bhargava said on Friday. The Centre underlined that cases are increasing even in countries with high vaccination and the World Health Organisation has warned against relaxations in public health measures as that is leading to rise in cases in many countries. Bhargava said districts with more than 5% positivity must implement restrictions and public health measures stringently. Currently, eight districts across Mizoram (5), Kerala (2) and Sikkim (1) have more than 10% Covid-19 positivity, whereas 19 districts spanning across seven states and UTs have positivity in the range of 5-10%. This includes Kerala (8), Mizoram (5), Manipur (2) and one each in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, West Bengal and Puducherry. "Regular meetings are being organised to keep a watch on the global scenario and regular meetings are being organised to also keep a vigil on the Covid scene in India, with a focus on Omicron," Bhargava said, underlining that there is no need to panic but people must comply with Covid-appropriate behaviour as earlier and get vaccinated. The cabinet secretary will hold a review meeting on Saturday to take stock of the Covid-19 situation across the country and preparedness to tackle and possible rise due to the new variant. The government also urged states and UTs to increase testing and surveillance to ensure cases are detected, isolated and treated in time. "Districts and states must ramp up testing as appropriate and scientific evidence for diagnostics and treatment are being reviewed regularly and treatment remains unchanged at the moment," Bhargava said. A total of 8,503 cases were reported from across the country on Thursday. Currently, there are 94,943 active cases across the country, of which 54% are in Kerala and Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/32-omicron-cases-in-5-states-all-have-mild-symptoms-govt/articleshow/88214871.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Goa||Enduring worst starts, FC Goa and Bengaluru hope to change script||Panaji: Let’s look at some numbers ahead of FC Goa’s clash against Bengaluru FC at the GMC Athletic stadium in Bambolim on Saturday. Goa lead the league in terms of number of passes per game – 543 to be precise – while Bengaluru are second with 460. Nobody comes close to their pass accuracy of 85%. Except for Hyderabad (93), Goa are ahead with 90 attacks, while Bengaluru are next with 88. These numbers are encouraging, but what matters most are the points and goals, where both teams have struggled this season. Goa lost three in a row before their win against SC East Bengal. Bengaluru, on the other hand, started with a win but have lost three of their last four games. “If you watch the games, you can tell that the results are crazy,” said Goa coach Juan Ferrando, whose team – preseason favourites – are placed tenth, one spot below their Saturday rivals. “In this league, nobody is a favourite. The games are crazy with scores like 6-4, 4-3. The most important thing is to keep our focus. The players are working hard.” Ferrando took everyone by surprise in the last game with a three-man defence, something that the club has not seen during the Spanish era, kickstarted by Sergio Lobera in 2017. It’s also true that Goa have not seen such a run of results since the legendary Zico ended his campaign here at the bottom of the pool. “We still have to work on some details. In our style, the most important part is the press. When the press is not good, we have some problems in coordination. Then it adds to the (pressure on) defence,” said Ferrando. Goa have conceded 11 goals in four games and, quite unusually, scored just six, which includes four in the last game. Spanish striker Airam Cabrera has missed the last two games with injuries but has now recovered. He will be part of the squad against Bengaluru, providing Ferrando with options, possibly from the bench. Goa do not have many fond memories of playing Bengaluru, who they defeated just twice in nine meetings. They have never kept a clean sheet either. Goa’s last win came late last season when the former champions were already out of contention, and now they are left with plenty of work to do. “The energy in the team is positive, but it doesn’t help that we are not getting the results,” said Bengaluru coach Marco Pezzaiuoli. “The most important thing is the three points. We are investing a lot to get there. Playing games every three days has not been easy, but we are managing the situation as best as we can.” Bengaluru played their last game with just three foreign players but Yrondu Musavu-King, Iman Basafa and Prince Ibara are now available after missing out on the Blues’ clash against Hyderabad FC. Bengaluru are enduring a worst start of the season after five matches. They have picked up just four points, the fewest they have managed at this stage of the season. Goa too have had their worst start since 2016 when they finished at the bottom. For clubs that have set the bar high, they’ll want to change that, soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/enduring-worst-starts-fc-goa-and-bengaluru-hope-to-change-script/articleshow/88214991.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant directed the Commission for Management of Air Quality over NCR and Adjoining Regions to consult NCR states - Delhi, UP, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab - while deciding scores of applications by industries for restarting activities and pleas by builders and hospitals for resumption of construction activities as well as take decisions for reopening of schools. Declining to take up Delhi government's plea for resumption of construction activities at 21 hospitals and asking it to approach the Commission, which has been asked to decide on these applications within a week, CJI Ramana-led bench said, "We will keep the matter pending for finding some long term solution to the perennial pollution problem that affects Delhiites and residents of NCR as well as adjoining areas." The bench said, "If the state and central governments had taken required steps and strictly implemented the anti-pollution norms before our shouting, we would not have been forced to pass orders. Now to say everything is permitted would be going back to square one. We are not talking about any hospital construction or industry. The Commission knows what is going on and it will pass necessary orders for relaxation of norms." The sedate proceedings were not without its share of lighter moments. When petitioner Aditya Dubey's counsel Vikas Singh, who had made a surprise appearance for Builders' Association to seek resumption of construction activities, said that the air quality has become better as the critical pollution period is over, the SC ticked him off for appearing on one hand for the petitioners seeking anti-pollution measures and on the other seeking resumption of construction activities which contribute to dust pollution. "However, the Supreme Court must ensure that long term measures are taken," Singh requested. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta asked, "On whose behalf Singh is saying air quality has become better - the petitioners or builders?" The bench had a hearty laugh over this lighter vein comment. On Payment of minimum wages to construction workers during the period when building work was stopped to reduce pollution, the bench sought compliance affidavits from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan after the workers' body alleged that these two states have not paid the workers from the Construction Workers' Welfare Fund. Mehta informed the court that "the Expert Group constituted by the Commission, having domain knowledge and data in the field of meteorological conditions impacting air quality, statistical modelling besides historical scientific data on air quality related parameters in Delhi-NCR along with IITM and IMD are in the process of finalising an air quality forecast model in terms of the Air Quality Index (AQI), using WRF-Chem Forecasting model". "The model takes into account local/non-local, natural and anthropogenic sources from emission inventories over Delhi-NCR developed by TERI and MoES. The air quality forecast model is coupled with all the meteorological parameters such as wind speed & direction, humidity etc at surface and at different vertical levels. The model is envisaged to provide a 7-day forecast and outlook for subsequent 3 days ( total 10-days) based on predominant surface wind direction, wind speed, mixing layer height, ventilation index etc," the Commission said in its affidavit. "The system would also be able to predict 7-day air mass inflow and outflow of Delhi which would in turn help in planning suitable actions that can be taken in advance to curtail any adverse air quality scenario," it said. The Commission said, "Evaluation of performance of available statistical models for forecasting air quality is likely to be completed by December 15. A new statistical model trained on past air quality and meteorological data is also under development for forecasting the air quality for next few days. The Expert Group is progressing well on the tasks assigned to them, as per the Terms of Reference, and is expected to submit its report soon for further consideration by the Commission."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-steps-back-asks-panel-to-decide-on-easing-anti-pollution-curbs/articleshow/88215215.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The House of Representatives Select Committee issued subpoenas to Brian Jack, who was Trump's White House political director; Max Miller, a former special assistant to Trump now running for a House seat in Ohio with Trump's endorsement; and Bobby Peede, former director of the White House advance staff, which prepared events for Trump's arrival.  House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy later hired Jack to lead his congressional political operation.  "Some of the witnesses we subpoenaed today apparently worked to stage the rallies on Jan. 5th and 6th, and some appeared to have had direct communication with the former president regarding the rally at the Ellipse directly preceding the attack on the US Capitol," Representative Bennie Thompson, the committee's chairman, said in a statement.  The committee also issued subpoenas to Brian Lewis, a Trump supporter and former executive at Fox News; Ed Martin, a prominent figure in Missouri Republican politics who backed Trump's campaign, and Kim Fletcher, who runs a pro-Trump organisation called Moms for America that organised a rally near the Capitol on Jan. 5.

The final rites of Gen Rawat’s defence adviser Brigadier LS Lidder, who was also among the 13 killed in the Mi-17 V5 helicopter chopper crash near Coonoor on Wednesday, were also conducted at the same cremation ground in Delhi Cantonment earlier in the day. Displaying a stoic demeanour, Gen Rawat’s daughters Kritika and Tarini lit the pyre on which their parents were laid side by side after the evocative ‘Last Post and the Rouse’ was played by tri-service buglers with full military honours and 800 military personnel in attendance. Defence minister Rajnath Singh, chiefs of the Army, Navy and IAF, along with politicians, officers and veterans as well as diplomats, defence attaches and military commanders from Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh were present for the final send-off of India’s first-ever CDS. Brig Lidder’s wife Geetika and 17-year-old daughter Aashna embodied the characteristic military ethos to bear loss with fortitude as they bid farewell to the officer. “We must give him a good farewell, a smiling send-off. I am a soldier’s wife. It’s a big loss,” said Geetika. Aashna, who lit the pyre, said, “My father was a hero, my best friend. Maybe it was destined and better things will come our way. He was my biggest motivator.” Earlier in the day, hundreds of mourners visited Gen Rawat’s official residence, where he and his wife were laid in state to allow family, friends, colleagues and the public to pay their final respects. Politicians cutting across party lines, from Union ministers Amit Shah, S Jaishankar and Nirmala Sitharaman and chief ministers Yogi Adityanath, PS Dhami and Arvind Kejriwal, to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, AK Antony, Mallikarjun Kharge and Harish Singh Rawat paid tribute to Gen Rawat at his residence. Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, national security adviser Ajit Doval, French ambassador Emmanuel Lenain and British high commissioner Alex Ellis were among others to offer their condolences. With six three-star generals from the Army, Navy and IAF acting as the pallbearers, the mortal remains of Gen Rawat and his wife were then taken to the crematorium in a ceremonial gun carriage decked with flowers. While 99 personnel from the three services and a combined band of 33 formed the front escort, another 99 military personnel acted as the rear escort. Scores of people from all walks of life also marched with the cavalcade for the final journey, with some chanting, “ Jab tak suraj chaand rahega, Bipinji ka naam rahega!”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tears-salutes-brave-smiles-as-families-bid-final-farewell/articleshow/88215304.cms||---
---||Goa||Despite losses, FC Goa have not lost confidence: Aberto Noguera||Panaji: When was the last time a midfielder scored two goals for FC Goa in the Indian Super League (ISL)? That happened 28 games ago when Hugo Boumous scored twice in the 5-0 demolition of Jamshedpur FC in the last league clash of the 2019-20 season. Against SC East Bengal early this week, Alberto Noguera scored twice. His goals helped Goa register their first win in the Indian Super League (ISL) this season after three consecutive losses, and not surprisingly, changed the mood within the dressing room. “I am always happy to help the team,” Noguera said on Thursday. “I am here for that, to help the team. I am happy because we won, that’s it.” The Spanish midfielder has now scored more goals in four games than he did the entire 2020-21 season when he made his debut for the club and won the league award for the most assists. Noguera has created more chances from open play than any other player and believes it’s not just the responsibility of the forwards to score goals. “We have to help the team score more goals. It doesn’t matter where you are playing. In the last match (against East Bengal), I scored two, but it doesn’t matter (who scored). We have to attack together and work as a team.” Noguera arrived early for pre-season and helped Goa win the Durand Cup where he played a significant role. In the ISL, the team has not had the best of starts, but confidence is not in short supply. “The team is always full of confidence, always looking for victories. The mood has remained the same, always confident. We are trying harder everyday. We have to keep going, have to keep accumulating points from the games we play,” said Noguera. Noguera started many games on the bench last season but has been handed starts in all four games this season by coach Juan Ferrando. Only Ivan Gonzalez has had that privilege among foreign players, with captain Edu Bedia, Jorge Ortiz, Airam Cabrera and Dylan Fox all starting at least one game on the bench.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/despite-losses-fc-goa-have-not-lost-confidence-aberto-noguera/articleshow/88215333.cms||---

At the same time, he added, an “amicable solution” needs to be found. In the city to chair a meeting of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, on a day when right-wing outfits were out in numbers to stop namaz congregations at multiple sites, the CM said, “ Ye namaz padhne ki prathayein jo khule mein hui hai, ye katayi bhi sahan nahi ki jayegi. Lekin isme se saath baith kar ke amicable solution nikala jayega (the custom of reading namaz in the open will not be tolerated but an amicable solution will be found through discussions).” Speaking to journalists at the PWD Rest House, Khattar said police as well as the Gurgaon administration had been told that “this issue needs to be resolved”. “In their own space, someone reads the namaz, someone does paath, someone does puja, we have no problem with that. Religious places are made for this reason, so that people go there and do all these things, such programmes cannot happen in the open (public spaces),” the CM said. Referring to the talks in 2018 after which namaz sites were designated by a government committee, he said some decisions had been made in the past but have been retracted now. “The matter will be discussed anew,” he said. The CM’s remarks come just two days after an outfit formed by some Muslim residents of the city – Gurgaon Muslim Council – along with members of the civil society described the ongoing protests as a threat to the city’s social fabric and part of a larger design to make minorities “invisible”. It’s not the first time, though, that the CM has expressed his opinion on this subject. During similar protests in 2018, he had said namaz should be read in mosques, idgahs or private spaces. On Friday, Khattar said several individuals from the Muslim community had informed authorities about land available with them and sought permission to read namaz there. He said there is land as well that belongs to private individuals or the Waqf Board, which is encroached, and the administration is exploring “how that can be made available to them”. The CM emphasised no “conflict” will be allowed on the issue. “We will not let conflict happen under any circumstances. Nobody should interfere in anybody else’s rights, but nobody will be allowed to force their way,” he said. Protests have, however, been organised every Friday for the last couple of months, leading to heavy police deployment around namaz sites. Protesters have been detained twice. In the meantime, bhajan recitals, havans and a puja have been performed at designated namaz sites to stop Friday prayers. While right-wing outfits have led the protests, some local residents have also joined in. Recently, outfits involved in talks to re-designate namaz sites – including a Muslim group, MRM – released a list of six spots where Friday prayers would be allowed. The Gurgaon Muslim Council rejected the list, alleging a conspiracy and pointing out that MRM (Muslim Rashtriya Manch) had allegiance to the RSS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/namaz-in-open-wont-be-tolerated-khattar/articleshow/88215604.cms||Sakshi Dayal

Among the evacuees, who arrived here on Friday, were three infants and even though they did not have passports, the government facilitated their entry. TOI had reported in August about the Indian government facilitating entry of four-month-old Iknoor Singh who did not have a passport when emergency evacuations were carried out through C-17 heavylift military transport aircraft of the Indian Air Force. After the special flight from Kabul touched down at IGI airport on Friday afternoon, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said in a tweet: “Under Operation Devi Shakti, a special Kam Air flight arranged by India has arrived in New Delhi from Kabul. It has brought 10 Indians and 94 Afghans including members of the Afghan Hindu-Sikh minority community.

The Guru Granth Sahib is expected to be placed at Gurdwara Guru Arjan Dev Ji in Mahavir Nagar and the Hindu religious scriptures brought from the fifth century Asamai temple in Kabul are to be taken to Asamai Mandir in Faridabad. The government last week informed Lok Sabha that India had evacuated over 565 stranded persons from Afghanistan since August. Puneet Singh Chandhok, president of Indian World Forum that has been coordinating the repatriation and rehabilitation of fghan Sikhs and Hindus in India, said in the earlier evacuations conducted by Indian Air Force, 77 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus were brought to India since August 15. "Friday’s evacuation was the first since the Taliban formed their government. The 83 Sikhs and Hindus who have arrived today were waiting in hope and anticipation since August to come to India. Officials at MEA have been working constantly to enable this repatriation," Chandhok added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/83-sikhs-hindus-brought-from-kabul-to-india/articleshow/88215672.cms||---

Biden's presidency has focused on restoring America to what Ronald Reagan liked to call a "shining city on the hill", or a beacon for freedom that other nations look up to.  But the Washington summit, held by video link because of the Covid-19, underlined difficulties facing the United States in resurrecting that traditional role.  In closing comments to leaders from scores of countries, as well as representatives of NGOs and philanthropical bodies, Biden said democracy "knows no borders. It speaks every language. It lives in anti-corruption activists, human rights defenders, journalists."  "We're committed to working with all those who share those values to shape the rules of the road," Biden vowed, saying the United States will stand by those "who give their people the ability to breathe free and not seek to suffocate their people with an iron hand."  Biden has spoken repeatedly about the world reaching an "inflection point" in a struggle between growing autocracies and increasingly under-fire democracies.  On the first day of the virtual summit, he pledged $424 million to support media freedom, fair elections and anti-corruption campaigns.  "Democracy needs champions," Biden said.  But as Biden hosted the summit on a wall of television screens in the White House, rival China was trolling the summit with mocking propaganda, including a rap song in English saying that Americans "sell democracy like they sell Coca-Cola!"  China and Russia, which Biden describes as the supreme leaders of the autocracies camp, were the highest profile names left off the invite list to the Washington summit.  Both countries have responded angrily, accusing Biden of stoking Cold War-style ideological divides.  China is especially upset because while it was not invited, Taiwan was.  As a democratically-run island that China considers a breakaway region, Taiwan is an increasingly sore spot in the wider battle between Beijing and Washington.  Beijing got a boost right in the middle of Biden's summit when Nicaragua dropped its previous diplomatic alliance with Taiwan, saying it only recognized China.  The announcement leaves Taiwan with only 14 diplomatic allies, just as the US state department is calling on "all countries that value democratic institutions" to "expand engagement" with the island. World skeptical on US Biden's democracy appeal also met a mixed reception at home.  On one side, Republican critics say he has not been tough enough on China or other adversaries.  "In Joe Biden's first 11 months in office, he has failed to stand up for freedom across the globe and caved to those who want to dismantle it, emboldening our enemies and undermining our standing abroad," the Republican National Committee said in a reaction to his remarks Friday.  On another end of the political spectrum, famed Vietnam War era whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg lashed out at the Biden administration for pursuing extradition of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.  Washington wants Assange to face trial for WikiLeaks' publication in 2010 of classified military documents relating to its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  On Friday, the US government won an appeal paving the way for the 50-year-old Australian to be sent from Britain.  "How dare Biden lecture a @StateDept #SummitForDemocracy today while refusing to pardon" Assange, Ellsberg tweeted Thursday.  He accused Biden of "killing freedom of the press for 'national security'".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/democracy-knows-no-borders-says-biden-as-summit-ends-china-scoffs/articleshow/88215690.cms||---

It is due to around 49% of the women gamers in India, who started playing during the pandemic, the overall number of gamers in the country has gone up 1.7 times between July 2020 and April 2021.   Most of these married women gamers use smartphones and are above the age of 34.  MUMBAI: These interesting revelations have been made by over 240 women gamers from across the country who participated in an online survey on 'InMobi Pulse advertising audiences platform' and 'VTION', a digital consumer behaviour and analytics company, earlier this year. The survey has used patent-protected technology to passively measure and analyse android smartphone consumption across various categories of apps on a real-time basis.  These women are now serious gamers, as around 35% play for 53 minutes a day, a significant amount of time. Interestingly, women in Bengal are playing for 67 minutes a day, more than the national average of 53%. The majority of Indian women, 75% and above, are committed gamers, playing mobile games every day.  Committed gamers enjoy playing a wide variety of games and can have up to 95 downloaded games on their devices. They also tend to explore newer games.  The majority of women, as per the survey, are playing action and strategy games followed by sports, casual, board and cards. Similarly more game downloading among women gamers has been witnessed in western states, especially Maharashtra, Goa and Gujarat, followed by north-central and those in the eastern part.  Piyush Kumar, founder and chief executive officer of Rooter, said the gaming market in India is expected to generate USD 3-5 billion by 2023 and revenue coming from game streaming would be around USD 300-400 million. "And in this growing perpendicular, women gamers are making their way to the bigger picture. We are also planning to hire more than 1,000 women gamers in the next three months. Today mobile gaming is transforming the dynamics of the gaming industry to its core and, in the next few years, we will see many more women gamers and e-sports athletes setting a new benchmark in the gaming universe." Gamer Paridhi Jain from Delhi, who in the gaming world is known as Curlbury, said the women gaming community in India is expanding on a daily basis. "I’m glad to see the kind of positive response and support we’re receiving from society, which is obviously helping us to push ourselves even further." Another gamer Radhe Joiser, 21, from Jamnagar, Gujarat, who in the gaming world is known as Little Drunk Girl, said the pandemic has also played a prominent role in the growth of women streamers. In the streaming sector, we can see the number of girl gamers increasing day by day, she adds.  Naman Jhawar, senior vice-president, strategy and operations, Mobile  Premier League (MPL), said over the last year, they have seen a substantial increase in the share of women gamers as home-makers and college students are looking to supplement their income by playing skill games that they would typically play for leisure. “We have also noticed that many of our e-sports tournaments in the past were won by women gamers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/its-womens-day-out-on-mobile-gaming/articleshow/88215646.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||India||Social media, cryptocurrencies must empower democracy: PM||NEW DELHI: Underlining the significance of cooperation among democracies, PM Narendra Modi offered to share India’s expertise in holding free and fair elections, and in enhancing transparency in all areas of governance through innovative digital solutions. Delivering India’s “national statement” at the US Summit for Democracy on Friday, Modi called for efforts to jointly shape global norms for emerging technologies like social media and crypto currencies, so that “they are used to empower democracy, not to undermine it”. He also recalled India’s traditions of participative decision-making and said it provides an example that democracy can, does and will deliver. Modi had on Thursday called on technology firms to contribute to efforts for preserving open and democratic societies. The PM said he was proud to represent the world’s largest democracy at the summit and that the democratic spirit was integral to India’s civilisational ethos. This spirit, he said, led to an unparalleled story in democratic nation-building over the last 75 years. Talking about what he described as India’s story of unprecedented socio-economic inclusion in all spheres, including constant improvements in health, education, and human well-being at an unimaginable scale, Modi said India had one clear message to the world: “That democracy can deliver, that democracy has delivered, and that democracy will continue to deliver.” By implication, and through remarks of various leaders, the summit was clearly intended, among other things, to present a counter-poise to China which is facing a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Games from US and some other western countries. “The structural features like multi-party polls, independent judiciary, and free media are important instruments of democracy. However, the basic strength of democracy is the spirit and ethos that lie within our citizens and our societies. Democracy is not only of the people, by the people, for the people but also with the people, within people,” said Modi. The PM said different parts of the world had followed different paths of democratic development and there was much to learn from each other. “We all need to improve our democratic practices and systems. We need to enhance inclusion, transparency, human dignity and responsive grievance redressal,” Modi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/social-media-cryptocurrencies-must-empower-democracy-pm/articleshow/88215723.cms||---

The US authorities accuse Australian-born Assange, 50, of 18 counts relating to WikiLeaks' release of vast troves of confidential military records and diplomatic cables, which they said had put lives in danger.  Assange's supporters cast him as an anti-establishment hero who has been persecuted by the United States for exposing US wrongdoing and double-dealing across the world from Afghanistan and Iraq to Washington.  At the Royal Courts of Justice in London, the United States won an appeal against a ruling by a London District Judge that Assange should not be extradited because he was likely to commit suicide in a US prison.  Judge Timothy Holroyde said he was satisfied with a package of assurances given by the United States about the conditions of Assange's detention, including a pledge not to hold him in a so-called "ADX" maximum security prison in Colorado and that he could be transferred to Australia to serve his sentence if convicted.  Further hurdles remain before Assange could be sent to the United States after an odyssey, which has taken him from teenage hacker in Melbourne to years holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London and then incarcerated in a maximum-security prison.  The legal wrangling will go to the Supreme Court, the United Kingdom's final court of appeal.  "It is highly disturbing that a UK court has overturned a decision not to extradite Julian Assange, accepting vague assurances by the United States government," Assange's lawyer, Barry Pollack, said. "Mr Assange will seek review of this decision by the UK Supreme Court."  Supporters of Assange gathered outside of the court after the ruling, chanting "free Julian Assange" and "no extradition". They tied hundreds of yellow ribbons to the court's gates and held up placards saying "journalism is not a crime".  Judge Holroyde said the case must now be remitted to Westminster Magistrates' Court with the direction judges send it to Home Secretary Priti Patel to decide whether or not Assange should be extradited. Helicopter attack Assange, who denies any wrongdoing, started out as a teenage hacker with the nickname Mendax - a classical Latin word for "liar" - but a few decades later would expose some of the United States' darkest secrets.  WikiLeaks came to prominence when it published a US military video in 2010 showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff.  It then released thousands of secret classified files and diplomatic cables that laid bare often highly critical US appraisals of world leaders from Russian President Vladimir Putin to members of the Saudi royal family.  Assange jumped bail and was offered refuge in 2012 by Ecuador's then-president Rafael Correa. He spent seven years holed up at the embassy in London while British police spent millions of dollars watching for any sign that he would emerge.  After relations with Ecuador soured, Assange, with white hair and a long beard, was dragged out by British police.  The US justice department said Assange was charged with conspiring with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to gain access to a government computer as part of a 2010 leak by WikiLeaks of hundreds of thousands of US military reports about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and American diplomatic communications. The US prosecutors and Western security officials regard Assange as a reckless and dangerous enemy of the state whose actions imperilled the lives of sources named in the leaked material.  His admirers have hailed Assange as a hero for exposing what they describe as abuse of power by modern states and for championing free speech.  "This is a travesty of justice," said Amnesty International's Europe Director Nils Muižnieks who said the US indictment posed "a grave threat to press freedom both in the United States and abroad".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-wins-assange-extradition-appeal-in-uk-court/articleshow/88215891.cms||---

He spent seven years holed up at the embassy in London while British police spent millions of dollars watching for any sign that he would emerge.  After relations with Ecuador soured, Assange, with white hair and a long beard, was dragged out by British police.  The US justice department said Assange was charged with conspiring with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to gain access to a government computer as part of a 2010 leak by WikiLeaks of hundreds of thousands of US military reports about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and American diplomatic communications. The US prosecutors and Western security officials regard Assange as a reckless and dangerous enemy of the state whose actions imperilled the lives of sources named in the leaked material.  His admirers have hailed Assange as a hero for exposing what they describe as abuse of power by modern states and for championing free speech.  "This is a travesty of justice," said Amnesty International's Europe Director Nils Muižnieks who said the US indictment posed "a grave threat to press freedom both in the United States and abroad".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/us-wins-assange-extradition-appeal-in-uk-court/articleshow/88215777.cms||---

The reason: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) swiftly filed an appeal before a division bench of the HC seeking a stay on Gaur’s bail. The bench admitted the appeal, saying it needs consideration. On February 25, an SUV with 20 gelatin sticks was found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia, and on March 4, the body of the SUV owner, Mansukh Hiran, was found in Kalwa creek. In March, Gujarat-based cricket bookie Gaur was arrested for allegedly procuring SIM cards for dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, the prime accused in the bomb scare case, and encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma. Before the bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal, NIA counsel Sandesh Patil said Gaur’s bail ought to be cancelled and stayed by an interim order as probe has shown prima facie evidence against him. Patil claimed that Waze wanted to spread terror in the minds of the industrialist and the public at large. “He wanted to reestablish his image as a supercop, therefore he had asked Hiren...to arrange for a vehicle…the accused [Waze] took the vehicle in Thane and changed the number plate to match that of the convoy of the industrialist to instil further fear,” he claimed. Patil added that it is from one of the SIM cards that Gaur had provided that a phone call was made to Hiren and so, he was charged correctly for conspiracy. However, Gaur’s senior counsel Shirish Gupte with advocate Aniket Nikam urged that no stay order be passed and once out on bail, their client would surrender before the court in case the NIA succeeds in its plea for cancellation of bail. Gupte said despite 22 days having passed since the special NIA court’s bail order, Gaur, a father of a year-old child and a “permanent resident of Bhuj”, continues to remain in jail. Gupte said Gaur has only been booked for a bailable offence, along with criminal conspiracy, under IPC Section 120B. The HC, in its order, noted that Gaur was still in custody and Gupte, on the court’s instructions, said considering that the appeal is to be heard next Wednesday, the accused will not avail bail by completing the formalities for release till appeal is heard. The HC accepted his statement. The NIA counsel did not press for a stay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-admits-nia-plea-against-gaur-bail-order-in-antilia-case/articleshow/88215773.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||India||SC: Not just crime, look at criminal’s mental state too||NEW DELHI: Holding that the court should not take into consideration only the crime but also the criminal, his state of mind and his socio-economic conditions while awarding the sentence, the Supreme Court has commuted the death sentence of a first time offender who killed his two siblings and a nephew over a property dispute. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, B R Gavai and B V Nagarathna said there is a chance of reformation of the convict as his conduct in jail is satisfactory and commuted his sentence to 30-years imprisonment. The bench agreed with the contention of advocate N Hariharan who submitted on the convict that the trial court and Madhya Pradesh high court erred in awarding the sentence as they did not consider that he was first time offender and not a hardened criminal. “In view of the settled legal position, it is our bounden duty to take into consideration the probability of the accused being reformed and rehabilitated. It is also our duty to take into consideration not only the crime but also the criminal, his state of mind and his socio-economic conditions,” Justice Gavai, who penned down the judgment for the bench, said The court noted that both the convict and deceased were rustic villagers belonging to poor families and were involved in property disputes and state government also did not place on record any evidence to show that there was no possibility with respect to his reformation or rehabilitation. “The appellant comes from a rural and economically poor background. There are no criminal antecedents. The appellant cannot be said to be a hardened criminal. This is the first offence committed by the appellant, no doubt, a heinous one. The certificate issued by the Jail Superintendent shows that the conduct of the appellant during incarceration has been satisfactory. It cannot therefore be said that there is no possibility of the appellant being reformed and rehabilitated foreclosing the alternative option of a lesser sentence and making imposition of the death sentence imperative,” it said. Referring to the judgment of the trial court and the high court, the court said it does not appear that the courts below have drawn a balance sheet of mitigating and aggravating circumstances. “The trial court as well as the high court has only taken into consideration the crime but have not taken into consideration the criminal, his state of mind, his socioeconomic background etc,” it said. “We are therefore inclined to convert the sentence imposed on the appellant from death to life. However, taking into consideration the gruesome murder of two of his siblings and one nephew, we are of the view that the appellant deserves rigorous imprisonment of 30 years,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-not-just-crime-look-at-criminals-mental-state-too/articleshow/88215827.cms||---

Banerjee had sought permission from the ministry of external affairs to attend the session on Friday, following Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba’s invite to the CM on November 26. Deuba wrote that Banerjee’s “presence will encourage us to work together in strengthening democracy in our region and beyond and reinforce our party-to-party relations”. The Bengal government, according to rules, sought clearance from the ministry. The MEA sought “clarifications”, to which the state responded, senior state government officials said. But clearance was declined “very late on Thursday” because it was a “private invite”, they said. The CM had to abort trips to Rome this September as well to Chicago in 2018 after being denied permission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-refused-nod-to-didis-nepal-visit-at-11th-hr-wb-govt/articleshow/88215865.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||India||It's 3 yrs, enhance cash aid to displaced Kashmiri migrants: Parliamentary panel to MHA||NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel has asked the ministry of home affairs to further enhance the cash assistance provided to displaced Kashmiri migrants from the current scale of Rs 13,000 per family, reminding that it had been three years since it was last revised. Noting that the enhancement in cash assistance to Kashmiri migrants was linked to inflation and wholesale price index and done after an interval of 2-3 years on recommendation of the J&K government, the parliamentary standing committee on home affairs, in its 235  report tabled on Friday regarding the action taken by the government on its recommendations, called for a suitable increase in the relief amount last raised in 2018 from Rs 10,000 per family or Rs 2500 per person to Rs 13,000 per family or Rs 3,250 per person. The committee also reiterated its recommendation that a special development package ((SDP) be made non-lapsable for few years to cater to the developmental needs of Ladakh, which could utilise only 27.42% of its budgetary allocation for 2020-21. The MHA attributed the low utilisation to factors like short working seasons, Covid-19 lockdowns, low arrival of labour from outside due to the pandemic and inadequate technical staff and contractors. The standing committee sought to be apprised about the progress made on providing telecom connectivity and electrification of border villages of Ladakh. It had earlier recommended the electrification of all villages in Ladakh, particularly those located in zero-border like Chumar and Demchok, in order to stop migration of people from these areas. ”This will go a long way in fulfilling the developmental needs of these remote yet strategically important localities,” it had observed in a report presented in the wake of the standoff in Eastern Ladakh. Also noting that of the 236 habitable border villages in Ladakh, 172 had telecom infrastructure and only 24 and 78 villages had 3G and 4G internet connectivity, respectively, the committee said the importance of proper communication facilities including internet has taken centrestage during Covid-19 pandemic with the switch to education via online mode. The home ministry informed the panel that border area development programme (BADP) norms were revised in March 2020 to cover all habitations situated between 0-10 km from international boundary. The guidelines also envisage phase-wise extension of coverage beyond 10 km, once the villages within 10 km are saturated. The ministry said the list of border villages – 14,708 with local government directory (LGD) code and 1860 where efforts are on to provide LGD codes -- was shared with the department of telecommunications to provide telecom infrastructure. MHA added the ministry of power is being requested for expediting electrification of the border villages in Ladakh. Another key recommendation of the committee is a review and reassessment of the factors behind the increasing number of suicide cases in the Central armed police forces (CAPFs). Noting that 134 CAPF personnel had committed suicide in 2020, the panel led by Congress MP Anand Sharma underlined that the two studies on causes were done way back in 2004 and 2012, through BPR&D and IIM, Ahmedabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/its-3-yrs-enhance-cash-aid-to-displaced-kashmiri-migrants-parliamentary-panel-to-mha/articleshow/88215829.cms||Bharti Jain

The attendance was low all around but the treasury benches looked particularly bare despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi having recently warned that party MPs should change their habits or be ready for unwelcome changes. Despite a lack of audience, speakers came prepared and emphasised on “equity and climate justice” while talking about India’s ambitious target set for reducing its carbon footprint. The low attendance saw barely few members available other than the speakers. Bhartruhari Mahtab of Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and Agatha Sangma of National People’s Party (NPP) hailed the voluntary mitigation goals set by India. Mahtab said that in 2010, India had set a target of reducing the emission intensity of its GDP by 20-25% from 2005 levels, by 2020. “We have taken a number of measures which have resulted in the decline of emission intensity of our GDP by 20% between 2005 and 2016. That means four years before, we achieved the target,” he said. NK Premachandran of RSP said India should not become a signatory to anything that adversely impacts its interests. “Equity should be key to sharing climate change commitments,” he added. The RSP MP said the concept (and obligation) of developed and developing countries had been changed at the CO climate summit at Glasgow, accusing the rich countries of hiding behind poor countries in tackling the challenges posed by climate change. “The principle of equity has been diluted and lost over the last 30 years. 'Common but differentiated responsibility' has become an insignificant part of the Glasgow declaration,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lok-sabha-discusses-climate-change-amid-thin-attendance/articleshow/88215892.cms||---
---||India||6 years after launch, Internat’l Solar Alliance gets ‘observer’ status in UN General Assembly||NEW DELHI: Six years after being jointly launched by India and France, the International Solar Alliance (ISA) has got an ‘observer’ status in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) which will help this treaty-based international organisation usher in a new era of green energy diplomacy for increasing its solar power footprint as part of a larger goal to face the challenges of climate change. “The International Solar Alliance has been unanimously granted observer status by the UN General Assembly,” Permanent Mission of India to the UN tweeted on Friday while thanking all the member states for their support. The ISA, headquartered in India, was launched in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the 21st session of the UN climate change conference (CO) in Paris in November, 2015. Congratulating the ISA on Twitter, environment minister Bhupender Yadav said it's an “acknowledgement of PM Narendra Modi’s vision of establishing solar energy as a shared solution that simultaneously addresses climate, energy and economic priorities across geographies”. At present, 101 countries are signatories to the ISA Framework Agreement that aims to mobilise $1,000 billion of investments in solar energy solutions by 2030, while delivering energy access to 1,000 million people through installation of 1,000 GW of solar power capacity. The granting of ‘observer’ status in the UNGA would help it better coordinate to expand its network through setting up a trans-national grid -- One Sun One Work One Grid (OSOWOG) -- launched by Modi and British PM Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the COP26 in Glasgow last month. Calling it a “historic decision” by the UNGA, the permanent representative of India to the UN, T S Tirumurti, tweeted, “In six years, the ISA has become an example of positive global climate action through partnerships to benefit global energy growth and development.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/6-years-after-launch-internatl-solar-alliance-gets-observer-status-in-un-general-assembly/articleshow/88215913.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||World||Mexico urges US migration rethink after horror crash kills 55||TUXTLA GUTIERREZ: After a horrific road accident killed 55 undocumented migrants in a truck on a major transit route to the United States, Mexico on Friday urged Washington to rethink its migration policy.  Bodies draped in white sheets lined the roadside near Tuxtla Gutierrez in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, where a truck transporting some 160 migrants -- most from Central America -- overturned Thursday.  Passengers, bleeding and with broken bones, lay in the road crying out in pain after the latest disaster to befall desperate people traveling through Mexico in search of a better life in the United States.  More than 100 people were injured.  Thousands attempt the long, often dangerous, and expensive journey every year to escape violence and poverty in their home nations in South and Central America.  Such tragedies, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Friday, should move the world to address "the underlying problem" -- despair.  "The migration problem cannot be solved by coercive measures, but by opportunities for work and well-being. People don't leave their villages for pleasure, they do it out of necessity," he said.  If the United States wanted to prevent migration to its shores, added Lopez Obrador, it should invest in social programs in Central America -- a matter he has discussed with Joe Biden.  But "there is slowness," said the Mexican leader.  The victims of Thursday's accident, authorities said, were from Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Mexico.  Most of the dead were from Guatemala, said Lopez Obrador.  "It was horrible to hear the wailing. I just thought about helping," 18-year-old Sabina Lopez, who lives near the scene of the accident, told AFP.  The driver, who fled the scene, was allegedly speeding when he lost control of the truck.  The National Institute of Migration said it was working to identify the dead, pay for funerals and repatriate bodies. It said survivors will be allowed to stay in Mexico.  - 'Don't close your eyes' - The death toll is likely to rise, with many of the injured taken to hospital in a serious condition, according to Luis Manuel Garcia, a local civil protection official.  Lopez told AFP she saw a man pleading with his wounded companion.  "Don't go to sleep, don't close your eyes," she recalled him saying. "Remember what you promised your mother! Hold on."  Another nearby resident, Isaias Diaz, who arrived 15 minutes after the accident, described a ghastly scene, with "a lot of people lying around, some of them were already dead."  Diaz said he saw "five, six children, injured ... People (who had) broken legs, ribs, heads, cuts on their necks, everything."  "The crying, the pain, the desperation. It was a very ugly atmosphere," he said.  - Broken hearts - People came spontaneously from nearby settlements Friday to place candles at the accident site, and pray.  "Our hearts are broken," said Rocio Hernandez, a 52-year-old housewife.  The Attorney General's Office has opened a homicide investigation, while government officials denied the truck had been allowed through a roadblock before the crash.  Guatemala's President Alejandro Giammattei and the Vatican expressed condolences to the victims and their loved ones.  "Migratory alternatives and legal avenues are needed to avoid tragedies like this," the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said on Twitter.  Human traffickers commonly hide undocumented migrants in trucks bringing them from Guatemala into Mexico, from where they head north to the US border. Accidents are common.  Last month, 12 migrants died when two trucks crashed and burned in Chiapas.  In a case that shocked a country sadly accustomed to violence, 16 Guatemalans and three Mexicans were found in January burned to death inside a truck with 113 bullet holes in the state of Tamaulipas.  Migrants have told AFP that the truck journey entails hours locked up without ventilation, avoiding drinking water so as not to have to urinate. Drivers, they say, ignore pleas for fresh air.  Faced with these dangers, many migrants opt instead to join so-called caravans undertaking the long journey on foot, enduring extreme weather and other hardships, including extortion from drug gangs.  The flow of undocumented migrants has increase since Biden came to office with a promise to scrap the hardline border policies of his predecessor Donald Trump.  Mexican authorities have detected more than 190,000 migrants between January and September, three times as many as in 2020. Some 74,300 have been deported.  The United States, for its part, recorded 1.7 million people entering illegally from Mexico between October 2020 and September, a record. Many were expelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/mexico-urges-us-migration-rethink-after-horror-crash-kills-55/articleshow/88215978.cms||---

On Tuesday, the HC bench of Justices SJ Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav had directed Malik to file an affidavit explaining why action not be taken against him for wilful breach of his undertaking of November 25 and 29 not to post or make remarks against the Wankhedes in a defamation suit filed by Sameer’s father Dnyandev Wankhede. “I had no intention to disrespect, dishonor, overreach or breach the said orders,” Malik said on Friday. The bench accepted his apology in his affidavit tendered through his senior counsel Aspi Chinoy. Malik said none of the three statements cited as his breach were press statements issued by him, but were “responses in course of interviews with journalists…to specific questions”. “I have since been advised that the undertaking would cover any responses to specific questions too and in future will not respond to any posed to me,” he said, adding that he believes that he can comment on “political misuse of central agencies and the conduct of their officers in course of their duties.” Senior counsel Birendra Saraf, appearing for Dnyandev, said the fresh undertaking may be tweaked to say Malik not be prevented from commenting on performance of duties “hereinafter”. The court agreed and the undertaking was changed to: “I believe my statement would not prevent me from commenting on the political misuse of central agencies and conduct of their officers in the course of performance of their official duties hereafter.” Saraf and advocate Diwakar Rai, for Wankhede, said Malik can’t speak of Wankhede’s past actions.

The department-related standing committee on home affairs, in its 236th report on Covid-19 management tabled in the Rajya Sabha on Friday, stated that both teachers and students should be offered training in use of digital devices as well as information and communication technology, in partnership with technical educational institutions and NGOs etc, via private-public-partnership (PPP) mode. “The committee also recommends to assess the efficacy of online classes including learning outcomes, shortcomings, etc….the Committee would like to know about the steps taken to ensure internet connectivity and provide digital devices particularly to the economically weaker students of rural and remote areas,” the panel headed by Congress Rajya Sabha MP Anand Sharma, said. The home ministry, informing the panel about the action taken by it on the latter’s previous recommendation to provide financial assistance and low-cost devices as well as sufficient data to access online education classes, mentioned the UGC’s Swayam Prabha initiative for remote areas, under which access to best teaching and learning resources is provided to all learners free of cost, with one-time installation of DD Free Dish reception system. Also, IIT Bombay had launched virtual course content for 21 engineering streams and started a website that enables students to conduct virtual lab experiments. Both facilities are available free of cost. The home ministry further informed the standing committee that the ministry of education had entrusted NCERT with the task of forming a panel of academic and curricular experts, to address the issues related to gaps and/or loss of learning among students. The panel conducted a survey in KVS, NVS and CBSE schools regarding various digital modes being used by students to receive online education and their concerns regarding children not having digital devices. In respect of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) students not having digital devices, resource materials like printed content, question & answers, alternative academic calendar (AAC), assignments, etc., were personally handed over to the parents/ students, the MHA told the panel. In CBSE schools, the Board had on September 2, 2020 advised all its affiliated schools to adopt guidelines for addressing the learning gaps in their students and optimise their learning achievement. To facilitate teachers to undertake online NISHTHA training, financial support up to Rs 1,000 per teacher for procuring pen-drives, printing of modules and high-speed data- pack has been provided at elementary level on reimbursement basis and subject to successful completion of the training course.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/both-teachers-and-students-should-be-offered-training-in-use-of-digital-devices/articleshow/88215986.cms||Bharti Jain

Rao was speaking at an event — The Path to 1962 — in the city. She shared her thoughts on Indo-China relations since India’s independence with Manoj Kewalramani, senior fellow, China Studies, Takshashila Institution, at Bangalore International Centre on Thursday. When asked what the ‘diplomatic boycott’ of Beijing Olympics meant for international politics and how India should react to it, Rao said the phrase has resurfaced now after the Cold War era. The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between US, Soviet Union and their respective allies, the Western Bloc and Eastern Bloc, which began following World War II. It lasted from 1945 till 1989 and did not necessarily involve a full-blown war between the two superpowers. “Diplomatic boycotts are vestiges of Cold War politics and remind you of that era. Though this is not as hot as the Cold War of the past,” she said. Rao added that India, however, will not play this kind of game. “China is a neighbour with whom we share a 4,000-km-long frontier. There are issues, challenges and priorities that we have to deal with in our relationship with China that cannot be solved with diplomatic boycotts,” she said. Earlier this week, the US announced a ‘diplomatic boycott’ of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February 2022, citing human rights abuse in Xinjiang, western China. Soon Australia, Britain and Canada joined the US-led boycott. Talking about Indo-China relations, Rao said the two countries face a three-body problem (India, China and Tibet), with Tibet at the geographical and diplomatic centre of their relationship since the beginning, as described in her book, The Fractured Himalaya. She said then Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, was against imperialist legacy, which he showed towards China’s presence in Tibet as well. “...India has taken care of the Dalai Lama since March 1959 and rightly so... He calls himself the longest staying guest of India,” she said, adding that Nehru was considered ‘Dharmaraja’ by Tibetans. Calling Nehru ‘flawed in a heroic sense’, Rao said both he and Vallabhbhai Patel showed extraordinary empathy for the sake of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/beijing-olympics-boycott-reminiscent-of-cold-war-era-politics-former-foreign-secy/articleshow/88216001.cms||Farheen Hussain

The move comes at a time when Bescom has been drawing flak from Bengalureans for frequent power disruptions. Bescom has justified the proposed hike pointing to crumbling distribution infrastructure, underground cabling work, need for improved efficiency with regard to maintenance, changed power consumption patterns because of work from home and closure of industries following the pandemic. KERC will hold hearings and take a call by May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bescom-seeks-power-tariff-hike/articleshow/88216003.cms||---

Titled the Karnataka Freedom of Religion Bill, the proposed legislation is being moved by BJP MLC and former RR Nagar candidate PM Muniraju Gowda. On December 6, Gowda submitted a letter and copy of the proposed bill to the council secretary seeking time to table it in the Belagavi session. Asked why he was mooting the bill when his own party is expected to table a similar piece of legislation, Gowda said if the government pre-empts his efforts, he’d welcome it. “We are not trying to scuttle the government’s plan or score brownie points by bringing this bill. If the government tables it in the legislature, I will heartily back it and urge them to add a few points from my recommendations,” said Gowda. According to BJP legislators and workers, the intention behind the private member’s bill is to push for speeding up the proposal. “While the home minister and chief minister have both made public statements about bringing the anti-conversion bill, unfortunately we are hearing the government isn’t serious about the issue. A private member’s bill may show how focussed the party’s vote bank is about this matter,” said a BJP legislator. However, law minister JC Madhuswamy dismissed claims that the government isn’t serious about the bill or is under pressure to desist from tabling it. “While I admit that it is taking time, we have not taken it off the table. We are serious about the anti-conversion law,” said Madhuswamy. According to government officials, the bill may be discussed at the next cabinet meeting to be held in Belagavi and tabled in the legislature the following week. A long process: OfficialsAs far as the private member’s bill is concerned, legislature officials say it is a long-drawn process before it can be brought to the house for assent. Gowda said at present the bill has been tabled before the legislature committee on private member’s bill and they have sought some clarifications on expenditure and a few other clauses. Following the committee’s recommendations, it will be discussed with law, home and finance departments before being considered fit to be tabled in the house. Legislative council secretary KR Mahalakshmi said the committee is vested with the bill now and will decide when it needs to be tabled. Consult citizens before passing transport authority bill: ActivistsWith the Bengaluru Metropolitan Land Transport Authority bill likely to be tabled in the Belagavi session, many citizens and activists have urged the government to hold a public consultation on the issue. At a recent online discussion on the bill organised by Bengaluru Bus Prayanikara Vedike, which is campaigning for better public transport in the city, activists said the Kannada version of the draft legislation is not available. The directorate of urban land transport is preparing the draft. Dattatraya T Devare, a trustee of NGO Bangalore Environment Trust, said: “The formation of a Unified Metropolitan Transportation Authority was mandatory to get the Centre’s approval for the new Metro project. But the Centre cleared the ORR-KIA corridor without any approval. Now, the state government is placing the BMLTA bill in the assembly like a ritual with no public consultation.” Sandeep Anirudhan, a civic activist said: “Pre-legislative public consultation should be made the norm for all bills and amendments.” Senior civic activist NS Mukunda agreed: “Public consultation is a must. BMLTA has a larger scope to provide affordable transport options, common ticketing, improving pedestrian footpaths and better coordination between government agencies.” Tara Krishnaswamy, cofounder, Citizens for Bengaluru, an NGO, said: “Local civic bodies led by the mayor should play a vital role in BMLTA. In fact, Bengaluru records the highest pedestrian fatalities in the country. But there is no accessibility from Metro stations to BMTC bus stops and railway stations. Multiple agencies are responsible for planning in the city but they are not talking to each other.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/anti-conversion-issue-bjp-legislators-decide-to-move-private-members-bill/articleshow/88216004.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Bengaluru||ECI challenges order on Bengaluru Urban members||BENGALURU: Close on the heels of a single-judge bench’s interim order virtually forbidding declaration of the legislative council election result from Bengaluru Urban local bodies constituency, the Election Commission of India (ECI) on Friday moved a high court division bench against the order. Senior advocate Dhyan Chinnappa, who appeared for ECI, made a mention of the writ appeal by submitting a memo before a division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and requested an urgent hearing. He told the court that the single-judge bench’s order was tantamount to interference in the election process, which is not permissible under Article 329(b) of the Constitution that stipulates that no election to either house of parliament or state legislature can be questioned, except through an election petition in the aftermath of the poll process. He claimed though the interim order was on one constituency, it could have a wider impact as political parties may demand similar treatment in other parts of the state where nominated members exercised their franchise on Friday. The division bench said the matter would be taken up on Monday, a day before counting of votes. On Thursday, the singlejudge bench granted conditional permission to 15 nominated members of Bommasandra, Attibele and Anekal town municipal councils to vote. Saying thevotes should be kept in a sealed cover and the result not declared without the court’s permission, it adjourned hearing of a petition filed by Congress candidate Yousuf Sharif to December 20. The main argument was that when nominated members are not allowed to vote in a municipal council meeting, they cannot be bestowed with the larger right of voting in a legislative council election. Prajwal votes 9th to bring brother luck:Superstition once again played a part in the JD(S) first family as Holenaraispura MLA HD Revanna's MP-son Prajwal Revanna chose to be the ninth voter after circumventing two other voters standing in the queue here on Friday.

---||Bengaluru||Another case of loan fraud surfaces in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Interstate gangs of fraudsters have become active in Bengaluru, trapping businessmen desperately seeking big loans to meet their immediate working capital needs. That they have operated with a fair degree of success has alarmed city police. P Krishnam Raju, 65, a resident of Hyderabad, is the latest victim of one such fraud. His relative Manthena Tarun Gandhi filed a complaint with HSR Layout police against a gang of miscreants, who cheated Raju of Rs 1.8 crore. Police said that two persons introducing themselves as Vijay Bhaskar Sharma and Narasimharao visited Raju’s office in Hyderabad recently. They assured him of Rs 100 crore loan to expand his business. Raju believed the duo and came to Bengaluru. He visited the office of the accused persons in HSR Layout, 3rd Sector, and met one Kathirvelan there. The man promised to arrange a loan of Rs 100 crore and asked Raju to pay Rs 1.8 crore upfront towards the interest on loan for the first three months. Raju transferred Rs 90 lakh each to two different bank accounts the alleged fraudsters shared. Kathirvelan had promised Raju that the loan would be transferred to his bank account on December 8. When Raju did not get the amount, he tried to contact Kathirvelan, but his mobile phone was switched off. So, Raju asked his relative Gandhi to visit the office and figured that Kathirvelan wasn’t available. HSR Layout police have taken up a case of cheating against Kathrivelan and others. Police conducted a raid on the office and arrested four employees. The accused are Niveditha, Harshita, Naresh, and Vijay Anand. Kathrivelan had opened the office just about a month ago. Police are making efforts to nab Kathirvelan, who is from Tamil Nadu. Preliminary probe revealed Kathrivelan had diverted the money to a few jewellers and purchased gold worth Rs 1.5 crore. Same modus operandi in previous casesMuch before this case surfaced, Suddaguntepalya police registered two similar cases of cheating on November 18. However, police say the accused persons in the HSR Layout incident and Suddaguntepalya ones are different, but with stunningly similar modus operandi. Two FIRs were lodged — one filed by businessman Girish P, 48, of Ashokanagar ( he lost Rs 2.3 crore) and businessman Panitar (he lost Rs 3.6 crore) and another filed by Taram, also a businessman, of Subansiri district in Arunachal Pradesh (he lost Rs 3.6 crore). Police named Daniel Armstrong, Vivekananda Kumar and Ravi Raghavan as the accused in both cases. Armstrong allegedly diverted the money to jewellery shop owners in Tamil Nadu and purchased gold. None have been arrested in these cases so far. Girish was looking for Rs 150-crore loan and Taram, Rs 240 crore. Telugu playback singer Harini Rao’s father Ayalasomayajula Kaliprasad Rao aka AK Rao and his friend Marali reportedly contacted Girish and Taram over phone and asked them to meet Armstrong in Bengaluru for loan. Accordingly, the two met Armstrong and his accomplices, Kumar and Raghavan. The businessmen lost money to Armstrong after paying huge sums as a commitment fee. The victims later approached police. Rao was reportedly found dead under mysterious circumstances on the railway track between Yelahanka and Rajanukunte in the early hours of November 23, a day after he appeared before police in connection with the cheating case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/another-case-of-loan-fraud-surfaces-in-city/articleshow/88216010.cms||Santosh kumar.B

Quoting a TOI article, Rao tweeted: “If I were MD BMRCL... aggressively advertise to increase ridership, reduce fares, aggressively achieve inter-modal reforms, phenomenally work on lastmile connectivity, increase Metro running hours up to 2am and start at 4am... no rocket science..!!! 500% increase surely (sic).” On December 5, TOI published the article, ‘Metro needs 12 lakh ridership to break even’. It highlighted the fact that Namma Metro had met only 27% of its ridership target in 2019-20 and needed a daily ridership of 12 lakh — a 208% increase — to break even, as per a report by International Association of Public Transport, an NGO. At present, Namma Metro is operational between 6am and 11pm. There are no monthly or student passes and many users have complained there aren’t adequate feeder buses. Passengers also need to maintain a minimum balance of Rs 50 on smart cards and the discount for them is just 5%, as opposed to 20% in Chennai. Twitter users agreeWhile BMRCL has not issued a statement on Rao’s comment, many Twitter users agreed with him. Amarnath, a user, tweeted, “For me, a reason not to use Metro is its fare and time delay in check-in. From Kengeri to Cubbon Park, it’s Rs 42 i.e. 84 for a round trip and Rs 2,520 per month. If I travel by BMTC, it takes almost the same time but just Rs 1,050. Why should I use Metro?” Another user said BMRCL should take a leaf out of BMTC’s book and issue student pass. “Introduce monthly and daily passes too. Public transport is meant to be easily accessible to the public. The motive behind it shouldn’t be making profit,” the user said. Ashok Surana Jain, a commuter, called for greater frequency, reduced fares, frequent mini-buses and multi-level parking at stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/increasing-metro-ridership-not-rocket-science-bhaskar-rao/articleshow/88216012.cms||---

However, to balance the situation, interim order as prayer for with regard to opening of the mall, has been granted subject to the petitioner paying Rs 2 crore by the end of the day. Since the day has now come to an end, and tomorrow and Sunday are bank holidays, counsel can deposit a cheque for Rs 4 crore with BBMP and replace the same with a demand draft for Rs 2 crore before Monday noon (December 13),” Justice M Nagaprasanna said. The matter will be heard on Monday for further consideration. Earlier, during the hearing, counsel for the petitioners claimed a distress warrant was issued for payment of property tax amounting of Rs 6,77,78,286 on February 14, 2020. The court was told the petitioners paid Rs 1 crore dues on September 14, 2020 and have been paying Rs 2 crore on monthly basis. The petitioners said that the BBMP’s action of locking the mall when customers were the inside was contrary to law as there is no such provision under the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976 or the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Act, 2020. However, BBMP counsel said the tax demand had been communicated to the petitioners year on year and they had defaulted in payment every time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/mantri-mall-to-reopen-post-hc-interim-order/articleshow/88216013.cms||---

Last year, exams were held on two days where three subjects were clubbed on each day. The core subjects of science, maths and social studies were held on one day and languages on another. Each subject was for 40 marks. This year, the exams will be conducted for 100 marks for core subjects and second and third language, and 125 for first language.

---||Bengaluru||India has a perverse tax system: BCIC report||Bengaluru: The Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce (BCIC)’s on Friday released a report on direct tax administration reforms that put the spotlight on measures of prevention of disputes, suggestions for improving faceless assessment, and improvement of the capital gains tax regime in India. “A complex unfriendly capital gains tax system is a big reason why many Indian startups have relocated their headquarters outside India. We have a perverse tax system that penalises investing in unlisted companies with a higher long-term capital gains tax for taking greater risks and creating more jobs. There is an urgent need to reform the entire gamut of capital gains tax on securities and real assets in order to simplify the tax regime, ensure uniformity across asset classes, improve compliance, reduce litigation. Reforms of taxation of capital gains would enable investors to invest in various assets after considering the risk and return rather than tax consequences,” said TV Mohandas Pai, chairman of Aarin Capital Partners, as a foreward in the report.For ease of doing business in India and to attract foreign capital, it is recommended to introduce a fast track assessment process for the timely conclusion of assessments (say, within three months of filing the return) in case of overseas investors such as foreign portfolio investors, foreign institutional investors, pass through investment funds such as Alternative Investment Funds, venture capital funds, whose income from other sources and capital gains are taxable in the hands of the investors.KR Sekar, president of BCIC, said the report provides recommendations on what could be done for making tax administration better including measures for prevention of disputes, and delinking of assessment function from revenue targets. “All functions relating to assessment should be categorically delinked from revenue targets. It should be driven by separate performance measures and targets that give due importance to the quality of the processes as well as recovery, and not by the extent of demand raised,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/india-has-a-perverse-tax-system-bcic-report/articleshow/88216022.cms||---

The state will be divided into 13 regions based on the situation that existed in the 1950s when Tamil Nadu had 12 districts including Chennai, North Arcot, South Arcot, Coimbatore, Salem, Tirunelveli, Trichy and Madurai and students will learn the history of the regions that came under these districts. As per the plan, the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) will include eight pages of local history and eight pages of geography in addition to the existing lessons. “Local history will include details like freedom fighters of the area, folklore, culture and geography will include local ecology, crops, demography and industry,” a source in the school education department said. In Tamil Nadu, Sivakasi is known for firecrackers and printing industry, Namakkal is known for chicken farming, while Tirupur is known for its garments industry. The students will know the history of these industries in their lessons and how they became prominent and their current status. “At present, history lessons only have world history and Indian history and students are unaware about their own region and community. Teachers are also likely to give assignments that will encourage students to find out more about their villages or towns and about culture and folk arts in their areas,” the source added. V Vasanthidevi, former vice-chancellor of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, said including the local history is a very good move. “History is not only about world history and Indian history. It starts with understanding the history of your own families, community and village. A kid should know what happened to his/her village or region,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/local-geography-history-lessons-for-class-ix-students/articleshow/88216027.cms||A Ragu Raman

Though the holidays are more than a month away, reservation status is on the waitlist on trains from Chennai to southern towns and to cities in neighbouring states. The demand is high for Pongal that begins on January 14, which is an extended weekend. Republic Day, which falls on a Wednesday, is also being used as an extended holiday by those who take leave on Monday and Tuesday. The air fare is already 3,500 to Madurai, 4,000 to Tuticorin, 3,500 to Goa and 4,000 to Srinagar for Pongal. As international scheduled flights are suspended till the end of January, domestic destinations are the only options available for people to travel for Christmas, New Year and Pongal holidays. International travel is confusing because of the new rules, paperwork and high air fare. Singapore and Dubai are ruled out due to restrictions and high fares. Travel and tour operators say people are told to book in advance for trips to leisure destinations in Himachal, Goa and Jammu and Kashmir because hotel rooms are full in January. Thanvi J, who is planning a six-day trip to Jammu and Kashmir with friends during the Pongal holidays, said the air fare was not too expensive but the hotels were all full and costly. “It costs 50,000 per person if budget hotels are selected. Some money can be saved by booking late evening or night flights.” Sriharan Balan of Madura Travels said that domestic travel had picked up. “Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Jammu and Kashmir and the most popular among the younger crowd. Those who want to enjoy extreme cold and snow are traveling to J&K. Families are not going there much in January.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/with-trains-full-air-fares-spike-for-pongal-week/articleshow/88216030.cms||---
---||Chennai||Expect light rain over next five days across Chennai: IMD||CHENNAI: The city may get light showers for the next five days, after which the north-east monsoon will weaken in intensity. The IMD has said the north-east monsoon season is likely to end abruptly. While the monsoon is weak at present, there are more dry days predicted towards the end of this month, leading to a rainfall deficit. For the next 48 hours, IMD has forecast light to moderate rain over areas of Chennai and suburbs, with the skies expected to remain partly cloudy. Temperatures may hover between 32 degrees C and 25 degrees C. “The easterly trough or an elongated region of relatively low pressure moving east to west may bring the rainfall,” a meteorologist said. According to IMD’s seven-day forecast, the city is likely to receive light spells and at times accompanied by thunderstorms. On Friday, the city skies were overcast, while Nungambakkam recorded traces of rain till 7.30pm. Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist, Skymet Weather, said the city may get some wet spells till December 15, after which there are chances of a significant reduction in rainfall as the easterly winds are not strong enough to bring rain beyond the coastal areas. “The monsoon may start withdrawing by the last week of December. We may not see the season extending over to January,” he said. Private weather bloggers said December, which usually records an average rain of 177.4mm in the city, may end up in a deficit as a favourable global phenomenon like Madden-Julian Oscillation (a pulse of cloud and rainfall that travels eastward along the equator) has moved over the west Pacific region. Nevertheless, Chennai subdivision has already recorded an excess of 64% with 1,154mm rainfall against a normal of 702.2mm from October 1 to December 10. “December is very likely to end in a deficit both for the city as well as for the state and even for south India. “But long- range models show some rainfall during Pongal in January 2022,” said blogger Pradeep John.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/expect-light-rain-over-next-five-days-across-city-imd/articleshow/88216031.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: HC fines selection board, SI-aspirant gets Rs 10 lakh||CHENNAI: In a first of its kind, the Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board (TNUSRB) was found guilty of criminal contempt of court and was imposed 2,000 as penalty, which is maximum under the contempt law, by the Madras high court. Though an individual found guilty of criminal contempt can be sentenced upto six months, a division bench of Justice P N Prakash and Justice R Hemalatha imposed only the maximum penalty since the board was a juristic entity. The bench also directed the state to pay 10 lakh as compensation to G Vijayakumar who was framed by the board to hide its mistakes and was made to suffer in jail for 22 days. N Senthamaraikannan, who is an IG-ranked IPS officer and was the then member secretary of TNUSRB was, however, discharged from the case as he was not directly involved. The case pertains to a recruitment conducted by the board for the posts of sub-inspector (finger print) in 2018. It utilised the services of four persons – G Vijayakumar, Arpudhenesan Dominic, Senthil Kumar and Manikandan -- for preparation of a question bank. When the board published the preliminary key for the exam it received objections from candidates with respect to the key for a particular question. Therefore, the board requested the service of Vijayakumar, who in turn introduced D Murthi. Based on their opinion, final keys were published. Aggrieved, one among the candidates approached the high court challenging the answer published for the question. Admitting the plea, a single judge of the court stayed the appointment and directed the board to find out the correct answer. In view of the direction, though the board passed a resolution to get an opinion from Anna University, it got a written opinion from Murthy and filed a report in sealed cover to the court. It was claimed that Murthy was a professor of IIT-Madras. Based on the report, the court dismissed the plea. Subsequently, the petitioner found through an RTI application that there was no such a professor in the IIT-Madras as Murthy. Therefore, he moved the court to reopen his petition. In response, the board took a stand that Vijayakumar and Murthy cheated the board for monetary benefit, filed criminal cases against them and arrested Vijayakumar. While so, Vijayakumar filed an affidavit claiming that he was not in Chennai during the alleged offense as he was giving a lecture in a college in Ooty. Murthy claimed that he was only a retired teacher of math in Kendriya Vidyalaya on the IIT-M premises, not a professor. The single judge initiated contempt proceedings against IPS officer N K Senthamarai Kannan, who was the then member secretary of the board, and the board. The case was later transferred to the division bench. During the hearing, it came to light that the board had framed Vijayakumar and Murthy by obtaining signatures on plain papers to escape from the contempt proceedings of the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-fines-selection-board-si-aspirant-gets-10-lakh/articleshow/88216033.cms||Suresh Kumar

The award carried a cash prize and a certificate of appreciation. Periasamy Thooran, R A Padmanabhan, Tho Mu Si Raghunathan and Ilasai Manian were the researchers who were posthumously awarded for their contribution on research on Bharathiar.

The award carries a cheque for Rs 3 lakh along with the certificate. Research scholar A R Venkatachalapathi said when the government proposed to celebrate the death centenary of Bharathiyar, the centenary death anniversary of great patriotic poet should be commemorated appropriately. When queries were raised about precedence for such commemorations, it was pointed out that 500th year of Shakespeare was celebrated with fanfare in 2016 in England. Subsequently, the government identified the researchers for presenting the awards along with the cash prize, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/bharathiar-memorial-award-for-six-researchers/articleshow/88216034.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: Corporation schools get new look with better facilities||CHENNAI: Bharath, a Class VIII student of Chennai High School on Manikandan Road in Royapuram, was in for a pleasant surprise when he returned to school after the Covid lockdown. Gone was the leaky roof and cracked walls; his classroom now was spick and span. This is just one of the 28 schools that the Greater Chennai Corporation plans to transform under the CITIIS (City Investments To Innovate, Integrate and Sustain) programme at a cost of Rs 99 crore. The programme is managed by the National Institute of Urban Affairs and financed by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, the French Development Agency and the European Union. The civic body had earlier planned to renovate 48 schools, but cut the list short for lack of funds. The project in four schools – on Manikandan street in Royapuram, New market, Kottur, and Nesapakkam – will be completed by March 2022. The civic body plans to expand this project under Singara Chennai 2.0 and revamp all 281 corporation schools at a cost of Rs 1,525 crore by seeking funds from NGOs, corporates and other funding agencies. P Prakasam, headmaster of Royapuram corporation school, said the school will get its first sports infrastructure in the form of a volleyball court under this project. “We will also get airconditioned staff rooms, a dining room, a STEM lab, new primary block, improved toilets and mid-day meal kitchens,” he said. Raji, a primary school student, told TOI that she always wanted facilities like in private institutions in her school. “We are very excited and happy. Our classrooms now look so lively,” she said. However, the teachers wanted the civic body to also improve furniture. In most schools, children in the primary sections sit on the floor. The education department had received letters from more than 100 schools seeking better furniture. An official said, they will look at external funding for that as it wasn’t included in this project. A corporation official told TOI the idea was to bring corporation schools on a par with private schools. “We have the best teachers. Infrastructure was lacking. This is all set to change now,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/corporation-schools-get-a-new-look-with-better-facilities/articleshow/88216036.cms||Komal Gautham

Jayalalithaa’s belongings, collections, furniture and decor were missing, said Deepa after officially taking possession of the property. Deepa, who went around the house after a decade, said it had changed beyond recognition and blamed it on Jayalalithaa’s aide, Sasikala. “I felt terrible and I was shocked. I remember seeing the house being beautiful and well kept. All the rooms, including my aunt’s bedroom, have become smaller. The house is vacant except for a few things,” she said, adding her doubts about Jayalalithaa’s death remained after seeing the house. Deepa urged the government to keep its pre-poll promise to probe the circumstances leading to Jayalalithaa’s death. Deepa alleged that Sasikala prevented the family from getting near her aunt. Deepa raised doubts about the changes made in the house which had sprawling rooms for Jayalalithaa. “They (Sasikala) have made the changes for their own convenience, which I find odd. I find grills in two or three places. And for what reasons I don’t understand. The library has shrunk, and even her bedroom has shrunk,” she said. Deepa said the government could extend police protection to the house since ‘ordinary people’ like her are confronted with an influential AIADMK and Sasikala on either side. Chennai Collector J Vijaya Rani handed over the keys to Deepa and her brother, Deepak, declaredthe ‘direct legal heirs’ under the Hindu Succession Act. Revenue officials helped the siblings open several rooms with separate keys. They included three sealed rooms with glass barriers as the house was converted into a memorial by the previous AIADMK government. The new owners had to wait for more than an hour for Tangedco to restore supply so they could open the rooms on the first floor, said a source. Jayalalithaa’s spectacles, wristwatch, veena, neatly stacked books, office table and chair, and photographs of herself and her mother, Sandhya, have been preserved, the source added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/jayalalithaas-poes-garden-house-in-bad-state-deepa/articleshow/88216037.cms||Julie Mariappan

---||Chennai||Take steps to abolish double-locking system at Sholingur temple: Madras HC||CHENNAI: The Madras high court has suggested the HR&CE department to modify the scheme of Arulmighu Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple, Sholingur to abolish ‘double locking’ system. Justice R Suresh Kumar made the suggestion to prevent ‘Theerthakar’ (claiming to be hereditary trustees) from claiming to be part of the temple administration and thereby interfering in the actions taken by the department. As per the system, one of the two keys of the temple’s safe will be in the custody of ‘Theerthakar’ while the other would be in the custody of the department. The court passed the order while rejecting a plea moved by K K C Yogesh, who challenged the November 17 notification of the department, inviting applications for appointment of non-hereditary trustees to Arulmighu Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple. Claiming to be the ‘first theerthakar’ of the temple, the petitioner contended that such notification could not be issued without giving prior notice to him. He further claimed that a division bench of the court had conferred such a right of notice to his grandfather who was also the ‘first theerthakar’ of the temple and the custodian of temple jewellery and valuables. Opposing the plea, Tamil Nadu advocate-general R Shunmugasundaram said the petitioner was neither a hereditary trustee nor is a recognised person to participate in any part of the administration of the temple. Recording the submissions, the court said, “holding of a key of a double lock system can never be a permanent phenomenon as has been directed under the scheme.” However, this court feels that, so long as Clause 16 of the scheme is still there, and it is being practised till date, unless and until there is a modification done in the scheme by referring the same before the commissioner, the double lock system shall continue in the temple, the judge said. As to the petitioner’s claim of right to notice, the court said, “if at all the petitioner has got any little right to have a say on the selections to be made for the post of non-hereditary trustees, in this regard only from the point of view the double lock system, he may have a limited say, for which the petitioner can be permitted to have his objections submitted to the department, which may consider and take into account before finalising the list of non-hereditary trustees.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/take-steps-to-abolish-double-locking-system-at-sholingur-temple-hc/articleshow/88216041.cms||---

S Sekharan, an activist in Korattur, said that within hours of a news report appearing in TOI on the issue Joseph Samuel, who represents Ambattur in the state assembly, inspected the spot and ordered the inlet closed. Subsequently, an earthmover was brought and the inlet was filled with soil. This, the MLA said, would help stop contamination of water in the Korattur lake. A couple of days ago, Sekharan said, chief minister M K Stalin visited the spot and issued orders to officials. He also assured residents that the underground sewage system in Ambattur would be completed and would put an end to sewage flowing into water bodies. Korattur residents had been complaining about sewage mixed water flowing into the Korattur lake from Ambattur through the inlet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/inlet-bringing-sewage-mixed-water-into-korattur-lake-closed/articleshow/88216042.cms||P Oppili
---||Chennai||Chennai: Sewage being pumped into storm water drains, say residents||CHENNAI: Sewage from Vembuliamman Koil Street in Virugambakkam, barely 1km from the Nesapakkam treatment plant, is being pumped into storm water drains for the past week by Metrowater officials because of a blockage due to a road cave-in. This not only harms the environment as the untreated sewage will go into the Adyar river, but also illegal, say activists and residents. A Metrowater official said Anna Main Road in KK Nagar, which is near the Nesapakkam sewage treatment plant, caved in on November 9 during heavy rain. The resultant hole was more than 7 metres deep because of which pipelines were damaged and blocked by debris. “Because of that, sewage from two wards has been blocked for more than a month. Initially, we pumped it out by bypassing one manhole using motors. But, more than 10 MLD (million litres a day) of sewage flows through these manholes. The excess is being pumped into drains as an emergency measure as we have no other choice,” he said. This may go on for another 20 days until the pipelines are repaired, he added. N Viswanathan, an advocate and resident of KK Nagar, said sewage from wards 128 (Kaliyamman Koil Street, Abhirami Nagar, Virugambakkam) and 137 (Vembuliamman koil street and nearby areas in K K Nagar) was being pumped into the drains for the past three days. “During the rain, since the roads were inundated, sewage overflowed on to roads. But now, after the water has receded, Metrowater illegally pumping it into drains is unacceptable,” he said. The capacity of the Nesapakkam treatment plant is 80 MLD of which about 27 MLD comes from these areas and 10 MLD has been blocked now. P Viswanathan, an activist, said lakes and drains are not places to dispose sewage. “In Pallavaram municipality, houses have not been provided with underground sewage connections,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sewage-being-pumped-into-storm-water-drains-say-residents/articleshow/88216043.cms||Komal Gautham
---||Chennai||Stop elephant deaths or face action: Madras HC warns railways, Centre||CHENNAI: Take immediate action to check elephant deaths in railway tracks or face the consequences, the Madras high court warned the union government and the railways on Friday. “We would not mind summoning the highest official concerned and make them vicariously liable for the deaths of jumbos,” a division bench of Justice V Bharathidasan and Justice N Sathish Kumar said. The court then directed the Centre to come up with a proper plan to prevent such incidents and protect the elephants by December 20. This apart, the court also appointed senior advocate P H Arvind Pandian as amicus curiae to assist the court in the issue. The court passed the order while hearing a batch of PILs filed since 2016 to check elephant poaching and deaths due to train accidents. When the pleas came up for hearing, the petitioners informed the court that in the last five years alone over 13,000 elephants have been killed in various such incidents. Earlier, pointing to a detailed order passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in July, Arvindh Pandian said the tribunal had directed the Central Monitoring Committee constituted by the Union ministry of environment and forest to take measures to prevent such deaths, particularly in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The tribunal directed the committee to conduct a joint meeting with Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Southern Railways in this regard within one month. But nothing has been done so far, he added. On February 10, the court ordered a probe by CBI based on a report filed by Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) that Tamil Nadu elephants were being poached by ‘culprits’ from other states and that no action was being taken against middlemen and kingpins. Pointing out the death of at least eight elephants and recovery of 300kg ivory from the possession of criminals, the court wondered as to how only male elephants got ‘electrocuted’ and how such deaths happened despite the presence of a large number of field level forest personnel and their watchful eyes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/stop-elephant-deaths-or-face-action-hc-warns-railways-centre/articleshow/88216044.cms||---

Auroville Foundation, an autonomous organisation which owns the township near Puducherry, has been directed not to cut any further trees till the next hearing of the case on December 17.The foundation had proposed to cut down trees in Auroville to construct roads (Crown Road - encircling the centre of the township, and an outer ring road). Residents, who opposed and protested against this move on December 4, were forcibly removed. This attracted media and political attention.Things turned from bad to worse on Thursday (December 9) when the Youth Centre was demolished despite protests. As unrest grew stronger, plans to cut trees at Darkali forest in Auroville was dropped. But within 24 hours, earthmovers were back on the field prompting residents to seek help from the NGT Southern Zone in Chennai.Petitioners alleged that the foundation did not conduct any feasibility (or impact assessment) study or obtained permission before demolishing structures or cutting down trees. They claimed that the present proposal will have an adverse impact on the environment and newspaper clippings were submitted as proof. After going through these allegations, NGT admitted the matter for hearing on Friday as there need clarity on whether permission is required the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 fur cutting trees from an area, which can be treated as a 'Deemed Forest'.Considering the circumstances, the tribunal issued an interim order without hearing the other side in order to preserve the property. Auroville Foundation has been directed to file its response before the next hearing.Auroville, which was formed in 1968 with representatives from 124 nations including India, was given special status by the Centre by an Act of the Parliament in 1988. The foundation recently decided to expedite development projects and proposed to spend Rs10 lakh for every kilometre of access road to be constructed in the township.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ngt-halts-cutting-of-trees-at-auroville/articleshow/88216047.cms||Ram Sundaram

All counters are not manned at the international arrival terminal because there is a shortage of staff. This is leading to congestion and long queues when two widebody flights arrive back to back at night. The airport authorities have asked the immigration to operate all available counters to ensure that passengers can clear the formalities fast. A senior official of AAI said that there are 48 counters and "we have asked for more people including for the counters that will come up in the new integrated terminal." The airport has requested for more than 100 people. There is a shortage but the existing staff are adequate to manage the current passengers because the number of international flights are fewer. The authorities need to be flexible and man empty counters depending on the number of passengers. "There will be a problem if scheduled flights resume. We have asked for more staff for the existing terminal and also for the new terminal that will be opened. We have already informed the immigration authorities to man all the counters to prevent queues," he added. He also said that more manpower has been requested because the personnel will be ready by the time flights resume and the new terminal is ready. The union government has suspended scheduled flights till the end of January. The arrival terminal has 48 counters. The new terminal will have 108 counters. When the new terminal is completed next year, AAI plans to shift international arrivals to the new building. It will function at the new terminal till the vacated building is demolished and rebuilt. "The discussions are on to shift and plans are being drawn up," said an official. The airport currently handles around 26 international flights per day. The number of passengers will increase in the coming days as Singapore – the most popular destination from the city – has been removed from the at-risk list of countries. “This is beneficial for passengers. Several are ready to travel. The lifting of restrictions will increase flights and passengers,” said an airline official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/immigration-counters-crowded-aai-seeks-more-staff-for-airport/articleshow/88216049.cms||---

When it turned out to be a success we decided to have a second edition in 2018 and the next year we also tied up with UNHCR,” says Supriya Malhotra, area general manager, Chennai Cluster, The Ascott Limited, adding that it couldn’t be held in 2020 due to the pandemic.The tournament will see eight vie for the title. “Each team will have 10 members. We will have diplomats from the consulates of six countries – Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Russia, and the UK. The honorary consuls of various countries will form another team and there will also be a team from UNHCR,” says Supriya, adding that sports, being a positive catalyst, is a good platform to raise awareness about the plight of refugees in India.As of October 31, 2021, there are 43,641 refugees and asylum-seekers who have registered with UNHCR in India. Of that number, 334 individuals were registered in October 2021.“Sport is an important part of the UNHCR's mandate to protect and empower displaced children and youth, as well as promote social inclusion and develop positive relationships with host communities,” says Kiri Atri, assistant external relations officer, UNHCR India. “Sport has more to offer than just physical rewards. It promotes physical and mental well-being, teamwork, friendship, and respect among the forcibly displaced and those who host them, as well as understanding and positive relationships between them and those who host them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/futsal-tournament-aims-to-highlight-plight-of-refugees/articleshow/88216053.cms||---
---||India||‘Danger zone’: Use of masks down to 60%, lowest since Dec’20, say health experts||NEW DELHI: The usage of maks in India has declined drastically to below 60% — the lowest since December 2020 — raising concerns among the health authorities who termed it a “danger zone” for protection against Covid-19. It is even below pre-second wave level, they said. Calling it a “reality check”, NITI Aayog’s member (health), Dr VK Paul, cited data from the Institute of Health Metrics (IHME) depicting how very few people are using masks at present. This assumes significance as many countries are witnessing a major surge in Covid cases, some despite large scale vaccination. Besides, in the wake of emergence of the new variant, Omicron, usage of masks has become even more crucial to prevent transmission. “According to this estimate, we are worse off now than we were before the last surge in Covid cases. In a way, we have again come to a danger zone technically. From the point of view of protection capability, we are now operating at a low level and unacceptable level, risky level,” Paul said, adding: “We are again warning along with the scientific community that it is not yet time to get rid of our masks.” Emphasising that mask is a “universal social vaccine”, which needs to be worn even when a person has been vaccinated, officials underlined that global situation is very “disturbing” with some countries witnessing large number of cases. According to the IHME data, at the start of December last, mask usage was about 65%. As the number of active cases in the country went down, so did the use of masks, dropping to around 60% by mid-February 2021, the data showed. However, as active cases started increasing, so did mask usage. Use of masks peaked to over 80% between May and June this year, around the time when the country witnessed a devastating second wave of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/danger-zone-use-of-masks-down-to-60-lowest-since-dec20-say-health-experts/articleshow/88215995.cms||---

But the development generated some controversy after former Infosys CFO T V Mohandas Pai wondered, in a tweet, if there’s a conflict of interest if a listed company invests in a startup where the founder of the listed company had invested. His reference was to Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal’s investment in Shiprocket.Goyal, however, quickly countered the charge, pointing out that he had exited his personal investment of $100,000 in Shiprocket at zero profit before Zomato stepped in for the investment. He said this personal investment was one of the key reasons Zomato got closer to Shiprocket and its founders, and that’s “how we discovered that there’s potential long-term strategic fit between the two companies”. He said they may continue to follow this strategy of personal investments followed by company investments. Goyal also chided Pai for marking his tweet to Sanjeev Bikhchandani, founder of Info Edge, an early investor in Zomato, instead of to him.Shriram Subramanian, founder of InGovern Research Services, a corporate governance analysis firm, wasn’t fully convinced by Goyal’s response. He told TOI that Zomato “should have been forthcoming on the quantum of the investment into Shiprocket by Deepinder Goyal and the company, and whether Goyal recused himself from the board when it decided to invest into Shiprocket”.Launched in 2017, Shiprocket is creating a seamless logistics data platform that connects retailers, carriers, and consumers across national and international locations. Its shipping solutions are available across 29,000 pin codes within India and 220 countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/zomatos-funding-of-logistics-firm-shiprocket-sparks-row/articleshow/88216101.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Aryan edges out Mardikar, in semis||Bengaluru: Reigning champion Aryan Roopa Anand came up with the goods when it mattered to edge out Pranav Mardikar on the 19th hole in the quarterfinals of the IGU 120th All-India Amateur Golf Championship at the Poona Club golf course in Pune on Friday.The 19-year-old from Mysuru will take on Bengaluru’s Vrushank Balu in the semifinals. Balu had shocked another Bengalurean, second-seeded Akshay Neranjen, 1-up in his quarterfinal. In the other semifinal, Arjun Puri takes on Eastern India winner Yuvraj Singh.Aryan, who overcame the 46-year-old Simarjeet Singh — the oldest golfer in the fray — 4 & 2 in the pre-quarters in the morning, was playing catch-up with Mardikar for the best part of the round. In fact, he seemed to be on his way out, trailing Mardikar (1-up) when the two walked up to the 18th tee box.Aryan, however, didn’t let the pressure get to him and reached the green in two and two-putted for a birdie to make it all-square. The Mysurean, who trains at the Tarun Sardesai Golf Academy near Kolar, took that confidence into the playoff hole and sank a 10-footer for birdie to dash Mardikar’s hopes.The all-Bengaluru clash between Balu and Neranjen too was a humdinger, the former prevailing on the final hole. Neranjen, winner of the Western India title, called the shots early on, going 3-up with birdies on the fifth, sixth and seventh holes.Balu fought back in fine fashion, winning the eighth with a birdie, 10th with an eagle and the 14th hole with another birdie to make it all-square. The 23-year-old, looking to turn pro, went 1-up on the 15th but Neranjen levelled scores on the 17th. However, Balu had the last laugh, holing a clutch 15-foot putt for a birdie on the closing hole.Semifinal line-up: Arjun Puri vs Yuvraj Singh; Vrushank Balu vs Aryan Roopa Anand.Results: Quarterfinals: Arjun Puri bt Tanmay Negi 6&5; Yuvraj Singh bt Arjun Bhati 1-up; Vrushank Balu (Kar) bt Akshay Neranjen (Kar) 1-up; Aryan Roopa Anand (Kar) bt Pranav Mardikar 19th hole.Pre-quarters: Puri bt Shaurya Bhattacharya 2-up; Negi bt Raunil Kukar (Kar) 3&2; Yuvraj bt Aaron Rockey 3&2; Bhati bt Rohan Dhole Patil 2&1; Neranjen bt Shat Mishra 2&1; Balu bt Gagan Vinod (Kar) 2&1; Mardikar bt Prakhar Asawa 4&3; Aryan Roopa Anand bt Simarjeet Singh 4&2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/aryan-edges-out-mardikar-in-semis/articleshow/88216102.cms||---

Stalin, 35, residing on fourth floor of Slum Clearance Board apartment complex in Ayodhyakuppam, was consuming alcohol on the corridor outside his house when the dog went to the fourth floor. A coolie, Stalin who had a dislike for the pet as it barked at him often, devised a plan to vent out his anger under the influence of alcohol. He came close to the pet and patted on his back. Suddenly, he lifted the pet and threw it on to the ground, police said after talking to other residents. As the dog screamed in pain, dog owner Praveen, who lives on the third floor, and other residents rush to the ground floor and found the dof laying in a pool of blood.

---||Chennai||Former RBI governor Rajan suggests new frameworks||Chennai: Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has said that there was a need to create a framework which enables new industries to strategize well and compete globally. Speaking at the Chennai International Centre, Rajan said that apart from creating an enabling environment, there was an urgent need to increase investment in people, decentralised policy making and measure outcomes and strengthen individual rights. On specific individual rights, he said: “Data needs to be controlled with individual protection over who gets to view it. This move will protect an individual from corporate misuse of data and unconstrained government access to data. This will provide confidence for both India and foreign citizens to share their data.” Rajan batted for more people to run management consulting with firms head-quartered in India and service for the rest of the world. Similarly, suggested to set up legal services, telemedicine, edtech and financial services from the country.Negotiating international agreements should be a key focus going forward, and said states must start negotiating on their own towards efficient business frameworks and not wait not for moves from the central government. He also asked to recognize the competitive advantages lying in value-added services like yoga, movies, play and literature born out of our art and culture.Indian manufacturers must be equipped and enabled to compete in the global market, as the domestic market is not enough. For which the government must gradually lift the tariffs and at the right time, to accommodate the manufacturers to compete globally. India is the world largest two-wheeler exporter, however, we continue to import clay-made Ganesha idols from China, he said. On the agri exports: “Not just for NRIs, we must sell the vadaam, vathals and Haldiram’s Bhujia to the rest of the world,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/former-rbi-governor-rajan-suggests-new-frameworks/articleshow/88216106.cms||Mamtha Asokan

Free consultation and medicines will also be provided to the people on the occasion. It is being jointly organised by Bihar Pradesh Ayurveda Sammelan and the state Ayush committee.

Nearly 1500 participants from across the country are being expected to attend this festival. After the inaugural session, scientific sessions will be held on Sunday and Monday. The government officials will also hold a meeting with the manufacturers of Ayurveda medicines. Media coordinator for this festival, Dr Sushil Kumar Jha, said, “The motive behind organising such festival is to create awareness about our indigenous method of treatment and take Ayurveda to every household.” He further said people during Covid-19 times had used several ingredients like ‘giloy’ and ‘ashwagandha’ as supplement. “Ayurveda emphasizes on diversified aspects of dietetics and nutrition, like quality, quantity, processing methods, rationale of combination of food particles, emotional aspects, nature of person, geographical and environmental conditions.

---||Vadodara||Didn’t take the diary noting seriously: OASIS trustees||Vadodara: Trustees of OASIS Institute told the crime branch on Friday that they had no idea that the 18-year-old Navsari girl studying at their institute had been gangraped. Even as cops grilled Sanjeev Shah and Preeti Nair for several hours, they said the duo didn’t give satisfactory replies. “Both Shah and Nair maintained that the girl never told them or anyone else in the institute that she was gangraped. They claimed that the girl had told Vaishnavi Taparia, an employee in OASIS, that she had met with an accident and was injured. Vaishnavi had informed about it to Shah and Nair,” a crime branch official said. “Both the trustees claimed that they asked Vaishnavi to WhatsApp them photos of the girl’s injuries. The girl had suffered injuries on her legs and on one hand. Duo stated that they deleted the photos after seeing them as they were private pictures,” the official told TOI. Both had, however, read the diary wherein the girl had mentioned that she was ‘sexually assaulted’. When asked why they didn’t inform the police about it, the duo stated that they ‘didn’t take the diary notes seriously’. Shah and Nair, however, denied tearing any page of the girl’s diary. “They thought that the girl must have written some fiction story. But, if the girl had written in her diary that she was sexually assaulted, the trustees should have informed her parents as well as the cops. Their behaviour was irresponsible,” investigators added. Interestingly, while both trustees repeated that the girl was like a daughter to them, cops found out that they still haven't met her parents to offer condolences. “We are going to summon Shah, Nair, Vaishnavi and OASIS Institute’s mentors again and all will be questioned together. If their replies aren’t convincing, they may be put under arrest,” said D S Chauhan, ACP (crime). The girl was allegedly gangraped in Vaccine Institute Ground by two men on October 29. She committed suicide in a train at Valsad on November 4 and the cops learnt about the sexual assault after they read the diary kept in her bag. The police said that the girl’s parents never suspected anything as she behaved normally after she returned to her home in Navsari after the alleged rape.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/didnt-take-the-diary-noting-seriously-oasis-trustees/articleshow/88213698.cms||---

Addressing a discussion on ‘Universal Declaration of Human Rights: Norms, Ethics and Law’ organised by CNLU, she said all the values enshrined in human rights were observed in the country even during the ancient period. She, however, regretted that human rights were being violated even by educated people in modern days. Banaras Hindu University’s law faculty dean, D P Verma, explained various provisions mentioned in the preamble of human rights declaration. He too expressed concern over the ever-increasing violation of human rights at various levels and demanded immediate steps for safeguarding the fundamental rights of all the people. At the outset, CNLU social science dean, S P Singh, welcomed the guests and introduced the topic of discussion. Meanwhile, a seminar on ‘Religious Rights of Women and Human Rights in the 21st Century’ was jointly organised by UGC Women’s Studies Centre of Patna University, National University of Study and Research in Law-Ranchi, and Jharkhand High Court Legal Service Committee on the occasion of Human Rights Day.

After the government put forward its proposal of trifurcating the capital with the legislature at Amaravati, the judiciary at Kurnool and the executive at Visakhapatnam, the capital city plans for Amaravati were put on hold. With the high court directing the government and the State Election Commission to not hold elections to the 29 villages, the government started the exercise to create the new urban local body. The high court is hearing a batch of cases by Kommineni Koteswara Rao and others filed in January this year. The petitioner said the government had not conducted elections to these 29 panchayats, along with other panchayats. The state government had told the high court that these 29 villages are not rural panchayats and they were part of Amaravati city. The government also told the court that the previous government, which had created CRDA, did not conduct public meetings in every village to take their views on creating an urban body with all 29 villages. The present government is now rectifying the lapses and will bring in a new legislation to create an urban body, the counsel for the government told the court. Going by what was submitted to the court, the government is planning to create another municipal corporation with the 29 villages of Amaravati. These villages are part of three revenue mandals of Thulluru, Mangalagiri and Tadepalli. The government had merged Mangalagiri and Tadepalli municipalities and created Mangalagiri, Tadepalli Municipal Corporation on March 23, 2021. On similar lines, the government plans to hold public hearings in the 29 villages before announcing the creation of Amaravati Municipal Corporation. The government is also said to be contemplating on creating a police commissionerate for Amaravati with the 29 villages. The previous TDP government too had planned to create a police commissionerate for Amaravati but the proposal was set aside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-mulls-new-urban-local-body-for-amaravati/articleshow/88214321.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Vijayawada||Upkeep of urban health centres under scanner||Vijayawada: Surprise inspections conducted by Y Kiran Kumar, the newly appointed Government General Hospital (GGH) superintendent, has exposed the poor state of urban health centres in the city. In a bid to provide better healthcare, the state government established three health centres in the city under the control of the GGH. These centres are located at Rajiv Nagar, Patamata and Kothapet, which are among the most crowded areas in the city. Duty doctors were allotted to these clinics and super specialty doctors were to make weekly visits. The centres are equipped with a clinical laboratory and an inpatient ward to treat fever cases. But the clinics were neglected by health wing authorities and patients who visited them faced bitter experiences and complained of foul smells and unhygienic conditions. Superintendent Kiran Kumar noticed that many doctors and nurses were not attending to duties and the sanitation contractor had ignored the maintenance of these clinics. Patients complained to the superintendent they were poorly treated by doctors and paramedical staff. “We will initiate stringent action against the staff found negligent in delivering duties. We will soon restore the 20 beds in patient wards in these clinics and arrange oxygen beds. These clinics will be utilised to treat Covid-19 patients in case of a third wave. Specialty doctors will also be posted to these clinics so that patients can get better treatment,” Kiran Kumar said. Meanwhile, doctors who skipped duties were given show cause notice. The centres are equipped with a clinical laboratory and an inpatient ward.

A lunch motion was moved to hear the petition on urgent basis. The high court said the petition will be taken up for hearing on Monday. One Mohammed Farooq Shubli moved the high court challenging GO 16 issued on November 25 to move AP waqf tribunal to Kurnool as “illegal, arbitrary and without application of mind”, and said the state government took the decision without valid reason or rationale. The petitioner argued that the government notified one justice city within the capital city of Amaravati to establish all judicial and quasi-judicial institutions. As the waqf tribunal is a quasi-judicial institution, it should also be part of the justice city in capital Amaravati. He stated that the action of the state government is illegal and against the orders of the high court as there is an interim stay on shifting of offices from the capital. Shubli further pointed out that institutions for minority welfare like waqf board, Urdu academy, AP Haj committee, minority finance corporation, minority commission, Dudekula corporation and Shaik corporation are in Vijayawada. Around 80% of Muslims in the state are dependent on welfare schemes being extended through these institutions and a common Muslim cannot afford to go to Kurnool to approach the waqf tribunal if he or she faces any problem. The petitioner contended the GO as it was stated that the CEO of waqf board sent a proposal as the chief minister to set up waqf tribunal in Kurnool at a review meeting. He said the GO itself is very clear that it was issued to please the chief minister without any application of mind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pil-challenges-go-on-waqf-tribunal-shift/articleshow/88214269.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The Reserve Bank of India has tightened the reporting process for global transactions, exercising its powers under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). Businesses can obtain an LEI from any of the local operating units (LOUs) accredited by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), the body tasked to support the implementation and use of LEI. The decision to have a unique identification number for every legal entity was taken globally after the financial crisis of 2007-08. LEI has been introduced by the RBI in a phased manner for participants in the over-the-counter (OTC) derivative, non-derivative markets, large corporate borrowers and large value transactions in centralised payment systems. “In order to further harness the benefits of LEI, it has been decided that banks shall obtain the LEI number from the resident entities (non-individuals) undertaking capital or current account transactions of Rs 50 crore and above (per transaction) under FEMA, 1999,” the RBI said. It added that for non-resident counterparts/overseas entities, in case of non-availability of LEI information, AD Category I banks may process the transactions to avoid disruptions. The LEI was introduced to improve the quality and accuracy of financial data reporting systems for better risk management. It is used to create a global reference data system that uniquely identifies every legal entity in any jurisdiction that is party to a financial transaction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/firms-sending-over-rs-50-crore-need-unique-id/articleshow/88214636.cms||Mayur Shetty

Speaking at the Chennai International Centre, Rajan said that apart from creating an enabling environment, there was an urgent need to increase investment in people, decentralised policy making and measure outcomes and strengthen individual rights. On specific individual rights, he said: “Data needs to be controlled with individual protection over who gets to view it. This move will protect an individual from corporate misuse of data and unconstrained government access to data. This will provide confidence for both India and foreign citizens to share their data.” Rajan batted for more people to run management consulting with firms head-quartered in India and service for the rest of the world. Similarly, suggested to set up legal services, telemedicine, edtech and financial services from the country. Negotiating international agreements should be a key focus going forward, and said states must start negotiating on their own towards efficient business frameworks and not wait not for the grand moves from the central government. He also asked to recognize the competitive advantages lying in value-added services like yoga, movies, play and literature born out of our art and culture. Indian manufacturers must be equipped and enabled to compete in the global market, as the domestic market is not enough. For which the government must gradually lift the tariffs and at the right time, to accommodate the manufacturers to compete globally. India is the world largest two-wheeler exporter, however, we continue to import clay-made Ganesha idols from China, he said. On the agri exports: “Not just for NRIs, we must sell the vadaam, vathals and Haldiram’s Bhujia to the rest of the world,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/former-rbi-governor-rajan-suggests-new-frameworks/articleshow/88214422.cms||Mamtha Asokan

The permission comes on the back of RBI’s new shareholding norms for promoters and non-promoters in private banks. The RBI has allowed non-promoters to hold up to 10% in a private bank. LIC already holds 4.59% in IndusInd Bank. The permission is valid for one year. IndusInd Bank said that it has received intimation of the new limit in a letter dated December 9, 2021 from the regulator. Earlier this month, the RBI had allowed promoters of private banks to hold 26%, up from the original long-term limit of 15%. Those banks where promoters had already reduced stake would be allowed to hike stake up to the new limit. Ashok Hinduja, chairman of IIHL, Mauritius — promoter entity of Indusind Bank — had told TOI that the bank’s promoter company was awaiting RBI’s operational guidelines as it gave them an opportunity to inject capital to hike stake to 26%. Last month, the RBI allowed LIC to hold up to 9.99% stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank, where the insurer holds 4.96%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-allows-lic-to-hold-9-99-in-indusind/articleshow/88214680.cms||---

Passengers need to sign up, with valid credentials, just for the first time and log in with a valid ID and password. Users have to keep “location” on, go to “booking”, then to “Book QR Ticket”, where they can select ticket type, source and destination stations. After booking the ticket, users can pay via netbanking, debit or credit card, Rupay, Maestro, Master Card, Visa Card or UPI. All major banks and SBI have been linked to the payment gateways.

The accused who procured these weapons on the basis of these fake licences were found to have been engaged as guards in and around Kolkata, including malls and jewellery stores. Five fake arms licences, five weapons and some ammunition were seized from the six persons arrested so far. The accused were produced in court on Friday.  CID said the gang had been operational for a long time and influential persons being involved in it is not being ruled out. The Central Association of Private Security (CAPSI), the apex body of private security agencies in the country, has termed the incident “unfortunate” and sought police help in cleansing these “rotten apples” to ensure continued trust in private guards. “We acted on credible source information about a fake arms licence racket operating in Burdwan district. The SOG launched coordinated raids on Thursday night and arrested six persons across south Bengal. A case was registered at Memari police station pertaining to cheating, fraud and criminal conspiracy. The team also found 36 fake seals of officials of Bengal and other states from the house of prime accused Safik Molla, a resident of Memari,” said DIG (operations) Meeraj Khalid. Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, secretary general of CAPSI, said the fact that guards with arms got over 50% more salary than ones without weapons meant some people would take advantage of the situation. CID sources said they have not found any link of the accused with security agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/arms-licence-racket-busted-6-arrested/articleshow/88214721.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

This process has been started on trial basis. A division bench of Justices Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Justice Madhuresh Prasad (court number 15) became the first bench whose daylong proceedings were streamed live on the Patna high court’s YouTube account created for this purpose. Justice Singh was also the first judge to conduct virtual proceedings of his bench for the first time in the Patna high court in March last year after Covid-19 pandemic started spreading its tentacles in Bihar. Justice Singh is the chairman of the e-committee of the high court while Justice Prasad is one of the committee members. With live streaming of the proceedings, the Patna high court is reported to have become the fifth such high court across the country to adopt this facility. The live streaming of court number 15 will continue from Monday even when during physical hearing of the cases. Afterwards, the live streaming of other courts in the Patna high court would also be taken up. Commenting on the development, senior counsel Yogesh Chandra Verma said it’s a big welcome step by the high court. “Several innovative works have taken place under Chief Justice Sanjay Karol,” he said. Verma, who is the chairman of the coordination committee of all three lawyers’ associations in the Patna high court, said the live streaming of court proceedings will keep the judges and lawyers alert about their performance and behaviour as everything would be visible to common people.

Pankaj Saha (39) and Avijit Mullick (33), both residents of Anandapally, were injured in their abdomens and are undergoing treatment at SSKM Hospital. Both victims supply construction material and had recently ventured into promoting. They were involved in a major argument followed by a fist fight with their attackers, before they were shot at by the accused around 4.45am. Police said they have so far arrested one Victor Bhattacharya in connection with the incident. “A 7mm pistol used for the shooting has been recovered from him,” said joint CP (Crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Victor’s aide, who too was directly involved in the incident, is presently on the run. Special teams from the detective department are trying to track him down. Incidentally, Victor’s uncle, Haradhan Bhattacharya, is a local Trinamool leader. Victor runs a construction material supply shop in the area. TimesViewSeveral areas, especially in the city's south and southeast, have seen a few such incidents this year. The menace needs to be tackled effectively and law-abiding citizens need to be assured that they are safe.“The incident took place at Dakshin Anandapally. The victims were parking and offloading a sand truck when Victor reached there on his bike along with his aide. An altercation ensued, leading to the firing. Victor, the principal accused, was arrested around 7.30am after we received a tip-off and mounted surveillance outside his residence. The shooting took place over some previous grudge,” said DC (SSD) Rashid Munir Khan. On Friday, Haradhan claimed that he had seen Victor return home early in the morning with head injuries. “I demanded an explanation and I knew I had to inform the police. They came to his home and arrested him,” said Haradhan. Police claimed it could be the result of a long-standing rivalry between Victor and Pankaj over promoting and construction material business. Police said they had admitted Victor to Baghajatin Hospital as his head injuries looked serious. Police sources said Pankaj had earlier tried to create trouble just before the assembly elections. “We had warned him. It seems his rivals now wanted to settle scores,” said an officer. A counter case has been lodged on behalf of Victor against Pankaj for allegedly assaulting him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/realty-turf-war-leads-to-gunfire-in-regent-park-2-receive-bullet-injuries/articleshow/88214707.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

He had ‘raj yog’, but has ruined it himself. Being the leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi is not only an individual, but he has dashed the dream and trust of 13 crore people in Bihar. He should be boycotted by all in the state,” the former Gopalganj MP told a news portal on Friday. Sadhu even cited the example of how, according to him, Lalu had rejected a proposal for his elder daughter from a “rajshahi (very rich)” family from Alwar because the boy’s mother was not from the Yadav caste. “Instead, he preferred a simple Yadav family from Khagaul for his daughter’s marriage. Why Lalu accepted a Christian girl for his son is beyond understanding,” he said. When asked whether he was invited to the marriage ceremony, Sadhu burst out, saying: “No one was either informed or invited. ‘Sab chupe-chupe, chori-chori hua. Ek din mein kahin shadi hota hai? Kya kami thi?’. Why did he disown the entire community for a girl. He wants to rule us. We cannot allow him to do so. We will teach him a lesson.” When asked about Sadhu’s outburst, Lalu’s close aide Bhola Yadav lashed out at him for his “statements, which are actually not acceptable in the society”. He said: “For us, our daughter-in-law is an honour and it is our duty to give her due respect and love.” Tejashwi married his long-time girlfriend Rachel Iris at a farmhouse in Delhi. Except former UP chief minister Akhilesh Prasad Yadav and his wife Dimple, only close family members, including his seven sisters and their kin, besides Lalu and Rabri, were present on the occasion. Meanwhile, people in Bihar, especially RJD workers, are anxiously waiting to have a glimpse of the bride. However, this does not seem to happen soon. If sources close to the family are to be believed, a reception will be hosted only after kharmas (inauspicious period according to Hindi calendar) ends on January 14. “Since only three days are left before kharmas, it will not be possible to hold a feast in such a short duration. Even Covid-19 situation will be taken into consideration,” said an RJD leader close to the family. He even indicated that the younger Yadav scion may spend some quality time with his spouse and there are little chances of him coming to Patna any time soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwis-marriage-leaves-his-maternal-uncle-fuming/articleshow/88213414.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Police said raids were being conducted to arrest suspected gang leader Mukesh Kumar alias Kabir and his father Shahjanand Kumar. Mukesh, according to police, is a bike mechanic. Police have recovered spare parts, engines and registration plates of at least six to eight bikes stolen from different areas of western Patna in the last few days from Mukesh’s house. However, the stolen bike fitted with GPS tracker was not found. SHO of Khagaul police station Mukesh Kumar Mukesh said more people were involved in the racket. “Mukesh used to sell parts of stolen vehicles at a cheaper rate to his customers. It seems the criminals were selling the stolen bikes at a very cheap rate to Mukesh. Police are looking for the GPS-fitted bike of one Akash Kumar which was stolen from the premises of Khagaul railway station,” the SHO said. “Akash’s bike was fitted with a GSP device. Its validity had expired. An employee of the firm providing the tracking facility restored the validity of the device after which Akash approached the police on Thursday. The device showed Chak Chechaul Maharajganj village as the location of the bike. The Naubatpur police station was informed about the gang and a raid was conducted. However, Akash’s stolen bike could not be traced. It seems they have now dismantled the GPS device,” he said. SHO of Naubatpur police station Samrat Deepak Kumar said an FIR was lodged in connection with the racket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gps-device-helps-police-unearth-bike-theft-racket/articleshow/88214125.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The UDHD has unseated Darbhanga mayor Vaijyanti Khedia, deputy mayor Badruzma Khan and seven empowered standing committee members – Ajay Jalan, Sohan Yadav, Asha Kishore Prajapati, Shivgtullah Khan, Nusrat Alam, Vinod Mandal and Subodh Kumar – for exempting the agency entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining nine ‘pay and use’ toilets from paying Rs27 lakh. The deputy secretary of UDHD, on December 6, issued an order to Darbhanga DM Thiyagrajan SM to recover the amount. The DM has asked municipal commissioner M K Meena to initiate the process for recovery within a fortnight. Meena on Friday said notices for recovery have been issued to all the nine members of standing committee, including the mayor and deputy mayor, to deposit the amount within a fortnight, otherwise a certificate case would be lodged against them.

Among the sites inspected by the CM were of the sewage treatment plant (STP), upcoming state engineering college, block and circle offices, local parks and various high schools and other institutes for girls. Since Bakhtiarpur is his home block, the CM recalled his childhood association with the town and its various aspects. As to the STP, district and other officials accompanying the CM assured him that the civil works would be completed by March next year. However, holding an engineering degree, Nitish was particularly effusive about the state engineering college under construction there. “I always wanted to see an engineering college at Bakhtiarpur. Today, I feel very happy,” Nitish emoted. He, in the same vein, said the state government has reserved one-third of the seats for girl students and, therefore, directed the officials to construct a comparatively larger hostel for the girls. The CM, having inspected the old block and circle offices, ordered the construction of the new premises, besides instructing that a new veterinary hospital should also be constructed near the new campus. He also garlanded the statue of Shaheed Bhogal Singh on the campus. Nitish also visited Manju Sinha Project Girls High School and the old building of the Manju Sinha Balika High School, besides the primary health centre (PHC) campus and the local park, where he also garlanded the statues of martyrs. The CM visited Ghosbari Ghat, Thakurbari Ghat and Sidhi Ghat on the banks of the Ganga and recalled the existence of an old well near Thakurbari and Sidhi Ghat, which was famous for its safe and sweet drinking water. He also ventured into Ramnagar diara and ordered the renovation of the bridge that existed there.

The convict, Dinesh Baisane, killed the minor by hitting her on the head with a brick as she bit him on hand and scratched him while resisting the rape on December 7, 2020. The court will announce punishment on December 16. The court of N A Anjariya, second additional sessions judge and special judge for Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) Act court, convicted Baisane. “The prosecution has requested capital punishment considering the heinous crime and the brutality involved. The court examined 32 witnesses in just 10 days,” said Nayan Sukhadwala, district government pleader, Surat. Earlier, police filed a 232-page charge sheet in the court within 15 days of the crime. Police mentioned 69 witnesses and evidence. Among the evidence, DNA profiling of the victim and the accused Baisane were submitted. Police also submitted footage of four CCTV cameras in which the accused is seen with the minor. The scientific evidence included blood stains of the deceased on cloth of the accused along with bite injury and scratch marks on the body of the accused. Among the key witnesses were an autorickshaw driver and an employee at a vada pav shop, both of whom identified the accused. Baisane kidnapped the minor girl from her home on December 9 by luring her with a promise of vada pav treat. Later, Baisane took the girl to an isolated place and raped her. As the girl resisted and shouted for help, the accused, afraid of getting caught, killed her. The deceased had got training on ‘good touch, bad touch’ at her school through an initiative of police and NGOs. It is believed that due to the training she tried to defend herself. Both parents of the deceased were working as labourers and they used to drop the minor at a relative’s home during the day time. Baisane was living in the neighbouring home of the relative. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/man-convicted-for-rape-murder-of-minor/articleshow/88213934.cms||---

The incident happened while the “killer bus” tried to overtake the other from the wrong side. The two buses were racing. The bus which knocked her down had 245 pending cases,167 of which are in court. Cops slapped culpable homicide charges against driver, who is absconding. Around 10am, Behala resident Asima Hati was on her way to work with her sister. According to Hati’s son Biswarup, his mother either took the 12C bus (Pailan-Howrah) or route 12 (Badartala-Sealdah) which travels on the same Taratala and Kidderpore stretch. “My aunt and my mother travelled together to the FCI office each day. They usually boarded a bus from Taratala Road. On Friday, my aunt saw the route 12 bus and raised her hands to stop it. It stopped in the middle of the road in a bid to stop the bus behind from overtaking it. After my aunt got on, my mother prepared to set her foot on the footboard. However, the bus behind overtook from the left at high speed and ran over her. I got a call and rushed to SSKM Hospital, where I was told she had expired. It was sheer negligence on part of the drivers,” Biswarup said. DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha said the fatal squad of Kolkata Traffic Police is likely to take over the probe. “This is the kind of rash and dangerous driving we are trying to control. A total of 643 buses have been prosecuted in the past 40 days for rash driving. We will slap the stringent sections against the accused,” he said. Locals claimed both drivers fled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/racing-bus-stops-in-middle-of-road-woman-run-over-while-boarding/articleshow/88214734.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Pointing out a particular property tax assessment of a resident and the alleged misdeeds in the revision of the assessment, TDP 39th ward corporator R Srinivasa Rao alleged that irregularities are happening in tax assessments. The unrelenting corporators of opposition parties surrounded the podium of GVMC mayor, demanding zero hour to discuss the irregularities. Mayor G Hari Venkata Kumari left the council hall at one point as no end appeared in sight and noisy scenes prevailed in the council. Police had to enter the council hall to separate the warring factions. The opposition parties also criticised the one-time settlement scheme and alleged that the government is looting public money in the name of providing rights over the land. CPM corporator Ganga Rao alleged that the GVMC is allocating funds only to certain wards. “Three parks have been allocated to ward 6. The allocation of funds and projects to the wards should be based on the population and the extent of civic issues there,” he said.

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: At-home online entrance exams to be new normal||VISAKHAPATNAM: Online education has taken the centrestage in the last two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The majority of institutions have shifted to online classes and exams. Some engineering colleges and universities in Andhra Pradesh have also offered students remote access to labs. Engineering labs like Matlab, Labview, XiLink, CATIA, AutoCAD and Staad Pro, etc. are being provided through virtual private network (VPN) services. Some higher educational institutions also provided their students with remote access to their libraries. Left with no choice, convocations of several institutions had to be held online. According to educationalists, Covid-19 has brought in a paradigm shift in the way educational institutions operate. But the institutions had to invest heavily in procuring technologies for online learning. Due to the same, the public institutions suffered due to their limited IT infrastructure, funds and resources. Now, moving a step forward, several universities of Andhra Pradesh are planning to conduct proctored at-home examinations to give admissions to the next academic year – 2022-23. This is expected to allay the fears of students as well as their parents, particularly at a time when the new variant Omicron has surfaced in several countries. Gitam vice-chancellor Prof K Sivaramakirshna said they are adopting an at-home online test for the Gitam Admission Test-2022.  “Even though Covid-19 disrupted the academic sector, it has accelerated the adoption of digital technologies and learning. The digital technologies have made it easier for our institute to conduct classes and even exams amid fears over the spread of the disease in physical classes. Campus placements were also done online. Considering the pandemic situation, we have now decided to conduct the exam at the convenience of the students at their homes through an online mode. The proctoring software constantly monitors the body and eye movements of the students and flags any doubtful case,” said Prof Sivaramakrishna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/at-home-online-entrance-exams-to-be-new-normal/articleshow/88214239.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Boozers seek a buzz but known brands hard to find||VISAKHAPATNAM: A recent study by Pahle India Foundation, a New Delhi-based policy think-tank, has found a change in the alcohol buying pattern in the last two years in Andhra Pradesh. The study, namely ‘Responsible drinking in Andhra Pradesh – A survey-based study’, was conducted in five major cities of the state – Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Guntur, Nellore and Kurnool. Almost 100 per cent of the study sample lamented the lack of reliable and recognised brands. About 90 per cent of the respondents pointed to the unavailability of their preferred liquor brands and how they have been forced to change their brand. About 34 per cent of the participants stated that there is also a lack of surety on the genuineness and quality of the brands that are being currently sold. About 40 per cent of the citizens are forced to buy what is available, and 60 per cent are compelled to find other sources. Speaking to TOI, chief executive officer, Pahle India Foundation, Nirupama Soundararajan, said the excise department’s data hints at the fact that consumption value of alcohol has increased by 36 per cent in 2021 compared to 2020 - from Rs 11,811 crore in 2020 to Rs 16,053 crore in 2021. “This is despite decreasing the number of liquor outlets and bringing the entire liquor business under the government’s control,” said Soundararajan. “Therefore, it seems evident that a reduction in alcohol consumption cannot be achieved just by supply-side measures. Instead, the need of the hour is probably to introduce the citizens to responsible drinking. Educating the citizens on responsible drinking will help the government to mitigate the negative impact of excessive drinking, while ensuring that the government also earns revenue,” added Nirupama Soundararajan. “The government must ensure that it listens to the voices of its citizens and ensures that preferred brands of alcohol are made available. This would reassure the citizens of the genuineness of alcohol and bring down the trade of illicit liquor. The government, in consultation with industry, should create a campaign on responsible drinking,” said Nirupama.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/boozers-seek-a-buzz-but-known-brands-hard-to-find/articleshow/88214199.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: 'One in every two consumers starts drinking between 21 to 24 years'||VISAKHAPATNAM: More than 50% of consumers start drinking alcohol between the ages of 21 and 24 in Andhra Pradesh, as per the ‘Responsible drinking in Andhra Pradesh – A survey based study’ conducted by Pahle India Foundation. The study finds they regularly consume alcohol for five to 11 years. Only some 2% of the study respondents started consuming alcohol at the age of 33 and above. Based on the survey, there seems to be a low understanding of individual capacity to consume alcholol and respondents confessed they had to be prompted to stop drinking. Chief executive officer, Pahle India Foundation, Nirupama Soundararajan, said the government and industry should have more open discussions on the concept of responsible drinking and target the youth since 50 per cent of respondents stated they started drinking between the ages of 21 and 24. “The citizens of Andhra Pradesh are not just open, but also keen to learn about responsible drinking. As per the survey, Andhra Pradesh has a large number of alcohol consumers. They do not want to become a public nuisance when they drink, and hence are willing to be educated on responsible drinking. There is a clear case for promoting responsible drinking. This can be achieved by bringing behavioural changes in people when it comes to consumption of alcohol and also ensuring a more socially acceptable ecosystem for the consumption of alcohol,” added Soundararajan. She added that family members are important influencers in driving responsible drinking. “Therefore responsible drinking messages must also be created to educate and inform this group,” added Soundararajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/one-in-every-2-consumers-starts-drinking-between-21-to-24-years/articleshow/88214222.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

With no hope of traffic easing anytime soon, several car and two-wheeler drivers were seen trying to cross over the road divider to take a U-turn. Many cars got stuck on the road divider as drivers tried to escape the blockade. Many harried travellers were also seen trying to drag their luggage across the road to find a way of reaching their destination. Worst affected were ambulances and people on their way to the airport. Faced with the prospect of missing their flights, they could be seen requesting protesters to make way. It took them nearly two hours to reach the airport. Truck operators and drivers of All Punjab Truck Ekta Union, district Patiala have been protesting against the Punjab government for the last five days by holding a dharna on Airport Road near Zirakpur-Patiala Road and Chhat Chowk. Although Zirakpur DSP Harjinder and SHO, Zirakpur inspector Onkar Singh Brar tried to persuade truck operators to lift the blockade, truck operators insisted that transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring comply with their demand to restore truck unions, which were dissolved. Police also tried to divert traffic from Patiala Chowk and Nabha Sahib village through alternative routes. The blockade, which coincided with office closure time, led to roads going out of bounds. Even ambulances were stuck. The jam spilled over on internal roads. Long queues of buses, cars and other vehicles could be seen on Patiala road and other roads. Earlier, a delegation of truck operators from All Punjab Truck Ekta Unit, District Patiala met transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring and they were assured that the truck unions would be restored in the assembly. District vice-president of the union, Amandeep Singh said, “During the 2017 Assembly elections, all truck unions in the state were dissolved by then Congress-led CM Captain Amarinder Singh. As now there is Congress government led by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi in the state, we demanded that these truck unions be revived. We also want increase in transport rates as truck operators were already suffering from the economic downturn.” Reacting to non-compliance of demands, he said that the future strategy would be decided in accordance with the decision taken at state level and if required, they would intensify the protest. The move to abolish truck unions had proven to be “a retrograde one as a new syndicate has emerged, which has monopolised the trucking trade resulting in losses to both owners and traders,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/commuters-try-to-escape-jam-as-truck-unions-block-airport-road/articleshow/88214316.cms||---

Institute of civil engineering department works on the project. Under this project, IIT-Roorkee will carry out the Channel Stabilization (River Training) Works on 17 locations along river Ganga for development of Navigation Channel with Eco-friendly Techniques for capacity augmentation of navigation on NW-1. The work would help in preventing shifting of deeper channel, siltation resulting in formation of secondary channels, erosion of banks and other factors affecting the depth of flow in the main navigable channel, and thus will result in stabilizing the main channel by containing the flow to get desirable flow and discharge patterns,which would ultimately reduce the need for dredging.The project work is to be completed in 25 months. This work is a part of ongoing Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) of IAWI, which is sponsored by the World Bank. The JMVP envisages the creation and improvement of integration opportunities with other surface transport modes, such as roads and railways, so as to improve the overall efficiency of the logistics chain by linking the waterways through various well-equipped terminals and jetties. “This collaboration would ensure advancement of the waterways of the nation, and specially benefit the farmers and the people residing in the entire Ganga belt. It would boost the growth of small-scale industries, create employment opportunities, and facilitate transportation of cargo, thus improving logistics through small jetties leading to the overall development of the region.”,said institute's director Prof AK Chaturvedi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/iitr-inks-mou-with-inland-waterway-authority-of-india/articleshow/88214310.cms||Tapan Susheel

The council had submitted a proposal to this effect in 2018 to the department. The town currently gets 5 MLD water daily from the Bhama river. “The existing water supply line is 25 years old.

The state irrigation department has already permitted the council to lift 2lakh MLD water from the Bhama Askhed dam in 2018, said Kamthe. “We endeavour to start the actual pipeline work within two months,” Kamthe added. Shekhar Gogre, former president of the council, said, “The town should get adequate water supply. Since the water will come from the dam, the town will not face drinking water issues during summer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-clears-rs-66cr-drinking-water-pipeline-for-chakan/articleshow/88214322.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Cops nab 6 involved in Ale Phata armed heist||Pune: The rural police have detected a robbery at an electronic gadgets repair shop located at Ale Phata, which occurred on December 7. The armed robbers had inquired about repairing an amplifier, used particularly in DJ sound systems. The local crime branch team led by senior police inspector (SPI) Ashok Shelke along with the Ale Phata police team led by police inspector (PI) Pramod Kshirsagar have now arrested six men from Ahmednagar district. “All the suspects are related to the DJ sound systems business,” Shelke told TOI. The suspects have been identified as Hrishikesh Pandit (22), Arbaz Shaikh (20), Vaibhav Gore (22), Rahul Chavan (20), Prakash Waghmare (20) and Shubham Shinde, all of whome hail from Nevasa taluka in Ahmednagar. The police are yet to recover the firearm that was used by the suspects. On December 7, around 10.30pm, six armed men had entered an electronic gadgets repair shop and robbed the owner, one Avinash Patade, of Rs21,000 by threatening him with a firearm. “They had entered the shop under the pretext of inquiring about whether Patade could repair a particular amplifier,” SPI Shelke said. During the probe, the police checked on people who were involved in the sound systems business in Pune district as well as in Ahmednagar district. PI Kshirsagar said that one of the suspects had to come to the complainant’s shop for repairing an amplifier. “He had noticed the complainant’s gold chain and he also knew that Patade works till late in the night. As the gang needed money for merrymaking, they hatched a plot to rob the shop owner,” informed Kshirsagar. “We got a tip-off that the suspects were from Ahmednagar. Accordingly, we laid a trap and then took them into custody,” Shelke summed up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-nab-6-involved-in-ale-phata-armed-heist/articleshow/88214326.cms||---

Those who report to work will also be entitled to revised salaries for the days worked from next week onwards. Parab had a closed-door meeting with senior MSRTC officials, including managing director Shekhar Channe, at the bus corporation’s Mumbai Central headquarters on Friday afternoon. Sources said officials discussed the list of workers who have been suspended and those dismissed or transferred. They also discussed whether the stringent MESMA (Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act) should be invoked for the striking workers. Union leaders, however, told TOI that they will continue to protest indefinitely and are firm on their demand. “We will fight till the end and want bus corporation employees to be deemed as state government employees,” said Shashank Rao of Sangharsh ST Kamgar union.  “We are not invoking stringent sections of MESMA as we cannot be so harsh with the workers. We will give them one last chance till Monday, after which we may take coercive action,” Parab added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-resume-get-benefits-or-strike-face-stricter-action-says-parab/articleshow/88215566.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||DLSA receives 3,681 bank related petitions ahead of today’s adalat||Thiruvananthapuram: The number of petitions related to bank recovery matters received by the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) here is a reflection of the financial crisis people are currently under. According to DLSA authorities, they have received as many as 3,681 petitions related to bank recovery issues under nationalized banks ahead of the adalat. The adalat, which is part of the national lok adalat, will be held on Saturday here. DLSA secretary and Sub Judge K Vidhyadharan said that this number is relatively high when compared to adalats conducted in the past and it was a clear reflection of how the pandemic have affected the people financially. ‘’The advantage of such adalats is that it helps to find amicable solutions for problems through mediations that too devoid of any court charges and we hope people make use of this opportunity to settle their cases instead of opting for desperate measures,’’ the Sub Judge said. This is the second offline national adalat being conducted since the second wave of the pandemic hit the country. The first such adalat one was conducted in September this year. But, the participation of people was low during that event. Perhaps the people were still concerned about the pandemic back then (in September), the Sub Judge said, adding that the applications received in the forthcoming adalat were higher than that held in September. The other categories of cases that will be considered in the adalat and their numbers are as follows; Petitions filed by private parties (341), pending cases in the courts (1,396), motor accidents claims cases (789) and petitions by BSNL (89). Court cases include criminal compoundable cases, civil cases, domestic violence cases, cases pending in family courts, land acquisition execution cases etc. Besides the adalat, the judicial first class magistrate courts in the Thiruvananthapuram district court complex here are also holding special sittings on Saturday to dispose of pending petty cases. More than 29,000 petty cases will be disposed of during these special sittings on Saturday. This mainly comprises cases registered under the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance. ‘’The number of petty cases have increased many fold ever since the ordinance was enacted. We have been conducting special drives since December 1 to dispose of such cases. As of Friday, there are over 29,000 cases pending to be disposed of,’’ Sub Judge K Vidhyadharan said.  He added that those who were booked under this ordinance could make use of this opportunity to pay their penalties as it was a non-working day, being a second Saturday. Offenders can pay the penalties by turning up in person or through their counsels. The adalat is being organised following strict Covid protocols. Sittings will be held at court complexes at Thiruvananthapuram (Vanchiyoor), Neyyattinkara, Nedumangad and Attingal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/dlsa-receives-3681-bank-related-petitions-ahead-of-todays-adalat/articleshow/88214339.cms||---

Most of the dung cakes and wood stored at the crematorium has become wet after the rainfall. Ravikant Adsul, the deputy commissioner of KMC said, “In the present condition, the stock of dung cakes used for performing funeral process will last only for the next ten to fifteen days at Panchganga, Kasba Bawda, Kadamwadi and Bapat camp crematorium. The Kolhapur civic body does not charge money for the funeral process performed at these crematoriums, and the dung cakes and wood are made available from the nearby villages. However, the stock has been affected due to the rains.” “During the first wave and the second Covid-19 waves, the usage of dung cakes and wood was more due to high death rate. Earlier also, the civic body had asked people to donate dung cakes, and we had received a good response before the monsoon season. Once again, we appeal to the citizens and social groups to donate dung cakes as presently we have stock for only the next ten to fifteen days. Carrying the funeral process after that will be a big challenge,” added Adsul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-civic-body-asks-citizens-to-donate-dung-cakes-wood-for-funerals-at-crematorium/articleshow/88212974.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Women slam MC over dumpsite, stage peaceful protest||Poviet Kaur Chandigarh: A group of women led a peaceful public demonstration at the Dadumajra dumpsite on Friday, criticising the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation's failure to clean up the open dumpsite. The women, who had gathered from different parts of the city, including the Dadumajra colony, claimed that despite many assurances, the situation at the dumpsite had only worsened. They said they had no choice but to gather peacefully as they were concerned about their children's future and wanted to get their voices heard. “We had earlier visited the residents of Dadumajra and found that close to 50,000 residents were living in inhumane conditions. The stench was unbearable and diseases, including skin allergies, asthma and more had increased. The dumpsite is a major source of air pollution. Promises made to clean the dumpsite have not been fulfilled,” said Samita Kaur, member, Warrior Moms from Chandigarh. She said that while Chandigarh prides itself on being a planned and clean city, its residents suffered the consequences of the open-air dumping site. “It came as a shock to several mothers as they realised that while they were dutifully segregating and recycling their waste, the civic body was dumping it without any separation at the Dadumajra landfill. This has become a cause of health and environmental concern for not only residents here but across the city,” said Samita. The women wrote to the municipal commissioner requesting action. A group of citizens, including the group, went to meet her and were assured that the site would be cleaned. “The municipal commissioner conducted a site inspection but no action was taken after that. Now that even the Municipal elections are around the corner, citizens are determined to intensify this campaign,” said area resident Harinder Singh. Residents also pointed out that, given the way the civic body had handled the waste crisis in Dadumajra, they were not surprised that Chandigarh’s ranking dropped in the Swachh Survekshan rankings for 2021. The women alleged that subjecting area residents to such pollution and filth was a violation of human rights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/women-slam-mc-over-dumpsite-stage-peaceful-protest/articleshow/88214328.cms||---

Inaugurating the delegates conference at Eripuram near Pazhayangadi, he said that IUML need not act as if it is the sole right holder of Muslim community and added that it won’t be acceptable. Vijayan said the decision to entrust Waqf board appointments to PSC was taken by the board and forwarded to the government. “When assembly debated the bill, IUML members only raised a demand for the protection of existing employees of the board. Now, after all democratic processes have been completed, IUML is trying to raise it as an emotional issue,” he added. Pinarayi said the government clarified its stand during its talk with religious organizations that it does not have an adamant stand on the appointment of around 100 staff positions in Waqf board and that the issue can be resolved through talks. “All of them understood the stand. Only League isn’t convinced. Who is IUML? It is a political party belonging to UDF like we are a party belonging to LDF. But, they are acting as if they are the sole right holders of the Muslim community,” he said. Vijayan said government held talks with organizations like Samastha (led by Jifri Muthukoya Thangal) and the Sunni faction (led by Kanthapuram AP Aboobacker Musaliyar), along with other organizations. He added that government’s stand was conveyed to all religious organizations that the decision to entrust Waqf board appointments to PSC won’t be implemented till the matter is discussed with all stakeholders. “All of them, barring League, understood the matter. Who is concerned about your (IUML’s) convictions? IUML can do whatever it wants. We have no issues with that,” he said. Vijayan asked if IUML knew where Muslims of the state stand now. Look at the results of the last elections in Malappuram and you can see that voter support for LDF has risen significantly, he said. He added that UDF and BJP had formed an unholy alliance before assembly elections to campaign against LDF and even now they were trying to discredit the government and oppose development projects envisaged for Kerala. The chief minister said that K-Rail and inland waterway projects were key infra projects that will change the face of the state. He said that if Kerala was to attract new investments, the infrastructure should be improved and government was focusing on the same. CPM’s district conference marks the first district-level conferences to be held in state ahead of the 23rd party conference in Kannur in April next year. The CM is attending the conference for all three days. Apart from 250 select delegates, 53 district committee members are also attending the conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/waqf-row-pinarayi-launches-blistering-attack-on-league/articleshow/88215048.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Rohini blast in mind, cops on toes ahead of Parliament attack anniversary||NEW DELHI: The capital is on heightened alert in the wake of the Parliament attack anniversary on December 13 with security measures being upped at vital installations and markets. Delhi Police is already on the tenterhooks after the tiffin bomb explosion at the Rohini District Courts Complex on Thursday, which left a policeman injured. In the Rohini courtroom blast case, NSG’s explosive analysis unit is learnt to have informally conveyed their initial findings to Delhi Police about the improvised explosive device recovered from the spot, a source said. The details were being used to generate leads about the possible suspects. Investigators haven’t found much luck in the initial CCTV footage analysis as there were no cameras installed inside or outside the courtroom, which could have captured the suspect. “Filtering out a suspect from the large crowd is going to be a humongous task. Several teams are working on it,” said an officer. While a team of Special Cell is solely working on the terror angle involving radicals who may have received bomb-making instructions in the form of videos and step-by-step guide on chat platforms like Telegram, other teams are learnt to be working on two other aspects. “One is to ascertain the possibility of the involvement of Indian Mujahideen remnants/sleeper cells, while the other angle involves finding out whether a gangster adopted this modus operandi to eliminate a rival. Details of the day’s court appearances are being scanned for the latter,” the source said. Meanwhile, Delhi Police has intensified patrolling and increased visibility in crowded areas, including markets and malls. Security outside all courts, including the high court and Supreme Court, has been scaled up. Police are also conducting anti-sabotage checks in high footfall and crowded places, apart from deploying extra pickets in vulnerable areas. The police brass has instructed DCPs to renew emphasis on anti-terror measures, enhance visibility of cops on the ground and intensify night patrolling. Sensitisation meetings with residents’ and market welfare associations are being conducted. Dark spots are being checked and tenant verification is being done across the city. Verification of cyber cafes, SIM card vendors and second-hand car dealers is also under way. Places from where ammonium nitrate can be procured are being scanned. Local cops are extensively checking parking lots, including those of malls and Delhi Metro.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rohini-blast-in-mind-cops-on-toes-ahead-of-parliament-attack-anniv/articleshow/88215052.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Strawberries at hefty price after rain spoils produce in Panchgani, Mahabaleshwar||PUNE: Strawberry lovers will have to spend more this year to eat the fruit after the untimely rain last week affected plantations in Panchgani, Mahabaleshwar and the surrounding areas where it is widely grown. Nearly 2,000 acre of the total 2,500 acre under cultivation has been badly hit, representatives of the All-India Strawberry Growers’ Association said after a preliminary assessment. The damage occurred just when the fruit was in the harvesting stage, they added. Balasaheb Bhilare, president of the association, estimated the loss at Rs 60 crore. “This is the third consecutive year the growers are facing losses. In the last two years, the growers did not get good returns due to the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions. This year, the rain has ruined the berry,” he added. The supply of the fruit will be less than the usual in the markets of Pune and Mumbai where there is a huge demand and it will command a higher price, Bhilare said. The strawberry season begins in November and goes on till March. This year, rain in October stalled the growing, the cultivators said. “The rain hampered the growth of the plants just when they were in the flowering stage. Hence, a very limited quantity is available in the market now. The rate is in the range of Rs 120 to Rs 220 per kg depending upon the size, colour, and taste,” strawberry grower Ranjit Shinde from Mahabaleshwar told TOI on Friday. Over 4,000 farmers grow strawberries in the Mahabaleshwar belt, and it has been their main source of income for years. Growers claimed that they need at least Rs 3 lakh capital to grow strawberries on one acre of land. “I don’t think I will get the capital from the harvest now. Whatever is available on the plantation is in a bad shape. The berries have already developed black spots. We have had to dump half of them. Some income is likely from the rest,” Ajit Patil, another grower from Wai, said. Balasaheb Bibwe, head of the fruit section at the Gultekdi Market Yard, said, “We are getting around 600-700kg of strawberries daily. The intake is less than the average for every year. As several plantations were affected by rain this month, the intake may reduce significantly in the coming days in the market.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/strawberries-at-hefty-price-after-rain-spoils-produce/articleshow/88214331.cms||Sandip Dighe

Goyal made these remarks during a meeting held at Delhi on Thursday, in which industrialists from Ludhiana also participated. Union minister of steel, Ram Chandra Prasad Singh and minister of MSME (Micro Small and Medium Enterprises) Narayan Tatu Rane were also present. Upkar Singh Ahuja, president of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), said, “The meeting chaired by Union minister Piyush Goyal was very successful and we are thankful to the minister for taking prompt action on our December 6’s request. As the representatives of prominent steel makers, including SAIL, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited, JSW Steel Limited and Tata Steel were present in this meeting, it is very likely that minister’s request will be accepted and rates of steel will come down soon.” According to S C Ralhan, president of Ludhiana Hand Tools Association, “After a lot of discussions, it was decided to reduce the prices of steel by the main producers Rs 4,000 per tonne. After personal discussions among the steel manufacturers, they came out with the proposal to reduce the price by Rs 1,500 per tonne, but the minister was insisting for reduction of Rs 4,000 per tonne. He sent a word of caution to the steel manufacturers to check the data and steel manufacturers later on settled at Rs 3,000 per tonne. The minister is still insisting at Rs 4,000 per tonne. The reduction will be announced in a day or two. Further, steel manufacturers have confirmed that the prices of steel will be fixed on monthly basis. This is a great news for the industry, specially MSME sector, as there has been a huge increase in the rates of steel raw materials.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/engineering-goods-makers-hopeful-of-reduction-in-steel-prices-after-assurance-from-goyal/articleshow/88214345.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Besides, relief kits, including food packets and safety and hygiene kits, will be given to the disaster-hit. In October, the Kumaon region received a record-breaking rainfall that led to floods, landslides, loss of human lives and destruction of property.

---||Kozhikode||Kerala: IUML leader’s remarks on Riyas’s marriage draw flak||KOZHIKODE: The objectionable remarks made by an IUML leader, referring to the marriage between PWD minister PA Mohamed Riyas and Veena T, daughter of CM Pinarayi Vijayan, has come in for strong condemnation from various quarters, including CPM and DYFI. While addressing the Waqf protection rally on Thursday, IUML state secretary Abdurahiman Kallayi, without naming Riyas, had said that the former DYFI leader is a newly-wed man (Puthiyappla) in his place and asked, “Who is his wife. Is this a marriage? It is prostitution. One should have courage and guts to say that.” Riyas married Veena, last year. Some IUML cadres chanted slogans against Vijayan with a casteist tone at the rally. CPM Kozhikode secretariat said in a statement that IUML leaders and activists were trying to whip up communal frenzy by raising casteist insults at the CM, trying to insult Riyas and family and also issuing death threats against CM and former minister KT Jaleel. The party also demanded action against those responsible for the same. “The mature stand taken by religious organizations exposed IUML’s stand on the Waqf board issue. Party was planning to create communal polarization by whipping up religious feelings. But, religious leaders refused to lend their support and it has forced the party to hit the streets with slogans. Abdurahiman Kallayi and KM Shaji have insulted CPM and its leaders with a Taliban mindset. Riyas and his wife were insulted using deplorable words,” said the district secretariat. It asked the people to resist such moves that would cause harm to secularism and social harmony. DYFI strongly condemned the statement saying that the remarks by IUML leader were uncivilized and a shame to the cultural heritage of the state. In a statement, DYFI state secretariat said that the opinion put forward publicly by IUML that the marital life of two persons cannot be considered a marriage but prostitution was unsuitable for modern Kerala. “The casteist insults hurled at the CM is an outpouring of the simmering Talibanism inside IUML. It shows the level of Jamaat-e-Islamisation of the party. League leadership, which has a primitive mindset stuck somewhere in the middle ages, is in a mental delirium,” the statement said. With his remarks being criticized from several quarters, Kallayi tendered an ‘unconditional regret’ and said he had tried to refer to the religious point of view on personal life and did not intend to hurt anyone’s sentiments. “I am pained that it happened so and I extend my unconditional regret,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/iuml-leaders-remarks-on-riyass-marriage-draw-flak/articleshow/88215054.cms||---

---||India||India’s Covid toll tops 4.75 lakh, third-highest after US & Brazil||The official death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic in the country crossed 4.75 lakh on Friday with India continuing to record the third-highest cumulative deaths from the virus in the world after the US (8.2 lakh) and Brazil (6.2 lakh). The last 25,000 Covid deaths in the country have come in 64 days, two fewer days than the previous 25,000 fatalities. While daily deaths from the coronavirus have decreased steadily during the last 64 days, the faster rise in toll has been on account of deaths from previous periods being added to the tally. Of the last 25,000 deaths in India, nearly 16,000 fatalities (at least 15,923) were from previous periods added to the toll now either in data reconciliation exercises by states or in keeping with guidelines on Covid deaths issued by courts. A vast majority of these old deaths have been reported by Kerala. Among other states, Bihar recently added around 2,200 previous deaths to its toll. Chandigarh too acknowledged over 100 old fatalities while Punjab has been adding previous deaths to its tally. In earlier months, Maharashtra had recognised thousands of old deaths as Covid fatalities. Some other states too had done the same, though the numbers weren't as high. Kerala has accounted for 67% of the last 25,000 deaths in the country. The state recorded 16,627 deaths during this period. The addition of old deaths, along with the decline in fresh Covid cases, has led to a steady rise in India case fatality rate (death rate) from the pandemic. The current CFR stands at 1.37%, close to the rate at the end of the first wave in the country, when the CFR was 1.41%. With the explosion of cases during the second Covid wave, the CFR had dropped to a low of 1.1% by May 1 this year. For comparison, the current CFR in the US is 1.61% while the death rate in Brazil is way higher at 2.77%. The UK, which has recorded the fourth-highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world, has a CFR similar to India's (1.36%). Meanwhile, fresh cases of the virus continue to decline in the country despite the Omicron scare. India recorded 8,065 new infections on Friday, down from 8,391 on the previous day and 9,226 last Friday. Kerala continues to dominate the numbers, with 3,972 new cases reported in the state on Friday. In recent days, Covid numbers have risen in several states — Karnataka, Delhi, Telangana, Haryana, Gujarat and Rajasthan, among others — but the spikes haven't sustained for long in any of these and other states. India recorded 85 new deaths from the virus on Friday while the overall toll rose by 394 as previous deaths were added by Kerala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-covid-toll-tops-4-75-lakh-third-highest-after-us-brazil/articleshow/88216112.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||Chandigarh||Consumer court tells insurance firm to reimburse claims of car damaged in floods||Ludhiana: District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has ordered an insurance company to reimburse the claim of the customer whose car got damaged due to flooding and heavy rains near Ghumar Mandi. The commission comprising it’s president K K Kareer and member Jaswinder Singh also ordered the company to pay a compensation of Rs 8,000 to the customer Messrs New Idea Farm Equipment Co., Giaspura Road, through one of it’s partners Vimal Gupta. In his complaint, the complainant said he got his car insured from the insurance company on October 1, 2012. On July 24, 2013, the car suffered damage due to flooding and heavy rains when it was being driven in the vicinity of Ghumar Mandi. The car was got towed to Tagore Nagar. The complainant lodged a claim with insurance company on July 25, 2013. Instead of reimbursing the claim, the company demanded flood confirmation certificate from any local authority. In the meantime, insurance company deputed a surveyor (fourth opposite party) to assess the loss who inspected the vehicle and took photographs also. On his advise, the vehicle was taken to Prestige Honda for repairs. Insurance company in its email dated August 14, 2013 wrongly alleged that the vehicle was shifted to workshop after a number of days and no information was given to the surveyor and the surveyor was not given an opportunity to take photographs of the vehicle. In fact, Raj Towing Service towed the vehicle to Lally Motors (P) Ltd, Dhandari Kalan, on July 30, 2013 and raised a bill of Rs 1,500. This fact was duly intimated to surveyor. On July 29, 2013, surveyor was further informed that the vehicle was being shifted to Lally Motors Pvt Ltd, Dhandari Kalan. On July 31, 2013, Lally Motors Pvt Ltd prepared estimate sheet of the vehicle and the final invoice. On August 1, 2013, the complainant made calls to surveyor requesting him to visit Lally Motors Pvt Ltd and take photographs of the vehicle, who in turn, informed the complainant that he had already visited the company. Surveyor further advised that the car should be dismantled. On August 2, 2013, Lally Motors Pvt. Ltd. through email sought the approval of the complainant to start the job of dismantling the car. The claim has been rejected on the ground that for 13 days, the car remained parked at the residence of the complainant and the surveyor was informed only after the car had been dismantled is absolutely wrong. Therefore, the rejection of the claim by insurance company on September 19, 2013 cannot be said to be justified. In the end, it has been requested that insurance company and surveyor are liable to pay a sum Rs 2,50,000 on account of expenses incurred by the complainant for getting the car repaired and further be made to pay towing charges of Rs 1,500, Rs 99,490 on account of repair and Rs 1,50,000 as compensation. It was contended by the insurance company that claim in this case has been rejected on the ground that the loss to the vehicle took place due to negligence on the part of the complainant as he knowingly took the car into flooded area where there was water of more than one feet on the road. However, the commission considered the contention and found the same to be without any substance. “It is a matter of common knowledge that when it is raining and a person is driving the car, he does not intentionally take the car into water logged areas. An element of chance is involved in case of heavy rains. Therefore, simply because the car happened to break down at the place on the flooded road due to heavy rains, it cannot be said to be the negligence on the part of the complainant.” Secondly, the counsel for insurance company contended that car was taken firstly to the residence of the complainant and then to the workshop without prior intimation to the opposite parties and the surveyor appointed by them, with the result that the surveyor could not do his job and also could not take even photographs of the car. The commission held that even these contentions are not tenable considering the fact that in para of the complaint, it has been categorically alleged that the complainant lodged claim on July 25, 2013 and this fact has not been specifically denied in the written statement. “If the information of the loss was given to the opposite parties on July 25, 2013, i.e. the very next day, then the onus stood shifted to the opposite parties to take prompt action and the surveyor should have been deputed immediately to assess the loss. “In the given circumstances, the complainant cannot be found to be at fault if the vehicle kept standing at his residence for days together despite the fact that the intimation to the opposite parties was given on the very next day,” the commission held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/consumer-court-tells-insurance-firm-to-reimburse-claims-of-car-damaged-in-floods/articleshow/88214355.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Finding meaning to life through art||Thiruvananthapuram: It was heart-breaking. She would stay up at nights, molding small flowers out of ceramic. There were hundreds of them. She wanted to make a 3D painting and those tiny flowers with intricately designed layered petals were just a beginning. One day she saw all of them had broken from heat; a seasoned artist would have known it. For a woman in her early 60s, who would take care of her grandchild, drive around her husband and look after household chores, to see her hours of work break away into nothing was painful. Remani Karunakaran would go through the process all over again, handcrafting flowers, trees with even cracks in their barks, leaves to create a 3D painting which is on display at the exhibition of paintings by five women at Flora art gallery. All of them - Shali Thomas, R K Viji, Rachel Jasper, Beena Sunil and Remani Karunakaran would recount the story of their life in the same vein. They had chosen to shelve their love of art for the sake of career and obligations until they decided that - ‘Sometimes you have to do what is best for you and your life, not what is best for everybody else’. It is the line on the Whatsapp profile pic of Rachel Jesper - a structural designer who took voluntary retirement from VSSC. “I took to painting slowly. I would watch my kids learn painting and whenever I found my space, I started painting. It was a stress buster for me,” says Rachel. Often she would slip into unbearable bouts of pain due to rheumatoid arthritis. At the age of 50, she was declared as 50% orthopedically handicapped. These women have been training under George Fernandez. Shali Thomas; a teacher and R K Viji, who had been a lecturer, gave up on their career due to health concerns. “Painting has given us a new meaning for life. We have been training for the last eight years. No matter what, we would finish up our household work and would arrive here to learn as much as we can,” say Shali and Viji. Landscapes, Madhubani paintings and murals numbering around 50 are on display at the exhibition. It is their maiden expo for some of them. “We are exploring all types of painting. It is a laborious task, but it is so gratifying. For us it is also a learning experience,” says Remani Karunakaran. The expo will be on till Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/finding-meaning-to-life-through-art/articleshow/88214357.cms||---

On December 3, Kolhapur district had 27 active cases, which rose to 71 on Thursday. The number of active patients, who require to be admitted to the hospitals, has also increased to 19.  The district health officials said the increased interaction between people and many not following the Covid-appropriate behaviour are the reasons for the increase in cases. Also, the officials claim that most of the new Covid patients reported are vaccinated with at least the first dose of vaccine. Anil Mali, the district civil surgeon, said, “The district had witnessed a drop in Covid cases for several weeks and then the number of fresh cases remained unchanged. However, in the last one week, the cases are steadily on the rise, though it is not an alarming situation but it indicates that we need to be prepared. The re-infection can take place, but vaccination plays a major role in avoiding hospitalisation and deaths. We have observed almost zero deaths in the district for the last several weeks, which is mainly due to an increase in vaccination coverage. So far, 90% of the population has been vaccinated with the first dose and half the eligible population has taken the second dose.” Also, the positivity rate of the district is much less than the state average. The increase in testings has also led to the increased number of cases being reported, he said. Most of the Covid patients are asymptomatic and are home-isolated. However, home-isolation norms is not followed strictly. Meanwhile, it has been observed that most of the fresh cases are being reported in Kolhapur city. In the past one week, 28 Covid cases have been registered in the city alone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-dist-rise-in-covid-cases/articleshow/88213028.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Be humble, Kodiyeri tells party workers||Thiruvananthapuram: The party supporters and activists should not give up humility just because the party could come back to power in the state, CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said in an article in the party mouthpiece. He added that if anyone behaves otherwise, they will be out of the party. He said that the LDF government is not just the government of the CPM, but instead the government belongs to everyone. The party view is that everyone should get justice. Be it party leaders or activists, they should go ahead bowing their heads before the public, he said. Balakrishnan said that the government under Pinarayi Vijayan is going ahead with a firm decision on a corruption-free government and this aspect and care should be emulated in village-level administration as well as the cooperative sector. He said that the party could completely root out factionalism and unlike in earlier times, there were no contests or voting in choosing the office-bearers to various party forums. He said that the party has never banned any kind of democratic elections for choosing the office-bearers to party forums, but would not tolerate factionalism or groupism. The CPM state secretary said that the party’s return to power in the state was a recognition of the development initiatives of the first LDF government. The party asked those who won consecutively twice to the assemblies to step down from contesting, because of which 33 sitting MLAs were changed. All those 33 seats were won by the LDF. The decision was part of reminding the party cadres and leaders that it is not parliamentary posts that is the most important achievement. All those who have committed lapses in the election campaign have been subjected to rectification measures as well. All these shows that the CPM is a different and clean party, he said. Citing the murder of party local leader P B Sandeep Kumar in Thiruvalla, Balakrishnan said that it is not the line of the party to seek blood for blood. Everyone should realise the politics of muscle power by the RSS, and should protest against it in a democratic and peaceful manner, he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/be-humble-kodiyeri-tells-party-workers/articleshow/88215071.cms||---

H S Kingra, president of PAUTA, expressed his utter disappointment that teachers are being forced to take to the streets once again to get their basic dues. He said, “We hope that assurance given by the Punjab government is fulfilled without any further delay. It is difficult to understand the inordinate delay when revised UGC pay scales have long been implemented all over the country except Punjab, Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh. Punjab has implemented the 6th pay commission for all other employees, thus giving them the benefits of revised pay scales.” K S Sangha, secretary of PAUTA appealed to the chief minister of Punjab to take a notice of the long struggle of the teachers and help them get their dues through his personal intervention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pauta-protests-demanding-ugc-pay-scales/articleshow/88214364.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Pipe burst a nightmare for Kanaka Nagar residents||By Kripa MSTHIRUVANANTHAPURAM: G Harikumar, a retired professor who resides in Kanaka Nagar, heard a rumbling sound outside his house on Thursday evening. When he looked out of his house, he saw a swell of water gushing towards the residential area. The water carried along with it soil and waste. Soon the water entered the compound of houses. Harikumar and his wife have been living in this place for 32 years and they have not seen something like that. The residents of around 15 houses in Kanaka Nagar had a horrible evening. A portion of the residence area and the road have been washed away by the strong gush of water. The residents were not able to come out of their houses. The burst occurred at 5.00 pm and the flow continued for two hours. The employees were able to stop the flow of water, but the mud carried by the strong flow of water made the cleaning difficult. Two of the electricity posts in the road were destroyed by the strong flow which was followed by a power failure. The officials stood along with the residents in the night to resolve the necessary issues, including relocating the vehicles to a safe spot. The electricity was restored in the morning itself. The remaining water was drained out by the corporation employees in the morning. They arrived at 7.00 am and cleaned all the affected houses and roads. The officials, including the health inspector, junior health inspector and PH division north executive engineer were present at the spot overseeing the works. “We got scared once we saw the water level increasing. The water entered inside our compound. Fortunately, it did not enter inside the house. The authorities were able to stop the flow of water after two hours of occurrence. The work done by the corporation employees are quite appreciable. The water, soil and waste materials, including plastic waste reached our compound,” said one of the residents. “I was not at home when the incident happened and I rushed to the house because my mother was alone at home. Once, my house collapsed in the rain and I was frightened about the post effects of this occurrence. The whole residential area was flooded with water and mud,” said Jayakumar, a resident. KWA officials said that the works have already started and labourers are being deployed overnight to finish the work by Saturday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pipe-burst-a-nightmare-for-kanaka-nagar-residents/articleshow/88214367.cms||---

Crime branch unit 5 on Friday arrested the informant Nayeem Hashim Qureshi, along with Ashfak Ahmed and Nikolas alias Nikky Nadar, and are looking for two others in the case. The crime branch took over the case from Sahu Nagar police. Police booked them under the IPC for offering bribe to a public servant, abetment, destruction of evidence, criminal conspiracy, as well as under the Arms Act, and NDPS Act. The case pertains to a raid by the Sahu Nagar police earlier this month on the house of Ali Fakruddin Sayyed, a marketing executive working in a multinational company, and his friend Gopal Moopanar, and allegedly recovered 485 grams of Mephedrone or MD worth Rs60 lakh and a country-made weapon. Cops arrested both of them under the NDPS Act and Arms Act. However, family members and friends of Sayyed and Moopanar complained that the duo had been framed. “The turning point was when Sayyed’s girlfriend gave us clear hints of the possible involvement of Nicholas, who was interested in her. After going through the case, it appeared that something was wrong. Then we picked up Nayeem who admitted to having planted the drugs and weapon at Sayyed and Moopanar’s houses. Police are in process of discharging Sayyed and Moopanar,’’ said DCP (Zone 5) Ashok Pranay. Police said that while planting the contraband, Nayeem and Nicholas also took care that the CCTV camera fitted outside Sayyed’s house was disconnected.  Police are now probing how much money Nicholas paid to Nayeem to plant the drugs.  Ashfak confessed that on Nicholas and Nayeem's instructions he had gone to Uttar Pradesh to procure the illegal weapon. Cops will now determine from where they procured the drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-police-informer-2-friends-arrested-for-planting-drugs/articleshow/88215595.cms||Ahmed Ali

CBI had arrested them last week and had already filed the chargesheet in this case where two Youth Congress activists were hacked to death. The bail petition was moved by Surendran, Madhu A, Reji Varghese, Hari Prasad, and Rajesh P, who was CPM’s Echiladukkam branch secretary. The accused had submitted in their bail plea that the investigation against them was complete and hence their judicial custody wasn’t necessary. But, CBI opposed the same and submitted that Surendran had direct involvement in the murder and others were part of the conspiracy. CBI’s counsel had argued that the agency is also conducting a further investigation and releasing these persons will impact the probe. Also, these persons were highly influential and there is a possibility of them influencing witnesses, the probe agency had said. The court, later, dismissed the bail petitions. The case pertains to the murder of Youth Congress workers Kripesh (19) and Sarath Lal (24) on Feb 17, 2019. On Dec 3, CBI submitted a chargesheet against 24 persons including ex-MLA KV Kunhiraman. In the chargesheet, provisions of IPC were invoked against three persons, including Kunhiraman, for obstructing lawful apprehension of accused persons. According to the CBI, there were some ‘politically-motivated attacks and counter’ attacks between the workers of political parties in the area. It was further alleged that the attack on the victims was a retaliation to the earlier attack on one of the accused named in the chargesheet and others, who hatched conspiracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cjm-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-accused-in-periya-case/articleshow/88215090.cms||---
---||Kochi||State drops damages claim against TN||Idukki: The state dropped its compensation claim against Tamil Nadu in the Supreme Court after a high-level meeting at the last minute. The affidavit was prepared by the irrigation department and one of the claims in it was, “Direct the government of Tamil Nadu to make an appropriate compensation to the people for the damage caused to them and their properties who live downstream of Mullaperiyar dam.” Before submitting the affidavit in SC, the chief minister called a meeting and high-level officials said that the state cannot legally seek compensation from Tamil Nadu. The affidavit was then changed at the last minute and a revised one was submitted. A KSEB source said that officials pointed out that the affected people of Mullaperiyar downstream areas are living in the river banks of Periyar and most of them have no title deed for their lands. Idukki district collector also accepted it at the meeting. “In the meeting, the officials stated that if TN raised the compensation issue in court it would turn against the state and so the claim was removed from the affidavit,” the source said. The office of water resources department was unaware of the change in the affidavit, the source added. Water resources minister Roshy Augustine had said that the compensation claim was removed from the affidavit after expert opinion. Talking to media persons in Idukki on Friday, Augustine said Kerala demanded stoppage of uncontrolled water discharge from Mullaperiyar dam. “A committee consisting of Kerala and TN officials should be constituted for releasing water to the Periyar. The control over the dam is more important than getting compensation for the damage of downstream area. Supreme Court was informed of the failure in convening a meeting of the supervisory committee appointed by the Supreme Court after the huge release of water,” he said. Meanwhile, TN continued to maintain the Mullaperiyar water level at the upper rule level of 142ft. Tamil Nadu reduced the tunnel discharge from Mullaperiyar dam to 1,200cusecs on Friday. However, the water level declined in Idukki reservoir to blue alert level on Friday. The blue alert level is 2,395ft, the orange alert at 2,401ft, and red alert level at 2,402ft. The upper rule level is 2,403ft. The water level at 6pm on Friday was 2400.92ft. A KSEB dam safety official said that the water level in Idukki reservoir now is in safe position. “Power generation was also at a high level and there was no rainfall in the catchment areas of the dam. We expect the water level to continue to decline in the coming days,” he said. To limit the water level in Idukki reservoir, KSEB opened shutter number 3 of Cheruthoni dam on Tuesday. As inflow declined, the shutter was closed on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-drops-damages-claim-against-tn/articleshow/88215107.cms||Sandeep Thomas

The health workers from the civic body’s health department and also from the district rural health department offices, who will be involved in the vaccination drive, were given training at two locations on separate days recently. Beneficiaries opting for ZyCoV-D have to take three doses, the second one after 28 days and the third one after 56 days. So far Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V vaccines were available in the region. This will be the fourth vaccine to be administered to those beneficiaries above 18 years, who are yet to take any vaccine. In May and June this year, Zydus Cadila in association with the Nashik-based HCG Manavata Cancer Centre, had undertaken clinical trials of ZyCoV-D on 300 children in the 12-17 years age group and 1,000 adults in Nashik. The trials went off smoothly with none of these children having any adverse event following immunisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-needle-free-vax-to-be-available-at-six-centres/articleshow/88213073.cms||Tushar Pawar

Uber remained the highest payer at most IITs, including IIT Bombay, with a package of Rs 2.17 crore (or $ 287,550). So far this season, IIT Kanpur has pulled in top recruiters such as Axtria, EXL, Graviton, Goldman Sachs, ICICI Bank, Intel, Microsoft, Ola, Rubrik, Samsung, Quadeye, Uber, Tiger Analytics. The IIT Kanpur spokesperson said, “The institute has witnessed excellent hiring trends across sectors this time. The numbers are very encouraging and much higher than the previous years.” The highest international offer at the institute was Rs 2.07 crore and the highest domestic one was at Rs 1.2 crore. At IIT-Kanpur, 49 students have got the Rs 1 crore-plus offers so far—a majority of which were for domestic roles. Including 156 pre-placement offers (PPOs), a total of 1,041 students have already bagged the offers. The institute recorded almost a 60% jump in the offers compared to the ones made in the first pandemic year till this time. International roles too increased from 19 to 47. Around 60 students of IIT-Delhi, which too crossed the 1,000 mark in less than a week, reportedly bagged the coveted Rs 1 crore-plus offers for national and international roles. Placements at most IITs have not only been better than the pandemic year of 2020, but also the year before that. Domestic packages crossed the Rs 1 crore mark this year, with companies offering attractive incentives and stock options. In comparison to the previous editions, this year’s placement has been a speedy affair, said IIT-Roorkee placement head Vinay Sharma. “What took us 45 days last year and a lot of effort has been achieved in 84 hours,” he told TOI, referring to the 1,000-offer mark. Interestingly, while last year saw a slow flow of hiring, this year was rather fast, and the first five days made it clear that the final tally would be better than 2020. At IIT Roorkee, a total of 1,171 offers were made till Day 8 and 11 students bagged jobs with Rs 1 crore-plus compensation. Accenture Japan, Amazon, American Express, Bank of America, Cisco, Flipkart, Goldman Sachs, Hindustan Unilever, Intel, ITC, J P Morgan, Jio Platforms, Microsoft, Myntra, NoBroker Technologies, Ola Mobility, ONGC, Oracle, Paytm, Rakuten Mobile, Societe Generale and Uber, among others, visited the campus. IIT-Hyderabad which has already closed its first phase of placements in a week, saw 466 offers, including 34 international offers made from 104 companies. In all, about 650 students have registered for placements. Phase-1 saw a total of 210 companies that registered compared with about 116 companies in Phase-1 last year. A total of 195 companies had registered in the whole of last year (2020-21). Including the accepted pre-placement offers (PPOs), a total of 427 students have already been placed. This is an improvement over last year when the students placed totalled 305 (including 49 PPOs). B S Murty, director, IIT Hyderabad, said, “We believe in creating an industry-ready talent pool and I am confident that the measures being taken for the past one year will certainly fetch the appropriate dream jobs for the students. The various initiatives taken in the last two years like semester-long internship for BTech, interdisciplinary MTech, industry lectures, industry-defined MTech projects and so on, have started yielding results and we will continuously improvise on it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mumbai-60-students-from-iit-delhi-get-rs-1cr-plus-offers-49-in-kanpur/articleshow/88215610.cms||Yogita Rao

NMC officials said they will check whether the patients had travelled overseas in the last one month. If any of the active Covid patients are found with international travel history, then swabs of these patients would be sent for genome sequencing. Such measures are being taken after some patients have been detected with Omicron variant in Pune and Mumbai cities. Officials said that around 198 patients have tested Covid positive in Nashik city between December 1 and 9. Of these, there are 168 active patients. The NMC health department’s drive for checking travel history of the Covid patients in the city came after the directive of the NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav. Apart from this, NMC commissioner has also directed the heath department of the civic body to trace risk contacts of the present active patients in the city and increase the contract tracing up to 15 contacts at least. NMC officials said that the rate of hospitalisation or mortality rate due to Omicron variant is low, but it is highly infectious. Over 500 international travellers have returned to Nashik city during the last few days. NMC squads have collected the swab samples of 143 of t 500 travellers and sent them to the lab for testing. So far, NMC has received swab reports of 133 international travellers and they all have tested negative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-check-travel-history-of-all-covid-patients/articleshow/88213082.cms||Tushar Pawar

Addressing senior police officials from the rank of SPs and above, the state police chief said that the district police chiefs have a major role in ensuring effective policing on the ground. He said that the police officers should ensure to dispose of the petitions relating to atrocities against women and the SC and ST categories. In complaints relating to domestic violence, the police should conduct a probe immediately without fail, said Anil Kant. The initial police inaction in the case of Anupama Chandran in the capital, citing it as a family dispute, had cost the force heavily. The behaviour of the members of the force while dealing with the public was also a point of discussion in the meeting. The latest instances of severe criticism from the high court against the Pink police and the suicide of a law student in Aluva after visiting the police station, have come as a huge embarrassment to the force as a whole, despite repeated instructions to police officials from time to time for behaving politely with the public. Stressing that investigations into Pocso cases should be completed in a time-bound manner, the state police chief said that the district police chiefs should ensure to provide all necessary records in the cases that are under trial. He said that police should make their presence felt on the roads in the mornings and evenings and should also ensure that night patrolling is effectively undertaken. The police chief asked the officers to take prompt and quick action in petitions received online. The meeting also reviewed the expenditure of the Plan funds and the funds for modernization of the police force, and also took stock of the various ongoing constructions and projects. The progress in community policing initiatives, including Janamythri, student police cadets and the Kadalora Jagratha Samithis, were also reviewed in the meeting. It is for the first time in the last almost two years that a meeting of top police officials is being convened physically at the state police headquarters. Ever since the pandemic broke out in the state, police meetings were being conducted online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/take-prompt-action-in-cases-of-atrocities-against-women-kids-police-chief/articleshow/88215121.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Maharashtra will name reopening date for schools next week||PUNE: The state cabinet will decide about the physical reopening of the remaining classes in schools in a meeting next week, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said in Pune on Friday after his review meeting with the district officials. “In the upcoming cabinet meeting, the chief minister, education minister and everybody else will take the decision on school reopening. Last time, there were instructions on letting the local bodies decide on school reopening in their jurisdictions. However, there was confusion as some people would say yes while others would oppose it. To avoid this ambiguity, we have decided to look at it at the state level. A review of the situation will be taken and then a decision will be made,” said Pawar. About 20 NGOs working in the education sector had written to the education minister explaining the problems that students were facing due to non-reopening of schools. They urged her to reopen the schools with immediate effect, and let parents be the judge to decide whether they want to send their wards to school or not. Mahendra Ganpule, spokesperson of the Maharashtra School Headmasters’ Forum said that there is a need to reopen all schools physically. “The primary students have been out of the system for very long. A statewide order to reopen schools should have been taken last month itself and the onus of taking a decision should not have been left to the local administration. No official in the city wants to take the decision to reopen because of the responsibility that comes with it. Hence, despite the GR to reopen from December 1, they kept deferring it at their level. Hence, we are hopeful that the state cabinet will now decide for all and reopen the schools immediately,” Ganpule said. In July, Covid free villages were allowed to reopen from std VIII to XII after which in October, schools in urban areas reopened for stds VIII to XII while schools in rural areas started for stds V to VII. However, there was no clarity about the remaining classes till a GR last month allowed reopening of all classes from December 1. While most of the rural areas reopened their remaining classes from Std I to IV, local bodies in many urban areas deferred the move for 10-15 days. In Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, the decision to reopen was stayed till December 15. Late in November, the paediatric Covid task force had made it clear that vaccination is not a pre-requisite for reopening schools for primary classes. A letter was sent to the state education department putting the onus on the education department to make the decision. The state's adult Covid task force said the vaccination of students can be carried out after reopening the schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-will-name-reopening-date-for-schools-next-week/articleshow/88214432.cms||Ardhra Nair

Even teachers felt that the paper had a lot of numerical questions, which meant students required more time to complete it. “Every time after the exam, I ask my teachers to solve the papers. Today, even they have been taking a lot of time. Students also complained about the paper being very lengthy,” said the principal of a private school. “One and a half hours were not enough to complete the paper. Many students could not complete it. There were also questions that were quite ambiguous,” a teacher pointed out. Prajwal Sinha, a student, said, “I was able to complete the paper. But since it was lengthy, I could not recheck it. So I am a little worried about how much I will finally be able to score.” Shreya Mukherjee, another student, found the paper to be both difficult and lengthy. “I had to leave some numerical questions. If I had attempted those, the other answers I knew would have been missed. I really don’t know how much I am going to score,” said a worried Mukherjee. Even Keshav Agarwal, who runs a coaching institute, said, “The papers have been quite tough this time. Not just physics, it has happened with other subjects as well.” The Term 1 examination of CBSE, being held for the classes X and XII students, has only multiple choice questions with examinees having to mark the answers on an OMR sheet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/class-xii-students-find-cbse-physics-paper-lengthy-teachers-agree/articleshow/88215122.cms||---

The HC has also imposed a Rs 1 lakh cost on the trust for playing fraud on the Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu). The directive comes after the HC found the trust resorting to fraudulent tactics with regards to the fixed deposit receipt (FDR), which an organisation wanting to start an academic institution, is mandatorily required to maintain in a centralised bank for 5 years. The HC observed that the trust would first create an FDR (Rs 7 lakh as required) with the bank and would take a colour photocopy of the FDR. The very next day, it would deposit the original with the bank to secure the maximum amount of loan (Rs 6 lakh to Rs 6.30 lakh as found in two different cases) and would submit the photocopy with the university to show compliance of the FDR norm. It would never repay the loan till the bank would adjust the money against the maturity amount. In June, when the HC had come across the first instance of such questionable modus by the trust, it had imposed a Rs10,000 cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/reject-trusts-plea-for-starting-new-college-hc/articleshow/88214451.cms||Mohammed Akhef

While residential properties will have to pay Rs75 per month for the same, commercial properties will pay Rs150, and homes from slum pockets will have fixed monthly charges of Rs55 per property. The charges are double that of residential properties for commercial ones as they generate more trash, civic officials said. The declaration of rates was done after corporators raised complaints about overcharging. They claimed some waste pickers were asking for extra money from certain households. The rate card is now expected to keep check on such overcharging. The civic administration said that the charges are applicable with immediate effect. PMC has also appealed to citizens to hand over only segregated garbage to waste collectors. Residents are expected to gather wet and dry garbage separately before handing it over. An official from PMC’s solid waste management department said, “We have asked bulk waste generators like societies and commercial establishments to set up wet waste generation plants on their premises.” Meanwhile, the administration has warned shopkeepers to take adequate steps to ensure no waste is dumped outside their establishments. Offenders involved in burning of garbage will face a fine of Rs500. Throwing garbage in public places like nullahs, rivers, ponds and streams will attract a fine of Rs200. A fine of Rs1,000 will be imposed against spitting at public places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-declares-charges-for-garbage-collection/articleshow/88214461.cms||---

While delivering a lecture virtually at the ICFAI University, Hyderabad, on the topic ‘Three decades of economic reforms in India,’ he said that even in 1991 there was extensive criticism of liberalisation moves and the policymakers were accused of being hand-in-glove with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). “We need consensus building. Therefore, as we move ahead with the reforms, a lot more consensus with all the stakeholders will be required. So, timing and sequencing is also important,” he said. Recently, the government had to withdraw three farm laws and the Prime Minister, while announcing the decision, had stated that the government was unable to convince the stakeholders about the laws. On improving the farm productivity, he said there needs to be consolidation in land holdings as the current size of land holdings is very small. As per the latest information available from agriculture census, the average size of operational holdings has decreased from 1.41 hectares in 1995-96 and to 1.08 hectares in 2015-16. Even as the former RBI governor batted for economic reforms, he pointed out that they alone cannot propel economic growth as the non-economic factors are also equally important in achieving economic growth. He said that the government must step up investments in the health and education sectors to ensure higher well-being of citizens. He stated that the government expenditure on education should be above 6% of GDP and also called for participation of public and private sectors in health and education systems to improve their delivery. --||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/timing-of-reforms-is-important-rangarajan/articleshow/88214465.cms||---

The deceased were identified as Priya, 36, wife of Nadukkandi Prakashan, and her daughters Punya Theertha, 13, and Nivedya, 4. According to relatives, the woman was depressed after her husband’s death 11 months ago. Prima facie it seemed like the mother had poured kerosene over herself and the children before setting fire, said police. Priya’s mother-in-law first saw the fire in the room after she woke up from sleep on hearing loud cries. Though the neighbours rushed the three of them to hospital, they could not be saved. Punya Theertha died on the way, while Priya and Nivedya died after reaching Kozhikode government medical college hospital. Prakashan died of a heart attack in January and Priya had not come to terms with it. Punya Theertha was a student of the Nochad higher secondary school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/woman-two-daughters-die-of-burn-injuries/articleshow/88215144.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The cleaning of most schools was also allegedly done when they had reopened and since then they haven’t been sanitised. A GHMC official said that before physical classes resumed, they conducted a special drive as they were asked to clean and sanitise schools since they were shut for more than a year. “Now, there are no instruction for us to clean inside schools,” the official added. When TOI visited a few government schools in Cyberabad region, teachers and students complained that they were scared to attend physical classes. “We have 105 students in class 6. There are no rooms available to divide class into two sections. How do we maintain physical distancing?” asked Amar Shekar Reddy, headmaster, Zilla Parishad High School (ZPHS), BHEL. Reddy said they have 1,100 students and despite requests to GHMC, the school was not being sanitised. He added, “We get water only for two hours in the morning. The tank is emptied by Urban Residential School students staying at our premises temporarily even before our students come to school.” Students said that they are scared to come to school ever since a positive case was reported in class 8 a couple of weeks back. “My classmate tested positive a few days back. I am very scared to come to school, but there is no means to study from home. Even washrooms are not clean,” said Spandana M, a class 8 student. In ZPHS, Serilingampally, the headmaster pointed out how classes are overcrowded. The school has about 1,400 students. “We can’t do anything about maintaining physical distancing in classroom or sanitisation,” said L Shanker, headmaster of ZPHS in Serilingampally. He said “Our campus was sanitised in last week of August before physical classes resumed. After that, no one came to sanitise the school.” An official from the education department confirmed that teachers have brought this issue to their notice and that they would look into it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-schools-wait-to-be-sanitised-students-suffer-as-classes-packed/articleshow/88214462.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||India||2nd dose coverage, doorstep drive take daily vax rate up||NEW DELHI: Average daily vaccination improved significantly in December to 78.66 lakh doses per day — up from 59.32 lakh doses in November and 55.77 lakh doses per day in October. The rise is mainly driven by expanded coverage of second dose and rollout of the government’s door-to-door vaccination campaign. More than 7 crore doses have been administered during the first 10 days of December so far, whereas a total of 17.79 crore doses were given during November. After a major ramp-up in first dose coverage in September, vaccinations dropped significantly during October and November in the wake of festivities and drop in Covid cases. Many people were overdue for their second dose. This prompted the government to roll out ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign in November. Next, the average daily vaccination in December bounced back to the September level when as average of 78.69 lakh doses were given per day.

---||Aurangabad||Reject trust’s plea for starting new college for next 10 yrs: HC||Aurangabad: The Bombay high court bench at Aurangabad has restrained all universities in Maharashtra and the state government from entertaining any plea, for the next 10 years, by the Prerna Bahuuddeshiya Shikshan Santha — an education trust at Khultabad in Aurangabad — for starting a new college or school. The HC has also imposed a Rs 1 lakh cost on the trust for playing fraud on the Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu). The directive comes after the HC found the trust resorting to fraudulent tactics with regards to the fixed deposit receipt (FDR), which an organisation wanting to start an academic institution, is mandatorily required to maintain in a centralised bank for 5 years. The HC observed that the trust would first create an FDR (Rs 7 lakh as required) with the bank and would take a colour photocopy of the FDR. The very next day, it would deposit the original with the bank to secure the maximum amount of loan (Rs 6 lakh to Rs 6.30 lakh as found in two different cases) and would submit the photocopy with the university to show compliance of the FDR norm. It would never repay the loan till the bank would adjust the money against the maturity amount. In June, when the HC had come across the first instance of such questionable modus by the trust, it had imposed a Rs10,000 cost. However, it again found the trust resorting to the same method in relation to its proposal for an arts, science and commerce college for which it was not even having the basic infrastructural facilities. The HC bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice Sanjay Mehare observed on November 29: “It is clear to us that Prerna Trust has been repeatedly indulging in acts of forgery and that too in the field of education. The courage shown by the person responsible for the fraud is astonishing.” To prevent recurrence of such tactics by any institution across the state, the HC went on to pass some specific directives against the Prerna Trust and some general directives to the state government, department of education and the universities to follow. The directives against the trust included refusal of permission to admit students and quashing and setting aside of the impugned (under challenge) letter of intent dated January 31, 2019 and the final permission dated September 21, 2020 (granted to the trust for starting an arts, science and commerce college). “If any further act of fraud is noticed by the university or education department, the Prerna Trust should be permanently prohibited from opening a new college or school,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/reject-trusts-plea-for-starting-new-college-for-next-10-yrs-hc/articleshow/88213111.cms||Mohammed Akhef

A meeting was held by the union Jal Shakti ministry to review the project. Bapat along with union minister Gajendra Shekhawat, officials from the ministry and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), including civic chief Vikram Kumar, were present. Bapat told media persons that the project would be implemented, and all required steps taken to ensure its execution. “We will initiate steps to renew the contract, besides there will be an attempt to get more funding from the agency considering the cost escalation,” he added. Bapat claimed that there were delays by the civic administration in handling the project. “It looks like that the PMC administration has not worked on the project actively, which has led to delays. About 11 STPs are to be set up under the project, of which land at five locations is still not in possession of the civic body. Formation of dedicated project implementation unit is still incomplete. Many things are still on paper. We are now reviewing everything. Some clearances are expected next one month,” Bapat said. The project aims at treating sewage by constructing STPs and laying of sewage line network.Bapat said that the PMC was expected to submit the documents to JICA for further clearances in next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1-month-deadline-for-civic-river-pollution-project/articleshow/88214469.cms||---

Officials said teams consisting of 20 people have been formed in all the 100 wards to inspect construction sites and industrial units, where cleanliness often goes for a toss.City health officer Dr Sathish Kumar said sustained efforts were being taken to keep the spread of dengue under control in the wake of the intermittent rain in the recent weeks. “Fogging is done regularly as the importance is on eliminating the mosquito breeding sources. The number of domestic breeding checkers with the city corporation has increased to 1,000 from 800. Each of them has been instructed to visit every house allotted to them once in a week.”The officer said people would be fined if they were found to be not keeping their premises clean. “Apartments and industrial units are fined up to Rs 50,000, if there are mosquito breeding sources on their premises.”He said 23 city residents were now undergoing treatment for dengue at various hospitals. “While fresh cases are being reported, the number has come down slightly this month, compared to last month.”Another city health officer, who didn’t want to be named, said their special focus was on areas where water supply frequency was less, as people would store water for a longer number of days. “Fresh water stored in containers without covering lids will act as a suitable ground for mosquito breeding. Domestic breeding checkers are sensitizing people on the need to cover the containers. Abate larvicide is also poured in water tanks and containers, as a precautionary measure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-forms-rapid-response-forces-to-curb-dengue-spread/articleshow/88214471.cms||V Devanathan

Akbar said that he decided to renounce his Islamic faith following the alleged incidents of several Muslims putting smiley emoticons below the posts and comments in social media related to the death of chief of the defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat in a helicopter crash. Akbar said that even top leaders of Islam are have not opposed such actions by ‘anti-nationals’ who dishonored a brave military officer and he could not accept it. He said he has lost faith in the religion and he posted a video on his Facebook page on Wednesday about it. “Today, I am throwing away an attire I received by birth. From today onwards, I am not a Muslim. I am an Indian. That is my reply to those people who posted thousands of smiling emoticons against India,” Akbar said in the video. The post attracted severe criticisms from Muslim users on Facebook and some even used abusive language. Akbar too was seen using abusive words to reply to some of those comments. Meanwhile, several user posts supported Akbar and slammed those who abused him. Though the post later ‘vanished’ from Facebook, it is widely being circulated on Whatsapp. Later, Akbar made another post in which he said, “The nation should identify those who smile at the death of the CDS and punish them.” This post too saw hundreds of supportive and abusive comments. Speaking to TOI, Akbar said that several anti-national activities happen on social media and smiling on Rawat’s death was the latest example. “Majority of the users who commented with smiling emoticons and celebrated the news of Rawat’s death were Muslims. They did this because Rawat had taken several actions against Pakistan and militants in Kashmir. Despite seeing these public posts, which insulted a brave officer and the nation, none of the top Muslim leaders reacted. I cannot be part of such a religion,” he said. He said that though he and wife will convert to Hinduism and would do the procedures to change the religious details in their official records, he will not force his two daughters to convert. “It is their choice and I let them decide. Ali Akbar, who was the state committee member of Bharatiya Janata Party, quit the post in October following some disagreement with the party leadership. Earlier in 2015, Akbar, made a sensational revelation that he was sexually abused by an ‘Usthad’ during his time in a madrasa.

The initiative was conceptualised by Deepak Harne, regional manager (Pune) of MTDC. Such cultural programmes have been arranged at 25 out of 33 MTDC properties in the state, from December 20 till January 1. Harane said, “We have brought on board local tribal dancers, folk singers, artists, magicians and more for these programmes to entertain our guests during their stay at our properties. This initiative will help local artistes earn revenue and more importantly, will also provide them with a stage to showcase their skill as they have not been able to do so for the last 20 months due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.” For instance, at the MTDC resort in Mahabaleshwar, there will be a magic show performed by a local magician; at the property in Panshet, there will be performances by a local folk band; meanwhile, at the accommodation facility at Matheran, there will be tribal dance performances for guests. This apart, guests will also be able to participate in or watch traditional games like gilli-danda, lagori, and so on. “Earlier this month, there was some hesitation among guests who had already made their bookings for the Christmas-New Year’s Eve week, due to cases of the Omicron strain being found in the state, and unsurety about whether there might be another lockdown. But we assured them that a 100% refund would be initiated in such a situation. We have 95% bookings throughout our properties for the last 10 days of the year, and we expect to be booked to full capacity allowed by the government in another two or three days,” said Harane. As per the annual rates revision, there has been a 5-7% increase in room charges across all properties, but additional perks have also been introduced, keeping safety precautions in mind. “We will also introduce a complimentary breakfast for all days from December 20 onwards,” added Harane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/local-artistes-to-entertain-guests-at-mtdc-resorts/articleshow/88214481.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

They had tested positive when they were checked again after confirmation of the septuagenarian’s Covid variant. All three have been kept in a separate ward. They all have milder infection and their line of treatment is the same as any other Covid patient with milder symptoms,” said a senior official at GG Hospital in Jamnagar. Dr Maharshi Desai, an internal medicine specialist from Ahmedabad, said that international reports indicate no or relatively less lung involvement in the infected patients – the biggest factor that sets it apart from Delta variant that brought the devastating second wave across India including Gujarat. “The studies so far indicate that there would be a higher spread if it spreads in general population. But there would be less hospitalization and mortality compared to Delta variant. However, it should not be taken as a respite – our goal must be to ensure all precautions as we can reduce its spread right at the start,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/omicron-symptoms-sore-throat-cough/articleshow/88214495.cms||---

In a recent video conference with all states on Covid-19 situation, officials of the Union ministry of health suggested that states increase testing and tracing mechanisms just as they were before. Telangana — like Jharkhand, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Nagaland, and Rajasthan — is experiencing a shortage of ventilator consumables. The state is also one of 14 states, which though it has trained personnel, has less than half the number of ventilators installed. Other such states include Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Manipur, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, Nagaland. Telangana has 1,708 delivered units and 1,565 installed units. Several crucial items are available in sufficient quantities in the state, such as dexamethasone injection 4mg/ml, remedesivir injection 100mg per vial, and IVIG injection. However, the state does not have any Methylprednisolone 40 mg/dl injection on hand. During the video conference, it was said that seven states reported roughly 85% of the cases in the last two weeks. Only two states, Kerala and Bihar, accounted for over 85% of all deaths. In the last two weeks, India conducted 11,555 tests per million (TPM) people, compared to the global average of 12,274. Telangana reported 10,446 TPM in last two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-has-meds-but-lags-on-ventilator-front/articleshow/88214480.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The students have requested the varsity to make necessary changes in the special examination time-table. The special examination is held for those candidates who could not appear for semester examinations due to Covid-19 and related reasons. The examination is held for first, second, third, fourth and fifth semester candidates. The bone of contention is that all these semester examinations are held together. Rajashekar Hebbar, principal of P Dayananda Pai Satish Pai Government First Grade College, Car Street, said that currently examinations are being held for those candidates who could not appear for examinations due to Covid-19. Along with them, the examination is also being held for students who had a backlog in the second-semester examination. “As a result, suppose a candidate has a backlog in the second semester, and has not written the third semester exam due to Covid, the candidate will be unable to appear for both. On Wednesday, we have had three such incidents, and the same has been made known to MU officials,” he added. A senior professor complained that MU is allowing only students who had Covid-19, and were unable to appear for the examination, to appear for the special examination. “However, it has not considered students, especially from Kerala, who could not travel to their colleges due to travel restrictions. Why not allow them to take the special examination?” he questioned. P S Yadapadithaya, vice-chancellor, Mangalore University, said that varsity will allow students who have been inconvenienced to appear for the examination, during special examinations held for sixth-semester candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mu-special-exam-candidates-request-to-change-time-table/articleshow/88213779.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

The café had to shut on April 11 this year due to a financial crisis caused by pandemic-induced restrictions. According to Ashish Shukla, director of Chhanv Foundation, the non-profit body that backs the Sheroes initiative, financial assistance from people across the country and abroad helped the cafe reopen. “Last seven months have been tough and have taken a toll on our mental health. Now, we are looking forward to continuing the journey that empowers us and gives us hope to lead a better life,” Roopa said. Shukla added that “the focus is now on reviving our mission, making the lives of survivors better through our ‘Vision 2022’ programme, under which we will induct new survivors, providing them better employment opportunities.” The rent of Sheroes Home (a rehabilitation centre) is paid by the revenue generated from the cafe. The educational project for survivors is also aided by the cafe, as are other campaigns and projects of the foundation. The café operates on a unique concept of ‘pay as you wish’. “The foundation is currently bearing the medical expenses of 60 acid attack survivors. Besides, it is paying Rs 10,000 to 30 survivors associated with its different projects, including the café,” Shukla said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/sheroes-caf-run-by-acid-attack-survivors-in-agra-reopens-after-7-months/articleshow/88213790.cms||---

Apart from this, the civic body has also reduced the water tax collection target from Rs 60 crore to Rs 50 crore for the current financial year. The revenue of the NMC through property and water tax collection has already been affected due to the pandemic. The NMC has already introduced an amnesty scheme for the property tax defaulters, but could collect only Rs 14 crore during the last one-and-a-half month. The amnesty scheme will remain in effect till January next year. NMC officials said that apart from this, 97 of 150 staff of property & water tax department have been deployed for the voters programme, while other staff will be deployed on election duty during the upcoming civic elections slated to be held in February. Hence, it would affect the recoveries of the property and water taxes from the tax defaulters. So far, NMC has collected property tax amounting to Rs 100 crore and water tax amounting to Rs 30 crore. NMC serves show-cause notice to 57 employees The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has served show cause notice to 57 employees for allegedly showing laxity in the process of bringing over 22,000 properties under tax net during the last two years causing financial losses to the civic body. The NMC had conducted a survey of all properties around three years ago and found 59,000 new properties that were not under tax net. The civic body conducted hearings of the property owners and brought 37,000 properties under the tax net.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-property-tax-collection-target-reduced-to-rs-130cr/articleshow/88213125.cms||Tushar Pawar

Do not dump garbage here. This place is under the surveillance of CCTV camera. Fine will be levied, if there is any violation,” the banners read.Sanitary inspector S R Gerald Sathiyapunithan said the CCTV cameras were not installed at all and the banners were put up only to deter people from dumping waste on roadsides. “The move has brought positive changes and people have stopped dumping garbage at the places where the banners have been erected.”Sathiyapunithan said a couple of years ago he had made use of the CCTV cameras that were installed at stores and houses to monitor the places where garbage dumping was rampant and the same had paid dividends. “I am planning to adopt the same modus operandi wherever possible in the wards under me. Meanwhile, we have bettered our door-to-door waste collection performance and urged the residents to segregate degradable and non-degradable waste at source. While there is an initial reluctance among the residents, we are confident of winning their full cooperation soon,” he said. As per the instruction of higher officials, Sathiyapunithan said, he was in the process of reducing the number of bins in his wards. “Recently, we had removed a bin from an important stretch at Lakshmipuram in ward 57. Now, the stretch is cleaner. We have created awareness among the residents on the importance of keeping their surrounding areas clean and now they are handing over waste to sanitary workers without any fail.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/banners-warn-public-against-dumping-waste-in-open-spaces/articleshow/88214492.cms||V Devanathan

All these students are asymptomatic and in stable condition. “The health of the children is stable. All the children are asymptomatic and their health is fine. They are doing good,” said civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat. Nashik district collector Suraj Mandhare on Friday said that the samples of the students would be sent for genome sequencing to Pune to find out if any of them had the infection of ‘Omicron’ virus. This is being done to be on the safer side, he added. According to the officials of tribal development department, out of the 349 tests conducted – including 102 boys, 103 girls, teachers and non-teaching of 18 and Central Kitchen Staff of 126, only 15 tested positive. “Given the atmosphere here, there was a student who had a runny nose. It wasn’t severe but we thought of getting the test done. After the rapid antigen test conducted at Wadivarhe PHC came back positive, we took him to Ghoti where the RT-PCR test was conducted on December 6,” Tanveer Jahagirdar, the headmaster of the school, said. The officer with the help of the taluka health officers quickly conducted the RT-PCR tests of all 349 on the same day and all of them were kept isolated to ensure the infection – if at all – did not spread. “The test reports that arrived on Thursday evening reflected that 15 children were positive and hence all of them were shifted to the civil hospital,” the officer said. Project officer of Integrated Tribal Development Project Vasha Meena and even Zilla Parishad chief executive officer Leena Bansod are monitoring the situation. A senior officer from the tribal development department said that all the remaining students and teachers have now been quarantined for the next few days as a precautionary measure and the school has been converted into a containment zone. “The children will not travel to their homes but stay in school, where the medical teams have been posted to take care of them,” the officer said. In the meantime, two teachers from two separate Zilla Parishad schools in Trimbakeshwar taluka have tested positive for the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/15-students-2-zp-teachers-in-two-schools-test-ve-in-nashik-district/articleshow/88213142.cms||Abhilash Botekar

TOI got access to a key document in which the standing committee on defence, consisting of 20 Lok Sabha MPs and 10 Rajya Sabha members, passed certain recommendations in both houses and sent them to MoD for approval after holding a meeting in Delhi recently. The standing committee, which came across resource crunch and challenges in infrastructure development often faced by the Cantonments, recommended implementation of the CSR scheme. All Cantonments Citizens’ Welfare Association welcomed this recommendation. Its general secretary Jitender Surana said: “CSR is necessary to uplift the needy sections of the society.” The MoD replied this could be suitably considered and intimated it to the committee. When the standing committee pointed out that the nature of Cantonments was such that there was only limited trade and business activity and practically no industrial unit’s presence, the MoD told the committee it was pursuing with state governments to provide funds to Cantonments as given to municipalities for carrying out various developmental activities/functions. The funds have been received from six states. Members of the standing committee also recommended the MoD extend necessary budgetary support to Cantonments so welfare initiatives taken by the Cantonment boards continue without any break. The 15th Finance Commission, while allocating grants to the states, has for the first time issued directions for distributing proportionate share of grant to the Cantonment boards in States during current financial year, MoD told standing committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mod-likely-to-approach-pvt-firms-on-csr/articleshow/88214516.cms||Sunil Mungara

In reply to questions raised by Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee, junior health minister Bharti Pawar said “in occasional isolated cases, vaccination certificates were generated for people who were deceased or those who did not receive the vaccine on the day”. She said, “These cases are due to inadvertent data entry errors by vaccinators in updation of vaccination data of second dose beneficiaries.” The ministry also said as per operational guidelines, “each beneficiary was to be verified prior to administration of a vaccine… to ensure the rightful beneficiary receives the vaccine dosage and there is no misuse”. In a separate answer, Pawar said the government also received reports of fake Covid-19 vaccination camps and vaccines from Maharashtra, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. “The ministry of health has directed the state governments to investigate these instances and take stringent legal and administrative actions so that such fraudulent activities are not repeated in future,” she said. Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya also fielded questions on the status of booster doses. He also asserted that India has administered the first dose of the Covid vaccine to 86% eligible population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/got-reports-of-fake-vax-camps-in-some-states-govt-tells-parliament/articleshow/88216175.cms||---

---||Delhi||Riots: Court Irked At Missing Prosecutors||New Delhi: Taking strong note of the absence of the special public prosecutors (SPP) in northeast Delhi riots cases, a court has said this is the state of affairs with regards to the riots cases, which are sensitive in nature, and this leads to delay in disposal of the matters. The court said it had found in several cases that the SPPs, to whom the cases are assigned, didn’t appear in the hearing and the matters had to be adjourned without conducting any proceedings. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat directed the deputy commissioner of police (northeast) to take it seriously and appoint new special public prosecutors to represent the state in riots cases. The court directed the DCP to send a report in a week. The court noted that two prosecution witnesses were present but they could not be examined in the absence of the SPP. It was submitted by the naib court that the head constable had called the SPP who said he was busy in some matter in Delhi High Court. Thereafter, another SPP was contacted who also expressed his inability to appear in the case. Another SPP, too, did not respond positively. “This is the state of affairs with regards to these riot cases... for which this special court was set up. These cases were assigned to a panel of special public prosecutors formed by police so as to ensure proper and effective prosecution of the cases,” the court said in an order on Thursday. It further said the counsel for the accused had also vehemently objected to the conduct of the SPPs, saying that the matters were being adjourned unnecessarily on account of their absence due to which the incarceration of the accused in jail got prolonged for no fault of theirs. The judge said he had communicated this state of affairs to the DCP earlier, too, with instructions to take corrective measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/riots-court-irked-at-missing-prosecutors/articleshow/88215893.cms||Usha Das

The ‘Jan Akrosh Mocha’ that began from Idgah Maidan opposite the civil hospital, passed through the ND Patel Road, Shalimar, the collectorate and reached the statue of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar.

Jaykumar Rawal, who is in charge of the party affairs in Nashik, said the morcha, where hundreds of people had participated, was the reflection of the people’s anger against the MVA government. “The situation in the state is deteriorating day by day as one after the other ministers are being caught in controversies and have had to tender resignations. The state government also failed to take appropriate steps to save the reservation for the Maratha community and the OBC community,” he said.

---||Goa||Goa: Low on numbers, tourist cops yet to make impact||PANAJI: A stroll along the busy beach stretches of Calangute and Baga shows that nothing much has changed there even after specially-trained tourist police personnel began patrolling the area. Vendors, touts, hawkers, children selling colourful bands, and masseurs are seen freely moving about, despite the shack policy barring them from the beaches. The beach shacks too continue to occupy as much space as possible, with their umbrellas, decks beds, chairs and tables, and canopies. While tourist police attend to petty crimes — resolving fights among tourists or between tourists and lifeguards, search for a missing child, attend to complaints against shack operators playing loud music — vendors seize the opportunity to slip on to the beach to sell their wares and services. The number of masseurs and vendors on beaches may have significantly decreased over the years, but they continue to operate, as many of them conduct their business in connivance with shack operators. Want a head massage? Pay Rs 200. Throw in another Rs 200 to get a shoulder massage too, and enjoy the pampering while relaxing on a deck bed at no extra or hidden charges, and indeed, at a cost that is much lower than that charged by spas. “If we question masseurs, shack operators rescue them claiming that they are their staff hired to do odd jobs,” a tourist police personnel said. Shacks on popular and crowded beach stretches have one or two women attendants who work primarily as masseurs. The number of masseurs swells after 5pm, even as police patrol the Calangute, Baga and Candolim beaches 24x7. A policeman said that though North Goa has over 70 tourist police personnel, there are only four female cops. “After 6pm, we don’t engage with female masseurs and most of the time they are defended by shack operators,” he said. Additionally, police said that nabbing vendors and masseurs is not easy as beaches have multiple entrances, enabling them to make their entry strategically so as to evade them.“When they spot a cop from afar, they disappear or will find shelter at a beach shack,” another tourist cop said. He said that besides keeping a watch on vendors, they have other tasks to handle. A lot of their time, he said, is taken up in resolving fights. “We have to first resolve the fight, take the injured to a doctor, and hand over the accused at the respective police station. All this can easily take an hour or two to bring under control,” the policeman said. They also have to attend to complaints about shacks overcharging or a tourist not paying the bill. Last week, a tourist from South India was detained for not paying a bill of Rs 2,000. “The man was in his twenties and had fled home and appeared mentally disturbed. He had no money on him. We contacted his family, and after they paid, he was released,” the cop said. No doubt, the presence of tourist police has helped bring some semblance of order, but it is foolish to expect the illegalities to stop completely, locals said. A local resident said that vendors are a vote bank and, naturally, get protection. Complaining about shacks playing loud music, locals said they stop when police arrive only to restart once they leave. “A shack in my neighbourhood plays loud music right from morning, everyday. I have called the police several times, besides the tourism department. They directed me to contact the tourist police,” Calangute resident Cais D’Silva said. Shacks playing loud music beyond 10pm is quite common, as it is a tactic to attract domestic crowds, a policeman said, adding that when questioned, operators point fingers at 10 others who are indulging in some or the other illegality. “We send reports to the tourism department about the excesses of the beach shacks,” he said. A senior tourism official said that it cannot be accepted that police cannot control vendors or masseurs, or that they cannot act against a female vendor or masseur. With regards to illegalities by beach shacks, he said, whenever a team is sent for inspection at any beach, it is cleared before the team reaches. To fight it, he said that they will introduce an app to collect pictorial evidence of violation of the beach shack policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/low-on-numbers-tourist-police-yet-to-make-impact/articleshow/88215168.cms||Bindiya Chari

Terming the arrests of activists as sheer violation of human rights, the farm outfit turned the last session of the farm protest into one of sloganeering, demanding that just as the central government repealed farm laws, it should make way for release of activists who have been lodged in jails for a long time now. The farm activists waved photos of arrested Gautam Navlakha, Roma Wilson, Varvara Rao, Surendra Gadling, Soma Sen, Sudha Bhardwaj (who recently got bail), Stan Swami (who died on July 5). Last year, BKU Ekta Ugrahan h had observed the day on December 10, during the ongoing farm protests, saying human rights violation were increasing in the country. The farm activists had to face flak from the government and were branded as Naxalites and Maoist sympathisers. The other protesting farmers’ groups had then distanced themselves from the BKU Ugrahan action, saying they had nothing to do with it. Farm outfit president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said, “The central government continues to crush the voices of opposition. Many intellectuals have been put behind bars for raising voices in favour of the rights of the people. The government is scaring people by laws like AFPSA and massacre in Nagaland has unmasked the face of the government,” Activist Navsharan Kaur said, “The government is branding all those who raise voice against its excesses, (calls them) urban naxals or anti-nationals. It is the biggest form of the violation of human rights.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/release-intellectuals-writers-arrested-under-uapa-farm-outfit/articleshow/88215171.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Goa||Goa: 30 per cent quota for women in govt offices if Congress voted in, says Priyanka Gandhi Vadra||MARGAO: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said on Friday that the party was committed to the empowerment of women in Goa, and assured recruiting more women in the police, providing credit of up to Rs 1 lakh for women self-help groups, and reserving 30% of jobs for women, if Congress came to office in the forthcoming assembly polls. She accused the BJP government of being anti-women and against empowerment of women which, she said, was evident from rising cases of crimes against women. Vadra said that the forthcoming polls were the last and only opportunity for Goans to save Goa from the hands of those who have no concern for the people and for the welfare of the state. “If the state goes once again into the hands of those who have no concern for Goans, Goa, which is such a beautiful state, could be destroyed,” she cautioned, while addressing a women’s convention at Margao. “Congress desires that Goa comes back into the hands of the people of Goa, that all decisions about issues concerning Goa be taken in your favour. Therefore, do not give your vote to any party that doesn’t talk about development, about issues concerning women and their safety, about health, education and environment.” She promised that Congress would work dedicatedly for the welfare of the people and solely in the interest of Goa if it came to office. “You have seen BJP for 10 years, you saw its greed and its false intentions. If you want to save Goa, you need a government that will be in your service dedicatedly,” she said. Referring to the 2017 polls, she accused the BJP of stealing the people’s mandate. “In the last election, you voted for Congress, but you were robbed of your government, only for the purpose of looting the state’s resources. When such is the government’s mentality, people can get but disrespect. And when elections come, they hardly talk of giving jobs, protecting the environment and empowering women, but only play on your emotions,” she said. Speaking on the three linear projects that have seen stiff opposition from locals, Vadra said that the projects were meant to “benefit just one industrialist who is in the business of importing coal”. “What are these projects for? There’s nothing of benefit for Goa’s people or for the state’s development in these projects. Pollution will increase, hills and rivers will be ravaged, and the Dudhsagar waterfall will be destroyed by these projects,” she said. Earlier, interacting with ‘Amchem Mollem’ student activists in Margao, Vadra urged people not to vote for parties and politicians who are supporting the destruction of Goa’s environment, even as she pointed out to the opposition voiced against these projects by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/30-quota-for-women-in-govt-offices-if-cong-voted-in-says-priyanka/articleshow/88215192.cms||Govind Maad
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Health minister Veena George warns of action against junior doctors||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Junior doctors have started boycotting all the emergency services in the medical college hospitals even as health minister Veena George has made it clear that there will be no more talks with them since their main demand has been accepted. Veena said as per the decision reached between the government and Kerala Medical Post Graduate Association (KMPGA) on December 7, within 48 hours the government has appointed 373 non-resident junior doctors in various medical college hospitals. The other demand of increasing the stipend for them has been requested to the finance department. Another demand for the NEET-PG counselling for the first year is not under the jurisdiction of the state government since the matter is already under the consideration of the Supreme Court, the health minister said. “The representatives of the association was happy with the decision taken in the discussion and they had immediately informed the government that they are withdrawing the strike. However, the junior doctors who are on strike now were not part of those who had come for the talks with the government,” she said. Hence, the government is not ready to justify the strike called by a section of junior doctors and there will be no more talks with them. The appointment process of the junior residents will begin from Monday, she added. On the complaints that the striking junior doctors were expelled from the hostel on Thursday night, the minister said no such directives were given by the government. “I have urged all the principals of the medical colleges not to take such decisions and no one should be expelled from the hostel,” Veena said. However, the striking junior doctors are of the view that the order issued by the government appointing non-academic junior doctors lacks clarity. There is no mention about the date of joining of these junior residents and a clarity is needed on this. There is also no mention about the increase in stipend in the new order, said Dr Ajithra, president of Thiruvananthapuram unit of KMPGA. The strike has adversely affected the functioning of medical college hospitals as the junior doctors have been manning the OPs and also the duties inside the wards, labour rooms and operation theatres. The intensive care and emergency department of the hospitals have been affected. Their senior counterparts, Kerala Government Medical College Teachers Association (KGMCTA), has also pledged their support to the strike called by the junior doctors. The health minister has warned of stringent action if they continue with their agitation, which would affect the normal functioning of MCHs. “A section of PG doctors was deliberately causing impediment to Covid-19 and non-Covid treatment in the state. Steps will be initiated under the Epidemic Diseases Act if the doctors did not withdraw the strike,” the health minister said. The government has issued orders appointing 50 junior residents in Thiruvananthapuram, 72 in Kozhikode, 72 in Thrissur, 75 in Kottayam, 61 in Alappuzha, 36 in Kannur and seven in Ernakulam medical colleges. They will be getting a stipend of Rs 45,000 as consolidate pay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/min-warns-of-action-against-jr-docs/articleshow/88214550.cms||---

The state had earlier banned the sale of liquor and meat in 22 wards of Mathura Nagar Nigam. Additional district magistrate AK Srivastava said, “After state orders, sale and purchase of meat, eggs and liquor will be completely banned in 25 wards which fall under Soron pilgrimage area. Instructions have been sent to the district excise officer and designated officer of the food safety department for a time-bound action in this regard.” According to sources, there are no restrictions on consumption as of now. The BJP government had accorded the status of "pilgrimage" site to Soron town on October 28. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had tweeted about the fulfilment of a decade-old demand of the Sanatan dharma followers. Also known as 'Shukar Kshetra', the town of Soron houses a ‘kund’. The believers come here for ‘visarjan’ (immersing) the mortal remains, mainly the ashes. The location has its mention in various spiritual literature. Soron is also believed to be the birthplace of saint Tulsidas who had composed Ramcharitmanas. It may be recalled that a part of Mathura district - an area of 10 sq-km with Sri Krishna Janambhoomi as epicentre - was declared a pilgrimage site on September 10. Seven other places within Mathura, linked with the lives of Lord Krishna and Radha, were already declared pilgrimage sites by the state in the past. These include Vrindavan, Gokul, Barsana, Nandgaon, Goverdhan, Baldev and Radhakund.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/now-up-govt-bans-sale-of-liquor-meat-eggs-in-25-wards-of-kasganj/articleshow/88213826.cms||Deepak Lavania

Congress has been quarantine for the last six years and is trying to recover from the same in this election but people are preparing to send them to quarantine again,” he said. Tandon said that the Congress had only indulged in scams during their 14-year long tenure, while the BJP gave impetus to development in the city. On pollution, Tandon said that an oxygen purifier had been installed at Transport Chowk to keep the city's air clean and all this happened during the BJP's tenure. Greenery in the city has increased from 38% to 46%. Cycle tracks have been built along the roads for convenience of cyclists, he said. Taking a dig on AAP, he said Chandigarh did not the Delhi model but Delhi needed the Chandigarh model. He also said that adjoining villages would be connected and developed as a model village by eliminating Lal Dora in Chandigarh. Box: ‘BJP, Cong not concerned with common man’ Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Chandigarh co-incharge Pradeep Chhabra on Friday inaugurated the election office of AAP candidate Harjinder Singh Bawa from ward 34 in Sector 46. Chhabra said AAP would work on developing all 35 wards. Chhabra said that both parties had done nothing except for looting people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-trying-to-recover-from-quarantine-but-it-wont-work-tandon/articleshow/88214554.cms||---

Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat convicted Kaleem Ahmed after he pleaded guilty to the offence under Section 2016 (harbouring offender who has escaped from custody or whose apprehension has been ordered) of the Indian Penal Code. As per the prosecution, Kaleem helped Pathan in hiding after allegedly committing the crime and it was corroborated by their mobile phone locations. The cops further alleged that Kaleem helped Pathan in purchasing a new mobile phone. “The charge was explained to him in Hindi in the presence of his counsel and the accused voluntarily pleaded guilty to the charge. Since the accused has voluntarily pleaded guilty to the charges framed against him under Section 216 IPC, he is held guilty and accordingly convicted,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/one-convicted-of-sheltering-man-who-pointed-gun-at-city-policeman/articleshow/88215907.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Agra||Mathura admin no to Hindu group for ‘aarti’ at Shahi Idgah||Agra: The Mathura administration has denied permission to the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha for “aarti” of Lord Krishna at the Shahi Idgah mosque on Saturday. Following the refusal, the right wing group announced it would launch a "referendum" for construction of the Krishna Janambhoomi temple from January 26, Republic Day, at Kurukshetra, the land where Krishna gave 'Gita gyan’ to Arjun. This is the second time in less than two weeks that the administration has stopped the Mahasabha from going ahead with their programme at the Shahi Idgah. The outfit had earlier announced it would install Krishna’s idol at the Shahi Idgah on December 6. In a letter issued to the national president of the organisation, Rajyashree Chaudhuri, the district administration said permission has not been granted "in the interest of law and order and peaceful atmosphere of the city". Section 144, prohibiting public gatherings, is in force in the city since November 24 and will continue till January 21. Chaudhuri said, “Earlier, they (the administration) refused permission citing communal harmony in the city. This time, they have said it would violate Covid norms. These are lame excuses. We will launch a referendum from January 26 and obtain 10 crore signatures for construction of the temple in Mathura and submit it to the President for intervention.” The controversy over a Krishna temple in Mathura was sparked off last year after a Lucknow lawyer and five others filed an appeal in a district court claiming that the mosque is exactly where Krishna was born. As of now, a local court is hearing a bunch of petitions seeking "removal" of the 17th century mosque. In the past few days, senior BJP leaders have spoken out about construction of a grand Krishna temple in Mathura. While UP deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya tweeted that foundations of mandir in Ayodhya and Kashi have begun and preparations are on in Mathura, state cabinet minister Chaudhary Laxmi Narayan Singh said, a Krishna temple will be built in Mathura alone and "not in Lahore or Rawalpindi". Then, BJP MP from Ballia Ravindra Kushwaha said, "When the government can repeal farm laws, it can also withdraw the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 to pave way for a temple at Krishna Janambhoomi in Mathura."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mathura-admin-no-to-hindu-group-for-aarti-at-shahi-idgah/articleshow/88213837.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Deshmukh was transferred from a Bhusawal-based trauma centre to the primary health centre at Pimpaldari. Deshmukh told TOI, “Within a few days of my posting at Parbhani, the Adhoc IAS officer offered me any post of my choice and demanded two months’ salary as a bribe. He asked me to pay a sum of Rs 10,000 and claimed that other officers are paying too.” He said after he refused to budge, the said officer allegedly started harassing and ill-treating him. The resignation letter, a copy of which is with TOI, states that some of the subordinates close to the said IAS Adhoc officer lodged a complaint against Deshmukh, due to which a show-cause notice was issued to him.  “I never met the medical officer, so there is no question of demanding bribe. He has failed to meet the given target for vaccination,”said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/parbhani-mo-blames-zp-ceo-of-harassment-resigns/articleshow/88213187.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Additional Public Prosecutor Ravindra Kumar, appearing for the police, submitted that as per his instructions, the FSL report will be ready by May. Special Judge Ajay Kumar Jain said this would substantially delay the trial of all the people and directed the official to file the report latest by December 12. “In case director FSL does not file the report on 24.12.2021, coercive action will be taken against FSL officials,” the court said in the order. The court had on October 8 ordered the director to file the report by October 18, however, it was not filed. The court on October 18 then noted that the arguments on charge could not be heard due to the fact that a voice sample of one of the accused was not received. “Director, FSL has already been requested to send FSL report, however, no response is received, therefore, FSL is directed to depute some other official of higher rank to be present on the next date of hearing to apprise the status of FSL report qua accused,” it had said. On November 17 too, the court had noted that the FSL report had not been received till date and directed the DCP (Special Cell) and director (FSL) to ensure filing of the report by December 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-warns-officials-of-action-over-delay-in-fsl-report-in-narcotics-case/articleshow/88215911.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Controversy over unified Holy Mass erupts again||Kochi: Controversy over the unified mode for conducting Holy Mass in the Syro-Malabar Church has erupted again as Cardinal George Alencherry on Friday issued a direction to ‘correct’ the exemption to the unified mode of Mass provided to certain dioceses in the Church. The Church, in a statement, said they received a letter from Rome on Friday which stated that an entire archdiocese cannot be provided dispensation from implementing the liturgical rules approved by the synod. However, Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese issued a statement saying that they had also received a letter asking for clarity on the exemption and the archdiocese has explained the same to Rome. In the Syro-Malabar Church, various dioceses had been following different modes of Mass. The difference is that the priest faces churchgoers during the ceremony in certain dioceses and faces the altar in others. The unified way is a combination of both. Apart from the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese, Irinjalakuda and Faridabad diocese, the rest of the dioceses switched to the unified format from Nov 28. This happened after bishops of these dioceses issued dispensation from following the new format using Canon 1538. The Church later wrote to the Oriental Congregation in Rome seeking clarity on Canon 1538. “We received a clarification letter on Friday dated Dec 9, undersigned by the Oriental Congregation prefect and secretary. As per the letter, it has been made clear that by using Canon 1538, an entire diocese cannot be exempted from implementing liturgical rules approved by the synod and issued as an order by the major archbishop,” the Church said. It further said that the Cardinal Alencherry has written to all bishops about the directions given by the oriental congregation. However, Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese, in a statement, said that a letter sent by the Oriental Congregation on Dec 7 seeking clarity on the dispensation was received by archdiocese apostolic vicar Mar Antony Kariyil on Dec 9. Mar Kariyil explained the context of the dispensation orally, and the same would be submitted in writing, the archdiocese said. Meanwhile, Athiroopatha Samrakshana Samithi, an outfit of priests, claimed there was no mention of cancellation of dispensation in any letters received from Rome. Convener Fr Sebastian Thaliyan claimed the decision for dispensation was taken with the blessings of the Pope and that the reports about its cancellation were false.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/controversy-over-unified-holy-mass-erupts-again/articleshow/88214569.cms||---

Their samples will be sent for genome sequencing as they’re suspected carriers of the Omicron variant. Director of health services Dr Ira Almeida said that two of the passengers that tested positive were a couple who travelled with their two children. The children were negative, though one under five was not tested in accordance with protocol. “The seven-year-old child was tested. The husband and wife and their two children have been placed at the Cansaulim primary health centre,” she said. Health minister Vishwajit Rane said that 237 travellers who arrived from the UK were tested on arrival, and three tested positive. “84 high-risk contacts of today’s (Friday) UK flight identified & advised 14 days home quarantine, with retesting on the 8th day,” he tweeted. Almeida said that travellers from high-risk countries have to undergo 14 days of home quarantine if they test negative on arrival. The first suspect, a Russian national who had tested positive along with three others, was discharged from hospital and transferred to the primary health centre, Cansaulim, on Friday. As of Friday, seven travellers are in isolation, and all are asymptomatic.

Wife and brother-in-law of the man, who had returned from Zimbabwe last week, also tested positive for the new strain, official sources said. His wife had returned with him from Zimbabwe and his brother-in-law had gone to receive the couple at Ahmedabad.  Omicron has been classified as a 'variant of concern' by the World Health Organization (WHO) after it was first detected in South Africa last month. Jamnagar Municipal Corporation (JMC) officials said the samples of the 72-year-old NRI’s relatives were sent for genome sequencing at the Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) in Gandhinagar and the results were received on Friday. Vijay Kharadi, Jamnagar municipal commissioner, said, “All three patients are being treated at the dental hospital and the clinical condition of all is stable. A medical team is continuously monitoring their health.” The other members of this family have tested negative and seven students, who were taking tuition from one of the family members, have also tested negative. The state-run GG Hospital in Jamnagar has created a special 400-bed facility at the dental hospital to treat Omicron variant patients with ICU and oxygen infrastructure. Meanwhile, 11 other people tested positive for Covid-19 in Jamnagar on Friday. These were among 177 people who had attended the marriage of Jamnagar-based industrialist’s son at Jaipur. In the last three days, a total of 27 people have been found to be infected. JMC health teams identified those who attended the marriage soon after the industrialist’s family tested positive and isolated them and everyone is being tested. Meanwhile, the municipal corporation has started random rapid antigen test at five public places like bus stations and markets. JMC also asked police to become strict on mask violation in public places. Large number of marriages in the city have also become a matter of concern now for the civic authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/two-more-test-positive-for-omicron-variant-in-jamnagar/articleshow/88214513.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Quarantine fears ground international fliers||AHMEDABAD: Shwetal Charan, a resident of Germany who was to arrive in Ahmedabad in mid-December to meet her parents, cancelled her ticket on Thursday. “I was to travel with my nine-year-old son. He is not vaccinated so that was a concern,” said Charan, who had planned a three-week visit. “Moreover, there are too many restrictions with regard to taking RT-PCR tests on arrival, waiting till the reports arrive, and then leaving the airport.” She added: “After a 12-hour journey, it would have been chaotic and exhausting to go through so many protocols and therefore I decided to cancel my visit.” With Covid-19 cases rising and the Omicron variant of the coronavirus deepening fears, travellers have cancelled India trips for social and other engagements. This is primarily because of the stringent protocols for RT-PCR testing and quarantine laid out by different states.  Anuj Pathak, president, Tour Operators and Travel Agents’ Association of Gujarat (TAG), said: “The new variant of concern has sparked worries among passengers who had planned to travel to India.” Pathak added: “People schedule visits ranging from two to four weeks and they are worried that despite precautions if, by chance, they test positive they will have to quarantine themselves for at least two weeks.” He added: “Nobody who is travelling for a social visit or a leisure break would take that chance. A businessman from the US who is my client recently cancelled his tickets to Ahmedabad.” Indeed, international passenger footfalls have taken a hit at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad. “Passenger arrivals peaked in November at SVPI airport. However, with fresh anxieties over the Omicron variant of Covid-19, footfalls from other countries have gone down by at least 30%,” said a well-placed source at the city airport. “Most passengers arrived from Dubai, Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, Doha, and Kuwait and remaining from Singapore, Sri Lanka, and London.” The source added: “Those who came from Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Doha were largely transiting passengers from either the US or Canada. Overall, footfalls have reduced with European and certain other countries being classified as at risk.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/quarantine-fears-ground-intl-fliers/articleshow/88214560.cms||Niyati Parikh

Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AIMED) has written to the PM that though hospitals and healthcare facilities are exempt from the ban on running diesel generators, the closure of 228 factories in Faridabad has been sought for air quality management. AIMED said its member company HMD runs on environment-friendly PNG gas and that its smaller plants have diesel generators as a backup, which is hardly needed as Haryana State Electricity Board (HSEB) rarely has any power tripping problems. The association has requested the PM to declare medical devices needed for Covid response, especially syringes needed for vaccination and healthcare services, as products of national importance under the National Disaster Management Act to ensure uninterrupted operation of HMD plants. It said HMD supplies 66% of India’s syringe requirement and any disruption could lead to a national crisis. In October, acute shortage of syringes globally and in India had led to the government placing “quantitative restriction” on export of certain categories of syringes for three months. HMD produces 1.5 crore needles and 1.2 crore syringes daily. The shutdown is expected to create shortages in a week’s time but the impact may start from Monday as buffer stocks get depleted. The Haryana Pollution Control Board asked the Faridabad industries to shut down on behalf of the Commission for Air Quality Management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/halt-ops-to-control-pollution-largest-syringe-supplier-told/articleshow/88216192.cms||---

Bareilly health department has ordered a probe against the second lab. SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan told TOI, “We will take action once a complaint is lodged by the health department. We will also investigate the matter at our level.” The first sample of the man, who was born in Bareilly and works in the UK, was collected on December 3 and the Covid positive report arrived the same night. According to the second lab’s records, the RT-PCR was collected at 9am on December 4 and the report was out by 11am. He then left for Delhi and boarded the flight at 4pm. On December 6, his swab collected by the first lab was sent to Lucknow for further investigation and the report said he was Covid positive with cycle threshold (CT) value of 28. According to the ICMR, a patient is considered Covid positive if CT value is below 35. Dr Anurag Gautam, nodal officer for Covid in Bareilly, told TOI, “His father told us that he arrived in India on November 24 and then went to Gurgaon for some official work and came to Bareilly on November 26.” “This man’s first swab sample was sent to Lucknow for genome sequencing, which confirmed he was infected with the Delta variant of Covid. We are verifying the credibility of the second report. A notice seeking explanation has been served on the second lab. The details have been shared with senior officials for further action,” said Dr Gautam. TOI contacted both the labs but they refused to comment. Bareilly’s chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Balveer Singh told TOI, “We are investigating whether protocols were violated by the man. We have forwarded this information to the district magistrate and an enquiry has been initiated against the second lab. Appropriate action will be taken if anyone is found guilty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/uk-passport-holder-who-tested-ve-for-delta-flies-out-of-india-after-securing-ve-report-from-pvt-lab/articleshow/88213875.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation blocks effluent line to sewage network||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has commended the AMC’s decision to not allow any industrial unit in the city to discharge its effluents into the sewage network. The civic body informed court of its plan on Friday. The judges have called a litigation pressing for a clean Sabarmati as ‘a people’s movement’. The AMC said that it has cut 330 connections obtained illegally by industrial units in the city to release waste into sewage lines. The AMC said the illegal discharge adversely affects Sewage Treatment Plants and improperly treated water is pumped into the river, causing environmental damage. Prodded by the HC, the AMC had begun a drive last month to snap sewage connections of polluting units. The issue became controversial after the civic body severed drainage connections of three major textile industries: Arvind Ltd, Ankur Textiles, and Ashima Ltd. The industrial units claim they treat effluents before discharging them into sewage lines. But the AMC maintained that the treated effluents contained mercury, lead, and other toxic elements and did not meet disposal parameters. As the industrial units made their case, the AMC’s counsel told the court: “There will not be any connection from industrial unit to AMC’s sewage lines…We don’t want to permit any industrial unit [to do this]”. The counsel said: “This is stated on an affidavit.” The counsel went on to say: “The civic chief has personally clarified that no industrial unit will be granted permission for connection and their outlet should not be in the sewage lines.” To this, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati said: “We are happy to know that the AMC has taken a policy decision. It is its statutory duty to see that trade effluents don’t go into sewage.” The AMC’s counsel further submitted that after the disconnection drive, a remarkable improvement has been observed in the functioning of STPs and in the quality of discharge. “If the industrial component is excluded, sewage content can be managed by STPs,” the counsel said. “The recent disconnection has resulted in some good.” The lawyers representing textile units objected to AMC’s stand. The HC recommended a practical view in absence of a facility to discharge treated effluents into CETPs. The AMC’s counsel said: “We will not permit. We will answer it legally and let the court adjudicate.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-blocks-effluent-line-to-sewage-network/articleshow/88214577.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: GMCH resident docs call off strike in emergency services||CHANDIGARH: As part of the all-India protest, Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, called off the strike in the emergency services on Friday morning. However, OPDs and non-emergency surgeries will not be attended to. Friday was the fifth day when the non-emergency services were halted by the resident doctors. Moreover, the resident doctors at the PGI also showed solidarity for the cause by wearing black badges in the emergency. The emergency services had been resumed after the health ministry assured of resolution by December 16. Members of the association at GMCH informed as per latest letter issued after discussion with the Union health minister and PMO where Federation of Resident Doctors' Association has decided to hold the agitation for a period of one week. “However, no written assurance about a concrete decision has come from any authority. Since resident doctors’ associations have been given autonomy to make the decisions regarding resumption of their services, in tandem with the other state RDAs and for upholding patient care, we have decided to resume emergency services from today. However, if no ruling comes out by December 16, as assured by the ministry of health and family welfare, the emergency services will again be called off,” said Dr Vikrant Sharma, vice=president, RDA, GMCH. Also, the elective services of senior and junior residents, including wards, OPDs and operation theatres shall remain withdrawn till further notice. ”The residents across the nation felt compelled to voice their concerns in the form of a nationwide strike as the highest authorities had failed to deliver on their assurances. The administration has not responded to the pleas of RDA representatives and has not heard our concerns even once. Such behaviour of top bureaucracy is very unsettling,” said Dr Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/gmch-docs-call-off-strike-in-emergency-services/articleshow/88214570.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The data released by the police show that 162 cases of sexual assault have been registered this year between January and November. During the corresponding period in 2019 and 2020, there were 114 cases each. The number of sexual abuse cases has also gone up. This year, till November-end, 316 cases of sexual abuse were reported in Kolhapur district, 272 in 2020 and 205 in 2019. Police data shows that the suspects, most of whom are known to the victims, have been arrested. In 138 cases of sexual assault, the suspects were either friends, neighbours, co-workers. As many as 21 suspects in sexual assault cases were the parents and 32 were strangers. In sexual abuse cases, 280 suspects were acquaintances, 31 were parents and five were strangers. District superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawade had asked heads of all police stations every crime against women and not to turn them down. “If the victim is approaching us despite knowing that the abuser or assaulter is an acquaintance, it shows the trust they have in measures adopted by us. A dedicated cell has been set up at every police station, helpline numbers for emergency calls etc,” said Balkawade. Balkawade said a new initiative will be launched soon to hold counselling of the girls from the zilla parishad schools, similar to the move taken in Nagpur. “We are waiting for the schools to resume physically completely to start the new initiative to make girls aware of the crimes and what steps they should take in case of emergency. We have started counselling in some schools,” said Shailesh Balkawade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/crime-against-women-on-rise-in-kolhapur-district/articleshow/88213217.cms||---

The bison had earlier been sighted in a village on the outskirts of the city. The bison was spotted in Bondre Nagar area on Thursday night, after which, taking the route via Laxmatirth Vasahat, the animal reached till Toraskar chowk area. Then, the bison went back and took shelter in the green woods next to Mahadev Bhakt mandir near Panchganga ghat area. At around 5.30pm, the bison went into the nearby sugarcane farms located in Laxmitirth vasahat to Padali village road. As the word of the bison spread, a large number of citizens rushed to Panchganga area to the animal. The crowd made the task of the forest and police departments even tougher. The operation to send the bison back into the wildlife was still continuing late on Friday night. Clement Ben, chief conservator of forests (territorial), said, “Our teams are trying to drive the bison back into the forest area. The animal has entered the city limits and we have to avoid any man-animal conflict situation. We are acting according to the animal’ his mood. If the bison is made to run, then there are chances of the animal loosing its life. Hence, our efforts are on to send it back naturally on its own. He added that they were thinking of some long term solution to keep animals like bison, elephant from straying into the cities. Sugar cane and corn are favourite fodder of these animals. “We are thinking of cultivating fodder for these animals next to forest surrounding so that these animals can get their food there itself,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/bison-in-city-keeps-foresters-on-toes/articleshow/88213240.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Delhi||Closure report in SC/ST case draws court ire||New Delhi: A Delhi court has pulled up the police for filing a closure report in a case registered under the SC/ST Act, saying the investigating officer conducted the trial during the course of the investigation and tested the veracity of the witnesses in the police station itself, which is legally not permissible. The case was registered on the complaint of a man on January 7, 2019, alleging that in presence of other public persons, two accused had hurled casteist abuses upon him in public view as he belonged to the Scheduled Caste. The IO had filed a closure report in the case on the grounds that a settlement took place between the accused and the complainant, and although two people had endorsed the version of the complainant, four others had refused to endorse the version. The court said none of the grounds relied upon by the IO justified the filing of the closure report. “The offence is non-compoundable and serious in nature and mere settlement between the parties would not absolve the accused from their liability from the alleged offence,” it said. Noting that there were specific allegations against the accused and that these were duly endorsed by two public witnesses, the court said there was sufficient material available on record against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/closure-report-in-sc/st-case-draws-court-ire/articleshow/88215920.cms||Usha Das
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC seeks NEERI report on CETPs, pushes GPCB to act||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday ordered the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to quickly get the seven common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) inspected by CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), regarding treatability of trade effluents and their functioning capacity, and sought its report as early as possible. The high court asked GPCB to deposit Rs 82 lakh as fees with NEERI within 48 hours so that its team can expeditiously inspect the CETPs, which as the HC put ‘run on 30% of their capacity’. During the hearing of the suo motu PIL, the division bench pulled up GPCB after it learned that it had issued notices over deficiencies found in all seven CETPs on December 4. The judges insisted that in case of an unresponsive from the companies running CETPs, GPCB should get into action and issue closure orders. The judges said that once the report on the CETPs arrives, there will not be any scope for the companies and their lawyers to question the results of laboratories. While discussing the issue, the judges commented on GPCB’s will to work, “They have all the power, they must have will to do it. Not just the will, but they must have the courage to do it. Not that they don’t have courage, its just their carefree attitude has led 200km of the Sabarmati to go dead.” The GPCB official told the court that the board would issue closure notices in 14 days, if the companies running the CETPs do not address the issues pointed out in the notices issued on December 4. When the HC prodded the GPCB official, he admitted that there were 17 notices issued to one of the CETPs because its discharge did not meet standard parameters. However, the GPCB counsel asserted that the CETP is functioning well. The judges took notice of the differences in their versions and said, “The officer has something else to convey, and the counsel has something else to convey”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-seeks-neeri-report-on-cetps-pushes-gpcb-to-act/articleshow/88214580.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte rethinks joining Congress, to contest as independent||PANAJI: Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte said on Friday that he has decided against joining Congress, and that he would contest the 2022 assembly elections as an independent. The two-term independent MLA questioned Congress’ seriousness in preparing for polls, and said that that while other parties have taken an aggressive stance, it has yet to grab the initiative. Khaunte’s decision came just hours after his close supporters quit Congress en masse. His move also comes close on the heels of Congress’ confusing signals regarding an alliance for the polls. “Congress hardly has any presence in Porvorim. The initiative of the Congress president is not towards winning any elections. If you see any of the parties that have come in, each of them are doing their part, but I don’t see anything happening in Congress,” said Khaunte. He said that many of his workers and supporters, including former zilla panchayat member Gupesh Naik, had joined Congress based on the understanding that Naik would be appointed as its Porvorim block president. With Congress dilly-dallying and unable to constitute the Porvorim block, Khaunte’s supporters lost patience. “They came back yesterday quite humiliated and insulted, because for more than a month nothing has been happening. I told them that’s the Congress style of functioning and operating, (and) they are nowhere close to winning elections or getting into election mode.” Congress apparently wanted to hold elections for the Porvorim block president’s post, and was reluctant to appoint Naik. “If Congress cannot appoint a three-time ZP member like Gupesh as block president, nothing more has to be said. They were considering the driver of a former minister,” said Khaunte, after which he said that Congress is relying on press conferences and protests to try and win the coming elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/khaunte-rethinks-joining-cong-to-contest-as-independent/articleshow/88215248.cms||---

Bhupendra Singh, SHO, Doghat, who is investigating the matter, said that the woman’s husband, Sonu Singh, is the main accused in the case while his mother and three brothers have also been booked under relevant sections of the IPC for suspected dowry, “All the accused are absconding. The post-mortem was conducted by a team of three doctors. The report is with the investigating officer (IO). Further action will be taken after the IO’s initial findings,” the SHO added. According to the victim's family, Neelam, who was from Bulandshahr, got married to Sonu, 25, from Baghpat’s Tikri village, in May. Her father claimed that the family of his son-in-law was harassing them for dowry for some time and they didn't even bother to inform him about her death. He told police that he received a call from the in-laws' neighbours who told him that his daughter had passed away. Neelam’s uncle, Ashok Kumar, added that she had informed him about random demands of dowry from her husband on several occasions. "Their last demand was for a motorcycle. We had already given them whatever we could. They killed her as we could not meet all their demands," alleged Kumar, adding that he had raised the alarm and called cops to stop the funeral.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/dowry-killing-half-burnt-body-of-20-yr-old-taken-out-of-pyre-sent-for-post-mortem/articleshow/88213924.cms||---
---||Kolkata||86-yr-old comes back to Kol with painting exhibition||Kolkata: Disturbed by the havoc that the pandemic wrecked, she was unable to pick up the brush for nearly a year-and-a-half. After the devastating second wave, Zofin Muchhala, wanted to start painting again and returned to the city that had shaped her works to put up a solo exhibition. She had developed a distinct style of box painting after she visited her domestic help's tenement in Kolkata around two decades ago and marvelled at how people lived in matchbox quarters. She will be 87 in January next year. “The pandemic was so unnerving that I nearly gave up on the only thing I have — my passion for painting. Since my husband passed away four years ago, my art has also been my companion. So, when I realized I was on the verge of losing everything, I steeled myself to reclaim my life. And that meant picking up the brush to paint. This solo exhibition in Kolkata is all the more special to me because it is my revival post pandemic. I hope I continue to paint and hold more exhibitions,” said Muchhala, who shifted from Kolkata to Pune two decades ago and currently lives there on her own. Born in 1935 in Surat and educated at the Madrasa Taiyyebiah, she moved to Mumbai after her SSC examination and joined St Xavier’s College, where she studied for a year-and-a-half before taking admission in the JJ School of Art, where she stayed on for five years, doing a diploma and post-diploma course. In 1958, she married Taher and moved to Kolkata, where she met her senior at JJ School, Toofan Rafai, and collaborated for her first painting exhibition at the Academy of Fine Arts. She also held exhibitions with Jairam Patel from the Baroda School of Art and painter Manu Patel. In 1976, she joined Modern High School where she taught for 23 years, inspiring many children to imagine and express beyond the mundane reality. When Taher and his brothers closed down their hardware shop SA Muchhala & Co because they were growing old, the couple decided to settle in Pune. It was before leaving Kolkata in 2002 that the domestic help had invited Muchhala to her house and she saw the match-box like quarters that led to the box paintings. “I began with painting boxes on canvas before getting to paint actual boxes,” she recounted. For nearly 18 years, she continued to paint boxes and hold exhibitions in Mumbai, Chennai, Pune and Surat, till the pandemic halted her life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/86-yr-old-comes-back-to-kol-with-painting-exhibition/articleshow/88214599.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The motorists concerned have been asked to clear their dues by paying the fine online or at the nearest traffic division office failing to which the matter would be taken up at the National Lok Adalat on Saturday. Assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Seetaram Gavit said a large number of motorists violate traffic rules. “The traffic police book such motorists and instruct them to pay the fine. If the motorists do not pay their fine on the spot, an e-challan is issued for them. The e-challan is sent on the registered cellphone number of the traffic violator and all the necessary links are given to pay the fine,” he said. “However, most of the times, the motorists concerned fail to pay the fine. While this year alone over 1.80 lakh motorists have not paid fine, the police has issued notices to thise who have defaulted in paying fine from the past two to three years,” he added. While traffic violation by motorists is a routine in Nashik city, over the past few years, the police have been challaning motorists for the violation without the concerned motorists getting noticed. Motorists now come to know through messages on their cellphones that they have been challaned for over-speeding, jumping traffic signal, wrong side driving and illegal parking. Policemen also said though motorists delay paying the fine, the record of such motorists gets generated and whenever these motorists have any work at the regional transport office (RTO) or with traffic police regarding their vehicle, they are instructed to clear their dues to be eligible for making a new application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/traffic-dept-asks-around-1-25l-motorists-to-clear-pending-fines/articleshow/88213261.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The Pune district administration has administered 1,40,43,925 doses ever since the mass Covid inoculation drive kicked off on January 16. Of the approximately 83.42 lakh eligible (above 18 years) population in the district, as many as 84.16 lakh people, including the floating population, have been administered the first dose so far. Of them, 56.27 (almost 67%) lakh people had received both the doses, officials stated. “We have already vaccinated all the eligible adults above 18 years of age with the first dose. This also includes the floating population. Now, we are ramping up vaccination of the adults due for the second dose,” said Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune region. The Pune district is only the second in the state to achieve 100% first dose vaccination. The feat was achieved on December 8, nearly 11 months after the launch of the Covid inoculation drive. The daily average vaccination in the district had gone down to 20,000 during the pre-Diwali period. It started rising from the second-half of November with the launch of the “Har Ghar Dastak” campaign, during which the daily inoculation count rose up to 60,000. The anxiety over Omicron seems to have further pushed up these numbers. According to the data, about eight lakh residents have been administered Covid vaccine shots in the district in the last 10 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-74000-more-take-ncov-shots-across-pune/articleshow/88214600.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||On your thali: Chromium, lead, nickel & more||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has been pulling up industries for fouling up the Sabarmati with toxic effluents. And, if you believe that the issue does not concern you, take a good look at your dinner plate. You may be munching on salads and veggies every day to keep fit, but many of them are grown in 43 villages located 60km downstream of Ahmedabad using the heavily polluted water from the river. As a result, the amount of metals found in the vegetables far exceed Indian, European as well as WHO standards by 3 to 28 times. This was revealed in a study conducted by researchers from the National Centre for Earth Science studies in Thiruvananthapuram, PDEU in Gandhinagar as well as the Physical Research Laboratory and SAL Institute of Technology in Ahmedabad. “High concentrations of cobalt, chromium, copper, manganese, nickel, zinc and deadly lead were found in edible parts of the vegetables. These metals cannot be removed by washing the vegetables, using de-ionized water, or even drying it in the oven at 80°C,” revealed the study, which was published in January 2021. Each day, tonnes of these vegetables enter Ahmedabad’s wholesale markets. The study claims, “When compared to Indian food safety standards, lead was found to be 12 times higher, manganese was 13 times higher, chromium was three times higher, zinc was 2.5 times higher while copper was two times higher than the standard level.” It reports, “For nickel, the Indian standard value is not reported. However, when compared to the European standards, it was found to be six times higher.” The researchers had been collecting samples of vegetables since 2015 from Gyaspur, Vishalpur, Kasindra, Saroda, Chandisar, Kaloli, Asmalli and Khada — all villages located downstream of the Vasna-Narol sewage treatment plant (STP), where Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation releases millions of litres of toxic wastewater. This is then used by farmers downstream. Dr Tejas Prajapati, a city-based toxicologist, explained that the heavy metals such as lead, copper, manganese, etc. are dangerous for the human body as their molecular weight is high and thus the body cannot process it like other molecules. “In normal course, the molecules get metabolized in the liver and then goes to the kidneys for excretion. But kidney cells cannot eliminate heavy metals and thus it starts accumulating in the body. After some time, it spreads to different parts of the body such as the liver, bones and brain and affects different internal systems,” he said, adding that the impact ranges from stomach ache on one side of the spectrum to convulsions on the other. Dr Dipak Vora, an associate professor of forensic medicine at BJ Medical College, said that lead poisoning can lead to headaches, visual disturbances, sterility and heart vessel constriction, whereas accumulation of copper can lead to atrophy of muscles and impact on nervous system. “Concentration of Cobalt can impact thyroid function and manganese can cause anorexia and fatigue. In short, accumulation of any heavy metal is not good for human body functioning,” he said. At Gyaspur, for instance, the spinach picked from a farm was found to contain 11.3 (microgram/ gram)μg/g of cobalt when the acceptable level was 0.27 μg/g. In other vegetables like tomato, brinjal, cabbage, and cauliflower 4.4 μg/g of cobalt was found. In cabbage procured from Kasindra, Chandisar and Kaloli villages, the average nickel content was found to be 3.8 μg/g whereas the WHO safe limit is 0.2 μg/g. “Wastewater from industrial units is carried directly or indirectly through small channels or sub-channels into the Sabarmati. Regulations by the state government’s pollution control authority, Gujarat Pollution Control Board, require efficient treatment of all industrial effluents before they are discharged,” said the researchers. The team includes Bibhabasu Mohanty, Anirban Das, Reema Mandal, and Sukanya Acharya from PDEU and SAL Institute of Technology as well as Upasana Banerji representing PRL and NCESS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/on-your-thali-chromium-lead-nickel-more/articleshow/88214616.cms||Paul John

These features will soon become mandatory for all old and new taxis, buses and other public transport vehicles. The state home department has initiated the process of making the installation of panic buttons and GPS tracking mandatory. A key source privy to the development said, “The state transport department will shortly order all regional transport offices (RTOs) to ensure all old and new taxis, buses and public transport vehicles get panic buttons and GPS tracking devices. All RTOs will ensure that listed passenger transport vehicles install panic buttons and GPS tracking devices if they do not have it. From the announced cut-off date, vehicle dealers will have to ensure delivery of vehicles only after installation of panic buttons and GPS tracking devices.” “The home department and transport department will develop a new centralized control centre, which will record the locations of vehicles in which the panic button has been hit,” sources said about the new move. “The government aims for law enforcement to reach the spot in ten minutes and if the vehicle is moving, it will be tracked continuously and local police will be asked to locate it,” sources added. Public transport vehicles such as taxis and buses had to be equipped with GPS devices with effect from April 1, 2018. These devices were to be fitted by the manufacturer, dealer or operators.  Sources said passengers are more vulnerable in closed vehicles. According to sources, the state transport department is responsible for putting a system in place for tracking public transport vehicles. When a passenger presses the panic button, both the transport department and police control rooms will be alerted for quick action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/public-transport-state-to-make-panic-buttons-gps-mandatory-after-4-years-of-missed-deadlines/articleshow/88214605.cms||Kapil Dave

With Kolkata ranking second after Delhi as one of the most-polluted cities, the cyclist groups underlined how motorized transport was the source of half of Kolkata’s pollution. The groups—Two Wheels, Kolkata Cycle Samaj, Cyclops, Kolkata Cycle Arohi O Adhikar Rokkha Committee, SwitchOn Foundation, Cycle Network Grow, Howrah Cycle Arohi, Cycos, NTFN, BYCS, Argo Cycling Team, Parsec Racing Point, 100 Miles—submitted letters to every major political party, seeking revocation of the ban on cycles on thoroughfares. The letter also raised concerns about a large section of the workforce, dependent on cycles for commute to workplaces in Covid times. This lowincome group section depends on this mode of transport—their cycles—to earn a living, they said. “Each ward has a very high number of cyclists who will matter in this election,” said Satanjib Gupta, Bicycle Mayor of Kolkata. Medicine experts also support the need for the eco-friendly mode of transport. “It’s high time we created a transport eco-system, which is climate resilient. It should combine non-motorized transport and electric and CNG buses, trams and Metro. The children are the worst sufferers and the contribution of automobile pollution cannot be disputed. One in every three children visiting hospitals come with acute breathing distress. Unless we act now, it will be late,” said Sanjukta Dutta, head of emergency medicine at Fortis. Former MMiC Debasish Kumar and Jodhpur Park Trinamool candidate Mousumi Das could not agree more. “I put major stress on environment. NMT should be promoted across the city,” said Das. Kumar said, “Our CM herself is a bicycle champion. She has added wings to dreams of lakhs of girls by gifting them bicycles. We will have to do something about NMT shortly.” The Bengal government, through its state action plan for climate change, had earlier committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. Last year, following NGT’s intervention, the chief secretary commissioned a comprehensive bicycle plan by KMDA with emphasis on decreasing road accidents, without affecting traffic speed of vehicular traffic. This master plan also included blueprints for cycle lanes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/make-city-cycle-friendly-voters-tell-netas/articleshow/88214606.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The bird is primarily found in Terai grasslands in Uttarakhand and western Uttar Pradesh, apart from a few pockets in Assam. For the last four years, Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), a wildlife research organization, had been working hard to get an update in the IUCN listing. “It is indeed a good development and is the need of the hour at a time when the bird's population is declining sharply. We hope to work with governments to draft a conservation plan and act on it,” said Dr Bivash Pandav, director at BNHS. Rajat Bhargava, an ornithologist and scientist at BNHS, had been spearheading the ‘movement’ to save the species and is also leading a Finn’s weaver conservation and breeding programme funded by UP forest division and implemented by BNHS. "If you ask me, Finn's weaver is critically endangered with merely 1,000 birds remaining in the world, half of which are in India. The revised status of this bird in IUCN list is something big and should now help in the revival of the species. The UP government-funded conservation project in Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary was to begin last year in April but got delayed because of Covid-19 pandemic. This year too, we were in the midst of the second Covid wave in April when birds were supposed to be bred in captivity in specially made aviaries. Now, we hope that we may be able to start it in April.” Destruction of habitat is the primary reason for the sharp decline in the number of Finn's weaver. "Until 60 years ago, this bird thrived because of the availability of vast grasslands, its natural habitat, but over the years, the landscape underwent changes and paved way for agriculture and constructions. Let's hope something positive comes out of this IUCN update,” said Asad R Rahmani, member of Governing Body of Wetlands International South Asia and former director BNHS. Finn's weaver is not the only bird that underwent reshuffle in the IUCN list. Out of 27 reshuffles worldwide, five birds are found in India, including Nicobar Imperial-pigeon, Green Imperial pigeon and Mountain Hawk-eagle (moved from Least Concerned to Nearly Threatened in the list). Another bird, which is a matter of concern, is the Lesser Florican that saw movement from "Endangered" to "Critically Endangered" in the upgraded list. This bird, also a victim of shrinking grasslands, is only found in India, particularly in Rajasthan and Gujarat. "We are on the brink of losing this beautiful flamboyant bird found in Shokaliya landscape in Rajasthan and Velavadar in Gujarat. It survives in dry grasslands of lowland areas, but rapid conversion of grassland into agriculture land is the cause of its rapid decline,” said Sujit Narwade, project scientist at BNHS involved in the conservation of Great Indian Bustard and Lesser Florican.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/finns-weaver-now-endangered-in-iucn-list-4-other-birds-of-india-in-status-reshuffle/articleshow/88213931.cms||Sandeep Rai

We will consider their inclusion in the priority list in our next meeting,” said Dr Pramod Jog, member of the paediatric Covid task force. A comprehensive priority list of children with comorbidities is being worked out for the combined launch of ZyCoV-D and Covaxin in India. Paediatrician Dr Vijay Warad, a specialist in clinical immunology, said, “About 95% of children with asthma have allergens that act as triggers. Hence, these children have underlying inflammation. Due to this, they may land up with post-Covid multi-system inflammatory syndrome. Various studies have shown this. Hence, these children need to be prioritised for vaccination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/call-to-include-asthmatics-in-priority-list/articleshow/88214607.cms||Umesh Isalkar

He exuded confidence that SEP will reform the school education system. “The school education department conducted a meeting on SEP. The list of members on the SEP committee has been sent to the chief minister’s office. We will have the policy in one or two months after which we can find solutions to issues in the education system,” he told reporters here on Friday. Mahesh termed the proposal to hold board exams under NEP for classes III, V and VIII as unnecessary. “Tamil Nadu government is keen on reforming the education system as we introduced Montessori system in the school education system,” he added. The minister distributed tablet PCs worth Rs 9.6 lakh to 80 students of government schools at the model school functioning at Indira Ganesh Arts and Science College in Trichy. He said distributing tablet PCs to students from rural background was aimed at helping them secure seats in premier education institutions. “It is being implemented as a pilot project in 10 districts and will be extended to all districts after analysing its result,” he said. The minister also exuded confidence that issues related to renewal of recognition for government-aided schools, where the salary of the faculty has not been paid for the last few months, will be sorted out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tns-state-edu-policy-in-two-months-min/articleshow/88215249.cms||---

She was speaking at a function held at the Chicalim grounds where she inducted Captain Viriato Fernandes into Congress on Friday. “BJP taking decisions like nationalising rivers, cutting thousands of trees, double tracking, etc, is just telling the people of Goa every single day that they have no respect either for them or the people of India. Nothing in a democracy is greater than respect for people,” she said. Gandhi said that such actions have hurt the people of Goa and it is time to teach them a lesson. Referring to Fernandes she said, “Once a soldier always a soldier and today you have become a warrior. The captain, who has won the hearts of the people of Goa already, has joined us today, which tells us that we are getting strengthened and that we are right. It is a matter of pride for Congress that such people are joining the party.” Fernandes said, “After taking premature retirement from the Indian Navy, I was supposed to fly to a foreign country, but the situation in Goa forced me to stay back. The three linear projects made me realise that this party does not deserve to remain here.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-has-hurt-peoples-sentiments/articleshow/88215251.cms||---
---||Pune||Start corona vaccination for kids fast, say experts||PUNE: Child specialists and paediatric task force experts have urged the Union government to expedite the process of starting children’s vaccination against Covid-19, considering how Omicron — the new variant of concern — is affecting below five-year-old kids in countries like South Africa. “There is a need for starting paediatric vaccination early. While children, by and large, have only a mild disease themselves, a small number of them may get sick enough to require hospitalisation, as has been seen in South Africa lately. The vaccination can mitigate the severity of disease in children so that they can be managed at home, and this will prevent a load on the health services,” said child specialist Dr Pramod Jog, also a task force member. The Union government is planning to start kids’ Covid vaccination by the end of December or early January. “Children being unvaccinated and those with comorbidities are susceptible to Covid-19. Also, they may have mild disease, but can act as a reservoir to infect adults and senior citizens at home, who may have worse consequences, and increased morbidity and mortality,” Jog said. Kids had shown a seroprevalence of antibodies around 70% without vaccination, but if the new emerging variants had immune escape mechanisms to cause infection in them, it could only be reduced by vaccination, he added. Mumbai’s Dr Rahul Pandit, director (critical care), Fortis Hospitals, also a member of the national and the state Covid-19 taskforce, said, “With the new variant Omicron impacting kids in South Africa, we should practice utmost caution.” Dr Pandit said, “At this juncture, there is no need to panic. Be cautious when engaging in festivities and do not drop your guard.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/start-corona-vaccination-for-kids-fast-say-experts/articleshow/88214609.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata civic poll: Politicians change tack, turn focus on high-rise voters||KOLKATA: Signalling changing times, political workers are making a beeline for high-rises to campaign for KMC elections slated for December 19. This is in complete contrast to civic poll campaigns in the ’80s and ’90s, when the focus would be more on urban slums. But over the years, apart from residents of slums, politicians have been turning their attention to the politically aware, educated voters as well, a large chunk of whom live in multistoreyed buildings. Trinamool’s Bhowanipore candidates from Ward 70 Asim Basu and Ward 73 Kajari Banerjee have formed special teams, comprising party members fluent in multiple languages, who have been visiting high-rises in cosmopolitan pockets to woo voters, many of whom are from other states but settled here for generations. Both Basu and Banerjee were instrumental in garnering votes from high-rises during the last Bhowanipore byeelection, where chief minister Mamata Banerjee won by a record margin. “The recent byeelection made the task easier for me. A majority of voters in my area live in high-rises and different families speak in different languages. I have sorted my team accordingly, and we are reaching out to each of them, speaking to them in their mother tongue,” said Basu. Former councillor and Ward 101 Trinamool candidate Bappaditya Dasgupta took interactions with voters one notch higher, as he distrbuted among high-rise residents a four-page brochure, featuring news reports of development work carried out in his Patuli area in the past six years. “We don’t get the chance to interact with people living in gated complexes the way we talk to others. So, I have prepared a brochure with all the work done in the past six years in the area and giving it out at the indoor meetings inside the complexes,” said Dasgupta. Ward 108 Trinamool candidate Sushanta Ghosh is opting for a more personalized interaction with senior members of residents’ associations off EM Bypass near Ruby Hospital, including Urbana. “There are restrictions on organising rallies or campaigns inside complexes. But they form a very important vote bank. So, we are holding small get-togethers and informal meetings inside complexes,” said Ghosh. Ward 63 Trinamool candidate and two-time councillor Susmita Bhattacharya, who represents posh Park Street, Loudon Street, Rawdon Street and Wood Street, depend primarily on voters living in high-rises, who add up to12,000 members of the 19,000-odd residents in the area. “I am with them 365 days a year. They contact me whenever they feel comfortable—on streets, in parks or in markets. But still, I need to visit each and every residential building ahead of civic polls,” Bhattacharya said. Sandipan Saha, who has been shifted from Janbazar to Tangra to contest the civic polls, is making extra effort to meet his new voters. “A considerable number of my voters in Tangra and surroundings live in apartments. I have been visiting them and introducing myself to them,” Saha said. Anindya Routh, who represents a large part of the Ultadanga-Kankurgachhi belt, is trying to ensure no high-rise is left out, hoping for a comfortable win in the KMC polls. BJP and Left leaders are also following the same trail. Ward118 BJP candidate Dipankar Banik has been visiting every house at Sahapur near New Alipore and knocking on every apartment, introducing himself and seeking votes. “That time is gone when elections could be won only banking on votes from slums. Today, every voter and every vote count,” said Banik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/politicians-change-tack-turn-focus-on-high-rise-voters/articleshow/88214608.cms||Saikat Ray

Some farmers captured the big cat on camera trying to find a place to hide. The ongoing cane harvesting had apparently exposed its presence and it accidentally wandered into the area. Munish Rana, a farmer, claimed that the leopard suddenly appeared. People raised a hue and cry, scaring the animal away. “The animal was probably there for about 15 minutes before disappearing into the thicket,” he added. However, people remained uneasy with the possibility of a leopard lurking in the vicinity. The forest department was informed but they were unable to trace it. When contacted, Anil Kumar Patel, Bijnor divisional forest officer, said, “We have inspected the place where the leopard was sighted.

---||Pune||One jab done, but CoWIN tags many as totally vaxxed||Pune: Scores of anti-Covid beneficiaries are still scrambling for their overdue second doses with CoWIN somehow showing them fully vaccinated. Though these beneficiaries had received only the first shots, their user accounts on CoWIN showed them as fully vaccinated. As a result, they could not get the second dose of the vaccine despite crossing the due date. “There is a scramble for second doses after the emergence of the Omicron variant of Covid. Hence, we wish to take our second shots as soon as possible. But somehow, my family and I are being shown as fully vaccinated on CoWIN with the final certificates in our names. I received my first dose in July, and could not get the second shot in the interim due to personal reasons,” Delhi resident Vishes Kumar, whose second shot has been delayed by over one month now, told TOI. Pune-based CA Anand Kankariya said one of his employees from UP now has a five-month gap between two Covishield shots as per updates on CoWin. “Another worker from UP, whose second jab was due in the last week of November, received a message on November 24 from CoWIN that his second jab was successfully completed. But in reality, he still has not got his second jab,” he said. A senior official with CoWIN portal told TOI, “A lot of times, vaccinators do not make real-time entry on CoWIN after vaccinating beneficiaries. They make a manual note of the beneficiaries’ names and cellphone numbers and feed in the data later. This can sometimes cause errors.” The official said another scenario when such an instance could occur was in case where a beneficiary did not possess a cellphone number. He said the affected beneficiaries might log into their accounts, resort to the “raise an issue” option on CoWIN and select “Report unknown member registered with my CoWIN account”. He said, “Then follow the entailed steps, which will revoke the existing second dose certificate generated in one’s name. S/he can then re-register for the second dose,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/one-jab-done-but-cowin-tags-many-as-totally-vaxxed/articleshow/88214621.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Trichy||Good response for e-bike rental facility at Trichy railway station||Trichy: A day after the Trichy railway division of the Southern Railway introduced electric bike rental facility at the Trichy Junction railway station for passengers, the facility has evoked a good response from travellers and senior citizens. Users can rent the bikes by paying a refundable deposit of Rs 1,000 and producing a photocopy of a valid ID proof such as Aadhaar/driving licence. Hourly package is Rs 50 per hour, while a business package will cost Rs 500 per 12 hours and day rental package at Rs 750 per day. “Upon handing over the vehicle, we would return the deposit. Within a day after the launch, half of our e-bikes were hired. Senior citizens can operate without any difficulty,” J Praveen Kumar, owner of the e-bike rental point said. The e-bikes can be operated for 80-100km distance once fully charged. The operator also provides a charger for the passengers opting rental package.  While the division will generate Rs 1.5 lakh per year without any investment, the passengers can hire these e-bikes instead of relying on autorickshaw and cabs. Southern Railway officials said that the first-of-its-kind initiative is attempted under the new innovative non-fare revenue ideas scheme (NBFRIS). A private battery-powered bike sales centre in Thiruverumbur was roped in to establish the e-bike centre near the RMS office at the junction. In about 250sqft of space, the rental point can display 10-15 e-bikes. Except for providing space, SR said that it did not invest any resources in the project. Before the pandemic, the Trichy junction was handling around 53,000 passengers per day while during the pandemic, around 30,000 passengers were using the facility. The e-bike rental point will benefit those on a short visit to the city. “Based on the response, we will introduce the environment-friendly service in other major railway stations of our division,” I Senthil Kumar, senior divisional manager said. At present, as the service is available only between 9am and 9pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/good-response-for-e-bike-rental-facility-at-trichy-railway-station/articleshow/88215252.cms||---
---||Delhi||Court grants bail to accused as no direct proof of abetting suicide||New Delhi: A Delhi court has granted bail to a man accused of abetting the suicide of social media star Himanshi Gandhi, saying there must be proof of direct or indirect acts of incitement to the commission of suicide. Gandhi had allegedly died by suicide by jumping from the Signature Bridge in Delhi. Additional Sessions Judge Lovleen said merely on the allegation of harassment, without there being any positive action proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of the accused that compelled the person to commit suicide, a conviction was not sustainable. The court stated that it had been clearly noted by the Supreme Court in a judgment that the accused must have played an active role by an act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate the commission of suicide. “It was further observed that the act of the accused, however insulting, will not by itself constitute the abetment of suicide and there should be evidence capable of suggesting that the accused intended by such act to instigate the deceased to commit suicide,” it said. The court granted the relief to Ayush Panwar on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 25,000 with a surety of a like amount. It also said that none of the witnesses could narrate anything about the alleged altercation between the victim and the accused or the reason behind it. According to the FIR, on June 24, 2021, Gandhi had gone to the inauguration of a cafe and an altercation had taken place between her and the accused, after which she went missing. Her body was found by the police near the Yamuna the next day. Advocate Manish Bhadauria, appearing for Panwar, had argued that no material had been placed on record by the police, which could depict the availability of the ingredients of the offence punishable under Section 306 IPC. He further submitted that the FIR was registered after a delay of 80 days, and that a chargesheet had already been filed and the accused was languishing in custody since September 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-grants-bail-to-accused-as-no-direct-proof-of-abetting-suicide/articleshow/88215939.cms||Usha Das

The accused, Pervez, was arrested and a murder case under IPC section was slapped against him. Five years ago, Pervez was booked for domestic harassment following a complaint from wife Shameem Begum. The couple was married for 14 years. On Thursday night, Pervez went home in an inebriated condition and picked up a quarrel with Begum suspecting her fidelity. After she fell asleep, Pervez slit her throat with a knife and and severed her head, Rajendranagar ACP B Gangadhar said. Pervez, who belongs to Imad Nagar in MM Pahadi of Rajendranagar, wrapped her head in a towel and went to the police stati on along with his three children on a motorbike after committing the murder and surrendered to cops at around 2 am. Unable to put up with his drunken harassment, Begum was staying separately. However, about a year ago, Pervez met her in the presence of elders and convinced her to come back. “In 2016, a domestic harassment case was registered against Pervez. The case was later resolved by mutual understanding of both the parties,” police said. Cops shifted the severed head along with the rest of the body of Begum for an autopsy. Pervez will be produced before the court on Saturday for judicial remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drunk-man-beheads-wife-carries-head-to-police-stn/articleshow/88214620.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Indian Statistical Institute professor 4th from India to win Ramanujan Prize||KOLKATA: Neena Gupta, faculty of mathematics at Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), has become the fourth Indian to win Ramanujan Prize for Young Mathematicians. The international award is jointly given by International Centre for Theoretical Physics (Trieste, Italy), International Mathematical Union (IMU) and the department of science and technology, the Government of India. Gupta’s success comes two years after she won Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology in 2019. Three of the four Indians to have won the Ramanujan Prize are all faculty members of Indian Statistical Institute. The award is given internationally to young mathematicians under the age of 45, for breaking new ground in the field. Gupta has been working on algebraic geometry and commutative algebra and she won the award this time for her solution to Zariski cancellation problem for affine spaces. “My field is an interface between algebra and geometry. One dream that will remain forever unfulfilled is to win the Fields Medal, because I have crossed the age of 37. But I hope someone from India would win it within my lifetime,” Gupta said. A student of Khalsa High School, Dunlop, Gupta found mathematics to be her calling from a very young age. She completed her graduation from Bethune College and did her Masters and PhD from ISI, where she soon joined as a faculty member. “In India, a lot of pioneering work is carried out in the field of mathematics but since those are usually not done by those under 40 years of age, a lot of awards are missed. We hope our work is publicised more on international platforms,” Gupta said. Two others who won the Ramanujan Prize from ISI before Gupta were Ritabrata Munshi and Amalendu Krishna. Munshi did his BStat and MStat from ISI, while Krishna did his MStat from the institute. “There is a lot I wish to do in the problems that exist in the fields of cancellation, epimorphism and fibrations. Starting from the one and two dimensional figures, that we get introduced to in high school, there are shapes that get multidimensional as we move forward. These one cannot perceive easily. My work involves them,” Gupta explained. The DST-ICTP-IMU Ramanujan Prize committee, composed of eminent mathematicians from around the world, said Gupta’s work showed, “impressive algebraic skill and inventiveness”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/isi-prof-4th-from-india-to-win-ramanujan-prize/articleshow/88214611.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy demanded that the state government should purchase the 49% stake held by the Centre to stop the alleged privatisation of SCCL. Congress also demanded that state government clear Rs 13,000 crore of its dues to the SCCL. SCCL is the first public sector undertaking in the country with the state and central governments having a share of 51% and 49% respectively. “TRS MPs did not utter a single word about SCCL privatisation during the ongoing winter session of Parliament. Both the TRS and BJP governments are hand-in-glove to sell away SCCL to private parties. Despite being majority shareholder in the SCCL, KCR government did not question Centre’s decision and his recent letter to PM was just an eye-wash,” said Revanth.  Revanth on Friday demanded the state should purchase the 49% stake held by the Centre to stop the alleged privatisation of SCCL||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-backs-sccl-workers-strike/articleshow/88214633.cms||---

Speaking during a discussion in the House on climate change, Mahtab said that not all vehicles emit pollution. “This is a blanket ban order. There is no limitation on how many kilometres the vehicles would have to run, whether they are pollution free or not,” he said referring to the green tribunal ban on 10-year-old vehicles. “My request to the government is that it should bring out a new law or go to the Supreme Court for reconsideration of this order,” the Cuttack MP said, touching upon an issue currently pending in the apex court. Both the Delhi government and the Centre had earlier said that they are considering approaching the SC seeking review of the tribunal’s order now that the road transport ministry has issued revised guidelines on phasing out of old vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mp-seeks-a-review-of-ngt-ban-on-old-vehicles/articleshow/88215942.cms||---

The average vaccination per day has surged in the district by around 50% in the last two weeks. Besides the scare, efforts taken up by rural medical officers such as conducting vaccination camps in the evening for farm labours and tribals have increased the vaccination coverage to 83%. From an average of 10,000 to 12,000 shots per day in November, 15,000 to 17,000 people got vaccinated in the first week of December. People aware of the emergence of omicron are coming forward themselves while, for those who are not well informed, medical officers are explaining to the unvaccinated people about the threats posed by omicron. “People who were skipping their second doses for weeks are now stepping forward as a result of omicron scare. We were also reminding them periodically,” said Dr A Subramani, deputy director of health services, told TOI. Compared to urban Trichy, the rural health team has been sensitising the public. By coordinating with the revenue, rural local body and panchayats departments, the health department has covered 84% of the eligible population with at least a single dose as of December 9. For Trichy city, the vaccination coverage is 81% in the corresponding period. In hilly areas, as the tribal population would return to work only in the evening, the rural health officers are conducting vaccination camps after 6pm. In Pachamalai hills, around 14 hamlets falling under Top Sengattupatti PHC saw vaccination for tribal workers at their doorsteps till 9pm. “People who have valid medical reasons for not getting the jab were asked to submit a written statement mentioning the reason. Some cite medication, they will be followed after a month,” said Dr P Sampath Kumar, a rural medical officer. With the help of rural NGOs, health workers are marking the number of vaccinated and unvaccinated family members in front of their houses for follow-up. Dr A Mohammed Hakkim, coordinator, urban vaccination camp, added that Trichy Corporation has witnessed a surge in vaccination after the omicron variant came to light.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/omicron-scare-helps-improve-vaccination-coverage-in-trichy/articleshow/88215256.cms||Deepak Karthik

Four more peole tested positive for the new variant on Friday, taking the district’s case count up to 11. Of the seven testing positive last week, six were from Pimpri Chinchwad and one from the Pune civic limits. Of those six from Pimpri Chinchwad, four tested negative on Friday. So did the patient from Pune city, Ajit Pawar told reporters after a weekly review meeting on the Covid-19 situation in the district. “The health of all the patients is good. Four out of six (10 now) Omicron patients in Pimpri Chinchwad and a patient in Pune city have tested negative,” he said Pawar. All those fully recovering from Omicron were mainly treated with vitamins as they had had no symptoms. A health official at the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC)-run Jijamata hospital, where Omicron positive patients are being treated, said, “Of the six (10 on Friday night) Omicron positive patients in the Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits, four have tested negative on the 10th day (after they tested positive for Covid), while two are still under care. These four patients will be discharged and their health will be monitored for the next few days. The other patients would be tested with RT-PCR until the report comes negative.” The official said there was no separate protocol for the treatment of the Omicron patients, so they continued with the routine protocol of treatment with multivitamins because none of the patients had any severe symptoms. “Their oxygen saturation level was normal, and it was not at all worrying at any time during their hospitalisation. Their cooperation made the treatment easier,” he said. The PCMC earlier this week had announced that a Bhosari hospital with 100 oxygen beds and around 12 ICU beds would be used for treating future Omicron patients, if any. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, the PMC’s nodal medical officer for Covid-19, said, “The Finland returnee Deccan resident, who was detected with Omicron infection, was treated only with vitamins as he had no other symptoms. He tested negative for Covid-19 on the 10th day of the detection and was discharged on Friday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/4-turn-negative-in-pimpri-chinchwad-one-in-pmc-area-says-ajit-pawar/articleshow/88214641.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Stern action likely for those skipping second dose, says deputy CM Ajit Pawar||PUNE: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said the district administration would take a decision next week on taking stern measures against those deliberately skipping the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine. He said the administration would first persuade those skipping their second dose to take the second shot through the door-to-door campaign. “If people still refuse and do not cooperate, we shall have to decide on taking stern action,” he said. The minister said a large number of people had avoided taking the second dose in Baramati, Daund and Indapur tehsils, among others. He said at present efforts would be focused on pursuing these people to get the jab. A similar approach would be taken at the state-level, too, till any decision on sterner measures against the “shirkers” was taken, he said. “The data of talukas lagging in administering the second dose would be shared with the elected representatives to ensure that they too can help in vaccinating those due for it. It is true that people were a bit reluctant about taking the second dose, but after the recent developments (Omicron), the pace of vaccination has increased, and queues are being witnessed outside the inoculation centres,” Ajit Pawar said, stressing on ramping up the vaccination rural areas. “Doctors in the (state) task force (on Covid-19) have advised that we have to administer the second dose at the earliest and if we succeed in that, the situation will be good,” he said. The district guardian minister said the Pune collector and the Zilla Parishad’s chief executive officer would closely work with the administration and mobilise the workers to reach out to those having delayed the second dose through the Har Ghar Dastak campaign this week. “Drives will be conducted to ensure that the beneficiaries are convinced to take the second dose on time,” Ajit Pawar said, after the district weekly Covid review meeting. Citing the advice from the task force members and health experts in the wake of the Omicron variant, Pawar said the main aim for all states should be to ensure speedy and complete vaccination of all adult beneficiaries. “The Pune district has already achieved 100% first dose vaccination but lagging in the second dose in certain talukas. The vaccination programme has picked up in the last 10 days with an average of 60,000-70,000 citizens being vaccinated each day,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/stern-action-likely-for-those-skipping-2nd-dose-dy-cm/articleshow/88214652.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Horticulture farmer Paresh Patel decided to try his hand with the dry fruit with not a dozen or 100, but 700 saplings in his farm last year. Patel is fond of gathering information on various crops from the internet. While surfing, one day he hit upon an Australian variety of almonds that can grow in hot climate and even in temperatures of around 45 degrees. He pounced upon the opportunity and decided to try his hand at almond farming. “I have a friend who has a nursery in Gandhinagar and I shared the idea with him. He identified a nursery in Andhra Pradesh that was supplying the saplings. We ordered saplings right away and I planted them in my farm,” Patel told TOI. Patel said that he planted the saplings at a distance of 15feet from each other. “I planted guava saplings in the centre of two almond saplings,” he said. Patel said that it has been one year and three months since he planted the saplings and the results have been encouraging. “The trees are growing very well. They are around 15-feet tall right now. They are said to bear fruit when they are 20 to 25feet tall. We hope to get the first crop in 2023,” said the farmer, who is not wary of the chances of the trees not bearing fruit. “At the end of the day, I will have some timber if not fruits. I have also planted guava crops on the same land. Also, vegetables and other items in the space available between the trees,” said the optimistic tiller who claims he will not stop experimenting. “I have planted pomegranates, custard apples, apples and even other crops that are not supposed to be local,” said Patel, adding that experimenting is his passion and he will keep trying new things. Patel said that after hearing about his almond plantation, a farmer in Rajkot too planted over 100 saplings in his farm. Other farmers in and around Vemar have also taken some trees and planted them in their farms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-farmer-bets-on-australian-almonds/articleshow/88213765.cms||Sachin Sharma

After introducing plant-based cupro fibre and viscose rayon, the city is now experimenting with fibre and yarn sourced from pineapple, birch wood, banana and bamboo. Few of the products are researched and developed locally, while some innovations made abroad are also trying to find its footing in the man-made fabric hub. Besides fabrics like nylon, cotton, cuprammonium, viscos, linen and a few others, almost 80 percent of fabric products at present are polyester based. Even as around 20 percent of the units have made space for natural fibres, experts do not see any dent in the growth of polyester in the offing so soon and that the natural fibre will only cater to niche segments. Of the local crusaders for natural fibre, Navsari Agricultural University (NAU) has been aggressively marketing its banana-plant fibre derived from the plantain’s pseudostem. “Plantain stems weighing around 45kg each were earlier considered waste and would actually incur the farmer an additional Rs 15,000 per hectare cost for removal of the eco-trash. But now, with the innovation of plant-based fibre, farmers can earn from that waste,” said J M Patel, head of Soil and Water management Research Unit, NAU. However, it too has its limitations as only two percent portion from 45kg of stem can be derived as fibre while the remaining material is utilized in manufacturing vermicompost and liquid fertilizer. “Some of these natural fibres and yarns have been available for the past few years but with very little commercial use. If its commercial production increases, these can be made available at customer-friendly price,” said Rajnikatn Bachkaniwala, president of MANTRA, a textile research institute. Meher International — a private group from the city — is making fibre and yarn from waste of pineapple and banana. “We are using leaves of pineapple to make fibre and then after a long process yarn can be derived. Farmers normally throw away these as wastage, but with technology they can now earn from it,” said director of the firm, Sumit Agarwal, adding that they are also working on developing fibre and yarn from bamboo as well. “Yarn derived from bamboo is currently imported and we will soon come up with locally made products,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/natural-eco-friendly-fibre-weaves-its-way-into-surats-polyester-hub/articleshow/88214033.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The third Raahgiri Day is going to be held from 7.30 am to 1.30 pm in the EPDP main road stretch of the south Delhi neighbourhood in partnership with Raahgiri Foundation and WRI India, DDC said in a statement. Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj and Kalkaji MLA Atishi will join the event as the chief guests. This would be the third of seven Raahgiri Days planned in Delhi over three months with the theme ‘Yudh Pradushan Ke Virudh’, the statement said. The first and second editions of the event were organised in Patparganj and Najafgarh, respectively. The special event will include a range of activities such as walking, running, cycling, skating, nukkad natak, street games, music band, painting, dancing, performing arts, yoga, aerobics, Zumba, etc. “The concept of ‘Raahgiri Day’ holds a lot of promise for reducing our share of pollution when communities take their ownership,” DDC vice-chairperson Jasmine Shah said. The Raahgiri Day is being organised in the backdrop of the ‘Yuddh Pradushan Ke Viruddh’ campaign launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to engage and encourage citizens to take individual responsibility for reducing air pollution, by reducing the usage of their private vehicles by at least one day a week, among other measures. “Such initiatives help in fostering a sense of community and belongingness and participating in the fun activities on ‘Raahgiri Day’ is a wonderful, joyous way to come together for common community goals,” Bharadwaj said in the statement. Kalkaji MLA Atishi said, “I want people to reduce usage of private vehicles, with at least one less trip a week. This will go a long way in reducing pollution and building healthier lifestyle habits.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plethora-of-activities-to-mark-third-raahgiri-day-at-cr-park/articleshow/88215963.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Paatil was speaking at the idol installation ceremony of the newly constructed Swaminarayan temple at Sardhar near Rajkot. Paatil further said that policy decisions need to be taken when problems arise. “At such times, when decisions have to be made for the good of people of the state and country, religion always leads one to the right path. Politics and religion cannot be separated. Politics without religion will lead to immorality,” he said. Chief minister Bhupendra Patel, who was also present at the event, said the Swaminarayan sect has become synonymous with service, virtues and discipline. Praising the sect for its service during natural disasters and the pandemic, Patel said the state government has received great support from the Swaminarayan sect during calamities. Paatil said that the Swaminarayan sect has done commendable work in the education of youth in different parts of the state. “By taking up causes for social good and education, the Swaminarayan sect has been doing great service,” Paatil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/politics-without-religion-will-lead-to-immorality-paatil/articleshow/88214683.cms||---

But the question is whether this is the only mode in which respect can be shown. When we celebrate pluralism and diversity, insisting that there can be only one way of showing respect reeks of hypocrisy,” asked Justice G R Swaminathan.Quashing the FIRs registered against people who protested in 2018 condemning the Kanchi seer Vijayendra Saraswathi Swamigal for not having got up while the Vaazhthu was played, the judge said: “The GO passed by the state government in 1970 stated that Tamil Thai Vaazhthu should be sung as a prayer song at the commencement of all functions organized by government departments, local bodies and educational institutions. A subsequent memo the same year directed that the song should be sung in Mohana raga and in Thisra thaalaa (rhythm) as composed by M S Viswanathan. Thus, Tamil Thai Vaazhthu is a prayer song and not an anthem.”However, the judge said that the highest reverence and respect ought to be shown to Tamil Thai Vaazthu.As for the case relating to Vijayendra Saraswathi Swamigal issue, the judge pointed out that the pontiff was sitting in meditation when the song was played at a function in Chennai in 2018 where the then governor released a Tamil-Sanskrit dictionary.Justice Swaminathan observed, “a sanyasi occupies a special place in our social and cultural life. When in prayer, he is invariably found in a meditative posture. Since Tamil Thai Vaazhthu is a prayer song, a sanyasi is certainly justified in sitting in a state of meditation. In the instant case, the pontiff is seen sitting in a dhyana posture with his eyes closed. It was his way of expressing his reverence and respect for mother Tamil.”The court made the observations while hearing a petition filed by Kan Ilango seeking to quash an FIR registered against him by Rameswaram Temple police in 2018. Ilango and a few others had assembled before the Kanchi Mutt at Rameswaram and raised slogans. They allegedly entered the mutt premises wearing footwear and also criminally intimidated the manager (complainant) of the mutt. The FIR was registered following the incident.The judge said the petitioner and the complainant did not appear to have any ill-feeling or rancour towards each other and the whole occurrence appeared to be more of an emotional outburst. Since the petitioner and the complainant had shaken hands as the former had expressed regret, the judge quashed the FIR registered not only against the petitioner but the others too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/its-not-anthem-need-not-stand-up-says-hc/articleshow/88215297.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra is third among 5 states with maximum overdue second doses||MUMBAI/PUNE: Maharashtra is among the five Indian states with the highest number of beneficiaries overdue for their second dose, trailing Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, ministry of health and family welfare data has revealed. Maharashtra has nearly 95.8 lakh people whose second shots have now been overdue by up to 2 weeks/2-4 weeks/4-6 weeks and over six weeks beyond the prescribed interval between two Covid vaccine doses. The same number stands at 2.42 crore in UP and 1.1 crore in Rajasthan. Of Maharashtra’s 95.80 lakh overdue beneficiaries, 83.77 lakh people are overdue for a second shot of Covishield and 12.02 lakh people are yet to take their second shot of Covaxin. As for Covishield, Pune has the highest number of people who haven’t taken the second shot (12 lakh), followed by Mumbai that has 6 lakh eligible for second dose. In case of Covaxin, Gondia has the highest number of defaulters (1,04,965) followed by Pune (81,616). State immunization officer Dr Sachin Desai told TOI that efforts were in place to vaccinate all due for their second vaccine dose. Dr Desai said, “The Har Ghar Dastak campaign has now been extended till December 31, while district-wise call centres have been started. Officials concerned are not just visiting the beneficiaries’ residences to remind them about their pending second doses, but are also giving them reminders on the phone through these call centres.” Emphasising the role of full vaccination, virologist Dr Shahid Jameel said the government must consider bringing down the gap between the two doses of Covishield to 12 weeks instead of the existing window of 12-16 weeks as that wouldn’t minimize the efficacy of the vaccine. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “We have pushed up daily jabs administered to 80,000-90,000 per day in Pune district, which had earlier dropped to an average of 30,000 daily. We have nearly 800 vaccination centres going live every day and have ample vaccine stock and manpower. The main reason why beneficiaries due are not coming forward to get their pending shots is a reduction of Covid fear, despite the emergence of Omicron.” Dr Deshmukh said by February-end next year, Pune was likely to complete all second doses, provided beneficiaries cooperated. Dr Naveen Thacker, a paediatrician and expert on vaccination, said even if people have missed their due dates for the second dose, with the delay stretching up to several weeks, they should not think that taking the shot now (beyond the prescribed interval) would not help. “International studies have shown that even longer gaps between two Covishield doses causes a good immune response, so due beneficiaries must hurry to get the second jabs as soon as possible, especially with the emergence of the new variant,” Dr Thacker added.

---||Delhi||104 land in Delhi from Afghanistan via special flight||NEW DELHI: A special repatriation flight from Afghanistan carrying 94 Afghans, including 83 Sikhs and Hindus, besides 10 Indian nationals reached here on Friday. For many on board, it was the end of a wait that began on the day the Taliban took over after the withdrawal of the American forces and imposed restrictions. The Indian government had since been in touch with the authorities in Afghanistan to bring to India all those stranded there. Among the evacuees, who arrived here on Friday, were three infants and even though they did not have passports, the government facilitated their entry. TOI had reported in August about the Indian government facilitating entry of four- month old Iknoor Singh who did not have a passport when emergency evacuations were carried out through C-17 heavy-lift military transport aircraft of the Indian Air Force. After the special flight from Kabul touched down at IGI airport on Friday afternoon, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said in a tweet: "Under Operation Devi Shakti, a special Kam Air flight arranged by India has arrived in New Delhi from Kabul. It has brought 10 Indians and 94 Afghans including members of the Afghan Hindu-Sikh minority community. Among the evacuees are 9 children, including 3 infants." The evacuees also brought three copies of Guru Granth Sahib which was received by BJP President JP Nadda and Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri at the IGI airport. The Guru Granth Sahib is expected to be placed at Gurdwara Guru Arjan Dev Ji in Mahavir Nagar and the Hindu religious scriptures brought from the fifth century Asamai temple in Kabul are to be taken to Asamai Mandir in Faridabad. The government last week informed Lok Sabha that India had evacuated over 565 stranded persons from Afghanistan since August. Puneet Singh Chandhok, president of Indian World Forum that has been coordinating the repatriation and rehabilitation of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus in India, said in the earlier evacuations conducted by Indian Air Force, 77 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus were brought to India since August 15. "Friday's evacuation was the first since the Taliban formed their government. The 83 Sikhs and Hindus who have arrived today were waiting in hope and anticipation since August to come to India. Officials at MEA have been working constantly to enable this repatriation," Chandhok added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/104-land-in-delhi-from-af-via-special-flight/articleshow/88215967.cms||---
---||Madurai||Madras HC commutes death sentence of man who beheaded his mother||MADURAI: Observing that death penalty is excessive and not proportionate to the gravity of the crime, the Madras high court on Friday commuted the death sentence awarded to a man to life sentence in a case where he beheaded his mother over a property dispute in 2018. The deceased Thilagarani was married to Thangarasu and they had five sons, including the convict Anand who was their first son. In 2007, Thilagarani was alleged to have murdered her husband over a family dispute, however, the court had acquitted her. Anand used to pick up frequent quarrels with his mother over property. On March 18, 2018, when Thilagarani was waiting at the Malaiyur bus stop to go to Pudukottai, Anand who came to the spot assaulted her using a billhook and beheaded his mother. The Malaiyur police had registered a case in connection with this incident. On October 1, 2021, the Pudukottai mahila court convicted and imposed death sentence on Anand for offence under Section 302 of the IPC. Since death sentence was imposed on the accused, the case was referred to the HC Madurai bench, for confirmation of sentence. Anand had also preferred an appeal challenging the conviction and sentence imposed by the trial court. A division bench of justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran observed that the act of the accused squarely falls within the definition of culpable homicide amounting to murder. In light of the overwhelming evidence against the accused, this court finds no other reasonable view than that recorded by the trial court, in so far as the charge under Section 302 of IPC. However, the sentence part of the trial court in imposing death is not in tune with the settled principle of law. The judges observed that the trial court has erred in its conclusion that the accused completely lacks the psyche or mindset which can be amenable for any reformation. The judges observed that the finding of the trial court is contrary to the conduct of the accused after the commission of crime as he had gone to the VAO immediately and had voluntarily given a confession statement. The evidence indicates he surrendered to police, remorsefully.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-commutes-death-sentence-of-man-who-beheaded-his-mother/articleshow/88215298.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The petitioner stated that the colony houses were constructed by the Tamil Nadu adi dravidar housing and development corporation (TAHDCO) some 30 years back. She stated that the houses have now become unfit to reside as they are in a dilapidated condition. Portions of the roof have started to fall apart posing a threat to the people.She stated that at present 25 families are residing in these dilapidated houses and they are unable to move to any place due to poverty and risking their lives.

The case has been posted for hearing in Supreme Court in January 2022 based on the Union government’s request. Due to these issues, newly graduating doctors are unable to join hospitals where, as PG students, they would be serving as resident doctors and involved in service provision. As a result, existing doctors in medical colleges and other hospitals are forced to work for 24 hours a day. With hospitals and medical colleges in the country facing severe staff shortages, this delay in admission process has worsened the situation further. Physically and mentally exhausted, resident doctors are now boycotting all non-emergency services as part of a strike, he said. Inpatient and outpatient treatments, Covid and non-Covid treatment are now in a crisis due to the staff shortage. This current crisis in NEET illustrates how excessive centralization can lead to a nation-wide crisis in critical areas, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/demand-to-expedite-med-pg-seat-allotment/articleshow/88215301.cms||---

The demand comes after Madurai district collector had announced that people without vaccination certificates would not be allowed into public places from this week. “Vehicles like buses with pilgrims which come in organised pilgrimages are parked in the Ellis Nagar parking lot. The visitors use it as a small picnic spot. It is worrisome because they don’t wear masks and spend a lot of time in the shops nearby,” said a trader. K Ganeshan, who runs an idly shop said that the pilgrimage was stopped for the past two years, but this year, the numbers though low now would go up as the season advances. “What is worrying is that while people coming in trains and flights are being screened, those coming in large crowds on pilgrimages are not screened,” he said. Senthil, a resident of Sarvodaya Salai, said that the visitors come to residential areas, rest under trees and eat there. They need to be screened. “Since they usually do not wear masks, we are double masking while going out of our homes,” he said. City health officer, Dr S Raja said that screening of the pilgrims at the parking lot would be carried out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/screen-pilgrims-at-meenakshi-temple-parking-lot-residents/articleshow/88215303.cms||---

---||Goa||Study reveals plasma donation hesitancy||Panaji: When Goa first started convalescent plasma therapy for Covid-19 patients during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, health authorities had a tough time convincing people to donate plasma. A study that investigated into Covid-19 convalescent plasma donation hesitancy has revealed that while 49.1% respondents were willing to donate, the remaining 50.9% were not. At the time, in the absence of a definitive treatment, plasma therapy was the accepted modality to treat Covid-19 patients. The study, which covered 110 participants, found that the top three deterrents in convalescent plasma donation were ill-health, ineligibility and perceived not full recovery. Other factors that proved a hurdle were gender, advance age, being symptomatic and lack of awareness of government initiatives. The research paper by Nitin Dhupdale, Vedang Sawant, Bolivia Fernandes, Aloysia Fernandes, Jagadish Cacodkar and Steffo Barretto was published in the International Journal of Community Medicine and Public Health. The research team felt that there was a need to develop interventions to target these factors and improve plasma donation whenever it was indicated. During the initial period, when convalescent plasma therapy was introduced, Goa was one of the few states that promoted it in a big way as response was really poor. Several donors were felicitated as a move to encourage donation. Subsequently, the government offered incentives wherein donors were given a certificate plus free medical treatment at government facilities, as also complimentary check-ups, limited to a one-year period. The government found it so difficult to get Covid survivors to donate plasma, that at Goa Medical College (GMC), a team was tasked with calling and informing them about the initiative and dispelling any doubts they may have about plasma donation. A GMC doctor attached to the blood bank said that people still have misconceptions about blood donation, so it was natural that Covid survivors were reluctant to donate plasma. Moreover, at the time, in the absence of adequate information about the virus, rumours related to Covid-19 got credence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/study-reveals-plasma-donation-hesitancy/articleshow/88214717.cms||---

After his arrest on Thursday, the accused was presented before a court that remanded him in judicial custody till December 23. Highly-placed sources said, “During investigation in the Happy Nagpal case, name of Sukirn Tej also cropped up. He owns two firms that had fraudulently availed ITC of Rs 6.25 crore from bogus firms and further passed it to various companies. Tej also admitted that these were dummy firms and no actual movement of goods was involved in these and that he availed ITC fraudulently. Based on the evidence gathered from analysis of their inward suppliers, physical verification of the registered premises and admission made by Tej on December 8, he was arrested on Thursday.” The CGST had, on October 8, also arrested two brothers for their involvement in this Rs 427-crore bogus billing case and during the search of their home, officials had found several incriminating documents and stamps of about 10 firms, based upon which further probe was conducted to identify and nab others who were part of this nexus. Its mastermind is believed to be Happy Nagpal. Meanwhile, sources said the department had found clues about involvement of some other persons too, so more arrests were on the cards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/rs-427cr-bogus-billing-case-man-running-two-fictitious-firms-held/articleshow/88214012.cms||Mohit Behl

He said winter this year would be relatively comfortable for his family as they had collected enough bamboo and wood to burn. They were the beneficiaries of the farmer protesters, who donated remnants of their year-long habitations at the Singhu and Tikri borders to the locals. Sitting on a cot with his brother and daughter, teashop owner Sunil Kumar said, “The farmers served food to us during their stay at the Singhu border. Now, when they are leaving, in another nice gesture, they gave us blankets, cots, tarpaulin sheets and bamboo poles.” Though the farmers donated the discards to the locals residing in villages adjoining the protest sites, many waste pickers and scrap dealers also arrived from Delhi. Tasleem, a ragpicker from Narela, said, “The farmers gave me the leftover iron rods, tin sheets and bamboo sticks, and my rickshaw is filled with the scrap items. I will make another visit in the evening to collect more things.” While a few scrap dealers purchased iron rods from the farmers, Inderjeet Singh, who sold nets and tin sheets to a Delhi-based scrap reseller, said, “We will donate the entire proceeds from such sales to organise a langar. We do not want to keep any money with us.” Ramesh Kumar could not hide his happiness as he gathered more than the expected amount of scrap material within an hour. A farmer at the Tikri Border offered to take down the bamboo cabins, clear the pavement and cart away all the stuff. “I live in a nearby colony and often visited the protest site where the farmers offered us cooked food and other eatables. Today morning, they asked us to take all the scrap material including plastic sheets, wood and bamboo provided we dismantled the temporary shelters they had erected. I might visit the place on Saturday also,” said Kumar. A little farther away, children happily carried away the dry rations offered by the farmers, who were packing up and preparing to leave the venue early on Saturday morning. At Tikri border, farmer Sukhbir Singh said, “We are elated as our long efforts bore results. We are going home so there is no point carrying back the food grains and other dry stuff. They will be more useful to these poor and needy people. We are giving away everything we gathered during the protest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/winter-delight-for-some-as-farmers-donate-leftovers/articleshow/88215977.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Goa||Goa: After hiatus, work on Mandovi cycle track, promenade resumes||Panaji: Stalled for over four years, work on the all-weather cycling and jogging track along the Mandovi river bank has recommenced, with Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) aiming for completion by December end. GSIDC has also begun preparations to construct the second phase of the cycle track. Construction of the 1.6km track from SAG sports complex to the Kala Academy has commenced in 2017, but was put on hold after Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Limited (IPSCDL) refused to clear the initial bills, citing deviations by the contractor. “Work has resumed. There is no cost escalation,” said a GSIDC official. The Rs 12 crore project is being jointly funded by the state and Centre under the AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transportation) which stresses on non-motorised transport and development of open spaces. Given the proximity of the project to the fragile river bank, the project includes initiatives to prevent soil erosion by using riprap rocks along the route. GSIDC had awarded the project to Krishna Builders with LKS India acting as the consultant for the project. “The idea is to stop erosion of the coastline, not only through retaining walls, but also through dissipation of wave energy,” said a GSIDC official. The project, which includes a walking track, will connect the SAG sports complex to the children’s park at Campal. As part of a holistic plan to encourage non-motorised transport in the state capital, planners plan to create a dedicated cycle track right from Dona Paula to Ribandar.  The Miramar-Dona Paula road already has a dedicated cycle lane. Panaji was one of the 107 cities across the country that participated in the India Cycles4Change Challenge. “One of the key objectives under the Union government’s AMRUT scheme is to increase the quality of life in cities by developing greenery and well-maintained open spaces while also reducing pollution by switching to non-motorised transport,” an official said. IPSCDL, the Panaji Urban Living Lab and the Corporation of the City of Panaji are working on a plan to encourage cycling and pedestrianise certain streets in the capital. There is an attempt to create pilot cycle lanes to redefine how locals and tourists commute in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-hiatus-work-on-mandovi-cycle-track-promenade-resumes/articleshow/88214722.cms||---

Henceforth, Gipard will have to conduct a social impact assessment before the state government or the Centre acquires land for public-private partnership projects or for public infrastructure works. According to the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (RFCTLARR) Act, 2013, it is mandatory to conduct a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) and prepare a Social Impact Management Plan (SMP) whenever the government acquires land. Gipard will help assess and determine the implications of land acquisition on the local community and region while also studying the socio-economic benefits that the acquisition will bring to the locals, the state and the nation. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gipard-to-study-social-impact-prior-to-land-acquisition/articleshow/88214733.cms||---

Her husband has been booked for the murder and is yet to be caught. The couple had been married for just over six months. The victim, Punyavati alias Bhavani, a native of Odisha and resident of Srikakulam basti in Moosapet, had married Santosh, a private employee from Moosapet, on May 30. Santosh allegedly started harassing Punyavati suspecting her fidelity and even prevented her from talking to others, Kukatpally ACP A Chandrasekhar said. On Thursday night, Punyavati’s father Bhaskar Rao went to the house after a neighbour informed that it was locked. He returned again on Friday morning at around 7.30am and finding the house still locked he called on the phones of his daughter and Santosh, but didn’t get any response. Rao finally broke the lock and found Punyavati lying dead. She was throttled. Based on Bhaskar Rao’s complaint a case was registered against Santosh under IPC Sections 302 and 498-A.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/newly-married-woman-throttled-at-home-absconding-hubby-booked/articleshow/88214725.cms||---
---||Delhi||Traders heave a sigh of relief, but business-as-usual may take time||New Delhi: The local businessmen and factory owners are shaking off the lethargy of having sat fairly idle for a year with the news that the protesting farmers are finally vacating the area. The barricading of the border at Tikri and the occupation of kilometres of the Rohtak Road allowed neither workers nor the customers to easily reach the factories or the shops. That is why there is a collective sigh of relief among the business fraternity. “My GST filing was nil for the past two years because there have been no sales,” claimed Vijay Singhal, who runs an electrical shop. “First, Covid hit my business and then the farmers came here to protest. I am the sole distributor for electrical products of two major companies, but they both took back the dealership because I couldn’t meet the sales goal. At least, the long struggle of the farmers resulted in the repeal of the three laws. But what about us? Who will assist us in bearing our losses?” Another shopkeeper added that most of the factories in the industrial areas had shut down due to the prolonged farm protest and workers had moved away, affecting the sales of local shops. “It is only people like us with our own shops and storehouses who survived the crisis,” he said. “Malls, shops and car showrooms also closed down during the protest. I live in Nangloi and reached my shop after parking a kilometre away. Why would a customer take so much pain to reach us?” A shoe shop owner at Babar Haridas Nagar pointed at the unremoved concrete bollards put up by police to restrict traffic movement from Delhi to Haryana and said, “The cops opened up a part of the border road for two wheelers and emergency vehicles, but commuting is still a problem at the moment.” Traders felt it would take at least six months for business to revive. “Sales of the local shopkeepers depended on people working in the nearby factories or living in our vicinity,” said Ram Niwas. “Now that most of the factories have halted operations, our earnings have reduced by almost 50%. And reopening these factories is definitely going to take a lot of time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traders-heave-a-sigh-of-relief-but-business-as-usual-may-take-time/articleshow/88215990.cms||Vibha Sharma

Source appropriation tracks down the sources as well as measures the amount of ambient air pollution. Residents from around the port town have been raising the issue of pollution from coal in Vasco and demanded that coal handling be stopped. Shetgaonkar said that IIT-Bombay will submit the final draft report. “The report would be placed before the board meeting and it would be made public thereafter,” he said. After discussing and suggesting changes to IIT-Bombay’s draft report on the source appropriation study, the report was sent back to the institute to allow it to incorporate some corrections and submit a revised draft. The state has witnessed several agitations due to air pollution in the port town and this report is expected to ascertain the exact cause of that pollution. IIT-Bombay had submitted its final draft report on the source appropriation study to the GSCPB in September, following which the board’s technical advisory committee gave its own suggestions. The institute had been tasked with conducting a source appropriation study following allegations of coal pollution at Vasco. The first phase of the report had stated that coal was not the only mineral responsible for the air pollution in the area. A senior GSPCB official had said that while the interim report hadn’t pinpointed the reason for pollution in Vasco, the second phase would provide details about the exact source of pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/iit-b-to-submit-final-report-on-vasco-pollution/articleshow/88214747.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||PSEB board papers: Schools rue exam centres and question banks are far away||Ludhiana: Government, government-aided and Punjab School Education Board-affiliated private schools’ classes V, VIII, X and XII students will appear for board exams this month. Most of the schools are ruing that not only the exam centres are far away, but also question banks —from where answer-sheets and question papers are collected and deposited —are located as far as 60 kilometres away.For instance, Government Senior Secondary School, Bhaini Darera, has its question bank 60km away at HDFC Bank, Basti Jodhewal. Government High School, Dolo Kalan, has its exam centre nearly 16km away at Government High School, Daad.Baljinder Singh, headmaster of GHS, Dolo Kalan, said, “The exam centre is nearly 15-16km away and we have to arrange transport for students. We have sent a request to the department to allocate the school a nearby exam centre.” An education department official said, “Earlier the PSEB used to send the list of exam centres and question banks to the department a month in advance to check distance and other issues. But this time, a few days are left and the department has not received any notification from the PSEB. We are receiving complaints from schools and are forwarding those to the board. Most of the students write board exams at self-centres (their own school). Only those schools that were registered in 2017 can be self-centres.”Some schools are complaining of another issue. At Government School, Gobind Nagar, 512 students will sit for exams. But the building can accommodate half the strength. PSEB controller of examinations JR Mehrok said, “The schools that can accommodate 135 or more students are the exam centres in urban areas. We have received report for classes X and XII from the DEO. Only those building that are feasible have been selected. With not much time left, not much can be done for classes X and XII. However, for Class VIII, the matter can be looked into as we have time. I have instructed the middle branch to deal with the issues schools are facing.” On question bank, Mehrok said, “It is an internal set-up and that information cannot be shared.”This year, the board has decided to conduct the classes V, VIII, X and XII exams in two terms (of 50 marks each) for main subjects only. In the first term, students will get objective-type question papers. The examination will start at 10am for Class X and at 2pm for Class XII. Its duration will be 1.5 hours. Candidates will have 15 minutes of reading and OMR sheet-filling time. The exams will be held as per Covid-19 guidelines. Both classes X and XII students will take the Punjabi exam on December 13. Class XII students have exam till December 23. Class X students will appear for exams on consecutive days as English paper is scheduled on December 14, followed by Hindi and Urdu on December 15, mathematics on December 16, science on December 17 and SST on December 18.  For classes V and VIII, term 1 Punjab board exam will be held from December 20 to December 22. It will be held from 9am to 12.15pm for Class VIII and from 9 to 10.45pm for Class V. The papers will be conducted for six subjects with multiple choice type questions. Building can take half studentsSome schools are complaining of another issue.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC polls ahead, netas get to work with unusual gusto||Mumbai: Sleeves all rolled up, the alacrity with which the city’s corporators are getting down to work these days is exemplary. With elections to the BMC slated to be held in February, netas are bending backwards to take up works in their civic constituencies with unusual gusto. Electoral wards across the city are already reverberating with the sound of the auspicious coconut being cracked ahead amid the customary fanfare. Most corporators have sensed the power of social media and are using it to the hilt to pass on the word to those who aren’t able to attend in person. Cuffe Parade’s Harshita Narwekar, a first-time corporator, held a ground-breaking ceremony for the upgrade of Colaba woods garden about a week ago in the presence of local MLA Rahul Narwekar from the BJP. “The ongoing Metro 3 work near the garden affected the entry gate to the garden. So, we’re looking at taking up holistic garden improvement work where the gazeebo, boundary wall, walking track would be improved. We also want to try to construct a cycle track connecting gardens across Colaba woods,” said Harshita who uses Twitter to reach out to locals. In Juhu, BJP’s Renu Hansraj is looking at completing works on machines being installed at Irla pumping station. “The machines will ensure that marine litter does not come onto the beach,” said Hansraj, also a first-time corporator. Another project she is pushing for is reconstruction of Gandhigram Municipal School which awaits a nod. In Wadala Shiv Sena’s Amey Ghole had state minister Aaditya Thackeray inaugurate work to improve footpath around Wadala-Matunga earlier this week Ghole said BMC would re-engineer footpaths and bus shelters in the locality by using standardised street furniture like litter bins, benches and refuge islands to make the city more pedestrian-friendly. “Another project I’m pushing for is a bird park on a land along the lines of Singapore’s Jurong Bird Park. The plan is still in the nascent stage,” said Ghole. Recently, Santacruz corporator Hetal Gala who had been pushing for the Santacruz mini fire station succeeded in getting it started. NGO Praja Foundation’s director, Milind Mhaske, welcomed such development work, but added that some of them have come in too late in the day. “Currently, there is no mechanism to access works of corporators’ throughout their term. Also, at times citizens need to take responsibility and hold their corporator accountable for works they should have done. Now, with elections around the corner, a lot of works being initiated shouldn’t come as a surprise,” said Mhaske.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-polls-ahead-netas-get-to-work-with-unusual-gusto/articleshow/88215338.cms||Richa Pinto

The innovative campaign, ‘75 lakh Postcard Campaign’, has been designed under the ongoing celebrations of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav (AKAM) and will also give the youth an experience of writing letters in this era of email and social media. It has been launched by the department of posts in collaboration with the department of school education & literacy, ministry of education and is being conducted from December 1 to 20. Giving this information, postmaster general of Varanasi region Krishna Kumar Yadav said, “Around two lakh students from Varanasi region are taking part in the campaign to write postcards to the PM. Students belonging to class IV to class XII from schools affiliated to CBSE, including Kendriya Vidyalayas and Navodaya Vidyalayas, and schools affiliated to the State Education Boards can participate.” He added, “The language used for writing postcards is English, Hindi and all scheduled languages. The postal department is organizing postcard writing competitions in various schools to motivate the students.” More than one lakh postcards have been provided to schools on their demand till now. “The postal department is providing postcards to schools by putting a rubber-stamped address of the PM’s office on each postcard to be used for the campaign. The postcards can be purchased for 50 paisa per unit. Arrangements have been made by the department of posts to deliver all the postcards through special bags to the PM’s office on a specified date,” he added. “The campaign is giving the youth an opportunity to know about unsung heroes of the freedom struggle. The participants will also get a platform to share their views with the PM for upliftment and development of India in 2047,” said Yadav, adding, “The young generation will also get an experience of writing letters in the era of email and social media.” “After the campaign, respective schools will conduct a screening of all the entries in order to shortlist a maximum of 10 postcards with the best ideas. These postcards will then be scanned and uploaded by the schools. Of these, 75 students across the country with best ideas in their postcards will be invited for the final event to be held at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi on January 17, 2022 and will get a chance to interact with the PM,” he said. “About 500-1,000 postcards having the best ideas will be displayed during the exhibition organized on this occasion,” Yadav further explained. ‘Mann Ki Baat’ is a radio programme hosted by the PM in which he addresses the people on All India Radio, DD National and DD News. The first show was aired on October 3, 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/now-students-to-share-mann-ki-baat-with-pm-through-postcards/articleshow/88214761.cms||---

Haryana police have removed all the barricades as the farmers have started dismantling the tents at the border. Amid slogans of ‘Kisan Ekta Zindabad’, Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav, who arrived at the protest site, called the farmers’ agitation a ‘historic movement’. “One year of farmers’ movement has been completed. South Haryana and East Rajasthan have played an important role in this historic struggle. But the fight to ensure legal rights for MSP is still on,” Yadav told mediapersons. “We have to visit every house in the villages to take this movement forward and prepare ourselves for the next big struggle. Whatever the farmers have achieved in the last 70 years, have got it only by fighting the power,” he said. Thanking the farmers and labourers for the victory of the historic movement, the members of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) vacated the Shahjahanpur-Kheda border on Friday. Tributes were also paid to the farmers who sacrificed their lives during the movement. A ‘Kisan Vijay Yatra’ was launched on Friday from the protest site to create awareness among people about the ‘historic farmers’ movement’. The yatra will travel to every district of Rajasthan. SKM members thanked the local residents for their patience and support during the year-long agitation and apologised for the inconvenience caused to them. “A victory procession was taken out in Jaipur city, which passed through Transport Nagar, Raja Park, Rambagh circle, Amar Jawan Jyoti, Statue Circle and other prominent areas of the city,” said farmer leader Rajaram Meel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traffic-back-on-jaipur-delhi-highway-after-almost-a-year/articleshow/88215991.cms||---

---||Delhi||Over half of tents, structures at Tikri gone||New Delhi: The farmers protesting at Tikri border for the last 379 days were preparing to vacate the site on Friday. Trucks and tractors were lined up, all loaded and ready to go. Over 60% of the tents and temporary structures put up at the sit-in venue had been dismantled as farmers from Haryana planned to drive away on Friday night and their counterparts from Punjab on Saturday morning. There were efforts being made also to remove some permanent structures that had come up in the past year. The farmers from the two states, Haryana and Punjab, who shared the spotlight for a year were saying their goodbyes and assuring each other that they would come visiting. There was dancing and singing too near the dais from which fiery speeches had been made till recently. Jaskaran Singh of Moga district in Punjab said the protest could have ended earlier if the government had softened its stand. “See, within days of the Prime Minister’s announcement on repealing the three agri laws, all farmers’ bodies decided to call off the protest. This is because we didn’t want anyone to suffer unnecessarily due to our protest. We hope the Centre gets the minimum support price norms implemented now,” said Jaskaran as he brought down his tent. Some farmers said they would leave the border at 5am on Saturday. Said Gurbachan Singh, “We spent a tough time living under the open sky for a year. We lost friends in this battle, but the protest was important for the future of our children who could have lost their fields and source of income if the three laws weren’t repealed. At the same time, the local villages supported us with perishable and non-perishable supplies without interruption and we are thankful to them.” Kishan Kumar for Fatehabad, Haryana, revealed how he had made many friends with farmers from Mansa, a place he has never gone to. “It is barely 65km from my home, but I had no reason to visit the place. Now, I want to visit my new friends and learn some farming methods to incorporate in our areas,” said Kumar as he went from tent to tent saying his goodbyes to farmers from Punjab. Kumar was accompanied by other farmers from Haryana districts. “Many of the protesters are leaving tonight or early tomorrow morning, so we may not get another opportunity to see them off together,” said another farmer from Fatehabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-half-of-tents-structures-at-tikri-gone/articleshow/88215992.cms||Vibha Sharma

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the KVD on December 13. Mythologically, Anand Kanan is described as a ‘garden paradise’, sprinkled with the holy waters of the river Ganga, abundant with flowers, filled with the song of birds, and the buzzing of bees. Its peace and beauty are attractive even to the gods, who begin to feel dissatisfied with heavens once they have seen the Anand Kanan. While the makeover of the Kashi Vishwanath temple, which enshrines one of the 12 Jyotirlingas, adequate care has also been taken to ensure that the environment around is not only protected but also enhanced. There is an abundance of trees and plants that have been planted in the premises of Kashi Vishwanath Dham. From the temple premises to the temple square and the bank of the Ganga, these trees will spread greenery and energise the whole area. For this, special arrangements have been made in the middle of pink stones. Along with this, Kashi Vishwanath Dham will give the message of environmental protection. Divisional commissioner and chairman of Kashi Vishwanath Temple Executive Committee, Deepak Agrawal said, “Rudraksha, the favourite plant of Mahadev, is being planted in Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham. Apart from this, plants of Parijat, Ashok, Bael will also spread greenery in the premises. When the devotees take water and move towards the temple, they will see greenery on both sides.” According to officials entrusted with the development of KVD, special arrangements have been made for planting the trees.

Reshma Khan, wife of Haji Hyder Azam, VP (BJP), Maulana Azad Minority Arthik Vikas Maha Mandal, who obtained the passport, is also named as an accused. Azam said his wife is an Indian national and the allegations are baseless. Bharti, now additional director general in charge of Maharashtra Security Corporation, and Phatangare declined comment. Police have invoked sections of cheating, forgery, breach of trust and sections under the Indian Passports Act. Khan had applied for a passport in 2012, and it was issued based on the verification of documents submitted by her. In 2017, the special branch had undertaken a drive to weed out Bangladeshi nationals. It wrote to West Bengal authorities, who said Reshma Khan’s birth certificate was not available. The special branch then wrote to Malwani police. Phatangare, who was senior inspector, did not initiate action, saying Bharti had instructed him not to. Bharti was then joint CP (law and order).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/senior-ips-officer-booked-for-inaction-in-passport-fraud/articleshow/88216246.cms||---

The chairman’s office of KVTT, which manages Kashi Vishwanath Temple, was lying vacant for two years. The KVD will be looked after by the Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board, which was constituted by the state government in 2018. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said that as per the state government's order, a scholar of Jyotish and Sanskrit, Prof Nagendra Pandey, has been appointed as the new chairman of KVTT for the period of three years. “A five-member KVTT board was also formed with the nomination of Prof Chandramauli Upadhyaya, Pt Prasad Dixit, Prof Brijbhushan Ojha, Pt Deepak Malviya and K Venkat Raman Ghanpathi,” he said. After the acquisition of KVT by the state government in 1983, KVTT had come into existence for its management, especially of religious affairs. The chairman and Board members are appointed for a period of three years. For the past two years, the office of the chairman was lying vacant. The department of religious affairs has issued the notification for the reconstitution of the KVTT Board and appointment of the new chairman on Wednesday.

He was addressing the Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad (MPSP) 89th foundation week closing ceremony on Friday in Gorakhpur as the chief guest. The programme was presided over by the CM. A two-minute silence was observed to pay tribute to the first CDS General Bipin Rawat, who died in a helicopter crash on December 8. “Gorakhpur, developed as a knowledge city through three functional and one under-construction university, will be made ‘Special Education Zone’ (SEZ) on the lines of ‘Special Economic Zone’ as per the Prime Minister’s intention and requirement of the new National Education Policy,” said the Union education minister. “The idea behind the SEZ is to groom students as global citizens and to address the problems of the world through academic pursuits. The institutes of MPSP and its students would play an important role in achieving it. The new education policy has been prepared in line with the strategic changes in the global scenario and it aims to make India as the number one country in the world and the children of India as global citizens. The children of Gorakhpur will also be involved in becoming global citizens,” Pradhan said. “While Baba Gambhirnath Peeth is being established here, Mahayogi Gorakhnath University and the two other already running universities will join the SEZ and ensure their participation in this endeavour,” he added. He also praised the leadership of CM Yogi. “CM Yogi as an epitome of successful leadership. His leadership is never bothered about the issues but always looks at the solutions. Under his leadership, Eastern Uttar Pradesh has got the gift of a fertilizer plant,” added the Union minister. Appreciating the Gorakshpeeth in the field of service along with religion and spirituality, Pradhan said, “Gorakshpeeth goes ahead and awakens the society whenever the society faces serious issues.” CM Yogi on the occasion said, “Social revolution is not possible without education. When Mahant Digvijaynath laid the foundation of MPSP in 1932, he must have had similar thoughts.” He also said that his religion is not limited to the way of worship only but the philosophy of religion is described in a grand manner. The idea of religious places shouldn’t be limited to worship but it should lead. MPSP is named after Maharana Pratap who symbolizes sacrifice and valour. The chief minister said, “Each education institute should plan according to the New Education Policy. And when the result of the policy will come in front of the people, MPSP will be celebrating its centenary year of foundation.” He also asked the MPSP institutes to start preparing to get associated with the results. Tributes were paid to the 13 people who died in a helicopter crash on December 8, including CDS Bipin Rawat, his wife Madhulika Rawat and wing commander Prithvi Singh Chauhan. Speedy recovery was also wished to the only survivor of the crash, Deoria resident Group Captain Varun Singh. Last year, CDS Rawat was chief guest of the opening ceremony of MPSP foundation week celebrations. While paying tribute to the late CDS, CM Yogi said, “He was an example of an excellent officer and a dedicated soldier. His statement on December 7 shows his far-sightedness in which he expressed his apprehensions over Bio war and chemical war.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/gorakhpur-will-become-a-special-education-zone-says-pradhan/articleshow/88214791.cms||---

He also interacted with office-bearers and workers of BJP Yuva Morcha and BJP Scheduled Caste Morcha, and asked them to “not let the conspiracy of opposition parties become successful”. He also gave them the mantra of victory in the 2022 assembly elections. “At present, a huge number of youth are standing with BJP including students, businessmen and farmers. The maximum numbers of Scheduled Caste MPs and ministers are in BJP and the party in changed situation is working on the idea of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’. You all have to work hard and make it a point to not let the conspiracy of opposition parties become successful,” Sharma said. He also enumerated the achievements of state and Central governments. He said, “BJP without any discrimination has provided more than 4.5 lakh jobs in 4.5 years in the state. More than 3.5 lakh contractual jobs were given and employment to more than two crore people was made available on the basis of one district one product (ODOP) scheme.” Sharma also participated in a BJP Mahila Morcha programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/dont-let-oppn-conspiracy-besuccessful-dy-cm-sharma/articleshow/88214780.cms||---
---||Delhi||Packing up with a bitter-sweet feeling; farmers say seems like leaving one home for another||NEW DELHI: Farmer Princepal Singh turned emotional while overseeing the last lot of laundry in the washing machines put up at Singhu border on Friday afternoon. Later, while loading the six machines on a tractor-trolley to take home, Singh recalled how he had initially purchased two washing machines to help the elderly protesters before realising others needed the facility too. “Our sewa here has been to wash the clothes of farmers and the locals without a break since December 9,” smiled Princepal. “Today, on the last day of sewa at Singhu, I have a bittersweet feeling. This place had become another home for us and we formed a brotherly bond with many other farmers.” Princepal, who completed 366 days at the protest site on Friday, plans to keep these washing machines at his village as a memorial of the farmers’ agitation and to inspire future generation of farmers. Like the farmer-launderer, others too were busy dismantling tents and huts and packing their belongings in preparation for leaving the Singhu border on Saturday morning. Pointing to his shack, one of whose sides was already dismantled, Mahinder Singh, 65, of Patiala described his feeling as one akin to leaving one home for another. “Though we are elated that our demands have been met, I feel sad about leaving this place as it had become a home away from home for us. We became friends with the local shopkeepers, all of whom supported our cause.” Mahinder, who has been at the border for nearly a year, organised a langar of tea and snacks on Friday. He said, “When we arrived here on November 26 last year, we never imagined having to stay put for such a long time. But as time went on, we brought refrigerators, fans, inverters and air conditioners. I even started growing radish. I am going to miss all my other plants too.” Jaspal Singh said he would bring down the lodgings he had created at the protest site by Friday night and join the victory march on Saturday morning. Nearby, Mohali farmer Bhupinder Singh, pulling down his tent and loading mattress and iron rods on a tractor-trolley, said, “All the items that we used over a year have gain a new value because they will always remind us about our year-long struggle. We do not want to part with them or leave them behind.” He added if a situation arose in the future, when they or someone else had to sit in protest, these items would be needed again. Though most farmers will leave for home on Saturday, some of them departed on Friday. Uddham Singh, who ran a langar for around 370 days, was one of them. “Friday’s lunch was the last meal we prepared because we are leaving for our village in Gurdaspur by evening,” he said. Many organisations that put up kiosks to assist the farmers are also going away soon. Parvinder Singh, volunteer at the temporary eight-bed hospital, said, “We will discontinue hospital services after all the farmers leave Singhu border. To manage any emergency, we will remain here till then.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/packing-up-with-a-bitter-sweet-feeling/articleshow/88216052.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Residents of Ambedkar Nagar said that the blasting in a nearby site takes place throughout the day. Work continues even late into the night. “There was a time when we used to hear sounds of peacocks and birds early in the morning. Now, all we hear is rock blasting. Birds have even stopped coming to Bathula Kunta lake,” said Ravikanth Chintala, who lives in a high-rise near the construction site. He alleged that debris is being dumped into a small pond near the site. “Most of the people who stay in this locality are retired employees or those working night shifts. We cannot rest either in the day or during the night due to the nuisance,” said Sampath Kumar Rao, a retired government employee adding that they even filed a police complaint on the issue. Activists meanwhile said that the government should have ideally not sold the hillock and tried to preserve it. “The locals should talk to the developer and see if they are willing to integrate the rocks, hillock into the layout. People, especially children are going to love it,” said Frauke Quader, a German-born Hyderabadi environmentalist and secretary of Society To Save Rocks. Jubilee Hills police, meanwhile, confirmed that they received a complaint against the developer for causing noise pollution. “We have inspected the site and verified the permits. Officials concerned are monitoring sound levels,” said S Rajasekhar Reddy, station house officer, Jubilee Hills police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/incessant-rock-blasting-vexes-jubilee-hills-residents/articleshow/88214788.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Hyderabad||Drunken drivers get licence to roam free as most trials stuck in red tape||HYDERABAD: Four deaths in two drunken driving (DD) cases early this week has put the spotlight back on this major menace on roads. In the last one year, 257 people have died in DD cases so far. But despite DD checks across three commissionerates and arrests, delay in trial and conviction has resulted in many not having fear of the law, police said. This is evident in the 350 arrests for repeat offence in the last one year alone within the city. Senior traffic police officials said there’s a big trial backlog of accused. “This delay is leading to lack of fear among many drivers about the consequences, making them take the wheel again after drinking. If people are punished in shortest time, it creates a lot of fear. Without a court order convicting a person for drunken driving, police cannot refer the case to Regional Transport Authority for suspension of driving licence,” an official said. The delays have also taken a toll on families of victims. The parents of Ramya (10) are still waiting for the trial to begin despite five years having passed since her death in a DD accident. A drunk college student without licence lost control and landed on the family’s car on the other side of the divider on Road No. 2, Banjara Hills, killing her uncle at the wheel on the spot. Ramya and her grandfather subsequently died in the hospital. “We were assured that case will be in fast-track court. This promise was not kept. The accused are out on bail. Pub which served the liquor to the under-aged accused was also allowed to reopen. Till now trial has not started despite police filing a chargesheet long ago. I doubt if I can get justice during my lifetime,” Ramya’s father Venkat Ramana said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drunken-drivers-get-licence-to-roam-free-as-most-trials-stuck-in-red-tape/articleshow/88214777.cms||---

Additional sessions judge PM Gupta, while acquitting the accused, pointed out lacunae in the prosecution’s case and acquitted the accused of all charges, said AS Jadhav, counsel for the accused. The prosecution told the court that on August 5, 2013, the victim, who was 13 years of age then, was walking on a road when the accused, both in their late 20s, approached her, caught her by the hand, and asked her to come with them. They fled after a passerby approached them. The judge said, “There is a delay of two days in lodging the FIR, and the same is not explained. The statement of the eyewitness was not recorded and spot panchnama was not prepared. It creates doubts about the case of the prosecution. Therefore, the benefit of doubt must be given to the accused.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-acquitted-in-teen-molestation-case/articleshow/88215368.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

The Congress office was also painted in pink under the ongoing work of giving a uniform colour to all buildings along the roads leading to Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) from Godowlia to Maidagin crossings. Giving a time of 36 hours for the removal of paint to the authorities, the Congress leaders, including former MLA Ajay Rai, warned that an agitation would be launched if their demand is not fulfilled. In a press statement issued on Friday, Rai termed the colouring of buildings as a marketing event and said that painting of the Congress office without permission is unconstitutional and condemnable. “This government is going mad with the power and colouring the buildings in pink. We have given a time of 36 hours for the removal of colour, otherwise we will launch a massive agitation,” said Rai, adding that the government is engaged in marketing in the name of people’s sentiment. He alleged that the government is trying to cover up its failure by false publicity and marketing events. The city president Raghvendra Chaubey said that the Congressmen will take to street if the administration fails to rectify the wrongdoing. The VDA officials could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. Earlier, a mosque in Bulanala, which was also painted in pink, was repainted after the objection raised by the mosque authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cong-objects-to-colouring-of-party-office-in-pink-gives-36-hours-to-vda-for-removal/articleshow/88214807.cms||---

---||Kanpur||Kanpur Dehat cop suspended for assaulting man with child||KANPUR: A police inspector posted at Akbarpur Kotwali in Kanpur Dehat district was on Thursday suspended after a video, purportedly showing him fiercely raining batons on a person carrying a child in his arms, went viral on social media. The incident took place at the district hospital in Akbarpur area on Thursday afternoon. In the video, another policeman could be seen trying to forcibly yank the child out of his father’s arms as the child cried out in fear. After the one-minute video went viral and earned the wrath of social media users, the cop was suspended for “insensitivity”. Going by the video clip, the man could be heard begging the policemen not to hurt the child. “Bachhe ko lag jayegi (the child will get hurt),” the man could be heard pleading to cops as he tried to run away from the police. The cops, however, chased him and a few among the cops tried to forcibly snatch the child away from him. The man refused to give the child saying, “The child is mine,” and added, “Iski maa nahi hai, sahab (the child doesn’t have a mother).” After the video clip went viral on social media, the Kanpur Dehat Police issued a statement. “A class IV government employee named Rajneesh Shukla, accompanied by 100-150 people, had shut the district hospital’s OPD. A police team from Akbarpur Kotwali rushed to the spot and tried to pacify the agitating employees’ leader, Rajneesh Shukla, and his aides to not obstruct OPD services, but they did not relent,” additional superintendent of police Ghanshyam Chaurasia said. “Soon, Shukla and his aides locked up the police out-post-in-charge and his team members in a room and started misbehaving. Shukla even bit the finger of the inspector while attacking him,” Chaurasia said and added, “The police used mild force to stop them.” The local sources said that during the construction of a medical college in the premises of district hospital of Kanpur Dehat, the employees had staged a dharna by locking the OPD on Thursday, alleging that the road and drain got damaged due to the movement of vehicles and mining. The protesters took the doctors and patients out of the OPD. The officers and police personnel who reached the spot tried to convince the agitating employees. In the meantime, a leader of the employees bit the thumb of the inspector and scuffled with him, then the police beat him fiercely. The police also rain batons on the brother of the leader, who was carrying a child in his arms, and who had come to save him. After immense outrage over the incident and the police response, the Kanpur Dehat police Twitter handle on Thursday put out a statement, saying an inquiry has been ordered and the concerned police inspector has been suspended with immediate effect. On Friday morning, another post on the official handle said, “While controlling the incident, the cop showed insensitivity... he has been suspended with immediate effect.” “Such conduct on the part of police personnel despite repeated instructions to respect the dignity of every citizen is not acceptable,” the UP Police also said on Twitter. “Some protesters had locked the OPD of the District Hospital and disrupted its services. The police was attacked when they went to restore order on the request of the chief medical superintendent following which use of mild force was done which is no justification for the insensitivity by the policeman,” it further read. Among those who expressed displeasure over the viral video was BJP MP Varun Gandhi. He tweeted: “A strong law and order is one where the weakest of the weak can get justice. It is not that those seeking justice have to face this barbarity in place of justice, it is very painful. A fearful society is not an example of the rule of law. Strong law and order is one where there is fear of law, not of police.” Watch Kanpur Dehat cop suspended for assaulting man with child||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/inspector-suspended-for-beating-man-in-kanpur-dehat-after-video-goes-viral/articleshow/88214812.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Kolkata||Untimely showers ruin veggies, push up rates||Kolkata: The prices of vegetables shot through the roof across the city retail markets on Wednesday with the constricted supply line widening the demand-supply gap. Vendors said widespread damage of standing crops due to the recent untimely rain had led to the sudden slump in supply. “Since winter vegetables are highly weather-sensitive, they tend to rot in a flooded field. This kind of rain at this time of the year has not taken place in the past 40 years. The extent of loss is huge. It will take at least three weeks to bounce back to normal production. Till then, the market is expected to behave a bit abnormally, because demand will far exceed supply,” said West Bengal Vendors’ Association president Kamal De. Prices of almost all vegetables have increased by Rs 20-Rs 30 per kg in three days. Also, the quality of vegetables arriving in the markets are below par. Most of the vendors are refraining from stocking vegetables, fearing they will rot fast under the present weather conditions. Green chillies, which sold for Rs 40 a kg even a week ago, are now retailing for Rs 100-Rs 120 a kg. Price of parwal (pointed gourd) that cost Rs 60 a kg is now going for over Rs 100 a kg. The cost of coriander leaves had dipped to Rs 80 a kg but has now now crossed Rs 200/kg. The cost of ridged gourd (jhinga) has gone up from Rs 50 a kg to Rs 100 a kg.  Water is yet to recede from many low-lying fields. As a result, a whole range of crops have been badly damaged, including brinjal, green chillies, cabbage, cauliflower, coriander leaves and green peas. Prices of these vegetables have risen more than the others. “The supply line from South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly and Midnapore have been the worst hit,” said Arup Das, a wholesale dealer at Sealdah market. “The supply line has been kept alive by vegetables from Bongaon, Basirhat and parts of Hooghly. The land there has a steeper gradient, and so, stormwater recedes faster there.” De is also a member of the Market Task Force. Prices of potatoes and onion, staple in most Indian dishes, are also witnessing a sharp rise. Potatoes (Jyoti variety) have been selling for Rs 22 a kg, though it came for Rs 16 a kg barely five days ago. Onion supply has also become erratic owing untimely rain in western India. Consumers are grappling with the sudden rise in prices of vegetables, which usually sell for less in cooler times. “I was shocked at the vegetable prices being quoted by vendors. I had not anticipated that prices would rise so sharply overnight. My wallet emptied out even before the bag filled up. I returned home without buying fish,” said Srikanta Dutts, a resident of Parnashree. Bratin Sarkar, another residents, has decided to cut down on vegetables for the time being and buy more chicken and eggs. Traders, however, feel prices are not likely to go down any time soon. Subal Saha, a trader at Lake Market, said, “The prices are likely to rise further till new vegetables grow. The rain has broken the chain of vegetable production. It will take some time to cool off the prices.” An agri-marketing department official said, “We are keeping a close watch on the market. We may carry out raids and seizures, if traders try to increase prices to maximize their profit. At the same time, we are also procuring vegetables directly from farmers to sell them through our network of Sufal Bangla stores at a reasonable price. This exercise would help both the ends of the system—farmers and consumers—to tide over the situations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/untimely-showers-ruin-veggies-push-up-rates/articleshow/88214821.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The memo issued by special chief secretary Arvind Kumar claims that a number of constructions, apartments, gated communities and layouts are coming up without HMDA’s permission. “In fact, in some cases, the constructions are going on by quoting the erstwhile gram panchayat (GP) permissions which are not valid permissions,” the memo states. Arvind Kumar explains that the GPs were authorized by HMDA to grant permissions for buildings up to ground +2 floors and that they were never authorized to issue permissions for apartments or gated communities. “Municipal commissioners of all municipalities located in the HMDA area are hereby directed to inspect all the ongoing constructions and verify if they have valid permissions,” the special chief secretary instructs. If the construction is found to be unauthorized, then the memo directs the commissioners to take action by demolishing them under the provisions of the Telangana Municipalities Act 2019 and the TSbPASS Act.

---||Lucknow||Land linked to Prof NR Dhar to house PDA office, 5-star hotel||Prayagraj: The huge piece of land, measuring over 3 acres in the prime location of Lala Lajpat Rai Road in Mumfordganj, and associated with the renowned academician and former head of the department of Chemistry of Allahabad University, Prof Neel Ratan Dhar, would soon be housing the first 5-star hotel of the city and the new office of the Prayagraj Development Authority (PDA). Prof Dhar, among the few Indians who found a place in the panel that made nominations for Noble Prize winners, had donated this land to AU and it was being used to teach practical classes of students of Soil Chemistry at AU. The land is part of the Sheila Dhar Institute of Soil Sciences and is located behind the building of National Academy of Sciences India (NASI). It was established in 1935 by Dr Dhar. Raised by his endowments, the institute, named after his first wife Sheila, was later donated to AU in the year 1949. The said land (Plot number 493), Lajpat Road, Mumfordganj, was given to the institute on lease by the Allahabad Improvement Trust (later known as ADA) in the year 1952 to be used for field work by MSc and DPhil students of the institute of Soil Sciences of AU. The land was given on lease against an amount of Rs 2 per year as lease rent. Later, ADA was at loggerheads with the AU authorities claiming that varsity had not renewed the lease deed that was supposed to be renewed every 30 years and hence the deed stands cancelled. PDA, in its meeting held in 2008, had decided to use the land of the institute for constructing its office. ADA had locked the main gate of the land’s boundary wall on the ground that varsity had not renewed the lease deed and hence it was cancelled. AU then moved Allahabad High Court and the court provided relief to AU. A bench consisting of chief Justice H L Gokhale and Justice Vineet Saran, had in 2015 directed that AU will continue to use the institute for research purposes. Allahabad High Court, in an order on July 8, 2015, said the varsity authorities may move a representation to the principal secretary urban planning and development and the case be settled within a period of three months after hearing the two parties. Later, the special secretary, urban planning and development, Hari Kant Tripathi, directed ADA authorities (in September 2015) to give a legible copy of the said deed to varsity authorities as the latter does not have a copy of the lease deed. However, it is the callous attitude of the AU authorities that the varsity failed to renew the lease of the land. PDA has now invited an expression of interest (EOI) for constructing an office building and 5-star hotel on the same piece of land. “We have invited EOI from the reputed agencies for the ambitious project which would be constructed at the piece of land located at Lala Lajpat Rai Road (adjacent to Stanley Road) following which not only PDA would have its own office, but the city would also have the first 5-star rated hotel,” said PDA vice-chairman Arvind Kumar Chauhan. However, AU authorities maintain that this piece of land still belongs to the varsity. “The matter regarding the Sheila Dhar Institute land is under consideration in the district court and we are pursuing the matter,” said AU public relation officer (PRO) Jaya Kapoor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/land-linked-to-prof-nr-dhar-to-house-pda-office-5-star-hotel/articleshow/88214826.cms||---
---||Allahabad||HC quashes FIR against ‘Mirzapur’ producers Akhtar, Sidhwani||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Friday quashed the first information report (FIR) lodged against producers Ritesh Sidhwani and Farhan Akhar in connection with a case registered against them for allegedly hurting religious, social and regional sentiments through their portrayal of the town of Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh in the web-series ‘Mirzapur’. Allowing the writ petition filed Ritesh Sidhwani, Farhan Akhtar and others, Justice Mahesh Chandra Tripathi and Justice Subhash Vidyarthi observed, “There is no allegation in the entire FIR that any content shown in the series portrays any particular religion in a bad light and which can possibly hurt the religious feelings of a class of citizens.” The FIR was registered on January 17, 2021 by one Arvind Chaturvedi at Kotwali Dehat of Mirzapur district against the makers of the ‘Mirzapur’ web-series under Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and other sections of the IPC and 67-A of the Information Technology Act. “Even as per the averments made in the FIR, it is the informant alone whose religious, social and regional sentiments have been hurt by the web series and not those of any class of citizens. There is nothing on record to indicate that besides the informant, the religious beliefs of any class of citizens were hurt by the web-series Mirzapur and what to say about the same having been done with deliberate and malicious intention,” the court added. Earlier on January 29, 2021, the court had stayed the arrest of ‘Mirzapur’ producers Ritesh Sidhwani and Farhan Akhtar. However, in the same order, the court had also made it clear that the investigation shall go on and the petitioners shall cooperate in the investigation. Appearing for the petitioner, their counsels had argued that even if all allegations in the FIR were accepted to be correct, no case was made out against the petitioners. There was no allegation that the web series was produced with any deliberate or malicious intention of outraging the religious and social feelings of the citizen of India or to insult the religious and social feelings of the people of any particular class, the counsel had added. On the other hand, the state counsel had submitted that there was a specific allegation that the web-series hurt the social and religious feelings of the first informant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-quashes-fir-against-mirzapur-producers-akhtar-sidhwani/articleshow/88214820.cms||---

The fine was imposed as after GCZMA began the proceedings, the complainant and the alleged offender asked the authority to dispose of the matter stating that they want to now settle the dispute amicably. The GCZMA had received a complaint in November 2020 that the alleged offender had constructed the first floor on his structure illegally at Khobrawaddo in Calangute, without the necessary permissions. The GCZMA had accordingly begun the proceedings against the alleged violation. But at the latest hearing held last month, ‘the complainant and the respondent submitted that they both want to settle the matter amicably and requested the authority to discharge them and dispose of the matter accordingly’. “The authority, after hearing both the parties, decided to dispose of the matter as requested by the parties with a condition that they will not file the complaint again and a cost of Rs 25,000 each is imposed on the parties to be deposited in treasury of the legal aid services’ office at high court of Bombay at Goa and produce the acknowledgement of the same before the authority before the next date of hearing,” the GCZMA ordered. The authority spent considerable time hearing the matter, where the alleged offender had even filed a counter complaint against the complainant and had asked GCZMA to look into it. The GCZMA had assured that the counter complaint would also be looked into. The alleged violating structure was falling beyond 500m from the high tide line. Personal hearings in the matter with the parties was held and the written replies had also been submitted by both parties to the authority, before they had a change of heart during the hearing last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gczma-fines-complainant-alleged-violator-for-withdrawing-plaint/articleshow/88215406.cms||---

They have complained to the range forest office. The range forest office has issued a notice to one such resort owner. The highway authorities had recently installed noise barriers along the Mumbai-Goa highway. TimesViewKarnala Bird Sanctuary, visited by over 220 bird species annually, is a priceless natural heritage. Loud party music or sharp noises of carpentry work in nearby resorts are unwelcome. Raucous sounds of human activities, especially after sundown, are disturbing for the winged residents and wild animals. Forest officials must stop this nuisance at once.A large number of resorts and hotels are found on both sides of the Mumbai-Goa highway which passes through the core bird sanctuary area. Several visitors turn up at the sanctuary and stay at the resorts and hotels during weekends and during festive time. However, loud music played at the resorts and the fabrication activities at the resorts are creating a nuisance for the birds. The Chinchvan villagers have alleged that high decibel music is being played during parties at the resorts and hotels all through the night. A group of villagers has handed over a written complaint to the range forest officer of Karnala Bird Sanctuary against one of the resort owners and have demanded action. “A complaint has been received from a group of villagers against one such resort owner. Based on their complaint, the resort owner has been served a notice. However, our staffers have not come across any violation, but this issue needs to be checked. The noise pollution issue is dealt with by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board,” said Narayan Rathod, range forest officer, Karnala Bird Santuary. “Our staffers have not come across any complaint from the sanctuary officials or the local residents. No checks have been made about the noise pollution at the resorts, but checks will be conducted,” said VV Killedar, regional officer-Raigad of the state anti-pollution board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-noisy-parties-spook-birds-at-karnala-sanctuary-one-resort-served-notice/articleshow/88215386.cms||Umesh K Parida

In view of the current situation and emergence of the Omicron variant, a proposal has been submitted to the chief minister for approval. We expect the proposal to be approved, albeit with stringent conditions,’’ a senior official said. Mumbai Congress President Charan Singh Sapra on Friday said there is no proposal before the Congress to postpone the rally. “December 28 is a very important day in the history of Congress; it’s the party’s foundation day. We will adhere to all the norms prescribed by the BMC and public health department,” he assured. Sapra pointed out that there are a few Omicron patients in the state and all of them are in home quarantine as there is no threat. “I think there should be no objection to the Mumbai Congress rally, particularly when a large number of poll rallies, with an attendance of at least one to two lakh, are planned in most of the election-bound states,” he added. A day after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi agreed for the December 28 rally in the city, Mumbai Congress President Bhai Jagtap wrote to the urban development department for permission to hold it at Shivaji Park. After reports from the BMC, the proposal was submitted to the urban development department, led by senior Sena leader Eknath Shinde. “Our information is that granting permission for the rally is just a formality. Certainly, there will be restrictions on the number of people allowed entry and it will be ensured that every one is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, as per the recent circular of the state government on rallies on open grounds,” a senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cm-to-decide-on-nod-for-cong-rally-at-shivaji-park/articleshow/88215404.cms||---
---||Dehradun||23% of U’khand MLAs are school passouts: ADR report||Dehradun: The Association for Democratic Reforms has released a report on the basis of which its affiliated state body known as 'Uttarakhand Election Watch (UEW)', a collection of several local NGOs including the RTI Club Uttarakhand, is educating voters across the state by holding awareness camps ahead of the assembly elections. Notably, the ADR report has found that 23% of state MLAs are school passouts who have studied between class 8 to 12. “We are holding voters’ awareness campaigns across the state. Currently, we have completed our three weeks long campaign in the 10 hill districts. In the coming days, we will hold such camps in three plain districts. We've appealed to the voters to cast their vote on the basis of the candidate and not on party lines. Also, we have tried to make them aware of their state assembly by making them more informed through data,” said Manoj Dhyani, coordinator of UEW. The report, which is an updated version of the earlier ADR report on Uttarakhand, since five assembly seats are currently vacant, reveals that 15 MLAs in the current assembly have an educational qualification between class 8 and 12 while 49 MLAs are either graduate or above. Currently, only six MLAs are women." This data reveals serious concerns because the MLAs are essentially lawmakers," added Dhyani.As far as crime records of lawmakers are concerned, 20 MLAs have declared "criminal" cases against them while 14 MLAs have "serious criminal" cases in their name. Two MLAs have cases related to "murder". The report further reveals that 46 out of 65 sitting MLAs are "crorepatis". Notably, minister Satpal Maharaj is the richest lawmaker among them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/23-of-ukhand-mlas-are-school-passouts-adr-report/articleshow/88214109.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Nagpur||NMC bent on land user change, ignores protests||Nagpur: Under alleged pressure from builders, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has continued the process to permit school and residential use on sprawling playground and garden in Nelco Gruh Nirman Sahakari Sanstha’s layout near Trimurti Nagar. The civic body did not hold hearings on the objections received, and cancelled the public notice, despite protests from people, including leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and former mayor Sandip Joshi etc. TOI had on September 4 and 13 highlighted how NMC issued public notice on August 6 inviting suggestions and objections to a proposal by Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) to change reservation of 1.24 hectare (1,33,472 sq ft) playground, and 0.33 hectare (35,521 sq ft) public utility (PU) land. NIT had proposed to build tribal girls’ hostel on playground and allot PU land for residential use. Leader of opposition in NMC Tanaji Wanve had asked NMC to do the needful on the request of a woman to change reservation of PU land to residential. The playground currently has reservation of school and library. The PU land was developed as garden, though it has reservation of parking. As per allegations of the people residing in the area, documents, pictures and information gathered by TOI, NIT had demanded change in reservation to favour some builders. NMC started the process by issuing public notice as general body under mayor Dayashankar Tiwari approved NIT’s proposal and gave consent to begin the process on January 20. As per NMC’s public notice, time period for submission of suggestions and objections was one month, till September 6. The Nelco society, some individuals, Fadnavis and Joshi objected to the proposal and demanded cancellation of the public notice. As per process, the NMC was supposed to hold hearing of NIT, those who objected, and then take decision. NMC town planning department on December 8 wrote to NIT asking it to measure exact area of playground and PU land through city survey office and submit details, while also considering objections raised by the people. “Proposal will be submitted to the government after receiving opinion of NIT and taking decision,” the department said. Secretary of the society Manohar Pande told TOI, “It was very unfortunate that NMC did not invite us for hearing. We were expecting NMC will cancel public notice and inform NIT. These two open spaces are lifeline of the entire area. Large number of people especially senior citizens and children use the playground for walking, fitness and recreation. Therefore, NMC should cancel the public notice.” Samir Sahasrabudhe, who runs a cricket club on the playground for children to practice daily, has developed and maintained the playground, which was lying abandoned earlier. With Rs40 lakh sanctioned by Fadnavis, NMC had also constructed walking track and installed green gym. Similarly, NMC had constructed compound wall and developed surface layer for garden on the PU land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-bent-on-land-user-change-ignores-protests/articleshow/88214835.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Lucknow||Among winners: A cancer survivor and a retired principal who lived his dream||Lucknow: A cancer survivor, 41-year-old Neha Mathur followed her calling for music 15 years after her marriage. It was after she beat cancer that she realised that life is too short to wait for the right time. Mathur was among 45 students who bagged medals at the 11th convocation ceremony of Bhatkhande University. Mathur is the winner of three gold medals in vocal music. “Music helped me cope with a traumatic phase after healing from cancer. My mother-in-law, who has always been fond of performing arts, insisted that I continue my passion which I had left due to several responsibilities after marriage. It was challenging to balance both personal and professional life but constant support from my family helped me throughout these years,” said Mathur. There is another example to show that there is no right time to pursue your passion. N Vakpati Raju (63) got admission to master’s in performing arts after his retirement from the post of principal from a school in Andhra Pradesh in 2014. He grabbed a bronze medal at Bhatkhande on Friday. Raju’s childhood dream to pursue music turned to reality only after he could think about himself after retirement. Similarly, Tanuja Bora, who stood third in the university, worked in the commercial tax department for years and quit her job to pursue her passion for dance. Hailing from Haldwani, she learnt the basics of Kathak in her hometown. “Performing arts is a stress-buster in my life. Dance is like meditation which replenished me after work. I want to carry the art of dancing to different parts of the world,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/among-winners-a-cancer-survivor-and-a-retired-principal-who-lived-his-dream/articleshow/88215402.cms||---
---||Allahabad||UPRTOU to get NAAC grading||Prayagraj: Twenty-two years after being set up, the lone state open varsity of UP- Uttar Pradesh Rajarshi Tandon Open University (UPRTOU)- is now close to getting NAAC accreditation. The achievement would make it the third open university in the country, after IGNOU, New Delhi, and Netaji Subhas Open University, West Bengal, to get a NAAC accreditation. The NAAC team is set to be arriving on a three-day physical inspection and assessment visit to the UPRTOU campus, in Phaphamau, on December 15. NAAC is the autonomous institution of the University Grants Commission (UGC) that assesses and accredits higher education institutions of the country. “The achievement would make UPRTOU just the third open university of the country after IGNOU and Netaji Subhas Open University to get a NAAC accreditation,” said UPRTOU vice-chancellor, Prof Seema Singh. Prof Singh further said that on December 15, the NAAC peer team will reach for an on-site inspection. The team will undertake its inspection, interaction and assessment in the university for three days between December 15 and December 17. After the visit, the NAAC team will submit its report to NAAC, which would then award the final grading to the university. Earlier, NAAC grading was not necessary for open universities of the country. However, after the UGC (Open and Distance Learning) Regulations-2017, which came into effect in April 2019, every open university had to apply for this vital grading within one year. The time duration for applying for the same was, however, extended because of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. This led to UPRTOU kick-starting the process for bagging a NAAC grading. The process involves registration of the higher educational institutions (HEIs) on the NAAC official website, a compilation of the institutional data and information for Institutional Information for Quality Assessment (IIQA) and submission of the self-study report (SSR), after the acceptance of IIQA (If it is rejected then the educational institutions get two more attempts to resume the process within one year), followed by data validation and verification process, student satisfaction survey and NAAC peer team visit in the institution, for further verification. This finally leads to final grades being assigned to the institution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/uprtou-to-get-naac-grading/articleshow/88214831.cms||---
---||Pune||PMPML undecided about pvt vehicles in BRTS lanes||Pune: The PMPML at present doesn’t have any solution to deal with private vehicles entering BRTS corridors, conversations with officials concerned have brought it to the fore. Though the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) had plans to come up with boom barriers along the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) corridors and also reinstitute wardens along the line, nothing seems to have been finalized yet. The accident, which killed two youths after their vehicle crashed against a BRTS stop near Kharadi along the Pune-Ahmednagar Road on Wednesday midnight, was just one among the many mishaps to have taken place in the corridor, but PMPML officials maintained to call the accident unavoidable. They have no plans to safeguard the corridors. “Even if there were wardens or barriers, they couldn’t have stopped the car. It was zooming at very high speed and dashed past all the signage that alert motorists about the corridor,” a senior PMPML official said. However, on the status of the boom barrier project planned early last year, scrapped because of funds shortage, and being revived again, PMPML’s joint managing director Chetna Kerure said, “There are no updates.” Boom barriers are automated barriers on the entrances and gaps of all corridors to restrict private vehicles from entering them. The barriers would open only on arrival of a PMPML bus. The project was postponed in May this year only to be revived in July. “The process is still on but I don’t think the corporations have approved it yet. There are issues with funding,” another PMPML official said. He said the plan to depute wardens at the corridors, too, has not yet been finalized. “It is the PMC who decided to remove the wardens during the pandemic, as the corridors remained empty without buses for months. There were talks about bringing people back on contract but a decision is yet to be taken. However, in one of the busy lanes of the Nigdi-Dapodi BRTS corridor at PCMC, a few wardens have been deputed after the corporation’s approval. We do not have any communication from the PMC so far,” the official said. TOI’s calls to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane and mayor Murlidhar Mohol went unanswered. “We shall speak to our CMD today (Friday) informing him about the risks and accidents occurring at the corridors and request him to talk to the PMC and get an update on the PMC’s plans to keep the corridors safe,” the PMPML official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-undecided-about-pvt-vehicles-in-brts-lanes/articleshow/88214843.cms||Joy Sengupta

Speaking at the 11th annual convocation of the institute, Patel said that students should be connected online and various competitions should be organised for them. She and special guest Padma Bhushan awardee Saajan Mishra conferred medals and degrees on meritorious students on Friday. “While the institute and its students are learning and preserving cultural heritage with their talent, it is the duty of the university to connect with our younger generation and try to impart training and knowledge to them via online medium,” said Patel. Addressing the faculty, Patel urged that the university should plan and organise competitions for school students on Republic Day. “Bhatkhande must honour such children on the stage, like it does for medal winners. This will motivate children to take up performing arts,” she added. Patel also asked the institute to keep a check on the health of students, especially the girls. She motivated students to become ‘atmanirbhar’ (self-reliant). Mishra congratulated the medal winners and Phd holders and said that the culture of touching the feet of the guru was something unique to Indian classical music and dance. “Students nowadays don’t pay respect to their teachers as they used to. But it is a matter of pride to see that students of performing arts continue with the tradition,” said Mishra, adding that students and those who pursue singing can never commit any crime. The institute also paid tributes to Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, his wife, and others who died recently in the helicopter crash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/strike-a-chord-with-schoolkids-via-music-training-contests-guv-to-bhatkhande/articleshow/88215416.cms||---

Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy demanded that the state government should purchase the 49% stake held by the Centre to stop the alleged privatisation of SCCL. Congress also demanded that state government clear Rs 13,000 crore of its dues to the SCCL. SCCL is the first public sector undertaking in the country with the state and central governments having a share of 51% and 49% respectively. “TRS MPs did not utter a single word about SCCL privatisation during the ongoing winter session of Parliament. Both the TRS and BJP governments are hand-in-glove to sell away SCCL to private parties. Despite being majority shareholder in the SCCL, KCR government did not question Centre’s decision and his recent letter to PM was just an eye-wash,” said Revanth.

---||Kolkata||Fog-day flights hit by visibility device snag, airlines fear more disruptions||Kolkata: The city airport experienced fog-related flight disruptions on Wednesday morning, when there should not have been any. Airport sources said a critical instrument that measured the visibility in the middle of the runway had developed a snag. That, in turn, led to downgrading of the category of instrument landing system at the airport from CAT III-B, which allows flights to operate even in extremely low visibility, to CAT I that needs considerably higher visibility for operations. With no clarity on when the middle runway visual range (mid-RVR) would be operational again, airlines are worried about more disruptions in the next couple of months. For flyers, this could mean huge delays and crowding in the terminal during the busy winter holiday season. “The airport meteorology department is the custodian of the RVR equipment. It became unserviceable last month and we had immediately asked them to repair it. We had a lengthy meeting with the Met director who said he had informed his seniors in Delhi about the matter and was trying his best to repair or replace the equipment at the earliest. But until it is repaired, we may face problems in the coming weeks as well,” said a senior airport official. The ILS Category III-B landing system installed at Kolkata airport allows aircraft to land till visibility is up to 50metre on the runway. If it drops further, operations have to be suspended. But on Wednesday morning, landing had to be suspended when the visibility dropped below 550m, while take off was suspended below 200m due to the absence of the mid-RVR. The worst the visibility had dipped to was 150 m, higher than the minimum required for flights to land if the mid-RVR was functional. While Boeing aircraft can land at a minimum visibility of 50m, an Airbus aircraft requires 75m visibility to land. For take-off, the minimum RVR requirement is 125m. Kolkata airport has a touchdown-RVR, mid-RVR and end-RVR. But with the mid-RVR not working, a low-visibility procedure was initiated in which minimum visibility required for take-off is 200m and for landing 550m. Consequently, an Ethiopian Airlines flight from Addis Ababa to Dhaka, which was diverted to Kolkata due to poor visibility over the Bangladesh capital, had to be re-diverted to Mandalay in Myanmar at 6.15am. Five minutes earlier, an IndiGo Airlines flight from Bengaluru was diverted to Bhubaneswar. At 7.30am, a SpiceJet cargo flight from China’s Wuhan was diverted to Dhaka, where the weather had cleared by then. Another IndiGo flight from Chennai was diverted to Bhubaneswar at 8.05am. In between, an IndiGo flight, which was to take off, had returned to the bay for visibility to improve. Several other morning departures operated as usual when RVR requirements for them were met. When the suspension was announced passengers of some flights had already completed boarding and kept waiting till the situation improved. Another lot were made to wait at the terminal and they boarded the aircraft after the suspension was lifted but had to wait further till the flights scheduled to take off before them took off. Frustrated passengers took to Twitter. “IndiGo flight 6E 375 scheduled departure at 7am. Boarded passengers at 10.45am. Pilots were not available. Pilots arrived at 11.22am. Still waiting for departure. Miserable conditions for passengers arriving at the airport at 5.30am,” wrote a Raipur-bound passenger, Pawan Kajaria, at 11.32am. Air travel time between Kolkata and Raipur is hardly one-and-a-half hours. Another flier, Abhishek Rania, tweeted at 11.37am: “Flight time 7am, boarded at 10.30am for an 11am take-off. But pilots walk in at 11.30am, and no signs of take-off yet. Pilots are not even apologizing and threatening to cancel the flight now.” The fog was caused by the high humidity in the air following Sunday and Monday rain. Though the rain stopped around Monday evening, the overcast conditions led to a build-up of suspended particulate matter in the air. Condensation of water vapour on these microscopic particles led to the fog.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fog-day-flights-hit-by-visibility-device-snag-airlines-fear-more-disruptions/articleshow/88214868.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The corporation is dealing with a case filed by a mall pertaining to the collection of parking fee. The mall has also filed an application for allotment of licence to collect the parking fee. The civic body has refused licence to private establishments for collecting parking fee in spaces mandatorily allotted for parking as per the approved building plan. Licences are given only for parking spaces apart from the authorised ones. Corporation secretary on Thursday issued a directive citing the illegality in collection of fee for vehicles parked in approved parking area as per the building rules. As per the directive, malls and commercial buildings ought to have mandatory parking facility. Collection of fees is illegal. The parking area has to be retained as part of additional facilities. In case there is additional parking area, licence has to be obtained from the city corporation and the permit has to be displayed at the parking lot, the directive said. The directive has reignited the old debate regarding the issue. In 2014, the corporation’s revenue wing had acted against the collection of parking fee in private theatres in the city. However, the civic body found itself in a fix over the legality of the matter. The corporation stopped collection of parking fee citing building rules. In fact, Section 34 of Kerala Municipality Building. Rules does not make any mention about parking fee. The local body’s role is limited to ensuring that there is adequate parking space. It does not say that parking should be offered for free. Even in Kerala municipality act (KMA), no norm is laid out specifically for parking fee. Another Section 475 (KMA) deals with licence for private cart stand, which includes offering parking facilities for taxis, autos and in places like markets and open spaces and licence can be issued by charging rates up to Rs 3,000.  The legal counsel had advised the corporation against intervening in the matter of levying of parking fee by private theatres and hospitals. Later, Kerala State Film Development Corporation (KSFDC) forwarded a letter to the city corporation expressing the willingness to remit an annual payment of Rs 3,000 for collecting parking fee. Even in the assembly the present LSG minister and former LSG ministers have sounded vague about the matter. Recently, M V Govindan Master said the government was unaware about collection of parking fee in malls. He also said that there was no provision to collect parking fee in areas allotted for parking as per the building rules. Former LSG minister K T Jaleel had told the assembly that the building rules do not have any provision that mandate that parking should be provided for free in shopping malls and rules only call for mandatory parking spaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-questions-parking-fee-collection-at-approved-spaces/articleshow/88194193.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The move comes after chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, on November 30, announced the withdrawal of the law, which was opposed vehemently by the priest community since it brought over 50 temples, including Char Dham shrines under the state’s control. The cabinet had also given its consent to the contentious repealing the law on December 6. Leader of Opposition Pritam Singh told TOI, “We will not let the state government walk away from the issue. During a discussion on the issue on Saturday, we will question the government why was the board set up despite heavy opposition from the priest community and Congress.” He added that the government must inform people of the reasons that led to the creation of this board. “Due to strong opposition and with assembly elections around the corner, the government has decided to repeal the law. The U-turn has nothing to do with the interest of people but is solely aimed at elections,” said the Congress leader. The other seven bills tabled in the House on Friday included -- The Uttarakhand (Uttar Pradesh) Public Services (Tribunal) (Amendment), Bill, 2021, The Uttarakhand Civil Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, The Uttarakhand Agricultural Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) Reviving Bill, 2021, The Uttarakhand Panchayati Raj (Second Amendment) Bill, 2021, The Societies Registration (Uttarakhand Amendment) Bill, 2021, The Uttarakhand Nazul Land Management, Settlement and Disposal Bill, 2021 and The Amrapali University Bill, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/devasthanam-board-repeal-among-eight-bills-tabled/articleshow/88214130.cms||Kautilya Singh

A total of 45 medals—27 gold, 10 silver and 8 bronze—were conferred to recipients of all age groups at the 11th convocation ceremony on Friday. Manisha topped the list by grabbing 6 medals, including the prestigious Rai Umanath Bali gold medal and Pt Leela Wamanrao Sadolikar gold medal. Resident of Nainital, Manisha said that she dreams of getting a course started for dance at Kumaon University for other students. “I have been learning to dance for several years. My parents supported me. I began working for the medals right after witnessing the first convocation where my roommate told me the importance of these,” she said. Kunwar Satya Pratap Singh, who was touched by the teachings of his grandfather in singing during childhood, stood second and got hold of 4 medals in master’s of performing arts. “My grandfather used to sing and play sitar. I got really influenced by him and learnt singing in early childhood. Today I pledged to give back to society by helping those who are keen to learn the cultural heritage of our country but are not able to due to lack of resources,” said Singh. Oshandi Nirmani, a Sri Lankan, who got a scholarship to learn jazz, belle, contemporary and kathak from an institute in Kolkata, came here for higher education in Kathak. “It is a moment of pride for me to be the only member in the family to pursue performing arts,” she added.

As part of the drive against illegal Bangladeshis, the special branch wrote to West Bengal authorities, who said Reshma Khan’s birth certificate was not available. The special branch then wrote to Malwani police asking for action. Phatangare, who was senior inspector, did not initiate action, saying Deven Bharti had instructed him not to. Bharti was then joint CP (law and order), who supervised functioning of the 93 police stations in the city. The FIR was filed by now-retired inspector Deepak Kurulkar, who was then with special branch’s ‘I’ branch. These facts also came out in a probe done last year at state’s instance by then DG, home guards, Sanjay Pandey. Kurulkar wrote to the Records & Copying Sections in WB to cross-check the birth certificate of Reshma Khan issued from 24 Parganas. He said there was some alteration, which was suspicious. “I was called by Jt CP Bharti to his office. Bharti Sir was leaving and met me on the verandah. He told me not to pursue the case lest I get into trouble. Khan is connected with a senior politician and Phatangare will look into it, he said,” Kurulkar said in his FIR. He said 3 cops from ‘I’ branch visited Bengal, but could not find records. Kurulkar, through an RTI plea in 2017, sought information on the inquiry report.. ACP and information officer, Malwani, again refused to provide information, stating the record had been destroyed. Calling it a case of political rivalry, Azam said, “We will legally fight the case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-cops-say-deven-bharti-told-them-not-to-pursue-passport-case/articleshow/88215454.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Kolkata||Jab done? Kolkata private hospitals stop placing fresh orders for Covid vaccine||KOLKATA: Private hospitals across Kolkata have stopped procuring fresh vaccine stocks following a drastic slidae in the demand for inoculations since early-November. With figures indicating that the city has vaccinated 100% of its eligible recipients, queues at vaccination centres are now likely to keep shortening and their existing stocks were enough to last several months more, according to hospitals. The number of daily doses has slid to their lowest since inoculation started in January. More than 99% of recipients at private hospitals are now queueing up for their second dose and their number is now less than a tenth of what it would be at some hospitals during the post-second wave period that witnessed a rush for vaccines. Procurement of fresh stocks, as a result, has been deferred. While all city residents have already completed their vaccination, according to the CoWin website figures, this includes a substantial percentage of recipients from outside Kolkata who took their shots in the city. At Peerless Hospital, number of daily recipients has dropped to 30-40. It used to be more than 400 between June and September. The hospital holds a stock of 8,000 doses that would earlier be exhausted in less than two weeks. “But now our stocks will last six months more unless a third vaccine is announced. So, we don’t need to get more vaccines,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. He added that most recipients now are either the elderly who couldn’t get their shots in time or the 18-plus age group who started getting their shots after the government inducted them into the inoculation drive in May. “Due to the prevailing second wave and the rush, many of these two groups couldn’t get their shots in time. There had also been a shortage of vaccines in July-August which led to a delay for many. But a far larger number of second dose recipients are now going to the government centres that have now streamlined the process even as the rush, too, has come down,” added Mitra. AMRI Hospitals, which would administer more than 600 doses a day between June and August at its three centres, is now administering around 100. It holds a stock of 16,000 vaccines that will last several months more unless the demand pattern changes, said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. “We are getting just the last batch of second-dose recipients. Our counters have never been so sparsely populated since January,” said Barua. He agreed with Mitra that government-run vaccination centres were now being preferred by those yet to complete their dosage. “They offer free vaccines and are no longer crowded. So, many are flocking them,” said Barua. Medica Superspeciality Hospital has been inoculating 50 a day on an average recipients since November. It has 3 lakh doses in stock that are enough to last a year, unless the demand shoots. Belle Vue Clinic has been administering just 30 doses daily on an average for the last three weeks. “At this rate, our stocks will last till April. So, we need not procure fresh stocks unless the demand pattern changes,” said CEO R Tondon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jab-done-city-private-hospitals-stop-placing-fresh-orders-for-vax/articleshow/88214117.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||It’s official! Santa’s coming to Kolkata's Park Street on December 20||KOLKATA: The stage is set to welcome Santa back to the city of joy. Like last year, Kolkata Christmas Festival will be a four-day event starting December 20, followed by a five-day Park Street Festival from December 26 to 30. In between, there will be a two-day break on Christmas Eve and Christmas day. The Christmas festival will be inaugurated by chief minister Mamata Banerjee on December 20. Peppered with live choir and band performances, programmes will be held till December 23 inside Allen Park on Park Street. “There will be Christmas carols in the evenings presented by various choirs and bands performing thereafter. The carols will be in English, Hindi, Bengali and Nepali to cater to a diverse audience,” said Michael Shane Calvert, chief coordinator of Kolkata Christmas Festival. Keeping in view the Covid situation, the organizers have decided not to allow food stalls along the northern pavement. Only three stalls will be allowed inside the Church premises to sell Christmas cakes and goodies. “We want people to enjoy Christmas but not contribute to the crowd on Park Street. Hence, the decision to do away with food stalls like last year,” reasoned Calvert. However, like every year, the entire stretch of Park Street between Chowringhee and AJC Bose Road will be lit up. At the entrance to Allen Park will be a 20-ft Christmas tree. “The crib that we are making will be placed in the park and inaugurated by CM Mamata Banerjee at 4.30pm,” said Catholic Association of Bengal president Angelina Mantosh. After the CM’s welcome speech, there will be carols by three groups, followed by performances by three bands. Carols and band performances are lined up on all days. Like last year, there will be a two-day break on Christmas eve and Christmas day followed by events conducted by the tourism department. The Kolkata Police band will perform on December 27. “We will keep the functions enjoyable yet low-key so that there is no major crowd build-up,” said Calvert. Catholic Association of Bengal has taken over the maintenance of Mother Teresa Island at the Park Street-Camac Street intersection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/its-official-santas-coming-to-park-street-on-dec-20/articleshow/88214139.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Hyderabad||Telangana HC dismisses Vatti’s plea on Pattiseema lift irrigation project||HYDERABAD: Stating that it cannot look into issues where it has no jurisdiction, the Telangana high court on Friday dismissed a 2015 petition filed by AP’s former minister Vatti Vasanth Kumar who challenged the construction of Pattiseema Lift Irrigation Project. He raised a grievance that the construction of the project would mean the diversion of Godavari water into Krishna river and depriving farmers of Godavari delta of water for their irrigational needs. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N Tukaramji, while dismissing the plea, made it clear that it will not take up such issues when a dedicated water tribunal, Brijesh Kumar Tribunal, is functioning to resolve water sharing disputes. Telangana’s additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao contended that Article 262 (2) says that even Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to look into inter-state water sharing disputes when there are dedicated tribunals to look into issues related to the environment, rivers, etc. “Seen from this angle, the current petition is not maintainable before this court,” he said. The petitioner contended that even Telangana and other riparian states may raise grievances in the future when a state decides to unilaterally link rivers at its end. He said that in the Pattiseema case, AP was planning to divert Godavari waters through Polavaram’s right main canal into the Krishna river for irrigation and industrial purposes. It even gave administrative sanction for spending Rs 1,300 crore for this purpose which would become a wasteful expenditure in the future upon completion of the Polavaram project, he said. The bench referred to the judgment of the apex court in the Atmalinga Reddy case and said that such petitions on water sharing were not maintainable before it and dismissed the plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-hc-dismisses-vattis-plea-on-pattiseema-lift-irrigation-project/articleshow/88214860.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Curtains down on MLC polls after Congress flip-flop, BJP voters’ picnic||NAGPUR: The curtains finally came down on one of the most interesting MLC local authority constituency polls, which witnessed a switch by a senior BJP corporator to the Congress to get the ticket, flip flop by the Congress over its candidate till the last moment, and the saffron party taking its corporators to a picnic to prevent poaching of votes. Nearly 99% polling took place on Friday at 15 centres across the district, as per the collector’s office. Entire process went on peacefully amid tight police security and now all eyes will be on the counting process on December 14 at Bachat Bhavan. Out of 560 voters, 554 exercised their right, while six skipped the process. Among those who skilled were four BSP corporators and one MIM councillor. This means BSP representatives defied party whip to abstain from voting since Congress ‘imported’ a RSS and BJP activist and allotted him the ticket. A councillor from Hingna was already prohibited from voting. The polling percentage increased after 10am, when the BJP brought its corporators from resorts at Pench in three buses to the collectorate, where two polling centres were located. Top BJP leaders were seen supervising and advising corporators, including city president Pravin Datke, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, senior corporator Sandip Joshi, Jayant Bangale and others. After casting their votes, the saffron party representatives flashed victory signs and posed for photographers. They heaved a sigh of relief after being kept out of the city for 12 days, and importantly, without their mobiles. “We are going to secure over 400 votes, including some from the opposition. All our 334 corporators and other members have voted for the party. We are confident of a crushing victory over Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA),” Datke told TOI. The elated BJP contestant Chandrashekhar Bawankule said the party was confident of victory right from day one, as all leaders in BJP work as one unit, unlike the opposition in tatters. “We are now waiting for the results on Tuesday,” he said. On other hand, the mood in the Congress camp was slightly down after Thursday’s flip flop over its candidate, but all of them performed their duty, as per directives from senior functionaries. In the morning, animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar convened a meeting of all 30 NMC corporators and zilla parishad members at Hotel Heritage, before they went to vote. Though Kedar refused to take TOI’s calls, city president Vikas Thakre said the meeting appraised voters about the voting process, to ensure they do not make while filling the preferential form. “Though BJP is ahead in numbers on paper, we are confident that independent Mangesh Deshmukh will put up a good fight. You never know what can happen on the counting day, so let us wait and watch,” Thakre told TOI. An elated Deshmukh, who contested for Mahadula seat on Congress ticket in 2013, said he got the lottery after the national party decided to support him and he was hoping for a win. “Just because of support from the Congress, my hopes of an unexpected win are revived,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/curtains-down-on-mlc-polls-after-cong-flip-flop-bjp-voters-picnic/articleshow/88214883.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Kolkata||KIFF plans Ray tribute to celebrate centenary year||Kolkata: The 27th edition of the Kolkata International Film Festival (KIFF) is gearing up for mega celebrations to commemorate the centenary year of Satyajit Ray. As part of the event, films of the legend will be screened daily at Nandan 1. A special audio-visual presentation is being made by cinematographer-turned-director Premendu Bikash Chaki for the Ray centenary exhibition. Plans of having a session with actors who have worked in Ray films are also on the cards. Festival chairperson Raj Chakraborty told TOI that special plans are being drawn up for Ray’s centenary celebrations at KIFF. “Everyone is coming up with ideas and suggestions to ensure that we can give a fitting tribute to the legend,” he said. Director Arindam Sil has given a proposal for an evening with Ray actors. The idea is to get the cast of Ray films from Kolkata and Mumbai together to travel down memory lane together. On the wishlist for this programme are the likes of Sharmila Tagore, Simi Garewal, Shabana Azmi, Jaya Bachchan and Tinnu Anand, among others. When Sil was asked about his proposal, he said: “Since I am not the official spokesperson for KIFF 27, I am in no position to answer this.” For many viewers, the opportunity to watch a restored Ray classic on the big screen is expected to be a big draw. “The inaugural film might also be a Ray classic,” the source added. There have been suggestions to invite Tinnu Anand to deliver the Satyajit Ray Memorial lecture. Ananda had assisted Ray in ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’ (GGBB), ‘Aranayer Din Ratri’ and ‘Seemabaddha’, among others. Special attraction this year is the Ray centenary exhibition. Shuvaprasanna is guiding the I&CA team to finalize the design aspect of the exhibition which is being curated by director Sudeshna Roy. “The exhibition will not only have photographs, writings and memorabilia of Ray but also relevant portions of write-ups by Sandip Ray, Barun Chanda, Prosenjit Chatterjee, Saswata Chatterjee, Shoojit Sircar, Debashish Deb, Debojyoti Mishra and Anindya Chattopadhyay, among others. Besides, there will be a three-minute audio-visual presentation by Premendu Bikas Chaki. This exhibition will be held at Nandan 2,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kiff-plans-ray-tribute-to-celebrate-centenary-year/articleshow/88214159.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The police identified the accused as Vishnu alias Panthalam Kannan of Punthalathazham. He has been booked for attempt to murder charges. Shibilal of Kottiyam is the complainant in the case. The police said the alleged crime took place on December 1. Vishnu, along with a friend, barged into an under construction house at Panackalam where Shibilal was engaged in work and attacked him using an iron rod and machete. They allegedly bludgeoned him on head using the iron rod and hacked him on his legs using the machete. The police had arrested the other accused Ananthu Krishnan on the same day of the crime. Vishnu had been hiding to evade the arrest till now. Vishnu was arrested from his hideout near Kochu Decentmukku in Kollam by a team led by Kottiyam sub inspectors Sujith B Nair and Shihas. The police said the provocation for the attack was a game of football which happened six months ago. The two accused were part of a team that was defeated by Shibilal’s team in the game that was held at the turf ground at Kannanalloor. The losing team was enraged by the victory celebrations of the winners and this made way for an unruly brawl. Though the brawl was stopped before it made way for more violence, the members of the losing team warned Shibilal and teammates of retaliation soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/one-more-arrested-in-attempt-to-murder-case/articleshow/88194200.cms||---

He was in Goa for the India International Science Festival (IISF). “India’s blue economy is understood as a subset of the national economy comprising an entire ocean resource system and human-made economic infrastructure in marine, maritime, and onshore coastal zones within the country’s legal jurisdiction. It aids the production of goods and services that have clear linkages with economic growth, environmental sustainability, and national security,” he said.  Singh said the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR) at Goa has the mandate of exploration of gas hydrate occurrences within the exclusive economic zones as well as multi-metal hydrothermal mineralisation in the Indian ridge area. The National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), with its headquarters at Goa, operates two research vessels that are equipped for multi-disciplinary oceanographic observations. “Efforts are on for development of suitable technologies for effective mining of some deep sea mineral resources and exploitation of gas hydrate resources and NCPOR can play a lead role in this,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/efforts-on-to-tap-marine-minerals-union-minister/articleshow/88215495.cms||---

The task for the organisers to mobilise crowd is more challenging as it coincides with the peak marriage season. The focus of the party is to bring as many people from the neighbouring districts. A meeting has been convened by higher education minister with special focus on Jaipur rural while the Jaipur urban is being handled by food and civil supplies minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas. The ministers and MLAs were also holding meetings in their respective constituencies to mobilise the crowd as the Congress leadership has reposed great faith in the state party unit. Meanwhile, hoardings and posters of the rally with pictures of Rahul Gandhi prominently dotting the skylines of Jaipur. It is speculated that this could be the second launching of Rahul to the helm of affairs of the party after a party brainstorming session in Jaipur in 2013 appointed him to the post of party vice-president. Meanwhile, leaders from other states have started coming to Jaipur. Former Puducherry chief minister Narayan Swami, former chief ministers of MP and Maharashtra, Digvijay Singh, Sushil Kumar Shinde AICC general secretary K C Venugopal also reached Jaipur on Friday to take stock of the preparations for rally. Khachariyawas unleashed an attack on the state BJP leaders who abused farmers till the other day. He asked them to go to villages and seek pardon from farmers after the Prime Minister Narendra Modi apologised to the farmers. He said, “State BJP leaders should go from village to village and apologise to the farmers by rubbing their nose to the ground. Because the BJP leaders of the state were abusing and threatening the farmers till the other day. Speaking to the media after a meeting of the party workers at Bani Park, he said that Congress workers will come out from every booth to the anti-inflation rally in Jaipur on December 12. Each assembly constituency of Jaipur has been given a target of bringing a crowd of 5,000 to the rally. Khachariyawas said that the Modi government at the Centre will be remembered for ending the subsidy of gas cylinders. Never before had the LPG subsidy ended. This fight of Congress is about the rights of the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-gears-up-to-make-rally-a-huge-success/articleshow/88214884.cms||---

Led by two advocates — Arindam Das of Calcutta High Court and Sunando Raha of Supreme Court — CCN aims to spread this initiative across the country. The legal team for Kolkata suburbs was formed on Friday. “Social and legal help does not only mean fighting cases in the court. For example, for claiming the ex-gratia amount, families might not know how to go about it. We can help them with the procedure. But if the need arises, we can take up certain issues in the court as well,” said Das, who also serves as the CCN vice-president. From helping in getting documents like legal heir certificate and filing a claim with a financial institute, the legal team will come to the rescue of the distressed. “We will not limit our activities only to issues related to ex-gratia claim but try and help whenever someone is denied justice on issues concerning Covid. We are also taking this National Covid Memorial – Legal Aid Services to other states as well,” said Raha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ccn-offers-legal-and-social-help-to-kin-of-covid-victims/articleshow/88214149.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Some Congress MLAs even entered the well of the House and raised slogans against the government. Last week, the convoy of former transport minister Yashpal Arya and his son Sanjeev Arya was attacked in Bajpur (Udham Singh Nagar). While the duo had escaped the attack unhurt, some of their supporters had sustained injuries. During the assembly session, Congress legislators claimed that the attack on the father-son duo, who recently left the BJP and joined the Congress, should be investigated and the guilty should be brought to justice. Leader of Opposition Pritam Singh said, “The government is trying to hush up the matter by not ordering a high-level probe into the matter. The issue should not be given a political hue. It is a serious matter concerning the poor law and order situation in the state.” He added that Arya and his son were on their way to attend an important political event and were attacked in a planned manner. Meanwhile, Congress MLA from Kedarnath Manoj Rawat cited his own experience saying that some people misbehaved with him at a helipad in his constituency. “A senior police official had called me to Kedarnath for a meeting with the CM to discuss preparations for the PM’s visit but I was denied a chopper and the heli company staff misbehaved with me. Why doesn’t the government check CCTVs in such cases,” he said. Speaking on the issue, agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said, “The official figures suggest that the crime rate in the state has gone down from 2012-2016 to 2017-2021. We are aware that those behind the attack have a close association with some politicians. Congress members are also well aware of the fact.” Unhappy with Uniyal’s jibe, Congress MLAs stormed into the well of the House and raised slogans against the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/congress-attacks-govt-over-attack-on-former-minister-yashpal-arya-his-son-sanjiv/articleshow/88214163.cms||Kautilya Singh

The petitioner says that the transfer order was issued in violation of IFS Cadre Rules-1996, especially when the court had ordered a fact-finding investigation into the irregularities reported from the Corbett National Park. Further, the petitioner asked the court to stop IFS officer Parag Madhukar Dhakate, who has been named the new chief wildlife warden of the state, from assuming office. It alleges that his appointment was made in violation of the Wildlife Protection Act and the Forest Manual. Notably, an inspection of the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) by the Supreme Court-appointed panel had revealed that forest authorities carried out construction activities at the upcoming Pakhro Tiger Safari (PTR) — envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi — using concrete instead of eco-friendly material. The SC panel report added that approvals were not taken from the National Tiger Conservation Authority, National Board for Wildlife and the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change before carrying out these construction works. The action goes “against the provisions of Indian Forest Act of 1927, Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980 and Wildlife Protection Act of 1972,” added the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pil-seeks-quashing-of-hoffs-transfer-in-corbett-illegal-construction-case/articleshow/88214172.cms||---

Grade III overseer Raju Ramachandran is the official who was arrested. The VACB official said that the arrest was made based on a complaint filed by Jose Thomas, a dairy farmer based at Kottarakkara in Kollam district. Jose Thomas alleged in his complaint that Raju Ramchandran had demanded bribes to release a fund of Rs 27,000 sanctioned by the panchayat to construct a cattle shed on his house premises. Jose Thomas promptly informed the VACB officials about this. The officials laid a trap and used the complainant to summon the accused to a resort in Kollam city to pay the amount. Raju Ramachandran turned up at the resort at 4.30 pm on Thursday.

---||Pune||Burglars target locked flats, vigil up in NIBM Rd societies||Pune: A spate of burglaries over the last few months in NIBM Road-Mohammedwadi area has caused concern for the residents. The managing committees of several societies are now contemplating a hike in maintenance charges to ramp up security. Last Sunday, an apartment in Parmar Residency in Kondhwa, was ransacked by burglars who broke in through the front door. Rachel Ignatius, daughter-in-law of the house owner, said, “Since my in-laws are out of town we stay there on some weekends. That day, we were out. Our neighbour called to inform us about the attempt. There were no valuables or cash to be found, so the loss was not much, but we lodged an FIR on Tuesday.” Another flat in the same society, with the owners away and renovation work going on, was found broken into in a similar manner. Acting chairman Girish Samangadkar said, “We believe that the two houses were broken into by the same people on the same day, but since the residents were away, neighbours spotted the break-in later. There have been instances of such break-ins before. The society has different accommodations varying from one-room kitchen to 2-3 BHKs and not all residents are willing to pay the increase in the monthly maintenance to ramp up security. The guards are paid between Rs 8,000 and Rs 10,000, which makes it difficult to manage their home and family responsibilities, so they take up odd jobs which may have given the thieves a chance to slip in. It is also possible that they may have crept in from the Bhairoba Nullah side of the society and the adjacent slum area. The local police are investigating.”  CCTV camera footage from Mayfair Eleganza phase II indicates unidentified men in masks entering the society from the boundary wall and exiting the same way. “After the first lockdown there were a couple of cases of burglaries and attempted thefts at different housing societies in the NIBM-Mohammedwadi, Salunke Vihar and Kedarinagar area. Security was ramped up at that time. The police also increased patrolling in the area so we felt safer, but now again such cases are cropping up. We are concerned,” Lalita Mansukhani, a resident of NIBM Road, said. A management committee member of a big housing society on NIBM Road said, “We have security guards working sincerely, screening visitors for temperature and oxygen levels, maintaining logs of entries and exits. Big housing societies are vulnerable as entries can be from many points. We have a comprehensive CCTV camera system, but sometimes even this facility might fail to prevent such burglaries. Neighbours can keep vigil and report it to the management or security.” Some housing societies have instructed their security guards to be extra vigilant at night, while some are planning to increase maintenance to install better surveillance equipment and increase security personnel on the premises. Chairperson of another housing society on Salunke Vihar Road said, “Residents have reported theft of petrol and vehicle parts from the parking over the last few months, but no FIRs have been filed as they were minor. When these instances increased last year, our security guards on the night shift started vigorous rounds on the premises and through the parking areas as well. We cannot let our guard down considering that thefts that have taken place in the close-by societies.” (With inputs from  Gitesh Shelke)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/burglars-target-locked-flats-vigil-up-in-nibm-rd-societies/articleshow/88214890.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

I am already a four-time corporator. Now, I will work to strengthen the party in my area and also work for it during the civic polls,” he told TOI. The staunch RSS activist said as per directives from the Congress, he voted for independent candidate Mangesh Deshmukh, despite himself being in the fray. “How can I vote for myself defying the party whip. If someone has voted for me, I do not know.” A visibly upset Bhoyar clarified that he never told the Congress party about his inability to contest the polls, as mentioned by Congress vice president Mohan Joshi in a statement to party’s elected and nominated representatives on Thursday evening. “However, I do not have any complaints against the party and toed its line while exercising my franchise. I was never unable to contest the polls.” On whether he will go back to the BJP after being dumped by the Congress, he said he will never rejoin the saffron camp, but will work to ensure its defeat in the forthcoming elections. “The BJP can plant anyone in any party, but it cannot plant Bhoyar,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/will-neither-contest-nmc-polls-nor-go-back-to-bjp-bhoyar/articleshow/88214898.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Lucknow||Saryu canal: A watershed project for water-positive UP||A flowing river is a living ecosystem – it supports and nurtures our soil, forests, wetlands and irrigates our farmlands, while performing many critical functions. The politics of irrigation development in Purvanchal just a decade back, mirrored this: no real strategy to resolve local irrigation issues, coupled with periodic losses from floods. Flooding is a part of natural cycle, but flood impacts can definitely be minimised using sound water management. A strategic commitment is required to solve the problems of flooding and conjunctive management of water. This is even more important when the water demand in UP is growing manifolds. With the new water framework and governance starting from 2017, many new water schemes and pending projects are being revived with a new lease of life The Saryu Canal project was incepted in 1978 and eventually got lost within different governments. It was revived and completed in 5 years after four decades of long waiting period. The inauguration of the Saryu Canal Project is a watershed moment as this is also the area where Gautam Buddha resolved the first water conflict in the recorded history, the water sharing between Rohini and Rapti rivers. For the ‘Panchsheel’ theory which Gautam Buddha gave, the water sharing became the starting point. The water will be judiciously used and returned back to the nature and will also act as a recharge to aquifers. And when the groundwater improves, the flow in the rivers also improves. The Saryu Canal connects to the National Irrigation Project that would help meet the growing irrigation demands of three million farmers while opening the doors for the precision and modern irrigation systems in the State. The irrigation facility will be expanded in Bahraich, Gonda, Shravasti, Balrampur, Basti, Siddharthnagar, Sant Kabir Nagar, Gorakhpur and Maharajganj of Purvanchal. For long, for farmers like those in the region, it seems that no matter how significant the social or economic benefits of their less formal practices, the politics was likely to continue to lead to them being dismissed by those in authority. But we realised that with robust water governance, quality of life of marginalised and small farmers could be substantially improved. Furthermore, the capacity of irrigated area has increased from 3.12 lakh hectare to 14.04 lakh hectare. This project is not having any adverse ecological impact on the rivers because the rivers are not being allocated over their required ecological in-stream flows. Helping farmers cope with flood, drought Uttar Pradesh covers about 28.7% area of the Ganga basin. It has most fertile and productive land with vast water resource potential – thanks to many rivers and water bodies. With about 4 million tubewells and one of the largest canal networks in the country, the state has about 87% irrigated area while the national average is only 49%. Groundwater has a prominent share of 70% in irrigated agriculture, while providing about 90% of rural domestic supplies, more than 75% of urban water demands and also meeting about 95% of industrial requirements. UP is particularly vulnerable to extreme events. Therefore, we need a resilient and robust water management system in the state. With the start of the Saryu canal project, the surplus water can be used in far-flung areas, and flooding impacts are likely to reduce in Mahsi, Kaiserganj, Nanpara and Motipur tehsil areas of the district. Five rivers have been connected through the link canals in this project, which include Ghaghra River, Saryu River, Rapti River, Banganga River and Rohin River and 6,600km of canals have been added to the 318km long main canal. Saryu canal has been taken out from the banks of Girjapuri barrage on Ghaghra river in Bahraich. With this water will be brought to the Saryu barrage built on the Saryu river. Rapti Link canal has been built in Shravasti ahead of it, which will be used for Rapti main canal. Two branches have been made for Basti and Gonda districts from the Saryu main canal itself. Similarly, arrangements have been made to transport water from Rapti main canal to Balrampur, Siddharthnagar and Maharajganj and Gorakhpur in Shravasti. Livelihoods revived More importantly, the project would also help stabilize the farming economy in the long run. The project will now provide farmers with enough water for agricultural production in the dry season while protecting them from floods in the rainy season. Supporting smallholder irrigation through finance and technical assistance will significantly improve productivity and incomes of the farmers. The government is already creating an enabling environment where farmers have information on the various systems, financial services to help them invest, and market access to sell their produce.

---||Mumbai||Malik: Can still comment on misuse of central agencies in Mumbai||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Friday accepted state minister Nawab Malik’s apology in his affidavit tendered through his senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, for making public remarks against Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede and his family despite his earlier undertaking to refrain from comments till the court’s interim orders.. Malik said none of the three statements cited as his breach were press statements issued by him, but were “responses in course of interviews with journalists…to specific questions”. “I have since been advised that the undertaking would cover any responses to specific questions too and in future will not respond to any posed to me,” the minister said, adding that he, however, believes that he can comment on “political misuse of central agencies and the conduct of their officers in course of their duties”. Senior counsel Birendra Saraf, appearing for the NCB officer’s father Dnyandev Wankhede, said that the fresh undertaking may be tweaked to say Malik not be prevented from commenting on performance of duties “hereinafter”. The court agreed and the undertaking was changed to: “I, however, believe my statement would not prevent me from commenting on the political misuse of central agencies and conduct of their officers in the course of performance of their official duties hereafter.” Saraf and advocate Diwakar Rai, for Wankhede, said Malik cannot speak of the NCB officer’s past actions. Justice Kathawalla concurred that Malik “will not speak about this officer…” Chinoy said that Malik would not speak about the Wankhedes or their holiday overseas or what happened in the past, but as an officer, Malik has a right to comment on Wankhede’s future professional performance. Dnyandev had filed an appeal against a November 22 HC order of Justice Madhav Jamdar on his plea to restrain Malik from tweeting and making public posts against him and his family to malign them. Justice Jamdar had observed that Malik’s tweets were “actuated by malice” and posted without reasonable verification, but had not granted a “blanket” restraining order on him. The single-judge bench had instead said that the fundamental rights of both sides be balanced and directed Malik to tweet only after reasonable verification in future. By a consent order on November 29, Justice Jamdar’s interim order was set aside and Malik had promised to not post or comment against the Wankhedes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/malik-can-still-comment-on-misuse-of-central-agencies-in-mumbai/articleshow/88215459.cms||---

In the final probe report submitted before the Uttarakhand high court, the BJP MLA has been cleared of the rape charge. Meanwhile, the single bench of Justice RC Khulbe also heard two petitions concerning the case on Friday. The first petition, filed by MLA Negi, urged the HC to scrap Dehradun’s Chief Judicial Magistrate court order that asked him to submit his DNA samples. However, the high court bench has scrapped the petition. The second petition was filed by the complainant woman. In her petition, she urged the court to order a CBI probe into the case saying that the MLA is using his position to influence the current probe. She added that two investigating officers were also replaced by the state government to safeguard the MLA. After hearing the petition, the court issued notice to the Uttarakhand government and MLA Negi and asked them to submit their responses in four weeks. To recall, Negi had been booked for rape and criminal intimidation in September 2020 after a woman accused him of having raped her and fathered her child. The woman had demanded Rs 5 crore from him as child support but he dismissed the allegations and refused to pay the amount, saying it was an extortion attempt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/probe-report-submitted-in-court-gives-clean-chit-to-rape-accused-dwarahat-mla/articleshow/88214173.cms||---

The Wankhede couple had last month approached the city civil court at Dindoshi with a suit seeking orders to social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Google India, to block individuals who were trying to “malign” them. Their plea for interim relief, filed through advocate Rohan Janardhanan, was “to restrain from airing, publishing, displaying or playing malicious, defamatory and deprecatory contents against the plaintiffs or their relatives in any manner”. The platforms fall in the category of ‘intermediary’ as defined under Section 2 (w) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and as ‘significant social media intermediary’ as defined in the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, said Wankhedes’ suit and “ are major players in the social media business and have a lot of influence”. Wankhede said allegations are being made not just against him, but also against his wife and distant kin, mainly on social media, “even by some political leaders” and “fly-by-night’’ operators.  A bevy of lawyers including counsel Yadunath Bhargavan for Wankhede, Charushila More for Google India, Soli Cooper with Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas, the leading law firm for Facebook, Sarvesh Jain with Vedchetan Patil for Twitter Communications India were also present on November 30 before the Dindoshi court in suburban Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-file-reply-on-wankhedes-suit-court-tells-twitter/articleshow/88215465.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Man held for stealing vehicle hired on rent||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kazhakootam police have arrested a man wanted in connection with a case related to fraud involving theft of a vehicle that was taken on rent. The police identified the accused as Sajeer, 38, of Thrithalackal in Thrissur district. He is the second accused in the case. The police had earlier arrested the first accused in the case Fidelis Francis of Valiyathura several weeks ago. He is currently out on bail. The police said the crime related to the case took place in April this year. The first accused rented a Toyota Innova car from the complainant Firoz Mamman of Kazhakootam citing the purpose of a wedding. Fidelis then handed over the vehicle to Sajeer, who absconded with it. The complainant approached the court with a cheating complaint following which the police registered a case and launched a probe. Though they managed to arrest the first accused, Sajeer successfully remained at large. The police have arrested him from his hideout based on a tip off received by Kazhakootam Cyber City Assistant Commissioner C S Hari. The arrest was made by a team led by Kazhakootam station house officer inspector J S Praveen. Following the arrest, the accused was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/man-held-for-stealing-vehicle-hired-on-rent/articleshow/88194220.cms||---
---||Pune||PMC may review draft delimitation||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) may review the draft delimitation for civic elections after the recent Supreme court’s decision on reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs). The civic body recently submitted the draft to the election commission. “We are waiting for direction from the state election commission regarding the civic polls. If they direct us to review delimitation, the process will be carried out accordingly,” said Ravindra Binwade, additional commissioner, PMC. The civic officials said that factors like OBC population, SC/ST population have been considered while drafting the delimitation. The Supreme Court has put on hold election for 27 per cent seats reserved for OBC candidates in Maharashtra local body polls. The election process for other seats are to continue as scheduled, the apex court said. The SC ruling overrides the state government’s ordinance for reserving the seats for OBC candidates. The ordinance allowed for OBC quota in rural bodies with the rider that once combined with the SC and ST reservations, the combined quota will not cross the 50% limit. Also, the OBC quota will not cross 27% of the seats in keeping with the existing state legislation. As per the data, around 46 seats would have gone to the OBCs in the PMC if reservation is allowed for these communities, said PMC officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-may-review-draft-delimitation/articleshow/88214911.cms||---

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has approved the allocation of a 36-crore budget to conduct a special campaign across the state to link each family with the health insurance scheme. The campaign aims to provide universal health coverage to the people of the state so that if they fall ill, they get cashless treatment at empaneled government and private hospitals. A fleet of ASHA workers, Anganwadi workers, auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs), panchayat workers, and all other ground-level workers will survey districts and find the ones who are yet to get registered under the health insurance scheme. After the survey, such families will be encouraged to get registered via e-mitra. To encourage workers involved in the survey, the state government has introduced rewards of Rs 500 to workers who will help get five families registered under the scheme, and for each next family (after the first five) getting registered, each worker will get an extra Rs100. To achieve100% target of registration of families under the scheme, collectors of respective districts will be allowed to rope in registered NGOs, which will also get similar incentives. So far, 1.33 crore families have already been registered under the scheme and over 5.7 lakh people have benefited so far. Under the scheme, 788 government and 590 private hospitals are empaneled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-to-reward-workers-who-get-families-enrolled-under-chiranjeevi/articleshow/88214912.cms||---
---||Pune||MSEDCL to improve dist power supply network||Pune: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) will set up new sub-stations for improving the power supply network in the district. Besides strengthening the sub-stations, MSEDCL will also look after the installation of new transformers across rural parts of the district. The work will be carried out under the new agriculture pump policy. The payment of the pending power dues of 66% funds, 33% for respective gram panchayats and 33% for the district, will be used for strengthening the power network. According to MSEDCL officials, as the farmers pay their pending agriculture power dues, 66% of that amount will be used for the agriculture contingency fund. “Sub-stations play a vital role in transmitting the power to the outgoing feeders, which are connected to the transformers. These transformers supply power to the consumers. Hence, its capacity building is as important as setting up new ones,” said an MSEDCL official. The official said from the past few weeks, around 470 power infrastructure works worth Rs13 crore have been completed from the agriculture contingency fund. “The amount in the contingency fund will continue to increase, as the farmers will pay their pending dues and eventually the funding will improve the power distribution network in the region,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msedcl-to-improve-dist-power-supply-network/articleshow/88214903.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Nagpur||1,400 persons, including 750 women, missing in Nagpur since 2015||NAGPUR: Around 1,400 persons, including 750 women, have gone ‘missing’ in the city since 2015 as per records with the cops, who have devised various mechanisms to trace them out. In January, TOI had also published RTI data revealing that 59 minors had gone missing last year, and many of them are still untraceable. The latest case of 22-year-old Farzana Quereshi has once again brought into focus cases of persons going missing. A missing report had been lodged at Sadar police station after Farzana did not return home on December 3. Investigations led cops to her body lying at Empress Mall in decomposed condition on December 8. In the light of this case, the city police are once again revamping their campaign to trace missing persons, whether adults or minors. CP Amitesh Kumar said drives to trace missing persons were conducted on at least four occasions in the last fortnight. “The readers (assistants) of Zonal DCPs have been assigned the special role of monitoring missing cases at police stations within their jurisdictions. Detailed report of each cases is being collected,” said the CP. “The readers update the Zonal DCPs about the latest progress in each case and then they are supposed to monitor and supervise the cases,” said the top cop, adding sustained drives have been undertaken in the last one year to track down the missing persons. Kumar also said that every missing case is being monitored seriously, and it is a wrong perception that cases involving adults are overlooked. “We hold review meetings of the investigation officers (IO) of missing persons cases periodically, even at the top level. This ensures the probe is heading steadily in the right direction without any indifference or lethargy,” said the top cop. The CP said even in the case of adults eloping with their partners, they are brought to the police stations and allowed to go after recording their statements, with detailed background. “We can’t force adults to follow our dictums, and they are allowed to take their own decisions. The police only record their details elaborately as their missing complaints have been lodged, to keep track of what happened with them after leaving home,” he said. A community approach to the problem of missing cases is also being taken through ‘Police didi’ campaigns, which are being monitored by Joint CP Aswati Dorje. Under her, a team of cops from every police station supervised by an officer regularly visits localities, schools, colleges and colonies. They create awareness against misuse of social media, threats of befriending unknown persons on social media platforms, and eloping at tender age with friends or acquaintances, which may expose people to unknown dangers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/1400-persons-including-750-women-missing-in-city-since-2015/articleshow/88214917.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Dehradun||Cong stages walkout over employment data||Dehradun: Opposition Congress on Friday walked out of the House, accusing the BJP government of presenting wrong employment data in the Assembly. Party legislators citied the examples of previous replies of government in the assembly on employment to substantiate their allegation. Opposition MLAs said that on December 22, 2020, the state government in its reply in assembly had claimed to have given employment to over 10 lakh people from 2017 to 2021 and on March 4, 2021, government had mentioned giving jobs to 7 lakh people. In a reply to a question put forthCongress MLA Qazi Nizam-ud-Din, skill development minister Harak Singh Rawat said that from 2017 to January 31, 2021, 7.5 lakh people of the state had been given jobs. Congress legislators questioned how the number of employment given by the government has gone down. After minister Harak Singh Rawat said that the Congress had deliberately raised the issue keeping in mind the forthcoming election, the Opposition members staged a walkout from the House. “Now the minister needs to clarify whether the data presented in the House in December 2020 was correct or the details shared in the Assembly in March 2021 were genuine. It needs to further clarify if the numbers were wrong and the one presented on Friday was correct. This is a serious issue of presenting wrong details in the House and misleading the assembly,” leader of opposition Pritam Singh said. Singh, who represents Chakrata constituency, said that he was surprised at how the number of employment by the government has reduced in the last one year. In his reply, Skill Development minister Harak Singh Rawat said that it was not possible to give government jobs to each individual.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cong-stages-walkout-over-employment-data/articleshow/88214204.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘State govt, panel differed on OBC data required’||Mumbai: The state government on Friday approved the first tranche of funds worth Rs 5 crore for functioning of the Backward Class Commission. Sources said there was a difference of opinion between the state and MSBCC on the type of OBC data required. While MSBCC wanted to conduct a full caste census, the state felt that random sampling and the use of secondary data would suffice. There was also the tricky question on how to define the political backwardness of OBCs. “Designing a questionnaire to establish the political backwardness of a community is much more difficult than trying to define its economic backwardness,” said a senior official. The state has repeatedly asked for the Centre to provide the empirical data required from its Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC). “If the Centre’s data on OBCs can be used for schemes like the Ujjwala Yojana, why can’t it be shared with us and used for this exercise,” asked food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who belongs to the OBC community. BJP leaders like Devendra Fadnavis have said the SECC data has many errors and does not fit the requirements of the SC. Meanwhile, the state is hoping that the next hearing of the SC on the case on December 13 brings some relief for the upcoming local body polls slated for December 21. The state is filing an affidavit asking for the local body polls to be held with the OBC quota seats or postponed altogether. The Akhil Bharatiya Mahatma Phule Samata Parishad led by Bhujbal is also filing an intervention application. “The commission will compile empirical data, but this will take time. Till then, the local body polls should be allowed as before with the help of the state’s ordinance,” said Bhujbal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-govt-panel-differed-on-obc-data-required/articleshow/88215472.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Omicron cases in Mumbai rise to 5, Pimpri Chinchwad 10||MUMBAI: All three Omicron cases in the city had mild symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, among such others, said SevenHills Hospital dean Dr Balkrishna Adsul. In Maharashtra, Pimpri Chinchwad has the highest number of cases so far (10)—all from a single family, followed by Mumbai (5), while Pune and Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal corporation have one case each. Four of the 17 affected in Maharashtra are children, aged 1.5, 3.5, 7 and 12 years. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said although all are unvaccinated, since they are minors, they don’t have any symptoms. Six of the 17 Omicron patients have already been discharged from hospitals, he added. The Dharavi resident was admitted to SevenHills on December 4. Although Tanzania doesn’t feature among ‘at-risk’ countries, he was subjected to an RT-PCR test at the airport as part of random sampling of 2% travellers returning from overseas. As soon as he reached his residence, civic officials were informed by the airport authorities he was positive. He was shifted to SevenHills while two of his contacts tested negative. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of F-N ward, said he didn’t have any symptoms. The person is unvaccinated. The other two Mumbai cases are a 25-year-old fully vaccinated man, who had arrived from London on December 1. Another patient is a 37-year-old man (originally resident of Gujarat), who came from South Africa on December 4. He too is fully vaccinated. Incidentally, all 10 cases of Pimpri-Chinchwad are from the same family. The source of the cluster, till now largest in the state, is likely to be a 44-year-old NRI woman who had come from Lagos in Nigeria with her daughters aged 12 and 18. Of the seven new cases in the state, four were vaccinated, one was partially vaccinated and one unvaccinated. Speaking at a webinar on Friday, virologist Dr Shahid Jameel said the Omicron variant is concerning due to its highest number of mutations among any variant so far, 50 in all, with 32 in the spike protein, making it more transmissible than even Delta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-omicron-cases-in-city-rise-to-5-pimpri-chinchwad-10/articleshow/88214941.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Sambhar Salt Ltd has recently invited expression of interest (EoI) from companies to set up the project. Out of the 58,000 acres the company has, it currently uses only a fraction of 2,500 acres for salt production and a large area can be utilised for solar power generation. As per industry estimates, over 16,000 acres would be required to set up the 4,000MW plant. This would mean setting up solar panels in large swathes of land. It is feared that such a large-scale project on the wetland could wipe out the eco-system with all its genetic diversity. Sambhar attracts a lot of birds. In the past few years, the archeological department with assistance from the Centre has spent close to Rs 100 crore to develop Sambhar as a tourist destination. Of late, it has also become a destination for film shooting. Kavita Srivastava, chairperson of People’s Union For Civil Liberties (PUCL), said, “They have to share the environment impact assessment study of the project before taking any decision. If they have not done that, they need to stop the exercise immediately.” While the solar industry in the state is always in favour of such projects, some representatives said that there was no dearth of barren or semi-barren land for solar plants in districts such as Bikaner, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Barmer. “Sambhar is not the right place,” they opined. When TOI contacted Kamlesh Kumar, the chairman and managing director of Hindustan Salt Ltd, the parent company of Sambhar Salt, he said, “Solar plants come under the ‘wise use’ category. That’s why environment clearance is not required. It does not affect the ecosystem.” TOI tried to get a response from the forest and environment department. But they said they were unaware of the expression of interest. But officials in the department said that as per wetland guidelines, no permanent structure can be allowed. The Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2016, does not permit ‘any construction of a permanent nature’. Restrictions in wetlands also include setting up of any industry and expansion of existing industries. The solar project in Sambhar was originally announced by former prime minister Manmohan Singh in 2013 when he had come to Jaipur to campaign for the party in the run up to the state elections. After BJP won the elections and Vasundhara Raje came to power, the project was junked as it would damage the wetland’s environment and ecosystem. Currently, no single entity is responsible for the management of Sambhar. But the multi-departmental Sambhar Development Agency, which is awaiting the law department’s approval, is expected to play a key role in protecting the wetland and creating a sustainable model for development for the benefit of local communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/4000mw-solar-plant-at-sambhar-may-spelldoom-for-prized-wetland/articleshow/88215470.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

Inaugurating the delegates conference at Eripuram near Pazhayangadi, he said that IUML need not act as if it is the sole right holder of Muslim community and added that it won’t be acceptable.Vijayan said the decision to entrust Waqf board appointments to PSC was taken by the board and forwarded to the government. “When assembly debated the bill, IUML members only raised a demand for the protection of existing employees of the board. Now, after all democratic processes have been completed, IUML is trying to raise it as an emotional issue,” he added.Pinarayi said the government clarified its stand during its talk with religious organizations that it does not have an adamant stand on the appointment of around 100 staff positions in Waqf board and that the issue can be resolved through talks.“All of them understood the stand. Only League isn’t convinced. Who is IUML? It is a political party belonging to UDF like we are a party belonging to LDF. But, they are acting as if they are the sole right holders of the Muslim community,” he said. Vijayan said government held talks with organizations like Samastha (led by Jifri Muthukoya Thangal) and the Sunni faction (led by Kanthapuram AP Aboobacker Musaliyar), along with other organizations.He added that government’s stand was conveyed to all religious organizations that the decision to entrust Waqf board appointments to PSC won’t be implemented till the matter is discussed with all stakeholders. “All of them, barring League, understood the matter. Who is concerned about your (IUML’s) convictions? IUML can do whatever it wants. We have no issues with that,” he said.Vijayan asked if IUML knew where Muslims of the state stand now. Look at the results of the last elections in Malappuram and you can see that voter support for LDF has risen significantly, he said. He added that UDF and BJP had formed an unholy alliance before assembly elections to campaign against LDF and even now they were trying to discredit the government and oppose development projects envisaged for Kerala.The chief minister said that K-Rail and inland waterway projects were key infra projects that will change the face of the state. He said that if Kerala was to attract new investments, the infrastructure should be improved and government was focusing on the same.CPM’s district conference marks the first district-level conferences to be held in state ahead of the 23rd party conference in Kannur in April next year. The CM is attending the conference for all three days. Apart from 250 select delegates, 53 district committee members are also attending the conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/waqf-row-pinarayi-launches-blistering-attack-on-league/articleshow/88214993.cms||---

The machine is non-functional because of blood bags crisis, said sources. During Covid times in 2020, the GMCH was heading world’s largest plasma therapy trial known as Project Platina. The state government had purchased advanced machines worth crores during this trial. One of them was an Apheresis machine, which is a device that receives blood removed from a patient or donor’s body and separates it into various components like plasma, platelets, white blood cells and red blood cells. However, this machine needs special type of bags to collect blood. During the Project Platina, these blood bags were made available by the state government and hence the machine was functional. As the Project Platina met an untimely death and was discontinued earlier this year, supply of these specialized blood bags stopped. As a result, this advanced machine is gathering dust. Officials from GMCH blood bank claimed they have already submitted a proposal for the purchase of these blood bags to the Haffkine Institute, the authority that purchases medical machinery and goods for all GMCs across the state. But the proposal is pending. A pair of these specialized bag costs Rs9,000. The GMCH cannot make such costly purchase on its own and had to go through the Haffkine Institute as per state laws. Doctors accepted that the SDP machines are lifesavers for dengue and cancer patients. “Random donor platelets increases the count by 3,000 to 5,000 at one time, while the SDP increases it up to 55,000 in one single donation. SDP is safer than the random donated platelets,” said a senior blood transfusion expert. What is SDP machine Single donor platelet helps dengue patients get access to platelets Cancer patients who need platelets also benefit from SDP machine Burn patients, brain stroke patients, kidney transplant patients also need SDP support WBC donation for cancer and BMT patients is also possible with this machine SDP machine is available at GMCH, but non-functional for almost a year now||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-blood-bags-sdp-machine-not-functional-in-gmch-for-a-year/articleshow/88214951.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

But the fight to ensure legal rights for MSP is still on. The victory of the farmers’ movement has to be taken forward," Yadav told mediapersons. "We have to visit every house in the villages to take this movement forward and prepare ourselves for the next big struggle. Whatever the farmers have achieved in the last 70 years, they have got it only by fighting the power," he said. Thanking the farmers and labourers for the victory of the historic movement, the members of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) vacated the Shahjahanpur-Kheda border on Friday.

Officials said that some of the existing bus stands are being revamped and these electronic boards are being put up. “The illuminated electronic display boards will mention the expected arrival time of a particular bus route and its next destination. For this, there will be synchronization of data and real-time information between the bus stops. Commuters will be able to know when the next bus will arrive and how much time will it take to reach the next stop,” said a Hidco official. One such display board have already been installed at Narkelbagan bus stop. “This would be very helpful. Not only those waiting for a bus will get to know the route, but commuters will be able to know the expected arrival of the bus, much like train arrival and departure times, which will enable commuters to plan out their time instead of waiting endlessly,” said Kaustav Dey, a New Town resident. Officials said that Hidco have been working to develop more smart bus stands across the township. The authorities had earlier set up three such smart bus stands with solar panel roof, LCD display board of bus arrivals and departure timings along with route fare, a newspaper and magazine corner along with a kiosk for commuters to sit, go through the magazines and have a cup of tea or coffee while waiting for a bus. Officials said that the bus stands have been very popular among people. “The idea is to have smart amenities for the passengers while they will be waiting to catch a bus, keeping coordinated with the smart city initiatives,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/real-time-bus-info-on-new-town-e-boards/articleshow/88214229.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Akbar said that he decided to renounce his Islamic faith following the alleged incidents of several Muslims putting smiley emoticons below the posts and comments on social media related to the death of Chief of the Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat in a helicopter crash. Akbar said even the top Muslim leaders are not opposing such actions by ‘anti-nationals’ who dishonoured a brave military officer and that he could not accept it. He posted a video on his Facebook page on Wednesday saying he has lost faith in the religion. “Today, I am throwing away an attire I received by birth. From today onwards I am not a Muslim. I am an Indian. That is my reply to those people who posted thousands of smiling emoticons against India,” Akbar said in the video. The post has attracted severe criticism from Muslim users on Facebook. Though it later ‘vanished’ from Facebook, it is widely being circulated on Whatsapp. Later Akbar made another post in which he said “the nation should identify those who smile at the death of the CDS and punish them.” Speaking to TOI, Akbar said. “Majority of the users who commented with smiling emoticons and celebrated the news of Rawat’s death were Muslims. They did this because Rawat had taken several actions against Pakistan and militants in Kashmir,” he said. Ali Akbar, who was the state committee member of BJP, quit the post in October following some disagreement with the party leadership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/filmmaker-finds-smileys-revolting-to-renounce-islam/articleshow/88216300.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

As per the original plan, IT hub is to have five pumping stations. The Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (NDITA) is set to start soil investigation work for the project. NDITA officials said, at present there are four drainage pumping stations in Sector V. Each have three pumps including one higher capacity and two other smaller capacity machines. Normally one big and one small pump remain in operation and the other small pump is kept in standby mode. The higher capacity pump has a 2,000 cubic metre/hour water discharge capacity and each of the two smaller pumps have capacity of 1,000 cubic meter/hour. The new station will also have pumps of same configuration. “As per the original masterplan, Sector V is suppose to have five draining pumping stations, but the fifth could not be done earlier as the East-West Metro and Garia-Airport Metro alignments were being set up. Now that the alignments have been completed, the fifth pumping station is to be built,” said NDITA chairman Debashis Sen. A new 12 lakh water discharge capacity drainage pumping station is also coming up at New Town, funded by Hidco and to be executed by PHE department, which is expected to solve the waterlogging problem to a large extent at Haldiram junction on VIP Road, Chinar Park and a large area of Rajarhat falling under Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) area. NDITA also plans to conduct a topographical survey of the drainage network system of Sector V to find out if there are any faults in the lines and if they need to upgrade the existing network. Officials said that the major reason behind the flooding was the overflowing Bagjola and Kestopur canal. “With the canals to be revamped, desilting to be done soon and with new pumping station to be set up, waterlogging woes in Sector V is expected to be sorted out by the next monsoon,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sector-v-to-get-fifth-pumping-station/articleshow/88214240.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Mela police teams would be assigned for constant surveillance and covid norms, including social distancing and wearing of mask would be strictly followed. He, however, said a total of 13 police stations and 36 police outspots would be set up for surveillance, crowd and traffic management and elaborate security measures. SP claimed police are currently working on a crowd and traffic management plan for devotees and pilgrims coming from far flung areas during the month long religious fair.

---||Kochi||Rehab of vendors in Kochi: Authorities failed to explore other options?||KOCHI: Almost three decades ago, a portion of Annie Besant Park, an exclusive women’s park, in Kochi was used for rehabilitating vendors from Subhash Bose Park and Children’s Park area. Another portion of the park was used for constructing a road, which is now being used as a one way for vehicles coming from Jetty area to reach Menaka Junction. The end result is that the city lost its only women’s park. Ironically, street vendors are still there in front of the Children’s Park. This gives the best example of the manner in which Kochi is losing its open spaces. Authorities who plan to shift the vendors at Fashion Street on Mullassery Canal Road to Maharaja’s College Ground don’t explore other options. “The Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) has constructed shops attached to Ambedkar Stadium and all the rooms there are vacant. They can explore shifting some of the merchants to that area. Post-pandemic, many of the merchants have closed their shops and many rooms are vacant in different parts of the city. Some of the vendors can be shifted to such shops until the renovation of Mullassery Canal gets over,” K S Dileep Kumar, president of Ernakulam Vikasana Samithi, an NGO. Another option is to shift the vendors to Manappattiparambu, owned by the GCDA. Protests have started to galore against the authorities’ move to rehabilitate the vendors to a portion of Maharaja’s College Ground. The area has been earmarked for setting up a basketball-cum-netball court. Moreover, the holding near MG Road has high land value. It was disregarding the protests raised by the college authorities that the district administration and the corporation decided to take over a portion of the college ground for rehabilitating the vendors. The authorities haven’t given any official communication to the college management regarding their plan. As the land belongs to the government, prior approval from the government is needed. But, no official order allotting the land has been issued by the government so far. Still, authorities have already started ground clearing for rehabilitating the vendors. It was almost two-and-a-half decades ago that the street vendors on MG Road in front of Maharaja’s College Ground had been rehabilitated to Mullassery Canal Road. There are allegations that a lobby protecting street vending for making monetary benefits is behind the move to rehabilitate the vendors to a portion of the college ground. “There are many who rent their stalls to others for daily and monthly rent. There are some who own more than one stall. They are influential. This doesn’t mean that there aren’t any genuine vendors in the Fashion Street,” said C K Peter, a former councilor of Kochi corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rehab-of-vendors-authorities-failed-to-explore-other-options/articleshow/88214238.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Bundi Rajputs choose Brig as their ‘king’ after successor dies childless||JAIPUR: Kings and queens may no longer have powers and titles with the integration of princely states into India, but their successors continue to be revered as titular heads of their respective communities even 75 years later. So ingrained is the tradition of choosing titular heads in the erstwhile ruling communities, the lack of one in a line of inheritance still prompts them to look for one. The Hada Rajputs of Bundi, a princely state that merged with India in 1948, haven’t had a titular head for the past nearly 12 years, since Ranjit Singh, the son and successor of their last king Col Maharao Raja Bahadur Singh, died childless in January 2010. The community has now chosen its ‘26th King’ from the masses. Brigadier Bhupesh Singh Hada, a soldier decorated by the Indian Army with Shaurya Chakra (for anti-terrorist operations in 1999) and Vishisht Seva Medal (for commendable work in Siachen Glacier in 2019), has been chosen from a group of shortlisted persons for his contributions to the nation, Bundi and the community. Brig Hada, who has commanded the Siachen Brigade, was national security guard force commander, holds the distinction of scaling Mt Everest and Mt Lhotse, is a paratrooper and a combat underwater diver, would be publicly ‘crowned’ by the community at a temple in Bundi on Sunday. Ranjit Singh was maternal uncle (mamosa) of former Union minister and Congress leader Jitendra Singh of Alwar, who is now locked in court battles with one Avinash Chander Chanana over ownership of the erstwhile royal family’s properties.  The property disputes, which involved Ranjit Singh’s other relatives too, kept the king’s title from passing on to anyone all these years. Parleys with the erstwhile Kota royals, considered Bundi’s big brother, too failed to break the impasse. The Hada Rajput community then decided to take matters into its hands and constituted a ‘Paag committee’ to search for a suitable successor among its members. ‘Paag’ is the turban tied to the successor upon a family head’s demise, hence the committee’s name. “We invited nominations through a social campaign saying the Bundi Hada community’s ‘Paag’ must get a worthy head. After several meetings and deliberations, a couple of names were shortlisted, which included Shivendra Singh Kapren and Brig Hada,” said Arihant Singh, the Paag committee spokesperson. “Of the 118 ex-jagidar and ex-thikanedar in Bundi, 108 finally chose Brig Hada and gave written consents to coronate him. Subsequently, we announced the name on December 4,” Singh said. “We are simply giving ourselves a leader. The new king will not lay any claim on the former Bundi royal families’ properties,” said Maharaj Shakti Singh, the Paag committee convener. So, what is the relevance of a title that is not recognised by the law anymore? “It is more ceremonial and titular in nature. The person donning the Paag of Bundi is head of the Hada Chauhan clan and ex-officio head of all Kshatriyas of Bundi,” said Brig Hada, the nominated ‘king’. Brig Hada, an alumnus of the Sainik School Chittorgarh and the National Defence Academy, explained the relevance of the title: “It is ceremonial and titular. The person donning the Paag of Bundi is head of the Hada Chauhan clan and ex-officio head of all Kshatriyas of Bundi.” He referred to a Kerala high court ruling of 2013, which upheld the state government's argument that “there was nothing unconstitutional in using royal titles because the 26th amendment in 1971 scrapped the ex-kings and their successors’ rights and privileges, not titles”. The primary purpose of having a king, according to Brig Hada, is to “keep the community united and help preserve our history and culture by keeping the tradition alive".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bundi-rajputs-choose-brig-as-their-king-after-successor-dies-childless/articleshow/88215490.cms||Bhanu Pratap Singh

With the targeted 130 kmph speed limit now just a final nod away from the Commission of Railway Safety (CRS), CR has already started preparing to upgrade it’s speed category to ‘semi-high speed’ at 160kmph and more. In two sections of Nagpur division, various upgrades to technology are being made to achieve the 160 kmph speed. These sections are the 380km stretch from Nagpur to Badnera, and the 510km Itarsi-Ballarshah stretch. At present, trains are running at around 110 kmph speed here but soon 130 kmph permission is expected on the two stretches. “CRS had raised some queries following our submission seeking clearance on the 130kmph speed. We have complied and sent back our final reply,” said an official, adding the clearance is expected soon. The CR, under the supervision of divisional railway manager Richa Khare is now working upon extensive upgradation of the existing technology for taking the speed limit to ‘semi high speed’ category. “We are gradually shifting to heavy rails of around 60 kg having longer panels (400m) to enable speeds of 160kmph and more,” said an official. “CR is also bringing in thick wave switches which have relatively new design on concrete sleepers, which can handle high speeds of 160 km and above,” he said. As per the official, a crucial technology revolving around Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is also being adopted on a larger scale as a requirement for running the trains in semi high speed category. “Automatic train protection system is being upgraded to ensure almost zero accident zones. We will soon modify, upgrade and develop the existing signalling and telecommunication system to such extent that the speed of trains would be regulated automatically,” said the official, adding coaches are also being upgraded as per the requirements of the 160kmph speeds. The official also said Cab signalling is already in place but it would be modified and upgraded too. “The trains running at 160 kmph would curtail time required by almost 45 minutes to one hour. While upgrading to 130 kmph, we had complied with several such components which would now make CR’s transition to 160kmph smoother,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/central-railway-sets-new-target-of-running-trains-at-160-kmph/articleshow/88214968.cms||Soumitra Bose

He was brought to the city on Thursday. The arrested person was identified as Deepak Mandal, a resident of Jayanpur (Malda) in West Bengal. Police have also seized a mobile, Aadhaar card and Rs 730 from his possession. Wanted by the police of UP, MP, Delhi and other states, Madnal was carrying Rs 1 lakh cash reward announced by the police. Deputy SP (STF) Navendu Kumar told TOI that a team of STF (Prayagraj unit) nabbed the most- wanted racketeer near Gandhi Park, Trivandrum when he was planning to escape. “This key operative and kingpin of the racket involved in pumping fake currency in many states of the country was running the racket from the Indo-Bangladesh border. The DSP added that following the arrest of a man identified as Rupesh Kumar of Phulpur in Prayagraj on June 1 along with fake currency worth Rs 1 lakh, police came to know that the gang members were getting fake currency consignments from Malda-based kingpin Deepak. Deepak used to take Rs50,000 genuine currency for fake currency worth Rs 1 lakh from the racketeers. On October 20, STF also arrested another racketeer, identified as Ram Sahu, a resident of Kaurihar who has Rs 50,000 cash reward on his head in Prayagraj district. Police then came to know that Sahu was in Mandal’s contact since 2014 when they were lodged at Naini Central Jail. STF officials claimed, “Wen UP STF tightened the noose around Mandal and even raided his hideouts in Malda in West Bengal, he kept on changing his mobile number and hideouts. later escaped to Kerala to evade police action.” During interrogation, Deepak admitted that he had been involved in pumping fake currency in many states for the past 14 years and used to visit Bangladesh through water routes for bringing the consignments. In 2013, a team of STF had arrested Mandal along with one of his accomplices and recovered fake currency worth Rs 3 lakh in Shivkuti area of Prayagraj district. He was then lodged at Naini Central Jail. In 2017 and 2018, the special cell of Delhi Police had arrested Mandal along with fake currency following which he was lodged at Tihar Jail in Delhi. However, after being bailed out, he again involved himself in the same trade and continued smuggling fake currency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/fake-currency-racket-kingpin-held-in-kerala-by-stf-brought-to-prayagraj/articleshow/88195010.cms||---

He said the administration would first persuade those skipping their second dose to take it through the door-to-door campaign. “If people still refuse and do not cooperate, we shall have to decide on taking stern action,” he said. The minister said a large number of people had avoided taking the second dose in Baramati, Daund and Indapur tehsils, among others. He said at present efforts would be focused on pursuing these people to get the jab. A similar approach would be taken at the state level, too, till any decision on sterner measures against the “shirkers” was taken, he said. “It is true that people were a bit reluctant about taking the second dose, but after the recent developments (Omicron), the pace of vaccination has increased,” Ajit Pawar said. — Nisha Nambiar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-will-decide-on-stern-steps-for-missing-2nd-dose-says-dy-cm/articleshow/88214970.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Unanimous candidature, active top netas make BJP confident of Bawankule’s win||Nagpur: After completion of voting process for MLC local authority constituency polls on Friday evening, the BJP camp is upbeat about its landslide victory on Tuesday, when the counting would take place. Entire top leadership of the party under Union minister Nitin Gadkari and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis actively participated in the entire process by shunning complacency unlike in graduates’ constituency and zilla parishad polls and bypolls, say party sources. In both these polls held last year and this year, the saffron outfit had lost to Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituents, particularly the Congress, due to overconfidence, say party activists. Both leaders were present in the city on the polling day, despite their other engagements. BJP’s debacle in zilla parishad bypolls in Nagpur, considered to be its bastion, came as an eye opener. Also, Nagpur being a native place of both Gadkari and Fadnavis, questions were raised on their leadership at the national level. The BJP had won just three ZP seats in comparison to nine by the Congress, when the results were declared on October 8. In the process, Congress had bagged three more seats, while BJP failed to retain one. Even in 2020 ZP polls, the party had won only 15 seats out of the 58, while Congress had pocketed 30. Both Gadkari and Fadnavis were hardly visible in the campaigning for the graduates’ constituency polls, and completely skipped the ZP polls, the leaders claimed. “Without active participation of these two leaders, it is extremely hard to convince the people and garner votes. Both are very popular leaders in Vidarbha. Their absence in the ZP bypolls had cost the party dearly in the BJP’s bastion,” party leaders told TOI. This time, however, both Gadkari and Fadnavis first ensured that the candidate for MLC polls would be a unanimous choice, forgetting their differences. Accordingly, Chandrashekhar Bawankule’s name was finalized considering his proximity to both top leaders. Both wanted to reinstate him as early as possible, as dropping him during 2019 assembly polls had cost the party heavily in terms of seats, particularly in Vidarbha. Last month, Gadkari had addressed all corporators, office-bearers and other voters at a city hotel, where he not only exhorted them to work hard for Bawankule’s victory, but also to work hard in their respective constituencies to resolve issues of the citizens. He had also indirectly warned them that their performance would be taken into account while allotting tickets for the next year’s municipal corporation and council elections. Fadnavis also regularly visited the city and interacted with the voters. On Thursday, he even visited all three resorts in Pench where the BJP voters were camping and also interacted with them till midnight, say sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unanimous-candidature-active-top-netas-make-bjp-confident-of-bawankules-win/articleshow/88214966.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Jaipur||Mafia using Prashasan camps for ulterior motives||Jodhpur: While the Prashasan Shahron ke Sang and Prashasan Gaon ke Sang campaigns of the state government have proved a boon for many who have been struggling to get their works related to civic bodies done, it has also turned out to be an easy means of getting fabricated documents to occupy others’ properties for many unscrupulous elements. Interestingly, persons with such ulterior motives are making fake documents of ownership and getting them approved by the officials, which shows that not much attention is paid by the officials to the authenticity of the documents and claims of the people in these camps. Recently, some persons succeeded in getting forged documents of ownership of a residential plot belonging to others and got it approved by the officials of JDA. The matter was taken up for investigation after a complaint to this effect was filed by the original owners of the plot. A similar matter cropped up before the JDA wherein the land mafia got forged lease deeds by tampering 32-year-old original documents of 20 plots. Deputy commissioner (JDA North) Neeraj Mishra said that the matter has come to their notice wherein some persons prepared fabricated documents using the photo copy of the original lease deed and got the new lease deed issued in their name. According to an officer, the land mafia have taken the advantage of the leniency of the procedure and pressure on the officials for issuing lease deeds and other permissions using the fabricated documents. "But the connivance of the officials or clerks in such cases could not be ruled out," he said, adding that such papers pass through many tables and chances of them getting passed unnoticed are unlikely. Commissioner (Jodhpur South Municipal Corporation) Arun Purohit said that no such complaint was filed but they have been receiving objections in many cases. "For this, we have a procedure which is strictly followed despite the pressure of maximum result," he said, claiming that no final document was issued before a detailed check of the documents. Some similar complaints have also been reported from the rural areas where the land mafia has been going all out to get the lease deeds of protected land parcels like pasture land or the lands meant for purposes other than residential ones. TOI also spoke to some stamp makers of the city who confirmed that they have been getting enquiries for preparing stamps of official designations from civic bodies and panchayats, etc., off and on, which is a clear indication that some notorious elements have been trying to take advantage of these camps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mafia-using-prashasan-camps-for-ulterior-motives/articleshow/88214958.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Weather you like it or not, AQI in Delhi back to very poor||NEW DELHI: The city’s air quality deteriorated on Friday from “poor” to “very poor”, with agencies expecting it to worsen further within the “very poor” category. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, the air quality index (AQI) on Friday, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 314 as against 289 a day earlier. The particle pollutants, primarily PM2.5 or particles in air with diameter less than 2.5 microns, were well above the national safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metres. It oscillated between 134.6 and 138.2 units, showing improvement from the afternoon. “The AQI on Friday indicates ‘very poor’ air quality, which has degraded from Thursday’s ‘poor’ category due to cloudy conditions and large reduction in mixing layer height,” according to a statement from System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a central agency. Track the pollution level in your city“On December 11, winds are likely to be moderate. Partially cloudy conditions and low mixing layer height (<1km) causing weak vertical mixing are likely to keep air quality within the ‘very poor’ category for Friday and Saturday. From 12th to 14th, air quality is likely to degrade to the upper end of ‘very poor’ due to relatively low wind speeds,” SAFAR predicted. According to the Union earth sciences ministry’s Decision Support System for Air Quality Management of Delhi, transport contributed about 17% of the city’s overall PM2.5 on Friday. Other major sources included Delhi and peripheral industries contributing 7-4%, construction up to 2%, and dust over 1%. Across NCR, Jhajjar district continued to be a big polluter with a contribution of 16-17% in Delhi’s PM2.5. According to weather analysts, the city may experience light easterly winds on December 13 and 14, after which wind speeds may increase over 15th and 16th. “There are chances of cold waves in isolated parts of northwest India, which is complimented by strong winds. This also means that chances of fog are little less over the next few days. However, fog is a complex occurrence and density could only be forecast prior to 12 to 24 hours of its occurrence,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department. Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 23.7 degrees Celsius as against 23.5 degrees a day earlier. The minimum was 9 degrees Celsius as against 8.4 on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/weather-you-like-it-or-not-aqi-back-to-very-poor/articleshow/88214961.cms||---

It is after a delay of two years that the KMRL takes any major steps towards implementing the project.  TOI had carried a serious of reports regarding the inordinate delay in implementing the project. Earlier, KCZMA had raised apprehensions on providing lock gates on the canals to be renovated under the IURWTS project. The agency had advised holistic study of the entire Kochi catchment, including the upper reaches of the main rivers. It took almost three to four months for KMRL to revise the DPR. KMRL has accepted the suggestions and removed the incorporation of canal lock gates in the IURWTS project. KMRL also conveyed that the incorporation of canal lock gates for mitigating floods into the Kochi city as a whole shall be taken up by irrigation department or state disaster management authority after taking into consideration all factors holistically. Revised DPR has been submitted to KCZMA on December 3. KMRL has already completed all the required surveys and finalized the concept plans for all projects. Out of the six canals, KMRL envisages to make the entire Edappally canal navigable and connect the Water Metro jetties at Eroor and Cheranelloor through Edappally canal. “Since there are interfering railway across Chilavannoor and TP Canal, navigation is not possible from end-to-end and hence KMRL shall be looking into widening these canals to the flood containment requirements only. The tender procedures for renovation of Market Canal can be started in February and the work will begin in February next year,” a KMRL official said. There will be four sewage treatment plants (STPs) to treat sewage from the households and shops on either side of the canals. KMRL has completed the demarcation of land required for Edappally Canal and social impact assessment study is in progress. Land acquisition process for other canals is also in progress. The Metro agency expects that the renovation of Edappally Canal can be started by August 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kmrl-submits-revised-dpr/articleshow/88214244.cms||---

While posting the matter for January 10, 2022 for the next hearing, a division bench comprising Justice Manoj Kumar Gupta and Justice Om Prakash Tripathi in its order dated December 6 also directed the state government to file its reply in response to the averments made in the writ petition. According to the case file, there is a dispute regarding possession of a house in Kalindipuram Awas Yojna at Prayagraj between the petitioner and a private respondent. In the writ petition, Vishnu Murti Tripathi of Prayagraj has made serious allegations of malafide against Maurya, alleging that with Maurya’s support the private respondent was trying to grab the house of the petitioner. Earlier on October 6, 2021, the court after hearing both sides had observed, “The grievance urged in the instant petition is that the petitioner, who owns House No. GI 456 EWS, Basera Kalindipuram Awas Yojna, Prayagraj, was dispossessed there from on June 6, 2018 by the intervention of the state machinery. In support of the said contention, reliance has been placed on a communication sent by respondent Keshav Prasad Maurya, the deputy chief minister of UP, to senior superintendent of police (SSP), Prayagraj dated March 14, 2018 wherein it is mentioned that private respondent had requested for possession of the house being delivered to her on basis of certain enquiry report and the senior superintendent of police was directed to take necessary steps and inform him accordingly.” The court added, “It has further been alleged that with oblique motives, the petitioner was thereafter implicated in a false case by lodging a first information report (FIR) against him. The petitioner is alleged to have made complaints in this respect to various authorities but no heed was paid to the same and hence, the instant petition has been filed.” However, appearing on behalf of the private respondent, her counsel had stated that a civil suit is already pending in connection with the aforesaid matter. He further stated that a counter affidavit has already been filed by the private respondent before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-issues-notice-to-mauryain-alleged-house-grab-case/articleshow/88195014.cms||---

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who visited the site of the canal on Thursday, said that work on the project had started in 1978, but only 52% of work had been done till 2017 when the BJP government took over in the state. I would be in Balrampur, Uttar Pradesh tomorrow, 11th December for a very special programme- inauguration of the Sa… https://t.co/X1NxlxEAf3— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1639148208000 "The remaining 48% work has been completed in the past four and a half years," he said, adding "the Saryu Canal project is spread over 6,623 km, covering nine districts." The canal would irrigate 14.5 lakh hectare land, benefitting over 30 lakh farmers, he said. You would be shocked to know that work on the Saryu Nahar National Project began in 1978 but for decades, the proje… https://t.co/YwcTgFDIqE— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1639148264000 “After Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath came to power in 2017, he took up the project and gave a deadline to complete the pending work within four years, a feat which none of the previous governments could achieve, or even wanted to. Farmers from nine districts, including Bahraich, Shravasti, Balrampur, Gonda, Siddharthnagar, Basti, Sant Kabir Nagar, Gorakhpur and Maharajganj, will benefit from the project,” said a government spokesperson.  Calling the completion of the project a “tight slap” on the face of the Opposition parties, the spokesperson said that they only talk about farmers’ interests but have failed to take any positive action. “Previous governments completely neglected this major agricultural project, which would have solved problems of farmers decades ago. They did not even bother to allocate sufficient funds for the project. The current government provided necessary funds and expedited work on the project. Land was also purchased by running a special campaign with the help of the local administration,” he said.  The project, said an official of the irrigation department, will allow farmers to have two crops instead of one since irrigation will become more dependable now. As the irrigated agricultural land will increase, he added, there will be a corresponding rise in the production of both kharif and rabi crops.  The project is expected to irrigate about 14 lakh hectare land and also provide relief from the problem of floods in certain areas of Purvanchal by linking the main and tributary canals to barrages built on rivers Ghagra, Saryu, Rapti, Banganga and Rohin.  The project was initially launched in 1978 to expand irrigation facilities in Bahraich and Gonda districts and was called Ghaghra Canal. In 1982-83, the scope of the project was expanded to include nine districts of trans-Ghaghra-Rapti-Rohini region of Purvanchal and it was renamed the Saryu Project. Along with Ghaghra and Rapti, Rohin river was also to be connected with the canal system. In 2012, the Centre declared it a national project and renamed it the Saryu Canal National Project.  The project is also connected to the River Valley Linking Project of the Government of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-to-launch-saryu-canal-project-in-east-up-pending-for-over-40-years/articleshow/88215520.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Fr Prasanth returns after ‘Discovering India’||KOCHI: Fr Prasanth Palackappillil, former principal of Sacred Heart College, Thevara, reached Kochi after completing his four-month-long solo bike ride named ‘Discovering India’ on Friday. The students and teachers of the college welcomed him by rallying along with him on bikes from Kalamassery to the college. Fr Prasanth, who retired from the college after 24 years of service as a teacher in April, started his ride on August 10. The drive was to interact with people of diverse culture and spread the message ‘discovering trust, green, peace’. He covered over nearly 22,000 km travelling through almost all states of the country during the trip. The ride was on his old 150cc Honda Unicorn motorbike and each day he covered a distance of around 200-400km depending on the topography of the place he visited. He stayed at churches, Christian establishment and with his old students throughout the trip. “The beauty of India is being destroyed due to non-eco-friendly activities. I could interact with several persons in ashrams, riversides, farmlands, national borders and villages. Throughout the trip I tried to spread the messages on waste management, ecology and even got a chance to interact with farmers, who were protesting in Delhi against the Farm Bills,” he said. Referring to his visit to Kashmir and the north east, he said that issues along the borders raise concerns and peace should be maintained with not only military force but also every possible ways. He even had a miraculous escape from an accident when he fell down from his bike as he dozed off while riding through Odisha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fr-prasanth-returns-after-discovering-india/articleshow/88214254.cms||---
---||Jodhpur||Rajasthan: Man loses Rs 3.6 lakh in ATM fraud, court asks bank to pay||JODHPUR: District consumer court here has directed the State Bank of India (SBI) to compensate a customer of Rs 3.60 lakh withdrawn from ATM by someone and an interest there on from the date of petition to the date of payment. The bank has been directed to make this payment to the customer within two months from the date of order along with Rs 10,000 towards physical and mental harassment and Rs 5,000 towards court expenditure. The court gave these directions while disposing of a petition by one Govind Lal Sharma who has a savings bank account in the high court branch of the bank. Sharma in his petition had stated that Rs 3.60 lakh were withdrawn from his account at the rate of Rs 40,000 per day through his ATM card from February 4, 2019 to February12, 2019. When he received this information from the bank, he checked his ATM card was with him and that he never withdrew this amount. He immediately informed the bank and also filed a complaint to the banking ombudsman apart from the one with the police claiming that he did not receive any SMS or any other info from the bank with regard to these withdrawals from ATM. To the surprise of Sharma, bank in its report, ruled that his complaint was baseless and he himself has withdrawn the money from his ATM card claiming that each transaction had been intimated to him by SMS and also claimed that the banking ombudsman was also apprised with this report. “The ombudsman also expressed its satisfaction with this report after which the complaint was closed as disposed,” bank submitted to the court. But the court observed that all these claims were made by the bank without their verification or investigation of the complaint. The bank neither submitted in the court any CCTV footage of the ATMs nor any list of ATMs where the amount was withdrawn from. On the basis of this, the court observed, “Despite appropriate complaints by the petitioner, the bank submitted a report without any investigation or verification of the facts, which was an attempt to renege upon its legal and moral duties as a trustee of money of its customer and thus is an indication of gross negligence of the bank in delivery of service.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/man-loses-rs-3-6l-in-atm-fraud-court-asks-bank-to-pay/articleshow/88214976.cms||---

Annpurna Nautiyal, V-C, said she still couldn't believe that Gen Rawat was no more. "He was always keen on taking up issues concerning the hill state and employment for the youth, too, was one of his priorities.” Paying last respects to Gen Rawat, his wife and other personnel who died in the chopper crash on Thursday, Nautiyal said, “He had assured us that he would look into the proposal of setting up the Chair, which is still with the defence ministry. If the proposal is approved, the Chair will be named after Gen Bipin Rawat. He was known for his humility and during the convocation also he interacted with one and all. His loss is irreplaceable,” Nautiyal added. Meanwhile, the Gen Rawat’s alma mater Cambrian Hall paid homage to him and 12 others.

---||Patna||Woman SI commits suicide in Bihar's Darbhanga||PATNA: A young woman sub-inspector of police allegedly committed suicide by shooting herself in her barrack near University police station in Darbhanga district on Friday. The deceased, Laxmi Kumari (28), was a resident of ward number 11 under Town police station area in Supaul. This was her first posting after joining the service in 2018 and completing training in September this year. She used her service revolver to commit suicide between 12.30am and 2am on Friday after returning from patrolling duty at around 10.30pm. She was looking normal, police sources said. Preliminary investigations indicate that Laxmi shot herself dead within a few minutes after talking over phone to a male batchmate, who had recently got engaged with someone. The matter came to light when her roommate, SI Arti Kumari, returned to her room at around 4am after her duty at the the University police station in night shift. The room was locked from inside and Laxmi didn’t respond. Her cellphone was also switched off. University police station SHO Satya Prakash said no suicide note was recovered from the room. “Her body was found lying in her kitchen in a pool of blood,” he said. The SHO said an empty cartridge and a pellet were recovered while her service pistol was found near her right hand. “Prima facie it seems she shot herself in the temple. Her parents have come. They are yet to submit a written complaint or record a statement,” he said.  City SP, Darbhanga, Ashok Kumar Prasad told TOI over the phone that forensic experts collected samples for analysis. “Laxmi’s parents also failed to tell anything,” he said. Prasad said Arti may be quizzed. Police have come to know that Laxmi’s parents were looking for a suitable boy for her marriage. He said police analysed the call detail records of Laxmi’s cellphone and found that she was talking to someone till midnight. “It seems she shot herself in anger. The Bluetooth hearing device used for talking on the phone was also found there,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-si-commits-suicide-in-darbhanga/articleshow/88213830.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Delhi||Delhi: Predicting fog? Here’s why picture is so hazy||NEW DELHI: As December enters its second week, the region may soon see annual episodes of fog engulfing the roads, expressways and airport obscuring visibility below 1,000 metres and in extreme cases, below 50 metres with winter peaking. According to experts, forecasting fog prior to 12-24 hours of its occurrence is extremely difficult. Pollution in Delhi is another component that complicates the “micro-physics of fog” as varying number of particles and droplets per cubic metres in certain humidity also drop visibility. Though fog formation is different in polluted and non-polluted areas, it’s an event specific to the location and depends upon meteorological factors, including humidity, wind speed, temperature and pollutants or other aerosols. “It’s very difficult to forecast fog in terms of intensity, especially for the Delhi region, prior to 12-24 hours of its occurrence,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, India Meteorological Department (IMD). IMD data showed maximum instances of fog were reported between mid-December and mid-January, with February being an exception in 2020-21. Delhi saw 24 foggy days between December 2020 and February 2021. December saw seven fog days with low visibility affecting mobility spanning over 28 hours. January saw 43 hours of fog over 10 days and February saw 28 hours over seven days. Similarly, the winter of 2019-20 saw 16 fog days, of which December 2019 saw 47 hours over nine days and January 2020 24 hours over six days. “In December 2020, extreme fog episodes at IGI Airport were recorded on the night of December 6-7, 12-13, 15-16 and from 29 to January 1. Similarly, in January 2021, major fog occurred on the intervening nights of January 3-4, 7-8, 10-11, 12-13, 15-16, 16-17, 18-19,” said an IMD official. Sachin Ghude, scientist at IITM and lead of Winter Fox Experiment (WIFEX), an experiment and study of fog, said the maximum cases of fog were reported early morning and middle of the night, while minimum cases were reported around afternoon, early night and late evening. However, Delhi has another issue — dense haze. “In Delhi, pollution suspends particles in the air. During winter, around the middle of the night, when the temperature is low and humidity rises, we have seen particle pollutants absorb moisture and swell to form a thick layer of haze, which often makes visibility very low and it stays till the morning,” said Ghude. A WIFEX report showed that intense fog in northwest India had led to a socio-economic impact. A 2017 study pointed out that 140 flights were cancelled, while 143 were diverted and 363 delayed at IGI Airport causing a loss of Rs 12 crore to the aviation sector during the winter of 2013–14. “However, this has reduced as IGI is now a Category-3C airport, which means it has equipment that allows a flight to land with visibility up to 75m. But the aircraft must also have supporting tools and the pilot trained accordingly,” said Ghude.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/predicting-fog-heres-why-picture-is-so-hazy/articleshow/88214986.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Ajmer||Ajmer police bust honeytrap gang, arrest 6||AJMER: City police have busted a honeytrap gang operating in Mewat region of Rajasthan and Haryana and arrested six suspects. The members of the gang used to create fake IDs of women to lure men on social media and later blackmail them for money. The gang was also involved in the extortion. Police seized the mobile phones of the suspects, which obscene and tweaked videos. They were produced in the court, which sent them to police remand. Christian Ganj SHO Dr Ravish Samaria said a resident of Johns ganj filed a report stating that he had seen an advertisement for a private job and he applied for that. He was asked to visit a mall on Link Road and the company manager asked him to open a bank account, the SHO said. After the youth opened the bank account, the manager took away the debit card, cheque-book, and other papers and soon transactions started in the account, he said. Christian Ganj police started investigating and found that a gang was into online fraud and was extorting money from people. The modus operandi was simple as the gang opened fake accounts in the name of girls and women on different websites and called using random numbers for friendship. Whoever accepted the friendship and started chatting with the fake account operator, got roped in. When the fake account operator would be confident that the victim had developed trust, he or she would ask for a video chat and record the video while talking. When the suspects would get videos of the victim, they would tweak them and turn them into obscene videos and start blackmailing. The gang later asked the victim to deposit the money in the account of a youth, who was appointed by the gang and whose debit card was seized. SHO Samaria said the suspects, Kuldeep (26), Yusuf (25), Mohammad Asif (21), Vakil (25), Jitendra (33), and Sarfaraj (19) were from Alwar, Bharatpur, Daruheda, Faridabad, and Mewat region of Haryana and Rajasthan. Police have not revealed the names of the victims yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/ajmer-police-bust-honeytrap-gang-arrest-6/articleshow/88214982.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Antilia case: Bombay HC admits NIA plea against Gaur bail order||MUMBAI: Two days after Bombay high court set aside a special NIA court order staying for 25 days the bail it had granted to Naresh Gaur, an accused in the Antilia bomb scare case, an appeal bench on Friday recorded his statement through his counsel that he would not act on the bail order till December 15. The reason: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) swiftly filed an appeal before a division bench of the HC seeking a stay on Gaur’s bail. The bench admitted the appeal, saying it needs consideration. On February 25, an SUV with 20 gelatin sticks was found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia, and on March 4, the body of the SUV owner, Mansukh Hiran, was found in Kalwa creek. In March, Gujarat-based cricket bookie Gaur was arrested for allegedly procuring SIM cards for dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, the prime accused in the bomb scare case, and encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma. Before the bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal, NIA counsel Sandesh Patil said Gaur’s bail ought to be cancelled and stayed by an interim order as probe has shown prima facie evidence against him. Patil claimed that Waze wanted to spread terror in the minds of the industrialist and the public at large. “He wanted to reestablish his image as a supercop, therefore he had asked Hiren...to arrange for a vehicle…the accused [Waze] took the vehicle in Thane and changed the number plate to match that of the convoy of the industrialist to instil further fear,” he claimed. Patil added that it is from one of the SIM cards that Gaur had provided that a phone call was made to Hiren and so, he was charged correctly for conspiracy. However, Gaur’s senior counsel Shirish Gupte with advocate Aniket Nikam urged that no stay order be passed and once out on bail, their client would surrender before the court in case the NIA succeeds in its plea for cancellation of bail. Gupte said despite 22 days having passed since the special NIA court’s bail order, Gaur, a father of a year-old child and a “permanent resident of Bhuj”, continues to remain in jail. Gupte said Gaur has only been booked for a bailable offence, along with criminal conspiracy, under IPC Section 120B. The HC, in its order, noted that Gaur was still in custody and Gupte, on the court’s instructions, said considering that the appeal is to be heard next Wednesday, the accused will not avail bail by completing the formalities for release till appeal is heard. The HC accepted his statement. The NIA counsel did not press for a stay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/antilia-case-bombay-hc-admits-nia-plea-against-gaur-bail-order/articleshow/88214989.cms||Swati Deshpande

Complaints have been pouring in from Pleasant Valley Society, which houses around 110 families. “For the last couple of years in this area, the Mussoorie Dehradun development board has failed to check the illegal constructions. There has been rampant destruction which has caused people in our society to suffer. Structures in the vicinity have made illegal constructional changes which have choked several drains. This causes severe back flow and water accumulation every time it rains. We have been struggling with this for the past few years and the situation is gradually becoming worse,” said Pankaj Tyagi, a society resident. Residents also claim despite complaints, authorities have failed to check illegal encroachments in the area. “The area adjacent to the east side of the society has been occupied by an illegal labour colony. Most of them are construction workers hired for ongoing projects here. But the settlement is growing gradually and nobody is checking on it. This poses a security risk to the residents here in the society and in addition we are losing space to an illegal encroachment that if goes unchecked will become a permanent fixture and almost impossible to remove later,” said another society resident. Residents claim that the MDDA has failed to take care of these issues. Meanwhile, officials claim that they are unaware of the problems. “The residents should file an official complaint and we will take cognisance of the problems. Our teams will visit the site and take appropriate action,” said Rajendra Bahuguna, assistant engineer, MDDA||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/encroachments-choked-drains-irk-residents/articleshow/88214282.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The letter was sent by post to her private residence on Friday morning from where it was forwarded to the current mayoral home at Byculla. The police said the letter originated from Uran. “The writer’s name mentioned on the letter could be fake,” said a senior police officer. “The content is very abusive apart from being derogatory, especially to women,” Pednekar said, adding that she has also written to state home minister Dilip Walse-Patil and sought that the culprit be nabbed at the earliest. “Political rivalry and acrimony have stooped to a new low. No ordinary person would write such a letter,” Pednekar said, adding that she has requested special police protection for her and her family members. MLA from Byculla, Yamini Jadhav, who was present with the mayor said, “If it’s the first citizen of Mumbai who has been threatened in such a manner, the central government too should take cognisance like our chief minister has.” The police said that they are trying to find out who the person is who had sent the letter from a post office in Uran. A criminal offence has been registered and the unidentified letter writer has been booked under sections of the Indian Penal Code that pertain to criminal intimidation and use of word, gesture or act intended to insult a woman’s modesty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mayor-seeks-police-protection-for-herself-and-family-members/articleshow/88215006.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Nagpur||No doctors in place, nurses diagnose illnesses, give prescriptions at NMC hospital||NAGPUR: In a brazen violation of norms, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has been running outpatient department (OPD) at over 10 dispensaries without doctors. A nurse was found diagnosing and giving prescriptions to patients at one of the dispensaries. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) activists Prabhat Agrawal, Harish Welekar and Narendra Padhade shot a video at NMC’s Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Hospital, where a nurse admitted she is diagnosing and giving prescriptions to patients due to lack of a doctor appointed by the civic body. The nurse is seen saying she had no other option but to diagnose and give prescriptions as she cannot see ill patients go back. Agrawal told TOI, “Padhade had fever, so Welekar took him to the dispensary. They learnt there has been no doctor in place for last three months. NMC transferred the doctor to Covid centre opened at Isolation Hospital. Welekar informed me so I rushed to the hospital and took details from NMC.” Agrawal said there is a lot of difference between the claims of NMC and factual situation. “None of the hospitals run by NMC are giving proper services. Dispensaries are hit by one or other problems. Committees visit West Nagpur and go away, and give nice rankings to NMC. They should visit parts of Central, East and North Nagpur, where people suffer despite paying high taxes,” he said. Activist Joseph George said it was a brazen violation of the Medical Council of India (MCI) rules if NMC is running dispensary without a doctor, and diagnosis and prescription is being done by a nurse. “NMC gets crores to provide medical services to the people under various schemes including National Urban Health Mission (NUHM). Also, NMC’s own budget is around Rs2,500 crore. Large number of poor and lower middle class people are totally dependent upon NMC’s dispensaries. That NMC cannot provide a doctor is very unfortunate and inhuman,” he said. As per NMC data, OPDs run at 65 health centres and three indoor hospitals. Of these, 26 dispensaries have been renovated and staffed with doctor, nurses etc under NUHM. Services at remaining 40 centres are reportedly poor. NMC sources said some 10 dispensaries are running without any doctor. “Some doctors are given charge of two dispensaries and also work at zone offices. Therefore, such doctors do not visit the dispensaries on daily basis,” sources said. NMC officials said recruitment of doctors at all centres and for Covid hospitals is going on. “Central and state governments had facilitated funds for development of Covid hospitals. Five hospitals were converted into Covid. Centre used to give funds for salaries of doctors and nurses, but it stopped a few months ago. We continue to operate three Covid hospitals. We are running these hospitals with doctors posted at dispensaries. The problem will be resolved soon,” they said.

The MULinx, an in-house software adopted for the examination for the first time, has reported several serious errors. The errors have affected the future prospects of students and marred the reputation of the university. It also forced MU to postpone postgraduate (PG) admissions for the third time. Yadapadithaya, agreed that issues in the MULinx software resulted in a chain of problems, and said that one cannot blame a single individual for the goof-ups. "The entire examination process is team work, so we have constituted a committee to look into what has gone wrong with the current examination software. The same findings will be chaired during the syndicate meeting, to take a decision on whether to continue with the existing software or not. MU is the first university, out of 23 other state universities, to adopt an in-house software, but we have failed in delivering error-free results. We may outsource the job to private firms from the next examination," he said. PG admissions extendedMangalore University had decided to commence first-year PG classes from mid-December. However, in the latest development, errors in sixth-semester results have again forced MU to extend the date to December 24. The earlier date was December 9. P S Yadapadithaya said that they extended the dates, so that no student aspiring for higher studies is deprived of the opportunity, because of mistakes made by the varsity. "We are a student-centric university, therefore, we called a meeting of all PG chairmen to decide on extending the dates. They have considered it and said that it is the last time they can extend dates. As a result of this inconvenience, we have decided to waive the entrance examination fee for PG courses," he said. The PG classes were supposed to start from November 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/exam-errors-mu-to-do-failure-mode-analysis/articleshow/88213573.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

The TRS will not hesitate to highlight failures and non-cooperation from the Centre,” the minister said at a press conference in Sircilla on Friday. He said Telangana government had urged the Centre for granting Indian Institute of Handloom Technology and a mega powerloom cluster in Sircilla and funds for Kakatiya Mega Textile Park, which is being developed on 1,200 acres. He said government was keen to set up textile parks in Dubbak, Gadwal, Narayanpet, Pochampally and other places, but there was no response from Centre. “Telangana is the only state which provides 50% subsidy to weavers on their material. The state government has given Rs 1,134 crore order for weavers under various schemes,” KTR said. He said government would be coming up with new schemes like work-to-order scheme for weavers by allocating Rs 400 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-central-help-for-textiles-in-t-ktr/articleshow/88215000.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Nagpur||VBA likely to be a kingmaker in Akola-Buldhana-Washim seat||Nagpur: The Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) could emerge as a kingmaker when the results of MLC local authority constituency polls would be declared on Monday. After peaceful polling across 22 centres in all three districts on Friday, which recorded 98.3% turnout, it was not clear where the Prakash Ambedkar-led outfit tilted. Since 808 out of total 822 voters cast their votes, it was clear the VBA representatives participated in the polling. With its 86 voters, it can help the BJP candidate Vasant Khandelwal to cause a major upset in the constituency by defeating three-time from Shiv Sena MLC Gopikishan Bajoria. But even with VBA’s votes, the saffron camp would require support from independents, to get to the halfway mark of 412 votes, as reported by TOI on Wednesday. On paper, the BJP has only 246 votes, which is way behind the halfway mark. On other hand, incumbent Sena MLC is strong on paper having over 400 votes belonging to Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) also comprising Congress and NCP with him. Ambedkar refused to divulge details on which way his party has tilted. “We have given a free hand to our representatives to vote as per their choice. We have not stopped anyone from exercising their franchise or told them to vote for a particular party,” he told TOI. Poll analysts however claimed that VBA could go with the BJP if Union minister Nitin Gadkari sought Ambedkar’s support. Since Khandelwal, a bullion trader is close to Gadkari, there is a possibility of major upset, as the BJP heavyweight is well experienced in such tactics and known to help his friends, cutting across the party lines. The BJP party workers confirmed that Ambedkar was in contact with the top BJP leaders from the region. It was earlier speculated that VBA would abstain from the polling process as it was rival to both BJP and Congress and Akola council. The suspense would be opened only on Monday when counting takes place.

The court had on November 26 ordered that an FIR be lodged against DSP Pramod Mishra, chief minister Hemant Soren’s MLA representative in Barhait assembly constituency Pankaj Mishra, Ranchi city SP Saurabh Kumar and Radhika Minz, the officer in charge of Ranchi SC/ST police station. “Several days have passed since the court’s order and yet, FIRs against these people have not been lodged. It is very evident that the Hemant Soren government is shielding the accused. I urge the CM to act on this and ensure the court directive is followed,” Marandi told reporters at the BJP’s state headquarters on Friday. The special SC/ST court ordered the FIRs to be lodged after an audio clip emerged where DSP was heard abusing the victim. “I have heard the audio clip and was left aghast. How can a person speak so lowly about a deceased woman?” Marandi said. “The JMM-led coalition government assumed power by promising a dignified life to the tribal people of Jharkhand. Now, Rupa’s mother kept running pillar to post to lodge an FIR but was turned away (by the SC/ST police station),” he added. Tirkey, the officer in charge of Sahibganj women police station, was found dead in her quarter in Sahibganj in May this year. Tirkey’s parents claimed she did not die by suicide and claimed she was harassed at the instruction of Pankaj and demanded a CBI probe. Marandi also accused the government of being ignorant of the Election Commission’s order on Deoghar deputy commissioner Manjunath Bhajantri. “The government is not paying heed to even a Constitutional body. The officer is biased and should be removed at once. How can a biased officer dispense his duties? He should be made to count buses on the road,” Marandi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-ignoring-court-orders-not-filing-firs-in-tirkey-case-babulal/articleshow/88214068.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Of the 16 super-specialist departments, only three are running while the rest, including the most important ones like cardiology and gastroenterology, are without any specialist doctor. Even the intensive care unit (ICU) and critical care unit (CCU) have no specialised intensivist to care for the patients. Only general physicians and general surgeons are running the show in majority of the departments, which is resulting in increasing number of patients being referred to other hospitals. BGH is run by Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL) of Steel Authourity of India Limited (SAIL). Chief of communication, BSL, Manikant Dhan, said, “Recruitment drives for specialists and super specialists in BGH have been done in the past. The management is keen on providing the required facilities. Efforts are on to hire specialist doctors.” He added that the situation is gradually changing for the better. “We are hopeful of getting some of them soon.” Recently, 14 doctors have been recruited by BGH, but none of them are super-specialists. They are general physicians. One of the main reasons for BGH’s plight is the acute shortage of super-specialists. BGH currently has super-specialists for neurosurgery, burn and plastic & nephrology departments. Sources said many super-specialists and renowned doctors left BGH or retired in the past few years. The head of the department of cardiology of BGH, Dr Satish Kumar, is also leaving BGH this month. Kumar is president, Cardiological Society of India, Jharkhand chapter. Similarly, head of gynecology department BGH, Dr Rupam Singh, also resigned recently. After Dr Satish Kumar, BGH cardiology department which receives highest number of patients, will no longer have a DM cardiologist nor a cardiothoracic surgeon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/13-out-of-16-depts-at-bgh-have-no-super-specialists/articleshow/88214058.cms||Divy Khare

Jharkhand Renewable Energy Development Agency (JREDA) MD and executive director of Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited K K Verma launched the platform, titled Energy Access Explorer (EAE), at a hotel in Ranchi. Uttara Narayan, who is leading the EAE initiative in WRI, India said, “EAE is an online and interactive platform that brings together geospatial data from development and electricity sectors to support decision-making. The tool is a research initiative led by WRI. Access to electricity is a pre-requisite to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of good health, quality education, clean water, sanitation and eventually, socio-economic development. This platform will provide a unique opportunity to visualize the energy, health, education and livelihood indicators and will aid in the decision-making processes for the accelerated development of Jharkhand. It will also enable decision-makers to make better informed policies to transform the state of energy availability and its reliability at critical social and public spaces in Jharkhand.” Bharat Jairaj, director (energy) of WRI, in his address said, “While India has achieved nearly 100% of household electrification, many crucial public infrastructures, like healthcare and educational facilities, continue to be impacted due to lack of access to reliable, sustainable and affordable power connections. While the departments of energy, health, education and livelihoods have been trying to address these problems at a sectoral level, there is an urgent need to understand the links between them and to adopt an integrated approach to solve some of these challenges.” He added that WRI, India is leading the initiative in expansion and the use of the tool in India for all stakeholders. “EAE is an open-source, digital, live data platform that has been created by WRI at a global scale. It leverages the power of satellite imagery combined with local data to visualize power supply and demand and equips electricity planners, investors and clean energy entrepreneurs with the data they need to close the access gap,” he said. Verma, in his keynote address, stressed on the importance of data and said, “We cannot do anything without data. I am happy to launch this platform today.” Citing on the government’s focus on renewable energy, he said, “Soon, we are planning to float tenders for setting up of a 100MW floating solar plant at Rukka dam, 300 primary health centres are in the pipeline to get solarised. Similarly, we are also working to convert police stations into solar energy-enabled entities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tech-based-energy-mapping-platform-launched-in-jharkhand/articleshow/88214817.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The letter mentioned about the vacant posts in state-level commissions. “The vacancy of chairperson at the Jharkhand State Commission for Women, for the Protection of Child Rights, State Human Rights Commission as well as the Jharkhand State Information Commission is concerning,” the letter said. The letter also brought to attention the repeated instances of police brutality in the state. Citing one such instance, the letter stated, “The police lathi-charged the JPSC aspirants who were taking part in a peaceful protest. It is significant to note that the protesters were only exercising their right to demonstrate peacefully and to have their voices heard.” The letter mentioned that incidents of custodial deaths, fake encounters and police atrocities increased in the state with no action taken against the guilty officers. It also highlighted the delay in the formation of Police Complaint Authority according to the guidelines mandated by the Supreme Court. Prior to handing over the memorandum, the members formed a human chain at Albert Ekka Chowk and raised similar issues through placards, banners and posters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pucl-highlights-police-brutality-vacancies-in-letter-to-governor/articleshow/88214203.cms||---

Physical classes of primary schools in the state have remained shut for almost two years which is creating problems for students who do not have access to smartphones as they are unable to attend online classes, especially in remote areas like Manika where very few children can attend online classes for lack of gadgets and poor internet connectivity. Friday’s gherao was convened by Gram Swaraj Mazdoor Sangh (GSMS), which is a local organization of rural workers, to mark International Human Rights Day. “If crowding is allowed at markets, marriage parties and even cricket stadiums, why are schools closed?” one of the protesters asked. GSMS member Somwati Devi, who is from Sadhwadih village, claimed, “This is a plot against poor people. Big people want us to remain illiterate so that we continue to work for a pittance in their fields and houses.” The protesters, later, handed over a memorandum, addressed to the governor, where they sought his intervention and urged him to ask the government for resumption of classes. “Under Section 244 (1) of the Constitution, you are the highest administrator in Scheduled Areas and hence, we urge you to direct the state government for opening up primary schools from immediate effect,” the memorandum read. The memorandum even sought his intervention pertaining to the protection of human rights in the remote areas of the state ‘where the police harass the locals in the name of administration”. The protest was staged at a time when a huge gathering attended chief minister Hemant Soren’s Sarkar Aapke Dwar event barely 50km away in the neighbouring district of Daltonganj. Prior to the gherao, GSMS conducted a village-to-village campaign where the outfit’s volunteers found that most children in the primary age group are unable to read even a simple sentence. This is consistent with the findings of the School Children’s Online and Offline Learning (SCHOOL) survey, which was conducted in 15 states earlier this year. The survey found that, among poor rural families, only 25% of children enrolled in Class 3 were able to read a simple sentence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/locals-gherao-block-office-for-primary-school-reopening/articleshow/88214101.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The president of the market, Tsering Dorjee, appealed to India on behalf of the Tibetan refugees to boycott Beijing Winter Olympics 2022 and urged for support to counter China. “Tibet is one of the countries where people are deprived of their human rights. Chinese rule is characterised by brutal repression and extreme cruelty. It has been 62 years of annexation of Tibet by the Chinese. His Holiness Dalai Lama raised the issue of Tibet on many international platforms. His efforts led to the foundation of Tibet independence movement and in the year 1989 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,” Dorjee said. The peaceful Buddhist country was “invaded” by Communist China in 1949. The 14th Dalai Lama has alleged that 1.2 million Tibetans were killed under Chinese rule. “Tibetans neither have the right to give birth to a child nor have religious freedom. Chinese rule is trying to put an end to the traditional Tibetan culture. There has been an increasing influx of Chinese settlers into Tibet in recent years. Further, Tibetan women are being forced to marry Chinese men, thereby reducing the Tibetan population. More than 200 youths died by suicide because of extreme Chinese torture,” Dorjee added. Dorjee accused China of dumping non-biodegradable waste in the waters of Tibet. He said, “Excess deforestation and fostering economy by rampant construction have led to dumping the garbage in our country. It has led to a huge ecological loss and raised the threat of glacier melting.” “It is been 26 years since Panchen Lama, the second important spiritual leader after Dalai Lama, was abducted at the age of six in 1995 by the Chinese. Till now there is no information about him. Further, Covid was a China-made virus to ruin the economy of the whole world. All countries should come together to hold China accountable by boycotting the Beijing Winter Olympics 2022,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tibetan-refugees-call-for-boycotting-winter-olympics-at-beijing/articleshow/88214108.cms||---

In one of the cases, a woman had filed a case with the family court alleging atrocities for dowry by an army man and had demanded maintenance. After a prolonged mediation, the couple agreed to live together. They took the decision to secure the future of their two children. In another case, a woman had filed for divorce in family court but the latter thought it fit to be referred for mediation. The mediators held meetings with the couple individually and jointly to counsel them. The woman eventually agreed to save her five-year-old marriage in the interest of her two-year-old child. Mediators L K Giri who managed to bring together three warring couples during the drive said, “Clash of ego is the main reason in many disputes. There is break down of communication between couples. It gives pleasure when we are able to reunite couples after counselling. However, in a number of cases the couples agree to live separately.” DLSA secretary Kamla Kumari said, “Over half a dozen mediations led to reunion of couples. They were garlanded and given proper guidance for a happy married life.” Around 200 cases related to family disputes pending in family court and other courts were taken up for mediation out of which 78 were resolved in the campaign. The DLSA is gearing up to hold the National Lok Adalat on Saturday. Disputes related to labour, post marriage atrocities, excise, check bounce, forest, power, traffic, land acquisition and compoundable criminal offences would be take up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/mediation-drive-resolves-78-cases-reunites-many-couples/articleshow/88214800.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The team questioned dera vice-chairperson P R Nain for about 4 hours about the conspiracy behind the sacrilege incidents. However, dera chairperson Vipasana was not present at the headquarters when IG Surinderpal Singh Parmar lead his team to the premises. This was SIT’s second visit to Haryana town in the last five days. The SIT was not satisfied with the response it got. SIT head Parmar said, “We had prepared a questionare of nearly 200 questions. The 73 questions posed to him made Nain uneasy. Nain has assured to answer the remaining questions in the next 48 hours. The SIT was not satisfied by the answers given by him as he either tried to avoid pointed answers or gave unsatisfactory replies.” The SIT will also try to know about the whereabouts of Vipasana, he added. Sources said the advocates accompanying Nain alleged that the case was politically motivated as the dera has nothing to do with sacrilege in Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sit-grills-nain-at-dera-chairperson-missing/articleshow/88215562.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Not an easy win for farmers, they paid a heavy price, says Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi||BATHINDA: Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Friday said the state government will welcome the farmers after their victorious return from Delhi borders. While addressing a rally in Mansa, he said it was the victory of the people and unmatched unity of the various sections of the society that forced the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre to roll back the draconian farm laws. He added that despite the BJP not paying heed to the farmers’ demands for almost a year, the party leaders now wanted to encash the victory of the farmers in the upcoming assembly elections. “It was not an easy victory for farmers as they had to pay a heavy price... and more than 700 farmers sacrificed their lives during the agitation,” he said. Channi claimed his government has given jobs and financial assistance to the families of around 350 farmers who lost their lives during the agitation and would soon facilitate the remaining families from Punjab. The chief minister also lashed out at the Badals and Akali MLA Bikramjit Majithia for looting the state’s exchequer to set up their own business empires. Apart from the Badals and Majithia, former CM Capt Amarinder Singh was also involved in such malpractices and did not pay any heed to the problems of the common people. Terming AAP a party of thugs and looters, he said the non-Punjabis are trying to befool the people of Punjab with their poll gimmicks and again termed the AAP national convener as ‘black-hearted Kala Angrez’. When Sidhu Moosewala started addressing the rally, the supporters of Mansa district Youth Congress president Chuspinder Singh Chahal created a ruckus. Holding photos of Chuspinder, they started raising slogans in support of the youth leader. Irked, Warring tried stopping the irate youth activists from raising slogans while Channi held the mike and said “crores (of people) see and listen to songs of Moosewala and this type of behaviour is not right”. Lathicharge on teachers Police resorted to a mild lathicharge when some ad hoc teachers, who are demanding job regularisation, tried to reach the Congress rally venue. Police detained some of them but released them later. The protesters claimed police beat up them “mercilessly”. Various teacher organisations slammed the government for treating teachers like animals “that too on international human rights day”. “This is the real face of Channi government, which chose the human rights day to violate the right of protests by under-paid teachers. This government makes lots of claims of siding by the people, but has in reality shown that it is anti-protesters,” said unemployed teachers union member Gurmail Singh. Farm groups oppose brutality Farm group BKU Ekta Ugrahan president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said by making police beat up protesters in such a way, the Channi government has even surpassed brutality of the central government. “We take it seriously and will ask the Channi government to stop indulging in such brutality or face action,” he said. Farm leader Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala said, “It is unthinkable that government indulged in such inhuman behaviour. It will have to pay for this as this government is trying to show that raising voice is a sin.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/not-an-easy-win-for-farmers-they-paid-a-heavy-price-channi/articleshow/88215575.cms||---

Singh wrote this in an inspirational letter three months ago to his alma mater, Army Public School, Chandimandir, a cantonment near Chandigarh. Singh is critical and undergoing treatment in a military hospital, Bangalore. In the four-page letter addressed to the school principal, Singh said he was an average student, barely scoring first division in Class XII. He said he was average in sports and other co-curricular activities. Exhorting students to “never lose hope”, he said: “I was mediocre and today, I have reached difficult milestones in my career. Do not think that Class XII board marks decide what you are capable of achieving in life. Believe in yourself, work towards it,” he wrote, informing about the award he won—Shaurya Chakra, the third highest peacetime gallantry award, for critical landing of light combat aircraft Tejas in an air emergency. “You may be mediocre in school, but it’s by no means a measure of things to come in life. Find your calling, it could be art, music, graphic design, literature etc. Whatever you work towards, be dedicated, do your best. Never go to bed thinking I could have put in more effort,” he wrote. He said he didn’t excel either in studies or sport in NDA, but found his wings in Air Force Academy. “My passion for aviation gave me an edge over my peers”, but lacked confidence, he said. “After commissioning as a young Flight Lieutenant in a fighter squadron, I realised that I could do well if I put my mind and heart to it…(and then) things started to turn around in my professional and personal life…” Singh wrote that he would be deeply humbled if some part of this story is shared with children.“If I am able to inspire even one child to believe him/her in himself/herself, I would have achieved my objective,” he signed off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/never-lose-hope-lone-survivor-said-in-recent-letter/articleshow/88216340.cms||---

Former Congress MLA Harjinder Singh Thekedar and former convener of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) legal cell Sandeep Gorsi have joined PLC. Harjinder, a Congress leader who contested the 2002 assembly elections from Amritsar South constituency had polled 23,322 votes while his closest opponent candidate, independent candidate Raminder Singh Bolaria, father of sitting MLA Inderbir Singh Bolaria, had got 19,232 votes. He was appointed chairman of the Backward Classes Land Development and Finance Corporation by then chief minister Amarinder Singh in 2019. If he contests from Amritsar South constituency, he is likely to face a competition from Congress’s Inderbir Bolaria, AAP’s Dr Inderbir Singh Nijjar and Akali’s Talbir Singh. Gorsi, who resigned from the primary membership of Congress saying “the present day Congress leaders have forgotten the party culture and discipline”, has already begun his political activities in PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s constituency Amritsar East.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/former-cong-mla-joins-amarinders-plc/articleshow/88215612.cms||Yudhvir Rana

With a heavy heart but steady hands and unwavering eyes, she stayed focused on the target, recalled every pep talk the CDS had given her, and told herself she would aim for gold in every event. “This time, while competing in the championship, my only objective was to win gold as I wanted to dedicate each gold to him and the other warriors who died with him. I will always remember him as a mentor and guide,” Bandhavi told TOI. In the last championship, she had got eight medals, five of them gold. This time, she has doubled her gold tally despite the trauma. A week short of her 20th birthday, Bandhavi is the daughter of Yashwardhan Singh, younger brother of Madhulika. Yashwardhan was the first to rush to Delhi by a special Army plane after news of the accident broke on Wednesday. The championship concluded on Friday, with Bandhavi being crowned national champion in .22 calibre, 50m category. She immediately flew to Delhi for the cremation of Gen Rawat and Madhulika. “Uncle Rawat spoke little, but whatever he said were words to inspire. He would always say that whenever someone takes up any task, they should never rest until they complete it. This was what kept me focused even after I learnt of his death,” Bandhavi told TOI. She last met Gen Rawat in October. “After returning from the world championship in Peru, I stayed with uncle and aunt at their home in New Delhi for two days. Whenever Gen Rawat interacted with us, there was something to learn. He took me to a few events. I had a great time, and never knew that it would be my last meeting with him,” said Bandhavi. A regular member of the MP Shooting Academy in Bhopal, Bandhavi is pursuing a masters in History. She took to shooting in Class 10. “I was the national school champion in hockey for six consecutive years till class 12. I was in Daly College Indore and was attracted towards shooting while I was in class 10. I won the national championship in both shooting and hockey at the school level, but decided to focus on shooting,” said Bandhvi. Her father Yashwardhan Singh said the late General wanted to open a Sainik School in Shahdol, Madhulika’s native place. “We belong to Shahdol, which is a tribal-dominated area. I spoke to Gen Rawat 15 days ago and he had promised to visit Shahdol in January 2022. He was willing to open a Sainik School in Shahdol,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/nieces-tribute-to-rawat-11-golds-in-shooting/articleshow/88216388.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Amritsar||Pakistan teenaged Sikh girl converts to marry Muslim boyfriend||AMRITSAR: A teenaged Sikh girl Rajmeet Kaur embracing Islam to become Zannat Bibi and marrying her Muslim boyfriend Zunaid has led to tension between Sikhs and Muslims of Nankana Sahib, Pakistan. Sources said Rajmeet, 18, married Zunaid, 18, on December 7 in a mosque at Jaranwala city in Faislabad district of Pakistan, about 25 km from Nankana Sahib. She also filed a petition in the local court, claiming threat to life and seeking security. Her father Ranjit Singh, an hakim by profession, has sought the help of community to bring back the girl to the family. As the issue escalated, the local administration intervened and brought both Rajmeet and Zunaid to police station, where their parents were also called for a compromise. However, the attempt failed and police decided to send the girl to Darul Uloom in Lahore, but her kin insisted that she be handed over to them. “Rajmeet has outrightly refused to go to her parents and agreed to go to Darul Uloom or be sent with Zunaid, which has led to some tension between two communities,” said a local Sikh leader. He also accused some Sikh politicians of fanning the fire for their political gains. Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee president Ameer Singh did not take the phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/sikh-girl-converts-to-marry-muslim-boyfriend/articleshow/88215637.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||India||Dos, don’ts for parents to keep kids’ gaming safe||NEW DELHI: An advisory by the education ministry has listed the ‘dos and don’ts’ for parents and teachers for safe online gaming by children, including installation of internet gateway at home with features like monitoring, logging and control of content that can be accessed. The other steps include not allowing purchases without parental consent, avoiding credit or debit cards registration on apps for subscriptions and getting them to use a screen name (avatar) that does not reveal the real name. Noting that prolonged closure of schools due to the pandemic has increased use of mobile and internet by children and also led to online gaming addiction, the advisory seeks to enable parents and teachers to educate them for necessary action to prevent stress. “Playing online games leads to a serious gaming addiction which has been considered as a gaming disorder. The game is designed in a way that each level is more complicated and complex than the previous one. This causes a player to push themselves to the limit in order to progress in the game. Therefore, playing online games with no restrictions and self-limits leads many players to become addicted and are eventually diagnosed with gaming disorder. The gaming companies also emotionally compel the child to buy more levels,” the advisory noted. “Children should be advised not to download software and games from unknown websites. They should be told to beware of clicking links, images and pop-ups in the websites as they may contain a virus and harm the computer, and may contain age-inappropriate content,” the advisory said. “Children should be counselled to not give personal information over the Internet ,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dos-donts-for-parents-to-keep-kids-gaming-safe/articleshow/88216400.cms||---

---||Goa||After MGP-TMC tie-up, BJP opens doors to Gaude||Panaji: Days after Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) declared they were entering a pre-poll alliance, BJP opened its doors to art and culture minister Govind Gaude. State party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said on Friday that the independent Priol MLA would soon join BJP. Around six months ago, Gaude had expressed his willingness to join BJP, but at the time, the party didn't react to his statement. Now, on Friday, Tanavade said, “Gaude is in alliance with BJP, and will join the party before the election.” This is the first time BJP has openly said that Gaude would join the party. Earlier, while BJP was in talks with MGP hoping to forge a pre-poll alliance, it was silent on Gaude. The talks involved BJP offering MGP around six seats, one of them being Gaude’s Priol. MGP president Pandurang Dhavalikar had announced his plans to contest from the constituency. A political observer said that with the announcement of the MGP-TMC alliance, the road for BJP to induct Gaude was cleared. In June, Gaude had said that he was willing to join BJP provided the party nominates him as its candidate for the 2022 assembly election. Gaude had won the 2017 assembly election with the support of the party, and has since been a cabinet minister in the state BJP-led government, under the chief ministerships of both Manohar Parrikar and Pramod Sawant. In 2019, Sawant, soon after taking over as CM, had dropped independent MLA Rohan Khaunte and GFP from the cabinet. The political observer said that if Gaude joins BJP, its karyakartas in the constituency are likely to get upset, as they want the party to finalise a candidate from among them. Tanavade said that the first list of candidates would be announced within a week of the election announcement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-mgp-tmc-tie-up-bjp-opens-doors-to-gaude/articleshow/88215205.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Haryana suspends IPS officer booked in multi-crore heist||GURUGRAM: The government on Friday ordered the suspension of an IPS officer who was posted in Gurugram as DCP (south) till a few weeks ago, two days after he was named as one of the accused in a multi-crore heist in the city. Dheeraj Sethia has already been served two notices by the Haryana special task force (STF), which is probing the case. A team of officers had also visited his official residence in Gurugram on Wednesday but found him missing. “IPS Dheeraj Sethia, currently posted as a commandant in the Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) at Rohtak’s Sunaria, has been suspended with immediate effect. During the period of suspension, his headquarters will be the DGP office in Panchkula,” read the suspension letter issued by Rajeev Arora, Haryana additional chief secretary (home) on Friday. Cash amounting to several crores was allegedly stolen from two flats owned by the developer of a Sector 84 residential society in August this year. Till now, investigators have found the trail of around Rs 22 crore and suspect the stolen amount could be much more. At the time of the crime, Sethia was posted in Gurugram as DCP (South) and was holding additional charge of DCP (crime) when crime branch of Gurugram police was probing the matter. During a bureaucratic reshuffle a few weeks ago, he was posted as the Kurukshetra SP. He was again shunted to the IRB recently after his name cropped up in the probe. In the meantime, the case was handed over to STF, which in November arrested two doctors who allegedly informed a gangster about the cash and helped plan and execute the crime. It also recovered around Rs 3.9 crore from their possession. In their disclosure statements, the doctors claimed they paid Sethia Rs 3.5 crore in cash and gold bullion as bribes. Later, Sethia allegedly kept Rs 20 lakh and returned the remaining money and gold. STF submitted the disclosure statements in court earlier this month. In an order issued on December 2, Gurugram additional sessions judge Jasbir Singh observed, “From the… disclosure statement of accused Dr Suchinder Kumar Jain Naval, it is clear he has given illegal gratification to DCP Dheeraj Setia for hushing up the matter. He (Naval) also disclosed having delivered huge amounts in the form of gold, dollars etc… to DCP for said purpose. From perusal of the police file, I have not found any concrete step taken for taking the investigation to its logical conclusion on the basis of the disclosures. As such, the investigating agency has failed to perform its statutory duty with utmost care, especially when involvement of a senior police officer has come on record.” The court further observed, “Delay in proceeding further against the police officer on the basis of the disclosure statement of Dr Naval is nothing but to give time to said police officer to destroy evidence… As such, the investigating agency is not conducting a probe in a proper way. For that purpose, this court, in exercise of its power… is hereby opting for monitoring investigation to ensure that search for truth is not muddied by police lapses, whether innocent or blameworthy.” STF then issued notices to Sethia to join the probe. After Sethia went incommunicado, STF on Wednesday added his name and sections of the Anti-Corruption Act and Section 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) of IPC to the existing FIR of theft registered at Kherki Daula police station in August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/haryana-suspends-ips-officer-booked-in-multi-crore-heist/articleshow/88215596.cms||Bagish Jha
