As of now, the third jab that will also be given to around three crore people above 60 with co-morbidities will be of the same vaccine that one had got in the first and second instances. On Saturday, PM Modi had announced that Covid vaccination of children between 15-18 will begin from January 3, whereas administration of “precaution doses” of Covid vaccines for health and frontline workers as well as for elderly above 60 with co-morbidities will begin from January 10. However, very few of the eligible elderly people may actually be receiving the third dose in January. Since Covishield accounts for majority of (89%) the total 141 crore doses administered so far, it is estimated a maximum of one crore people above 60 with comorbidities would be eligible in January. Immunisation among children aged 15-to-18 will begin with Covaxin, which secured regulatory approval on Saturday for emergency use in children above 12 years. While Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D has also been approved for children above 12 years, it is still not part of the government’s programme. “Any decision on mixing of doses will be taken based on clinical trial results,” an official said. The government maintains there are adequate doses available to be able to cater to the additional load. States have an inventory of four crore doses of Covaxin and the demand for Covaxin in the 18-plus category has ceased in many states. As on Sunday, there are 18 crore unutilised doses available with the states. The monthly production of Covaxin and Covishield is estimated at around 31 crore doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-3rd-dose-will-be-of-same-vaccine-as-two-earlier-shots/articleshow/88511181.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||Centre sets up panel on Nagaland AFSPA relief||DIMAPUR/NEW DELHI: The Union home ministry has constituted a five-member committee headed by registrar general of India Vivek Joshi to examine the possibility of withdrawing the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act from Nagaland in the wake of the botched December 3 Army operation in Mon district that resulted in 14 civilian deaths. The committee will submit its report within 45 days. AFSPA has been been in place in Nagaland for decades. A joint statement issued by Nagaland CM Neiphiu Rio, his deputy Y Patton and Naga People’s Front Legislature Party leader TR Zeliang on Sunday said the decision was taken at a meeting convened by Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on December 23. At the funeral of the victims from Oting village in Mon, Rio had led the call for a repeal of the “draconian” AFSPA, a demand backed by his Meghalaya counterpart Conrad Sangma. The committee includes the additional secretary (northeast) in the ministry of home affairs as member secretary along with the Nagaland chief secretary, DGP and Assam Rifles director general as members. Committee head Joshi holds the additional charge of secretary of border management. Apart from Rio and his deputy, the Delhi meeting was attended by Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, who is also the convenor of the North East Democratic Alliance. The meeting decided that based on the outcome of a court of inquiry, disciplinary proceedings would be initiated against the Army para commando unit involved in the Mon operation and the personnel who were in the team that night. Once identified, they will be placed under suspension with immediate effect, the Rio government said.

---||India||CJI: Executive’s tendency to ignore court orders a worry||NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India N V Ramana on Sunday expressed grave concern over the executive’s “growing tendency to disregard and disrespect court orders” and said unless there is cooperation and assistance from both the executive and legislature, justice to people cannot be ensured by the judiciary single-handedly. Justice Ramana said the higher courts have been mandated to ensure that executive decisions and legislations were in sync with the Constitution and asserted that the constitutional courts cannot show any laxity while testing the validity of a decision by a government, enjoying popular majority, on the constitutional touchstone. Delivering the fifth L Venkateswarlu Endowment Lecture on ‘Indian Judiciary: Challenges of Future’ at Siddhartha Law College in Vijayawada, the CJI said, “A popular majority is not a defence for arbitrary actions taken by a government. Every action is mandatorily required to comply with the Constitution. If the judiciary does not have the power of judicial review, then the functioning of democracy in this country would be unthinkable.” “Courts do not have the power of the purse or the sword. Court orders are only good when they get executed. The executive needs to assist and cooperate for the rule of law to prevail in the nation. However, there appears to be a growing tendency to disregard, and even disrespect court orders by the executive,” the CJI said. “One ought to remember that ensuring justice is not the responsibility of the judiciary alone. Unless the other two coordinate organs make sincere efforts to fill the judicial vacancies, appoint prosecutors, strengthen infrastructure, and make laws with a clear foresight and stakeholders’ analysis, the judiciary cannot be held responsible alone,” he added. Referring to the rising number of physical attacks on judges and court complexes, the CJI said, “At times, there are also concerted campaigns in print and social media against judges if parties do not get a favourable order. These attacks appear to be sponsored and synchronised. The law-enforcing agencies, particularly the specialised ones, need to deal with such malicious attacks effectively. It is unfortunate that unless the court interferes and passes orders, the authorities generally do not proceed with the investigation.” Justice Ramana stressed it was the bounden duty of the government to create a safe and secure environment for judges to function fearlessly. He said the fair and fearless functioning of the judiciary also gets adversely impacted by media trials, which have become a trend these days. “New media tools have enormous amplifying ability but appear to be incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, good and bad and the real and fake. Media trials cannot be a guiding factor in deciding cases,” he added. The CJI was concerned about a dysfunctional criminal justice system and said the overarching control of the executive over the public prosecutors was the main reason for its abysmal state of affairs. “There is a need to liberate the institution of public prosecutors. Total independence must be granted to them and to make them answerable only to the courts. Historically, prosecutors in India have been under the control of the government. Hence it is not a surprise that they do not act independently. They do nothing to prevent frivolous and non-deserving cases from reaching the courts,” he said. “Public prosecutors automatically oppose bail applications, without independently applying their mind. They attempt to suppress evidence during trial which could benefit the accused. A holistic rework needs to be undertaken... PPs act as gatekeepers who ensure that rights of citizens are not sacrificed and that citizens are not harassed through malicious prosecutions,” he said. The CJI did not spare the investigating agencies and accused them of acting in a highhanded manner because of the absence of any accountability. “There is absolutely no system of accountability in place for faulty and inordinately delayed investigations. A person wrongfully incarcerated due to false implication loses his right to liberty, property, etc. He suffers enormously. There is no real remedy left for him and no compensation whatsoever even after an acquittal,” he said. Reiterating his demand for setting up of national and state judicial infrastructure authorities to improve woefully inadequate infrastructure in courts, the CJI also attempted to dispel purported misconception about the collegium system, often referred to as judges-appointing-judges system. “It is nowadays fashionable to reiterate phrases such as ‘judges are themselves appointing judges’. I consider this to be one of the widely propagated myths. The fact is the judiciary is merely one of the many players involved in the process. Many authorities are involved, including the Union law ministry, state governments, governors, high court collegia, intelligence bureau, and lastly, the topmost executive, who all are designated to examine the suitability of a candidate. I am sad to note that the well-informed also propagate the aforesaid notion. After all, this narrative suits certain sections,” Justice Ramana said. He said a Union government study showed that governments accounted for 46% of total litigation pending in courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cji-executives-tendency-to-ignore-court-orders-a-worry/articleshow/88511609.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Recall OBC quota order or defer MP local polls: Centre in SC||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Sunday moved the Supreme Court seeking recall of its December 17 order de-reserving seats for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in MP panchayat polls while asserting that holding elections without ensuring adequate representation of the community in elected bodies in grassroots-level governance was contrary to the mandate of the Constitution. Alternatively, the SC could defer the polls for four months and seek a report within three months from the commission already engaged in identifying seats to be reserved for backward classes, the Centre suggested. Till the time elections were held with seats reserved for the OBC community, administrators could be appointed as a stop-gap arrangement, it said. Questioning the correctness of the SC’s December 17 order, the Centre said it was impermissible for the court to interfere at a stage when the election process, providing for representation of persons belonging to the OBC community, had already commenced. “Any intervention at this stage would deprive the person belonging to the OBC community for five long years which by no stretch of logic can be said to be a short period causing grave prejudice to the backward class citizens,” it said. It said the SC’s order deprived the OBC community of representation in grassroots level governance, opportunities for developing leadership qualities and denied persons belonging to the OBC community chance to get elected to panchayats. The MP government also moved an application seeking recall of the SC’s December 17 order and continuance of the panchayat elections as scheduled in the Election Commission’s December 4 notification, which reserved seats for OBCs. The state said that as per the 2011 Census, OBCs constituted 51% of the population and hence 27% reservation for backward classes in panchayat polls was in sync with the mandate of Article 243-O of the Constitution. In its petition seeking recall of the SC order, the Centre said, “The issues raised in the present petition are of great public importance and have a pan-India ramification on the issue of implementation of OBC reservations in the elections throughout the country. Upliftment of SCs, STs and Other Backward Classes has been the utmost priority of the Union government and any inadequate representation of OBCs in local self-government defeats the very object, intent and purpose of the very idea of the de-centralisation of power and taking governance to the grass root level.” Seeking impleadment in the petition challenging the MP government ordinance providing for 27% reservation in panchayat polls, the Centre said inadequate representation of OBCs in local self-government defeats the very object, intent and purpose of the very idea of decentralisation of power and taking governance to the grassroot level. The SC, in its December 17 order, had directed that seats reserved for OBCs be treated as general category ones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/recall-obc-quota-order-or-defer-mp-local-polls-govt-in-sc/articleshow/88511741.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Among states, Maharashtra saw the highest number of abandoned babies, foeticides and infanticides combined across the country within the same period, accounting for 18.3% of the national tally of 6,459. While Maharashtra topped the list with 1,184 cases, Madhya Pradesh was second with 1,168 cases, followed by Rajasthan (814), Karnataka (771), and Gujarat (650). Among cities, Delhi tops the list with 221 cases, followed by Bengaluru (156), Mumbai, Ahmedabad (75), and Indore (65). A senior IPS officer said, “The cases and reasons vary in urban and rural areas. In urban areas, they could be socio-economic. While in rural areas, it could be the girl child issue. These cases are given top priority in investigation.” In police parlance, abandonment is registered under three categories: infanticide, foeticide, and finally exposure and abandonment of a child. Investigators said infanticide and foeticide mainly occurs in the context of poverty, and female foeticide is perceived as an economic choice. Other reasons include the dowry system, deformed infants, famine, lack of support services and postpartum depression. Following the Covid outbreak, which affected the total number of births, Maharashtra also witnessed a dip in the number of newborns abandoned. According to the National Crime Records Bureau’s 2020 report, 143 cases occurred in Maharashtra in 2020, as against 184 in the previous year. In most cases, on being tracked down by the police, the person who abandoned the infant doesn’t want the child back due to social stigma, said cops. As recently as December 23, the Meghwadi police found a day-old boy on the roadside in Jogeshwari. “We immediately admitted the newborn to hospital. We are searching for the person who abandoned the child. Normally, the team tries to locate the person and counsel them, and tries to understand their reason for taking such an extreme step,” said Sanjay Pimple, senior inspector at Meghwadi police station. On November 14, another newborn was dumped in a nullah in Ghatkopar. “The baby girl was handed over to a Chembur-based NGO. We are trying to find the baby’s mother. On finding her, counselling sessions will be held,” said constable Sheetal Sonawane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-tops-cities-in-desertion-of-infants-maharashtra-mp-among-worst-states-ncrb/articleshow/88511790.cms||V Narayan
---||India||Weekly Covid cases rise in north, west India||Covid-19 numbers are rising sharply in several states in north and west India, despite another week of falling cases nationally. While Covid cases in India saw a fall of 6% in the week ending Sunday, the numbers in Delhi, Haryana and Jharkhand more than doubled during the period as compared with the previous seven days. India recorded close to 46,000 cases during December 20-26, down from over 49,000 in the previous week and the lowest weekly count in over 19 months since May 18-24, 2020. The fall mainly reflected the pandemic's trend in Kerala, which recorded 5,454 fewer cases than the previous week- a fall of 24%. Elsewhere, Covid cases rose, in varying numbers, in as many as 16 states and Union territories. The spurt comes at a time of rising cases of Omicron in the country. However, since just around 500 Omicron cases have been documented in the country so far, it's not clear whether the surge across states is linked to the new Covid variant. Maharashtra posted 2,579 more cases than in the preceding week, translating to a 45% surge in numbers. The state logged 8,292 new infections, an eight-week high since 8,633 cases were reported in October 25-31. In Jharkhand, cases have trebled in a week, based on six-day data since Sunday's numbers weren't available. Haryana recorded a 145% growth in cases, although the overall numbers were still low at 344. Delhi, meanwhile, reported over 1,000 new cases (1,155) this week, a first since June 21-27. This was a 141% rise from the previous seven days. Daily cases have risen from 102 on Tuesday to 290 on Sunday. Other states in midst of a Covid spike include Gujarat, where cases have nearly doubled (up 97%), Uttar Pradesh (68% rise), Bihar (64%), Madhya Pradesh (57%), Rajasthan (50%) Uttarakhand (42%), Punjab (21%) and Chhattisgarh (20%). Gujarat reported 177 Covid-19 cases on Sunday, its highest single-day addition since June 20 when the count was 185. Similarly, Maharashtra logged 1,648 cases in the last 24 hours, the highest in 64 days. Mumbai alone accounted for 896 cases. Meanwhile, overall deaths from the pandemic in the country crossed 4.8 lakh on Sunday, with 2,440 fatalities reported during the week, including old deaths added to the toll.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/weekly-covid-cases-rise-in-north-west-india/articleshow/88511895.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

Sudhakaran told reporters in Kannur that no one in the party has the right to oppose the party decisions. “Tharoor is only a single member in the party. If he yields to the party, he will be in the party. If he doesn’t he won’t be there in the party. It is applicable for all, be it Shashi Tharoor or K Sudhakaran. No one who is part of the party has the right to oppose or reject the decisions taken by the organization. Such an authority has not been given to anyone, including an MP. Congress is not just one Shashi Tharoor,” Sudhakaran said responding to a question. He said that Tharoor had given his reply to the explanation sought by the KPCC on the issue and that the party has asked Tharoor to give the explanation in writing. “He can maintain his own opinion and protect it. But finally he should obey the party. If party MLAs and MPs themselves do not follow the party’s official stand, then we can only sympathize over the unity in the party,” the KPCC chief said. Sudhakaran said that though he recognize the talent and the broad views of Tharoor, he feels that the MP is yet to get on the right track of Indian politics. Tharoor had earlier refused to sign the letter written by the UDF MPs to Union minister of railways seeking to issue a directive to stop land acquisition for the scheme. Many Congress leaders, including former KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran, had earlier criticized Tharoor’s stand saying that his stand was against the considered stand taken by UDF against the K-Rail project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fall-in-line-or-you-will-be-out-kerala-congress-chief-to-tharoor/articleshow/88512037.cms||---
---||India||No plan to revive farm laws, Rahul is doing ‘cheap politics’: Tomar||MORENA (MP): Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Sunday made it clear that the central government has no plan to reintroduce the three withdrawn farm laws, and accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of doing “cheap politics” and misleading people. Tomar’s statement comes a day after the Congress alleged that the Centre was hatching a conspiracy to reintroduce the three farm laws after the upcoming assembly polls. The Congress had made the allegation after Tomar, during an event in Maharashtra’s Nagpur, said while talking about repealed farm laws that the government moved a “step back” and “will move forward again”. “There is no proposal of the government to bring back agriculture reform laws. People like Rahul Gandhi indulge in cheap politics. These people have tried unsuccessfully to mislead the country by misquoting my statement,” he said. In Nagpur, Tomar had said that the Centre brought agriculture laws, but some people did not like these laws which were a big reform brought about 70 years after the Independence under Modi’s leadership. After this statement, Rahul Gandhi had said, “If anti-farmer steps are taken again, then satyagraha of annadatas will take place. Had defeated arrogance, will again defeat it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-plan-to-revive-farm-laws-rahul-is-doing-cheap-politics-tomar/articleshow/88512193.cms||---
---||India||PM Modi’s short-notice address cleared air on booster doses||NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi’s decision to address the nation on Saturday night at a short notice was driven by the need to effectively communicate the decisions to initiate booster doses and vaccination for children without any unnecessary speculation. Rather than leaving the matter to officials and press releases, PM Modi explained the categories eligible for the “precaution dose” (as he chose to call the booster shots) and also placed the decisions in the context of the current Covid situation in the country. Sources said the reference to “precaution” doses needs to be seen in the context of studies and surveys revealing a high degree of “hybrid immunity” in the country which stems from being vaccinated and also contracting the disease at some point. The infection in such cases may often be asymptomatic as suggested by sero surveys showing antibodies even in children who did not receive vaccines. So, boosters could be better viewed as “precaution” doses for those in a certain age category or in “at risk” jobs. The government has been cautious about initiating vaccination for children despite encouraging results of Covaxin and Zydus shots, the view being that even a few stray adverse reports could prove a serious setback. Also, government experts noted the minimal infections among children and prevalence of antibodies. The advent of the more transmissible Omicron variant and concerns over immunity levels in the elderly who recieved the vaccines in early 2021 and health and frontline workers led to a thorough review of data and the decisions announced by the PM. Additionally, it was also necessary, said sources, to ensure adequate vaccine availability for the large number of people who will be eligible for the booster shots and the first doses for children. The current goal of the government — to step up full vaccination for adults — remains relevant as this is the basic protection against severe disease and death. Taking this to at least 85% from the current 61% is top priority. Overall, the PM’s address was seen to reflect the need for caution and at the same evince confidence that the nation was prepared to face rising Omicron infections. The feedback from business and industry, said sources, reflected a preparedness to take the developing situation in stride rather than anticipate big dislocations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modis-short-notice-address-cleared-air-on-booster-doses/articleshow/88512276.cms||Rajeev Deshpande

Home minister Araga Jnanendra, who is piloting The Karnataka Protection of Right to Freedom of Religion Bill, 2021, said, "We will bring the ordinance to the cabinet next week. We are planning to promulgate it in early January after getting the governor's assent."  However, law minister JC Madhuswamy said the government will also consider the timing of the joint session before pushing for the ordinance. "We have an option to get the bill passed in the council during the next legislature session— the joint sitting of the assembly and council— in January or February. But if the legislature session is delayed, we will take the option of promulgating an ordinance," said Madhuswamy. The bill was passed in the assembly by voice vote on December 23. The government tried to get it approved in the council on Friday but was forced to defer it as it did not have the required strength. Social welfare minister and House leader Kota Srinivas Poojari told the House that the government will not seek the House's consideration for passage as it wants it to take up the bill in the next session. "It is left to the government to decide when it wants to get the bill passed. They can even promulgate an ordinance since the bill has been tabled but not rejected by the council," said council chairman Basavaraj Horatti. According to parliamentary rules, the government can promulgate an ordinance of the pending bill if it is not rejected in any one of the two houses. But it must get the approval of the legislature for the bill in the immediate next session after promulgating the ordinance. The BJP's strength in the council will increase from 32 to 37 next month when newly-elected MLCs take oath. Since it will still be one seat short of a simple majority in the 75-member council, Jnanendra said the BJP is reaching out to independent member Lakhan Jarkiholi to support the bill. However, Congress and JD(S) are determined to defeat the bill. "They may promulgate the ordinance. But they have to seek the passage of the bill in the council and we will seek division and defeat the bill. I hope the JD(S) sticks to its present stand," said senior Congress MLC BK Hariprasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/anti-conversion-bill-govt-to-take-ordinance-route/articleshow/88512295.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Tracking the movement of the Indian plate, they have also suggested that such erosion may have created the Himalayan mountain range. Some hypotheses suggest that a supervolcano (a mantle plume) erupted at around 65 Ma — each Ma or mega annum represents one million years — which drastically affected Earth’s climate, resulting in the fifth mass extinction event called the K-T boundary mass extinction that saw reptiles such as dinosaurs being wiped out. “This volcanism occurred just underneath the then Indian plate, in a location known as Réunion, presently in the southern Indian Ocean. Scientists have suggested that the volcanism probably created India’s Deccan plateau and affected the dynamics of the Indian plate in many ways,” IISc said. In their new study, Jyotirmoy Paul and Attreyee Ghosh from the Centre for Earth Sciences (CES) at IISc, looked into the interaction between the Indian plate and the Réunion plume using numerical models of mantle convection. The researchers constructed “spherical time-dependent forward mantle convection models” to investigate whether the “Réunion plume” eruption could have reduced the Indian craton thickness. Their findings show that due to the Reunion plume eruption, about 130 km of the Indian continental lithosphere might have been eroded away, making it an unusually thin plate compared to other continental plates. “In addition, the plume material could have lubricated the boundary between the Indian plate and the underlying mantle. As a result, the Indian plate could slide over the mantle very quickly, achieving the highest velocity ever by any plate (around 20 cm/year) since 65 Ma. Such fast velocity could be a potential reason for the massive impact between the Indian and the Eurasian plates, ultimately forming the world’s tallest mountain chain – the Himalayas,” the researchers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/iisc-volcanos-from-last-mass-extinction-created-himalayas/articleshow/88512303.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Grabhouse and Pankhuri founder Shrivastava no more||BENGALURU:: Pankhuri Shrivastava, founder of a woman-centric community platform called Pankhuri, passed away on Friday. She was 32. Pankhuri was founded in 2019 for members to socialise, explore and upskill through live interactive courses, expert chat, and interest-based clubs. The startup has raised $3.2 million led by Sequoia Capital India’s accelerator programme Surge. Shrivastava previously founded rental startup Grabhouse which was sold to Quikr in a cash and equity deal around five years ago. Grabhouse had raised $10 million in funding led by Sequoia Capital and Kalaari Capital. Vani Kola, founder of Kalaari Capital, tweeted on Sunday, “Yesterday it came as a shock to me when I found out that @pankhuri16 is no more. I remember her as a vivacious bright woman full of ideas and full of life. She was confident. That was something you noticed about her immediately.” Kola added, “My heart reaches out to her family at this untimely tragedy. Her demise is a loss for our startup ecosystem. We lost a bright and young founder, but I know her legacy will live on. It was truly a privilege to know Pankhuri. Rest in peace, Pankhuri.” An engineering graduate from RGTU in Bhopal, she landed a Teach for India fellowship and taught at a municipal school in Mumbai. The computer science engineer found it difficult to find shared accommodation with like-minded flatmates. “I had a budget constraint and spent a lot of time in finding an accommodation bypassing brokers. I shifted 5 houses in 2 years,” Shrivastava told TOI when she founded Grabhouse. To put an end to her house-hunting woes, she teamed up with her colleague Prateek Shukla to launch Grabhouse.com in 2013. The startup offered a broker-free, community-based online exchange for finding rented accommodation. Shukla, her former cofounder, and a friend said, “Pankhuri was full of life.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: 91 ITI trainees used fake marks cards to land jobs||BENGALURU: A verification of marks cards belonging to thousands of people who landed government jobs in 2017-18 has revealed that 91 of them, who trained in various Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) in the state, furnished fake documents. Siddapura police registered a case of cheating and forgery against 91 persons on December 23, based on a complaint filed by Chandrashekara BL, joint director at the industrial training and employment commissioner’s office. He alleged that various government agencies sent marks cards to the office for verification in 2017-18 during their recruitment process. Three committees were formed — on September 12 in 2017 and January 31 and June 23 in 2018 — to verify the documents. The committees have now submitted their findings. Many of the 91 persons were employed in public sector undertakings. “The committees found that marks cards belonging to these 91 persons were fake. Many got them with the help of officials in the department of industrial training and employment. A few received them from private persons,” Chandrashekara alleged. The suspects belong to Talikote, Hungund, Hirur, Hosapete, Channapatna, Devalapura, Bengaluru, Tangadagi, Muddebihal and other places. Many are from districts in North Karnataka. Siddapura police are verifying the documents. An officer said all the suspects would be summoned and interrogated to find out how they got the certificates. Police added that a few state institutions and officials are suspected to be behind the scam. “Once we question the suspects named in the FIR, we may get more information about the main culprits behind the scam and the money involved,” the officer said. Police registered the case under IPC sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged document), and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/91-iti-trainees-used-fake-marks-cards-to-land-jobs/articleshow/88512308.cms||---

VV Puram police have taken up a case of theft against the unidentified man on the basis of a complaint from the 65-year-old woman’s husband, B Ramappa, a resident of Yeliyur village near Devanahalli. Ramappa told police his wife Rathnamma was suffering from nausea for the past couple of years and was treated at various hospitals. Doctors at a private hospital in Devanahalli referred her to Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital. The couple went there on December 23 and was referred to Victoria Hospital. “A 60-year-old person met us at Bowring Hospital said he would help my wife get proper treatment at Victoria Hospital as he knew doctors there. We reached the hospital around noon and registered Rathnamma’s name, but they refused to allow three persons inside. So the man took my wife to the scanning area. He asked her to remove her jewellery before entering the screening room. Trusting him, she removed her gold mangalsutra and earrings and gave them to him,” Ramappa said. Police said the man fled soon after getting the gold, worth over Rs 3 lakh. A case of cheating and theft has been taken up against him. Police warned the public not to believe strangers in hospitals and hand over valuables to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-loses-gold-to-conman-at-hospital/articleshow/88512311.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||25k seats taken after 2nd round of CET counselling||Bengaluru: At the end of the second round of counselling of Common Entrance Test-2021, only about 25,000 of 60,000 engineering seats have been taken by students. While an extended second round is under way and the last date to report to colleges is four days away, KEA is hoping more students might join at the last minute. The low numbers are attributed to the dilemma of students arising out of the confusion over the delay in NEET counselling. “All the seats have been allotted, but students have not reported to the colleges. This is because they are in a fix because NEET counselling hasn’t begun. Some students might be holding on to their seats hoping to get a better college or course. A clearer picture will appear in the next 3-4 days,” said Karisidappa, vice-chancellor of Visvesvaraya Technological University. NEET counselling has been delayed as a case over the issue of eligibility criteria for economically weaker sections quota is currently being heard in the Supreme Court. The next hearing is on January 6. Meanwhile, the state government has also urged the Centre to allow them to conduct another round of counselling for engineering after medical counselling is over. There has been no decision on it yet. The Supreme Court had asked the government to complete admissions by December 31. “We are hoping that around 20,000 students will join in the next two-three days. While the state had also asked about the possibility of conducting another round after NEET, the SC hasn’t expressed any views on it. We have proposed to the Centre for another round. We have done our best, but we have to wait and see whether the Centre will give us permission,” said Ramya S, executive director, Karnataka Examination Authority. However, ComedK colleges have seen a slightly better response from students when compared to last year. While last year, 69% of its seats were vacant, this time, only 64% are vacant thus far. Of the 17,407 seats that were available, 11,116 are vacant after the third round of counselling. “In ComedK, students are decisive. They know what course and college they want. So, they would choose it immediately,” said the VTU VC.Sources in ComedK said the all-promotion policy in II PU, as well as lack of cutoff marks in the eligibility criteria enabled a large number of students to apply. “As much as computer science is popular, new-age courses like Artificial Intelligence also pumped up admissions in many colleges this time. With CET becoming very indecisive, many preferred to stay safe by choosing ComedK,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/25k-seats-taken-after-2nd-round-of-cet-counselling/articleshow/88512313.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Former journalist pedals his way to create eco-village rich in arts & crafts||BENGALURU: He’s a cyclist who has entered the Limca Book of Records, a former journalist and a sustainable-living advocate. His bicycle journey of 20,000km that began in 2017 and covered 15 states has now led to creation of an eco-village. Ankit Arora, 32, who hails from Rajasthan, built Innisfree Farm — a community village where anyone can live, grow their own food organically and pursue arts and crafts — in Tamil Nadu’s Krishnagiri district, about 90km from Bengaluru. (Photo: Chethan Kumar)It all began when Arora entered Limca Book of Records and India Book of Records in 2016 for covering the 700km Golden Triangle — connecting Delhi, Agra and Jaipur — without a break in just 69 hours. Encouraged by this, he decided to cycle across India. He met rural and tribal communities, learnt their practices and even mastered handicrafts, sustainable alternatives for building homes, and farming. Four years later, he began putting these learnings into action and built the village. Arora says he learnt to make wooden sculptures in Maharashtra and Bengaluru, mud houses in a remote hamlet of Anantapur district and Nagpur, coconut shell cutlery and jewellery in Tamil Nadu, natural farming and forest conservation from various tribal communities, and Kondapalli toys and musical instruments in Andhra Pradesh. “I learnt to make houses with three types of mud with natural binding agents such as jaggery, honey, sugarcane fibre and egg yolk. I also stayed with a team of Archaeological Survey of India experts in Maharashtra who were reviving an eighth-century temple. There I saw urad dal being used as a good adhesive,” he says. Having gained some attention on Instagram, he is often invited for talks and has had a chance to meet several celebrities, including cricketers and music directors. But it was a meeting with Sreedevi Balasubramanian and her husband Colonel L Balasubramanian from Bengaluru that eventually kicked off the village project. The Balasubramanians, who had invited him to their Koramangala home in 2019, went on to join the ambitious project of setting up Innisfree Farm, whose name was inspired by the WB Yeats poem ‘The Lake Isle of Innisfree’. “At the farm, we have two mud houses, two wooden and thatched houses, two dry toilets, one mud sofa and two mega-sized ponds for rainwater harvesting,” Arora says, adding they use recycled wooden, coconut and mud vessels and reuse 100% of their waste to power eco-toilets, kitchens, and even provide fodder for animals. They also grow vegetables such as spinach, tomato, green chilli and okra, and have fruit trees like mango, tamarind and jackfruit. While saying volunteers who wish to learn more are welcome to visit, Arora makes it clear it is not a homestay. They also train people in traditional arts such as Madhubani, Gond, Pichwai, and wall paintings. In fact, Arora recently helped a community of single mothers in Belagavi earn a livelihood by teaching them how to make handicrafts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/former-journalist-pedals-his-way-to-create-eco-village-rich-in-arts-crafts/articleshow/88512314.cms||Farheen Hussain

Responding to a TOI report on National Highways Authority of India deciding to foreclose four highway projects in Tamil Nadu due to issues like inability to procure soil for earthwork and delay in land acquisition, E V Velu said in a statement on Sunday that permission was granted for contractors to excavate soil for the road work, but they were unable to proceed because of heavy rainfall He said review meetings were held with district collectors in October and instructions were issued to expedite land acquisition for the road projects.TOI had reported that two projects of four-laning from Tamil Nadu-Kerala Border to Kanyakumari, and two projects of six-laning from Sriperumbudur to Walajapet have been listed for foreclosure. Contractors are unable to dig soil for the earthwork in Kanyakumari district, bringing all plans to a halt, the report said. The developers were also waiting for statutory clearances from various state government departments for months.Velu said that after the DMK formed government in Tamil Nadu, meetings were held with district collectors and permissions were being granted for soil excavation for road works. “At a meeting chaired by the chief secretary on August 13, collectors were asked to grant permission for soil excavation. They were told to pay special attention and expedite land acquisition for the road work,” Velu said.On September 12 Velu wrote to ministers of revenue, forest, electricity and mines departments to grant permissions sought by NHAI for uninterrupted road works. Once again, on October 10, collectors of respective districts where road projects were underway were sought to clear the blocks and grant permissions for the highway works. Velu said so far six review meetings have been held to discuss highway projects and several permissions were granted. Velu said during a meeting chaired by him on December 16, contractors had said that permission for soil excavation had been obtained, but they were unable to go ahead because water bodies were brimming due to the recent rain.They were told to identify alternative spots for soil excavation and that permission would be granted for excavation there. District collectors were asked to give permission once the contractors submit a letter in this regard, the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-minister-says-hurdles-to-national-highway-projects-are-being-removed/articleshow/88512315.cms||---

He asked the DMK government to come clean and explain the status on NEET to students. Until Tamil Nadu is exempted, the government should expedite conducting of special training for students to clear NEET, said Palaniswami. He urged the students to have fighting spirit and not to succumb to unwanted pressure and end their lives, while pointing out to the two deaths of students recently in Nilgiris and Thanjavur districts. “Whether in opposition in the run up to the assembly election or after coming to power, the DMK had created a false hope among students that NEET will be abolished. The politicisation of NEET by the DMK is the cause for the heartburn among students,” he said in a statement. Palaniswami said the earlier AIADMK government had ensured that even students from government schools can get into medical colleges, by reserving 7.5% of the medical seats for them. The move was appreciated by the parents of such students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/eps-slams-dmk-for-politicising-neet-exam/articleshow/88512316.cms||---

It is a service road used as a second entrance to the station on its southern side and is used by more than 50,000 people to reach the station from Sriperumbudur-Poonamallee High Road junction and densely populated areas like Manavalanagar. Following representations from the people, railways recently started the work to pave the 300-metre road. The road used to become waterlogged after rain, inconveniencing several people. Sources said that repairs were taken up a few days back but could not proceed after the GRP objected saying that the land belonged to them. Black topping work was about to start. "The contention is that the width of the land which GRP has received will reduce if the road is paved. But railways have promised to offer them land in an alternative site because the road will have to be repaired because it is an entry to the station. Railways has urged the GRP to allow the work," said an official. The Consumer Federation of Tiruvallur has given a petition to Tiruvallur MLA V G Rajendran urging him to intervene and ensure that the road could be repaired. K Baskar, a frequent commuter, said that people who work in factories walk to the railway station along the path after getting dropped by buses on Sriperumbudur-Poonamallee High Road junction. "There are many residential areas on the southern side of the station," he added. A GRP official said that the state government has allotted land for building quarters in that area where the road is located. “There have been some changes in the land when the platform was extended. We have approached for resurvey,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/grp-objection-to-road-repair-near-station-leaves-commuters-in-a-fix/articleshow/88512318.cms||---

Accordingly, the government employee, V Balasubramanian, was subjected to a clinical examination and psychological assessment and the report from IMH held that Balasubramanian is able to understand the details of the charges against him and has adequate cognitive functions (thinking, memory and problem solving abilities). Citing the report, the court held that the petitioner was fit to stand trial and the prosecution had a prima facie case to proceed against him and dismissed his petition to drop charges against him. The accused, after being terminated from service, had appealed twice before the high court and after both appeals were dismissed, he had sent a letter to the Chief Justice of the Madras high court to provide him a job along with 10,000 bribe to give him a favourable order. Based on a complaint from the registrar of the Madras high court, a FIR was registered by the Central Crime Branch and he was arrested. Police filed the report and the special court had taken cognizance of the report on November 11, 2020. When the case was taken up for trial, the accused appeared before the court and raised various grounds to discharge him from the case and one such ground was that he had been suffering from mental illness between 2012 and 2014 and he is continuing psychiatric treatment for the same till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/court-junks-plea-by-govt-employee-who-tried-to-bribe-hc/articleshow/88512320.cms||Srikkanth D

Meetings have been held even on festive holidays and officials have been holding meetings with the committee members to explain local-level problems in 561 locations which have faced water logging issues during the November-December rains in the city. “The state government is keen on taking up drainage work on priority basis in these 561 locations,” said an official. Meanwhile, the corporation has issued work orders for the construction of missing link storm water drain project which will include construction of 45-km of drains in 144 locations in areas such as Tondiarpet, Royapuram, Thiru Vi Ka Nagar, Anna Nagar, Teynampet, Kodambakkam and Adyar zones. The project has been funded by the World Bank. Residents have demanded that the civic body makes maps and gradient levels of these drains public. Jayaram Venkatesan of Arappor Iyakkam said that only if they make network maps and drain gradients public, residents can monitor the implementation of the work.

---||Chennai||Chennai: Adyar riverbank continues to be garbage dump, says NGT panel||CHENNAI: Dumping of solid municipal waste along the banks of the Adyar river in the city’s western suburbs continues unabated, according to an inspection report submitted before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) recently.  The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) directed the Kundrathur Panchayat Union to pay 42 lakh as compensation for polluting the water bodies. But the local body has neither paid this amount nor taken adequate steps to streamline the water disposal process.  Burning of garbage in and around Gerugambakkam, Iyyappanthangal and adjacent areas attracted the NGT's attention. A joint-committee was constituted to visit the areas and submit recommendations to put an end to these violations.  This committee after an inspection in July recommended that the local body clear the accumulated waste near Gerugambakkam, install a micro composting centre (MCC) and a pyrolator for solid waste magnetic decomposition). During the hearing of the case on December 17, the committee told the tribunal that unsegregated waste was dumped at the same site, the micro composting centre was not functioning and a pyrolator was yet to be installed.  At Iyyappanthangal, the committee said, the process of clearing accumulated waste was incomplete and not enough steps were taken to prevent fresh dumping of waste along catchment areas of the Porur lake. The local body, which had shifted a portion of the accumulated waste to the Kodungaiyur dump yard, attributed pending work to heavy rain and water stagnation in the area.  Besides this, the committee noted, the authorities had installed only two pillars without any sort of barricades or fencing to stop miscreants from dumping waste. TOI had written about such violations in its news reports in October and more recently in December.  Since the local body has not paid the environmental compensation too, the NGT Southern Zone directed the TNPCB to conduct a separate inspection and submit its report and identify persons responsible for this.  The director of the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department has also been asked to submit further reports before the next hearing of the case, which is scheduled on December 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/adyar-riverbank-continues-to-be-garbage-dump-says-ngt-panel/articleshow/88512323.cms||Ram Sundaram

It also asked colleges to avoid cultural events and functions involving crowding of students and to encourage the use of disposable plates in hostels and canteens. However, city colleges said it will be difficult to follow social distancing while conducting physical classes. “It is difficult to maintain social distancing in normal mode with students attending physical classes six days a week. If colleges are allowed to conduct classes in dual mode, we will be able to maintain social distancing,” said Madras Christian College principal Paul Wilson. He said colleges will space out the offline exams if cases increase. DG Vaishnav College principal S Santhosh Baboo said most of the students above 18 years were vaccinated. “If vaccination is allowed for those below 18 years after January 3, we will ask all our first year students to take the jab. Then our campus will be fully vaccinated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/civic-body-wants-colleges-to-enforce-social-distancing/articleshow/88512325.cms||---

---||Chennai||Art4good: Slaying stereotypes about mental illness with imagery||CHENNAI: A picture is worth a thousand words, it’s said. Images can influence attitudes, and help form perceptions. And when it comes to mental health, visual representations can have a huge impact on how people with mental health issues are perceived. That’s why Suicide Prevention India Foundation (SPIF), in partnership with Wikimedia Foundation, recently launched art4good, an initiative that invites professional artists, photographers, students, and amateurs to create the world’s largest repository of mental health-related imagery. Selected images will then be made available as an online resource that can be downloaded for free. “Mental health has become an important topic of discussion after the pandemic but most narratives are bereft of images or infographics. art4good will generate imagery across many themes that will complement and drive the conversation around text-based narratives forward,” says Nelson Vinod Moses, founder and director of SPIF, who was inspired to start the initiative as he felt that most images used in mainstream media, social media, and even those used by researchers or organizations campaigning for mental health often end up causing more harm than good. “Mainstream narratives frequently portray negative stereotypes about mental illness, while falsely representing, trivialising, and stigmatizing mental illness and persons with mental illness,” says Nelson. “But it can be used for the good. Mental health and people living with mental illnesses, when represented in the right manner, can change the way the general public perceives them, bring greater understanding, pave the way for stigma reduction, and increase the number of people who seek help.” Research has shown the impact images can have on people. An online experiment of 162 American adults, conducted by two researchers from the University of Nebraska Omaha in 2021, concluded that visual narratives, whether with photo or animation, produced more anti-stigma effects than text-only narratives In another study, ‘Laughing at one’s self: A study of self-reflective internet memes’ in 2019 by researchers from Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta, Indonesia, which focused on students, 47% participants said that internet memes made them laugh and helped ease symptoms caused by anxiety and depression. Psychiatrist Dr N Rangarajan says that visuals are powerful and have a great impact on people. “There are people who are disturbed by news reports of suicide, and we see copycat suicides. Even well-meaning movies or tele serials that show the mental anguish of a person who then dies by suicide can be triggering to people,” he says. Negative portrayal of people living with mental illnesses can impair their self-esteem, reduce help-seeking behaviours, meddle with medication adherence and overall recovery, says Nelson. art4good has identified 10 themes self-care, care-giving, reduce stigma around mental health, speak up, don’t bottle your emotions, digitally connected, socially isolated, work-life balance, your life matters, help-seeking, protective factors (who or what are my safety nets?), and neurodivergent (we maybe different but same) – around which participants can conceptualise their work. “We looked at some of the most commonly accessed topics on Wikipedia and identified topics that will attract creators. We also thought through topics and themes that are broad-based, commonly addressed, and will need images to bolster the content,” says Nelson, adding that participants can also choose their themes. “We accept all images that follow the proper guidelines and it will be made available on Wikipedia Commons. But we won’t accept images that are triggering, misrepresent mental illnesses and persons with mental illness, stereotype, stigmatize and misinform.” Since it is a year-long campaign, creators can keep sending in images. “We will send them an email if the images are accepted on Wikimedia Commons. The creators continue to own rights to the images but they will be freely accessible on Wikimedia Commons for distribution under CC-BY-SA 4.0 license,” says Nelson. Rangarajan says that the images need to be carefully whetted. “The people who approve of these should be aware of sensitivities of people,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/art4good-slaying-stereotypes-about-mental-illness-with-imagery/articleshow/88512331.cms||Priya Menon

This is expected to decongest the stretch to a significant extent. NHAI officials said the wall was built in 2012 as part of the Chennai Port-Maduravoyal corridor project. While the project never took off, the 10-feet-high wall remained horizontally placed in the middle of the road causing snarls on either side. “With the layout of the port-corridor project being changed, we no more require the abutment wall. We have demolished about 50% of it and the remaining will be demolished by the weekend,” said an NHAI official. TOI last week had highlighted how the congestion at the junction caused bottlenecks, leading to nearly four ambulances heading towards Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital (KMCH) getting stuck there. This had also caused a stoppage time of 4-6 minutes. In addition to causing bottlenecks, the abutment wall also was a blind-spot structure that led to accidents. The NHAI had attempted to remove the structure earlier this year but could not do so because of the wall’s rigidity. On Sunday, officials began the work of bringing it down using high-power drilling machines. Officials, however, were sceptical about how much this would help reduce traffic on the stretch. “The vehicle capacity on the stretch is much higher than the road’s capacity. We have to wait and see how much this will reduce the bottlenecks," the official added. Meanwhile, as per the new proposal, the alignment of the double-decker elevated Port-Maduravoyal corridor is likely to go along the Cooum River. The Detailed Project Report for this long pending project is also expected to be completed soon. The corridor will be exclusive only for the container vehicles heading to the ports and ambulances are also expected to be allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/relief-as-nhai-begins-removing-abutment-wall-at-maduravoyal/articleshow/88512333.cms||Omjasvin M D

---||Chennai||Cop who ran car over elderly man in Chennai booked||CHENNAI: A police constable driving a friend’s car ran over an elderly man sitting outside his house at Virugambakkam on Sunday evening, killing him on the spot. A test found that the constable, Ranjith Kumar, 32, of Alwarthirunagar was not drunk at the time. The Pondy Bazaar traffic investigation wing booked him for causing death due to negligence and of rash driving and riding on a public way.  Ranjith Kumar, who was attached to the crime wing at JJ Nagar police station, is currently the gunman of the north zone joint commissioner (traffic). On Sunday, he borrowed a friend’s Toyota Innova and with another friend, 27-year-old Manikandan, he set out to meet a friend. On Devi Karumariamman Koil Street in Virugumbakkam, he lost control of the vehicle when he suddenly swerved to avoid hitting a few children who had rushed out of a temple holding prasadam in their hands. He then crashed into Shankar, 67, who was seated outside his house eating prasadam. Police said it was a narrow street and it was difficult for him to negotiate the stretch. Shankar, who fell down on the ground, died on the spot after sustaining severe head injuries. Several residents of the area, who heard the noise, gathered at the spot and stopped Ranjith Kumar from proceeding further. They tried to bash him up when he told them that he was a policeman. The residents assumed the constable was under the influence of alcohol and alerted police.  A team of the Pondy Bazaar traffic investigation police arrived at the spot and the constable was subjected to a test to find out whether he was drunk. After it was revealed that he was not drunk, he was booked under relevant sections of the IPC and arrested. A witness later told police that Shankar had come out of the temple just five minutes before the accident with the prasadam. Many in the area usually sat outside their houses in the evenings for some fresh air, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cop-who-ran-car-over-elderly-man-booked/articleshow/88512337.cms||---
---||Chennai||Two shops fined 20K for stocking adulterated tea||Chennai: The metropolitan magistrate court in Egmore has levied a penalty of 20,000 on two shops which sold adulterated tea dust. The food safety officer, Anna Nagar, inspected the premises of Relax Cool Bar (a tea and fruit juice shop) in Anna Nagar and asked for its license. The shop owner did not have one. The officer then took samples of tea dust from the shop and sent it to a designated laboratory. Test results showed that the sample was ‘substandard and unsafe’ for public consumption. The results were sent to the proprietor of the shop, who later pleaded guilty. The proprietor gave an undertaking before a court that it adulterated tea dust being used at his shop was his first offence and that he was the sole breadwinner of his family. He also pledged not to use unsafe products again. The tenth metropolitan magistrate, S Lakshmi, after perusing his submissions observed that no health injury or harm to the public was reported and that the proprietor had bought the tea dust from an open market in bulk, without realising that it was of a poor quality. Considering his economic situation, the court imposed a penalty of 20,000 on him. In another case, the food safety officer found adulterated tea dust in a store in Kilpauk, during an inspection. The proprietor of the shop accepted his offence and told the court that he was not aware that the tea was adulterated and that he had shut down his business and is currently an auto driver. The magistrate imposed a fine of 20,000 on him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/two-shops-fined-20k-for-stocking-adulterated-tea/articleshow/88512339.cms||---

---||Chennai||Lights go out on Tamil Nadu||Chennai: Himachal Pradesh’s opener Shubham Arora (136 n.o., 13x4, 1x6) is featuring in his maiden domestic season. But the 24-year-old’s maturity helped his side defeating Tamil Nadu by 11 runs by the VJD method to win the Vijay Hazare Trophy in Jaipur on Sunday. This was Himachal’s maiden domestic title.Shubham’s 131-ball essay overshadowed the seasoned Dinesh Karthik’s equally brilliant 116 that saw Tamil Nadu finish on 314. The loss meant that Tamil Nadu couldn’t complete the limited-overs double after winning the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy for the national T20 tournament last month.On Sunday, with Rajasthan needing 15 off 15 balls and Shubham and captain Rishi Dhawan well entrenched, the light deteriorated so much that the umpires had to call off play. In fact, the light was consistently falling for the last 15 overs and Rajasthan were always ahead in the VJD method. Tamil Nadu, too, couldn’t bring their medium-pacers back at the back-end because the light was not good enough for pacers to bowl. It made the job of Shubham and Dhawan easier. Dhawan (3-62) had earlier used the early morning moisture to take a couple of wickets that had put brakes on TN batting at the beginning. Shubham began his innings by adding 60 for the opening wicket along with Prashant Chopra (21, 2x4). With No. 3 Digvijay Rangi (0) and Nikhil Gangta (18) not lasting long, Shubham got the chase back on track with Amit Kumar (74, 6x4). By the time Amit was dismissed, Himachal were 244 for 4. Dhawan (42 n.o) then added 55 runs which placed Himachal on 299-4 in 47.3 overs when bad light stopped play. The first half of the contest belonged to Karthik and B Indrajith (80, 8x4, 1x6). The two added 202 runs for the fifth wicket in 167 balls to give impetus to Tamil Nadu’s innings. After the two got out, M Shahrukh Khan’s quickfire 21-ball 42 helped them go past 300. Brief scores: Tamil Nadu 314 in 49. 4 overs (Dinesh Karthik 116, B Indrajith 80; P Jaswal 4-59, R Dhawan 3-62). Himachal Pradesh 299-4 in 47.3 overs (Shubham Arora 136, Amit Kumar 74, R Dhawan 42 n.o.). Himachal Pradesh won by 11 runs using VJD method.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/lights-go-out-on-tamil-nadu/articleshow/88512346.cms||Prasad RS

---||India||PM: Self-discipline, collective strength key to beating Covid||NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Sunday emphasised the role of “collective strength” to defeat the coronavirus and its new Omicron variant. In the last episode of his Mann Ki Baat in 2021 and ahead of the New Year, the PM said while scientists are studying the new variant, the “efforts of citizens” and “self-awareness and self-discipline” are very important in the battle against the virus. “Our experience of the past two years is that our own effort as a citizen is very important to defeat this global pandemic. Our scientists are continuously studying this new Omicron variant. They are getting new data every day, their suggestions are being worked upon. In such a situation, self-awareness, self-discipline is in itself the country’s strength in fighting against this variant of Corona (virus),” the PM asserted. “It is this very collective strength of ours that will defeat Corona; with this very sense of responsibility we have to enter into 2022,” he added. The PM also dwelled upon the important role of citizens and community through the pandemic. “It is because of everyone’s effort that India could fight the biggest pandemic in a 100 years. “We stood by each other like a family in every difficult moment. To help someone in one’s locality or city... Everyone tried to do more than what one could have done,” the PM said. Modi went on to highlight that crossing the 140-million vaccine doses mark is an achievement of each and every Indian. This, he said, shows the “trust of every Indian in the system; shows trust in science and in scientists; and is also a testament to the willpower of we Indians who are fulfilling our responsibilities towards the society”. “If we compare the vaccination figures of the world today with those of India, it feels that the country has handled such an unprecedented task... how big a goal has been achieved...,” he added. However, the PM sounded a note of caution asserting that “we also have to keep in mind that a new variant of Corona has already knocked at the door”. He went on to emphasise that besides the scientific interventions, responsible behaviour and and collective strength are critical in the fight ahead. On Saturday, the PM in an address to the nation also spoke of the emergence of the Omicron variant, its implications. He urged people not to panic while asking them to observe Covid protocols like masks and hand sanitisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-self-discipline-collective-strength-key-to-beating-covid/articleshow/88512379.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad 2nd most climate vulnerable city among seven studied by MoEF||AHMEDABAD: Are Amdavadis climate ready? Can our administration or infrastructure withstand natural calamities? Or grapple with rapidly rising city population? It turns out, out of the seven vulnerability factors, examined by the Union ministry of forest and environment-led study on a scale of 3, Ahmedabad among seven cities is the most vulnerable in three aspects — ‘physical factor’ where residents are directly or indirectly exposed to sudden weather effects, ‘hazard factor’ where a city’s geographical location makes it vulnerable to more frequent calamities, ‘demographic factor’ which is a vulnerability factor based on population density. The study, one of the first of its kinds, evaluates seven cities, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Srinagar, Shillong, and Ahmedabad based on varied geographical location, hazard-prone zone, population and size and identifies the Urban Climate Vulnerability Assessment (UCVA) on a scale of 3, which is score rated as ‘most vulnerable’. Ahmedabad scores a ‘3’ on physical, hazard and demographic factors and a 2.67 on the social factor, where a large slum population stays exposed to these calamities with little or no protection. Among the seven factors that were examined were financial provision, infrastructure and administration and governance apart from the four mentioned above. While elaborating on the three most vulnerable aspects for Ahmedabad, the study, ‘Assessment of Climate Hazard Vulnerability of Selected Indian Cities’ claims that the vulnerabilities in Ahmedabad were largely because of the 2010 heatwave which killed many in the city and affected more than 20% of the population. The city experiences at least two episodes of climate hazards in a year where the demographic rise in migrant population is 5% to 10% annually. The study was conducted by a team of experts Rohit Magotra, Professor Ajit Tyagi and Yashi Sharma. However, when it comes to ‘financial provisioning’, infrastructure readiness and administration and governance the city scores anywhere between 1 and 1.53 on the scale of 3. “The overall vulnerability score for Ahmedabad for all the seven factors is 2.12 and ranks second after Sirinagar (2.42). Bangalore (2.12) shares the same rank as Ahmedabad,” according to the MoEF study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abad-2nd-most-climate-vulnerable-city-among-seven-studied-by-moef/articleshow/88510846.cms||Paul John

With just a week left for the exercise to begin from January 3, the health officials have started doing groundwork though the Centre’s detailed guideline with regard to vaccination of children is still awaited. Health department special secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh said around 75 lakh children would fall in the category of 15-18 years in the state. “According to a data released in 2002, nearly 28 lakh children are born per year in the state. Excluding some cases of newborn deaths, we expect the number of children in the age group of 15-18 years to be around 75 lakh,” Singh added. Asked whether the beneficiaries among women would also be inoculated at the educational institutions, Singh said, “We are awaiting the Centre’s detailed guideline. Once everything is clear, the plan will be made accordingly. Vaccination can be arranged at schools or even at home. We have sufficient vaccine doses to inoculate eligible children,” he added. Though PM Modi announced vaccination of teenagers above 15 years, Bharat Biotech had sought approval for emergency use of vaccine for children in the age group of 12 to 18 years. “We are waiting for a clear instruction in this regard from the Centre,” said a senior doctor. In Bihar, clinical trial of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin had been done on nearly 200 children in the age group of 2-18 years at AIIMS-Patna. Covid-19 nodal incharge at AAIMS-P, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, said all the children who participated in the trial were completely fine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/enough-vaccine-stock-to-inoculate-kids-govt/articleshow/88510423.cms||Sheezan Nezami

PU development officer P K Khan told this newspaper here on Sunday that the admission ordinance and examination regulations of all these courses would be placed at the next meeting of the university senate scheduled to be held on January 18. After senate’s approval, the same would be sent to the Raj Bhavan for obtaining the chancellor’s assent. “The ordinance and regulations of as many as 16 subjects at undergraduate level have already been drafted and those of the remaining 16 subjects are likely to be drafted by the subject expert committees soon,” Khan said. PU vice-chancellor (VC) G K Chaudhary has convened a meeting of the heads of concerned departments on January 3 to review the situation and take necessary action. Earlier, the VC had constituted a six-member committee headed by Vanijya Mahavidyalaya principal N K Jha to formulate admission ordinance and examination regulations for the UG courses under CBCS pattern in the light of the UGC guidelines. Other members of the committee are Shankar Kumar (physics), Rakesh Ranjan (political science), Siddharth Bhardwaj (economics), Shekhar (geology), and Shobhan Chakraborty (English). As early as in 2019, the chancellor’s secretariat had announced that the CBCS would be introduced at the undergraduate stage in all the colleges from the next session (2020-21) and had even started framing uniform ordinance and regulations of CBCS. It had also initiated steps for getting the syllabi of UG courses revised as per the new CBCS system. However, the same did not materialize owing to the pandemic. “PU had implemented CBCS at the postgraduate stage from the session 2018-19 itself, but it could not implement the same at undergraduate level as most colleges were not prepared for it,” Khan said, adding, some self-financing courses of PU running in different colleges have already introduced CBCS from the 2019-20 session. “If the regulations were approved by the chancellor, PU will become the first university in the state to introduce CBCS and semester system at the undergraduate level,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pu-set-to-introduce-cbcs-from-next-academic-session/articleshow/88510333.cms||B K Mishra

Kazi Anirban told TOI that a year-long celebration of the poem has created ripples in Bangladesh, South Korea, the United States and Canada. “My sister Anindita lives in New Jersey and has organized an online event to mark the poem’s centenary. I feel it is significant that Kolkata organized such an event too. My grandfather’s words ring true even in the contemporary context.” The response to Sunday’s rally was “overwhelming”, he said. Members of the Facebook group Purono Kolkatar Golpo, Swarnali Chattopadhya and Jayanta Sen, joined the rally as well. The poet’s granddaughter, Mishti Kazi, came all the way from Bangladesh to attend the rally. Anirban walked down memory lane and remembered the genesis of ‘Bidrohi’ in 1921. Nazrul lived in this Taltala house along with close friend and Communist leader Muzaffar Ahmad. “Muzaffar Ahmad had fallen asleep when my grandfather had started writing this poem with a pencil. Next morning when Muzaffar asked my dadu why he chose to use a pencil, my grandfather had replied saying using a pencil was the best option in case he ran out of ink and lost his emotional tempo,” Anirban said. WBHC chairperson Suvaprasanna remembered meeting the poet. “I have never been to the Taltala house though I had the good fortune of meeting the poet at the Christopher Road house where he used to live with his son, Sabyasachi. I have been to that house on two of his birthdays. I am so happy to see so many people walking to celebrate the poem’s centenary,” he said. ‘Bidrohi’ was first published in the Bijoli little magazine. “As far as I know, nowhere in the world has there ever been such a celebration of a poem’s centenary. This poem is a big example of how a good piece of writing can transcend the barriers of religion, caste and nationalities to inspire people,” Suvaprasanna said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/150-admirers-including-kin-walk-to-celebrate-100-years-of-kazi-nazrul-islams-bidrohi/articleshow/88510827.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh spends Rs 8,000 crore on Covid-19 management||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Covid-19 pandemic posted complex and grim challenges to the state besides placing an unprecedented financial burden. But it also presented a unique opportunity for AP to scale up its health infra and medical care, which will come in handy during future emergencies.  As per the statement made by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy during the recent state-level bankers committee meeting, the state has so far spent about Rs 8,000 crore on multiple interventions for prevention, mitigation and management of the Covid-19. This expenditure was incurred on establishment of labs, testing, procurement of medicines, ventilators, oxygen supply, vaccines, third wave preparation, and other measures. Andhra Pradesh is the first state to include Covid-19 treatment in the list of illnesses covered under its healthcare scheme (Dr YSR Aarogyasri). In the first wave itself, about one lakh patients availed free treatment under Aarogyasri scheme, which cost the exchequer of the state to the tune of Rs 310 crore.  The once-in-a-lifetime pandemic once again proved why the investment on public medical facilities in terms of men, machinery and maintenance is crucial. The rate caps on Covid-19 treatment at the private hospitals did not work in several cases. The health insurance claims were also rejected in many instances.  A few months into the first wave, the doctors started identifying (happy) hypoxia cases in several Covid-19 patients without any obvious symptoms, but leading to a rapid deterioration. Since then, the health department has worked on addressing the gaps in the infrastructure at the government facilities. Right from creating oxygen lines to the beds, the health department recruited thousands of medical personnel to meet the patient care needs at the brimming hospitals. The entire second wave revolved around oxygen management. Medical oxygen became a scarce commodity as several patients died due to inadequate oxygen supply at the peak of the second wave. In view of these experiences, the state government is now spending around Rs 400 crore to set up 144 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen generation plants and to create related infrastructure. State has lined up a higher number of hospitals and oxygen/ICU beds compared to the first and second waves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-spends-rs-8000-crore-on-covid-19-management/articleshow/88510228.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pvt hospitals with 45L unused shots hope booster clears stock||MUMBAI: Sitting on a stockpile of almost 45 lakh unsold Covid-19 vaccine doses, private hospitals in Maharashtra are heaving a sigh of relief with the announcement of rollout of booster shot and vaccination for children from January. Hopeful of finding takers for their unused doses, most are closely tracking the developments on which vaccine would be approved for booster. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Saturday that ‘precaution doses’ (boosters) for health and frontline workers as well as those above 60 with co-morbidities will begin from January 10. While vaccination for children aged 15-18 will begin on January 3 using Covaxin, the details of which vaccine would be used for booster and after what interval following the second dose is yet to be made public.  Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), said that as per the last available information, private facilities had more than 45 lakh doses. State as well as BMC data, however, shows that a majority of the stock lying with hospitals is that of Covishield, followed by Covaxin and Sputnik. The BMC had asked private hospitals to declare their stocks about a month ago. About 30-odd hospitals responded to the corporation. The data gathered showed that they had around 7 lakh doses of Covishield and nearly 40,000 doses of Covaxin, and less than 5,000 doses of Sputnik. However, speculation is that Covishield or Covaxin are unlikely to be used as boosters. Epidemiologist Dr Chandrakant Lahariya said that there is a good possibility that Covovax could be used as a booster shot. “Globally, mRNA vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna have been used as boosters mainly, but since we don’t have those, Covovax is likely to be the candidate,” he said. While those holding Covishield are still worried, private hospitals with stocks of Covaxin are hopeful of findings takers once vaccination for children begins. Covaxin and Zycov-D are two vaccines that have received approval for children. Joy Chakraborty, COO of PD Hinduja Hospital, said that the booster announcement has come as a relief to some. “Some hospitals had vaccines which were expiring in November and December, so the news didn’t help them. But for most others, the expiry is between February and May,” he said. “We are waiting to see what vaccines are recommended as booster and what schedule is announced for children,” he said.  Dr Sachin Desai, state immunisation officer, said that there may be some spurt in demand as more people become eligible for second doses. “Due to the 84-day gap, many are not able to take second shots across districts,” he said. Private hospitals, however, may never see the demand it did in June this year, said Dr Prince Surana, CEO of Surana hospitals. “Public sector is now flush with doses, so that crisis will never arise again,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pvt-hosps-with-45l-unused-shots-hope-booster-clears-stock/articleshow/88511438.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Business||Biz fundamentals are intact, have RBI support: RBL Bank||MUMBAI: RBL Bank on Sunday said its business fundamentals were intact after RBI placed an additional director on its board on the same day its MD & CEO Vishwavir Ahuja went on medical leave. Seeking to clear the air after executive director Rajeev Ahuja was designated CEO, which coincided with the appointment of RBI chief general manager Yogesh Dayal as an additional director, the private lender said it had full regulatory backing. “I want to reiterate that this transition, our strategy and our business has full support from the RBI. These developments are not in any manner, reflections on our performance,” Rajeev Ahuja said. The bank had a call with newspersons and later with analysts, where Rajeev said the developments were not on account of any concern or advances, asset quality or deposit levels of the bank. Vishwavir had proceeded on leave six months before his term ended even as the bank was searching for his successor. While a search committee will look for suitable candidates, Rajeev is seen to be one of the contenders for the job. During the press conference, the interim CEO said that the bank had learnt its lesson after it had to battle rumours about its financial health in the wake of the Yes Bank crisis in 2019. Since then, the bank has raised over Rs 1,500 crore and has Rs 15,000 crore of liquidity besides having strong capital adequacy of 16.3%. “We are in the process of bullet-proofing our balance sheet,” he said. Rajeev also squashed speculation of governance issues. Responding to a query on whether he was aware of any regulatory inquiries with respect to governance, he said that there were none as far as he knew, and he did not think there was any such inquiry. RBI sources also said that too much should not be read into the appointments and they were not comparable to earlier moves at Yes Bank or Lakshmi Vilas Bank. Gopal Jain, managing partner, Gaja Capital, which owns a 2.1% stake in the bank, said: “We are supportive of the new leadership at RBL Bank. Rajeev Ahuja is one of the original and principal architects of the new RBL bank strategy since 2010 having been part of the journey since day one. We are confident that under his leadership RBL will continue to progress towards its objective of creating India’s leading digitally enabled banking franchise”. On the RBI decision to appoint an additional director, Rajeev said, “The RBI has a wide, broader agenda. The nomination of the RBI person on our board has been reiterated in all our conversations as a measure of strengthening the ongoing process. The RBI, in its wisdom, does appoint additional directors, but in our case, the intention was to provide overall strength to the board and continue the improvement of process and compliance that we have undertaken for the last 6-8 quarters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/biz-fundamentals-are-intact-have-rbi-support-rbl-bank/articleshow/88511639.cms||---
---||Business||RIL, Tatas invest in cancer care startup Karkinos||MUMBAI: Reliance Industries (RIL) and Tata Group have invested in Karkinos Healthcare, an oncology startup led by former Tata Trusts CEO R Venkataramanan. Venkataramanan, who rose from an executive assistant to Ratan Tata to be the CEO of Tata Trusts and later quit the philanthropic organisation amid controversies, was with RIL before establishing Karkinos. RIL through Reliance Digital has acquired a minority stake in Karkinos, while the Tata Group is investing Rs 110 crore in the tech startup. Karkinos didn’t reveal the investment made by RIL. Besides Tata Group, Tata Trusts chairman Ratan Tata is an investor in Karkinos. Tata Group promoter, Tata Trusts, has been sharpening its focus on oncology in recent years and has been ramping up cancer care centres in the country. Set up during the pandemic, Karkinos works with various healthcare institutions in the oncology ecosystem, a statement from the startup said. Apart from Ratan Tata, TVS chairman & Tata Trusts’ trustee Venu Srinivasan, and Infosys co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan have backed Karkinos. The startup also counts UpGrad co-founder Ronnie Screwvala, Paytm founder Vijay Shekar Sharma, and Ola co-founder Bhavish Agarwal as its investors. “We are overwhelmed with the support received from leading business groups and personalities from corporate India. Cancer care continues to be one of the most underserved needs and we are focussed on scaling our presence in relevant parts of the country,” said Karkinos CEO Venkataramanan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-tatas-invest-in-cancer-care-startup-karkinos/articleshow/88511655.cms||---
---||Business||‘Long-term’ key in stocks as bulls run out of breath||The New Year is expected to be an uncertain one for investors as a host of emerging factors — global and domestic — could negatively affect stock prices. On the global front, the US central bank has already said it would end its easy money policy by March and raise interest rate at least thrice before 2022 ends — both thanks to the raging inflation rate, which is at an over three-decade high. Then there are chances of the recent Omicron variant of the coronavirus forcing countries to again opt for lockdowns, impacting markets and economies. On the domestic front, as a result of the US decisions, foreign funds could intensify selling Indian stocks, which could weaken the rupee. Rising inflation, with the wholesale price index at over 14% and food prices showing a growing trend, could also impact the bond as well as the stock markets. “2022 could be the year of consolidation, but will still be a good year for equities. But volatility could be higher than what we experienced in 2021,” said Alchemy Capital Management CEO, director & CIO Hiren Ved. In such a scenario, what should investors do? Investment advisers feel that in uncertain times when volatility could be higher, investors should hold their nerve and not panic. “This is a period that calls for resilience, since investments in the equity markets are for the long term. It is important that investors remember their long-term goals for investing, instead of giving in to the panic,” said Foundation of Independent Financial Advisors (FIFA) chairman Dhruv Mehta. “While market volatility and uncertain times are natural for a short-term period, the bigger picture needs to remain long-term savings.” This bigger picture is possibly a structural bull market in India. “Indian markets have entered a structural bull phase again — supported by strong macros, solid earnings growth and strong exports,” Ved said. On the question of where to invest, Ved feels that the internet, and new age businesses and entrepreneurs may fuel the next leg of the rally over a few years. “But the failure rate (in the internet business space) could be very high too. So, investors will have to be very selective, patient and careful.” Mehta feels that market dynamics are ever-changing, but any temporary dip should not affect one’s long-term financial plan. Also, it is advisable to not read up aggressively on expert opinions and negative insights on the market, which will only cause chaos and confusion. Seeking the guidance of a mutual fund distributor — who will handhold one through the period and offer rational & sound fiscal advice — will also help investors see the bigger picture, remain calm and stay focused on their financial plans and goals, irrespective of the present market situation, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/long-term-key-in-stocks-as-bulls-run-out-of-breath/articleshow/88511607.cms||Partha Sinha

The big cat, a forest department official said, has crossed almost a 3.5km stretch of the river from Herobhanga 5 forest to enter Gopalganj village of Kultali on December 23. “Since then, it has covered almost 15km in four days through villages of Gopalganj, Garankathi — popularly known as the Piyali island — and Dongashora Shekherghat,” said South 24 Parganas forest division DFO Milan Mondal. At its latest location in Dongashora, two villagers were injured on Sunday morning after falling off a tree trying to catch a glimpse of the tiger. An official said the last incident of tiger straying happened in the Piyali island in the late 80s. According to Mondal, the department has laid two trap cages with bait. “We are in the process of readying two machans so we can tranquillize it,” he said. Contrary to reports of two villagers being attacked by the tiger, Mondal made it clear there has been no attack. “There is a thick man-grove cover close to the village where the tiger is hiding now. Two villagers climbed a tree to catch a glimpse of the tiger. When it growled, they fell, injuring themselves,” Mondal said. The area has also been fenced off to protect the villages around it. A forest team led by Mondal and the ADFO is also interacting with villagers to alert them about the situation. Locals also demonstrated in front of foresters on Sunday demanding immediate capture of the tiger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sunderbans-tiger-crosses-3km-river-stretch-to-enter-village-eludes-foresters-for-4-days/articleshow/88510989.cms||---
---||Business||Missing office? Wait to swipe in just got longer||If you were looking forward to going to office regularly in the coming year, you may be disappointed. Most organisations (86%) will continue to follow a hybrid work model in 2022, according to a poll by TOI, which surveyed companies across sectors. Some companies, who are in minority, have expressed hope of returning to the pre-pandemic normalcy. This, however, would depend on the Covid situation easing. All FMCG & IT companies in the poll have adopted the hybrid way of working. Among automobile manufacturers, four out of the six surveyed said they have adopted the hybrid way, reflecting the current realities. Hindustan Unilever, Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki India, Marico, Mondelez and Hyundai are some of the organisations that have transitioned to the hybrid model and would continue to do so in 2022 as well. For others like Nestle India, the hybrid model of working would start from the first quarter of next year. Once PepsiCo India decides to resume office, it will follow a hybrid work model for its office-based staff. “A large majority of our employees find resonance in this model of work and, with employee centricity and flexibility at the core of the business, we shall adhere to work that works for our employees,” said PepsiCo India CHRO Pavitra Singh. Maruti Suzuki India executive board’s member Rajesh Uppal said, “We don’t have a fixed percentage of people who work from home — in some roles 80% people work from home, and in others it is 20-25%. This hybrid model is way more productive and effective and we’ve learnt this structure through the pandemic which we will sustain.” Hyundai Motor India’s current model is a mix of work-from-home and a staggered work (with differentiated work time). The company said it aims to keep work-from-office at an optimum 50:50. It has been working on a futuristic model, which is being done in a co-created way, with workgroups (such as its ‘millennial board’) involving employees and people managers together reimagining ‘work, workplace & people at work’. To ease employees into the change, L’Oreal India has initiated an internal campaign called ‘Reconnection’, so teams learn, and contribute to the new ways of working. Marico has adopted the hybrid work model under ‘ways of work’ design for the long term, with currently 20-25% of its corporate office employees coming in on an alternate week roster model, which the company expects to continue. GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals (GSK Pharma), on the other hand, has launched a policy ‘Performance with choice’ to embrace hybrid flexible working and will apply to all office-based employees effective January 2022. “At GSK, we believe that availing flexibility does not trade off business delivery, rather it acts as a catalyst for enhanced business performance,” GSK Pharma EVP (HR) Chinmay Sharma said. TVS Motor Company uses flexible attendance rosters where some functions are categorised under alternate week patterns, while others have alternate days. The company said its investments in building robust digital infrastructure have helped find a suitable long-term operating model for a more balanced hybrid approach for the future. A Hero MotoCorp spokesperson, however, said the company, which regularly monitors the dynamic situation, will take a call on future work models towards the end of January 2022. Mahindra & Mahindra said it will evaluate the situation and return to office fully only when it is safe to do so. On whether the company hopes to return to the pre-pandemic work style of 100% attendance in office, a spokesperson said, “We hope that will be the case.” Among IT companies, TCS said it is committed to the 25x25 model — no more than 25% of the employees will need to work from the office at any given point, and an employee will not need to spend more than 25% of their time in office — by 2025. At present, less than 10% of its associates are working from offices. Cisco too has moved to a hybrid way of working. At Infosys, right now physical attendance is on a voluntary basis. Infosys executive VP & head HR, Richard Lobo, said, “Over a period, if the situation stays stable, infection rates are low, and vaccination is higher, we will probably have a larger percentage of our workforce returning. But we expect to operate in a hybrid mode for most of the coming year.” Crisil has rolled out a calibrated return-to-office plan starting December 1, 2021, and the phase-1 (first 6-8 weeks) allows vaccinated employees to voluntarily come to office, using their personal vehicle, which will use about 20% of office capacity. Crisil president (HR) Anupam Kaura said, “Assuming we continue to see low infection rates despite Omicron or a potential third wave, we would expect a phase-2 with an up to 35-40% office capacity being used, starting February 2022, and the rest continue to work from home. Eventually, by April-May 2022, we expect to scale up office capacity utilisation up to 70% in phase-3.” Among retail companies, Metro Cash & Carry India reopened its corporate office in September on a roster basis for fully vaccinated employees. “From January 2022, we are opening office in full capacity for all fully vaccinated employees, which is close to 90% of our workforce,” said Metro Cash & Carry India MD Arvind Mediratta. At Puma India, too, where offices have opened up in the past few months, the company sees employees looking to get back to normalcy in how they work. “We do believe that people find positive energies and good vibes when they come together, and it has a great impact on employee morale, teamwork, and business. As a working model, we have opened our offices and are welcoming people back. However, we are cognisant of the situation around, are constantly monitoring the developments, and allow people flexibility in terms of how they would prefer to work,” said Puma India head (people & organisation) Manisha Agarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/missing-office-wait-to-swipe-in-just-got-longer/articleshow/88511583.cms||---
---||Business||E-pharmacies, medtech to help cut health expenses||Vaccines, medicines and diagnostics — all key ammunition to fight the raging pandemic — will be in the spotlight in 2022. Additionally, acceleration in digital transformation, healthcare innovation, telemedicine and a focus on preventive care will also be core themes. The pace of this change will accelerate through 2022 as e-pharmacies, telemedicine, video consult, wearables and virtual care witness huge growth, bringing savings & convenience for consumers. The sector will continue to be red hot, with a spate of private equity deals expected in active pharmaceutical deals (raw materials) and formulations, while medtech, health tech and diagnostics will be chased by startups and investors, says PwC India partner & pharma leader Sujay Shetty. Analysts say these trends will continue to drive R&D, investment and value creation, with the domestic pharma market expected to touch $130 billion by 2030 — a nearly threefold growth from $45 billion this year. Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance secretary general Sudarshan Jain says, “Covid is the biggest humanitarian challenge the world is facing today. It has brought healthcare centre stage and also the role of global cooperation and coordination. The integrated approach focused on vaccines, therapeutics, testing and Covid-appropriate behaviour will be critical to meet this challenge.” With the threat of mutant strains emerging, the focus will be on getting as many people vaccinated as possible, and to address the massive vaccine inequity globally. This presents an opportunity for contract manufacturing, R&D and innovation for domestic companies. The pandemic has created unprecedented disruption in the health ecosystem, highlighting the urgency to augment healthcare infrastructure, and discover partnerships and spur innovation. As healthcare innovation is set to accelerate, the industry is likely to become more personalised, more focused on preventative care and more digital. Wearables, telemedicine and gene-editing are other areas that may attract investments. “Since 2020, we have seen the SARS-COV-2 virus go through various mutations and still pose a threat to the health and safety of people across the world. Multiple mutations like the ones we are seeing in the Omicron variant may lead to re-infections in those already infected or, in some cases, even breakthrough infections. Omicron, labelled as a ‘variant of concern’ by the WHO, has already caused a surge in cases across the world. So, the threat still looms large and public health action will need to continue. The Indian pharma industry and the healthcare fraternity at large, which has been playing a critical role so far, will continue to lead the fight. From vaccines to developing a cure, supplying all possible resources and essential medicines to fight the pandemic, the industry has the capabilities to fight the challenge ahead,” says Zydus Cadila managing director Sharvil Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/e-pharmacies-medtech-to-help-cut-health-expenses/articleshow/88511598.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

The girl was produced before a local court where his statement was recorded on Sunday. She was later sent to the sadar hospital for medical examination. The accused, Parvez Khan (38), has been booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The FIR against Khan, father of five kids, was lodged with Bairgania police station. He is a resident of Dhakarkha village and had won the panchayat election recently. Layeeq Ahmed, SHO (incharge) of Bairgania police station said girl’s family alleged that she forcibly sexually abused for months by the accused, who threatened to kill her if she revealed the matter to anyone. “On December 24, Khan forcibly entered the girl’s house when she was alone and sexually assaulted her. When her parents returned home, they opposed the act of the ward member. Khan then had a scuffle with the girl’s parents. As locals gathered at the house, he fled,” the SHO added. Ahmed said in her written statement, the girl alleged that Khan had earlier raped her on November 3. “To stop pregnancy, Khan used to give contraceptive pills to the girl,” he said, adding raids were on to arrest the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/panchayat-member-accused-of-raping-16-year-old-girl/articleshow/88510396.cms||Faryal Rumi

It also demanded action against the caller who had abused Tiwari by taking umbrage over his statement on Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. Tiwari said he had got a call from an unknown number and the caller started abusing, his dead mother and other family members. “I had given my views on Savarkar to a media outlet. It has been written in books that Savarkar considered cows to be a useful animals, but was against giving it the stature of a mother,” Tiwari said in a written statement. He expressed concern over the way a section of people was spewing venom and “hampering the unity of the country”. He mentioned about the recent event in Haridwar in which a call for genocide of Muslims was allegedly made. “I am the victim of such hatred,” Tiwari said. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said the police should take such matters seriously and take strict action against the guilty. “These episodes will hamper the democracy of the country if not controlled immediately,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-abuses-shivanand-over-phone-rjd-fumes/articleshow/88510418.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Kolkata||Kolkata cops tweak New Year crowd-control plan||KOLKATA: Cops will take a cue out of Kolkata Police’s efficient crowd management protocol during Durga Puja to control traffic and pedestrians at Park Street on New Year’s Eve. The huge crowd at Park Street, Alipore zoo and other city hot spots on Christmas Eve and Christmas prompted cops to redraw their crowd management plan for the next weekend when a larger crowd is expected. Officers at the police headquarters hinted at doubling cop presence on the streets. Unlike Christmas when Park Street was made no-entry for traffic after 4.30pm and the area turned into a walking zone, the police will not shut traffic there on New Year’s Eve. Lalbazar also plans to launch a major mask drive. On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, 493 persons were hauled up for not wearing masks, but cops gave up after a while as the offenders numbered in the thousands. Police also cracked down on disorderly conduct, arresting 113 people over the weekend. Cops also slapped 57 drink- driving cases and 3,220 people were prosecuted for traffic violations. The maximum prosecutions and arrests happened in south Kolkata and areas bordering Bypass. The detective department officers also arrested eight persons from Park Street on Christmas and seven persons from the zoo on Sunday for harassing women and creating nuisance near the cages. The crowd at the zoo on Sunday was 70,000 strong. Cops will also continue nakas every night. Though night nakas had been removed for the festive week, they will be back due to the massive rise in drink-driving cases and several instances of nuisance. The traffic-flow plan for the morning will take into account the pressure on Bypass as people travel to Eco Park, Nicco Park and Science City. There will be additional cop presence around the zoo, Victoria Memorial Hall, Park Circus, Exide crossing and Science City. “Vehicles going towards Behala, Alipore and New Alipore may be told to use Red Road and Mayo Road from Esplanade and Dalhousie,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-tweak-new-yr-crowd-control-plan/articleshow/88510801.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

He said a workshop on basic emergency life-saving skill and advance cardiac life support by Dr Swati was organised. Dr Karan Juneja, JDN national secretary from a Gurugram-based hospital, pleaded for equality in seats in MBBS and PG (MD, MS) courses in medical colleges. He said several MBBS passouts remain deprived of opportunity of pursuing PG studies due to the less number of seats. Dr Rohan Krishnan, national president of Federation of All India Medical Association and senior resident (SR) of Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi raised the issue of discrepancy between DNB and PG courses like MD and MS. Dr Shankul Dwivedi from Madhya Pradesh and joint secretary of JDN raised the issue of growing incidents of suicide committed by young doctors. He said examination-related stress, long working hours in hospitals, unhealthy living conditions provided by the institutions and competition with the seniors could be the reasons behind cases of suicide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/young-docs-discuss-future-of-medical-profession-in-country/articleshow/88510374.cms||VK Tripathi

---||Vijayawada||Firm dupes investors through mobile app||A major online scam came to light after customers approached Vijayawada cops on Saturday, citing that they were duped by a company identified as ‘LoveLife – Natural and Health Care’. According to cybercrime police in the city, LoveLife lured customers by offering them high returns on investing in the company’s medical and life saving equipment through their mobile application. Looking to make money during the ongoing pandemic, customers invested amounts ranging from Rs 1,000 to lakhs. Initially, the customers received returns on some small investments they made to check the authenticity of the scheme. But later, they realised they had been cheated after the company did not disburse the returns. Cops said one of the complainants, T V Srinivasa Rao, who works for a private firm, initially invested Rs 1,000 and received a return of Rs 400 from the company. Setting his hopes high, he then spent Rs 30,000 and purchased equipment such as an oxygen cylinder and disinfectant sprayers. After the company stopped disbursing the money, Rao lodged a complaint with the police. Sources said the total scam could be to the tune of Rs 100 crore as over 10 lakh people in Vijayawada alone invested via the mobile application. A case has been registered and further investigation is underway. Cybercrime inspector Kagitha Srinivas said they have received four complaints so far. Cops said they are looking into the financial transactions of the company and trying to identify its representatives. The accused did not set up a brick-and-mortar office and carried out operations online from their homes, cops said, adding that there could be victims from other states, cities and even rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/firm-dupes-investors-through-mobile-app/articleshow/88510494.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Visakhapatnam||Energy saving potential assessed at Rs 10L cr||Visakhapatnam: The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has put the energy-saving investment potential of the country by 2031 at Rs 10.02 lakh crore. The energy saving potential in the industrial sector alone is estimated to be around Rs 5 lakh crore, followed by the transport sector (Rs 2.26 lakh crore) and domestic sector (Rs 1.2 lakh crore). The BEE has designed various strategies to strengthen energy efficiency efforts. This is expected to cost about Rs 4,200 crore to the exchequer of BEE from 2020-21 to 2024-25. These measures are expected to reduce 557 million tonnes of CO2 per annum by 2030. Addressing a webinar with state designated agencies, BEE director general Abhay Bhakre along with deputy director general-BEE Ashok Kumar and director-BEE, Milind Deore, said the transition towards an energy-efficient economy requires a huge capital investment in energy efficient technologies. “I request all state governments to focus on energy efficiency related investments that will help states to boost the economy, improve energy performance in key sectors, create employment and improve the environment. Creating awareness among stakeholders would play a crucial role to reach the goals of energy efficiency in the country,” Bhakre said. The DG-BEE has appreciated Andhra Pradesh energy secretary for his initiative to involve around one crore self-help group women members in energy efficiency activities in a phased manner. This is being done in coordination with society for elimination of rural poverty (SERP), mission for elimination of poverty in municipal areas (MEMPA) and other allied departments. The Andhra Pradesh state energy conservation mission officials explained to the DG-BEE the activities conducted during the energy conservation week. These included an energy conservation rally, webinars on IoT application to MSMEs, awareness sessions on the PAT (perform, achieve, and trade) scheme, etc. The APSECM conducted physical awareness programmes on energy conservation at various colleges and a mega workshop for self-help groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/energy-saving-potential-assessed-at-rs-10l-cr/articleshow/88510505.cms||---

---||Kolkata||A steamer ride through history: KOPT resumes heritage tour on Boxing Day||Kolkata: When Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi returned to India from Durgan in 1896, he had taken the ship SS Pangola to Kolkata. Gandhi had used Kolkata port to make two more journeys, in March 1915 when he went to Rangoon (now Yangon) with wife Kasturba, and in March 1929 when he went to Rangoon again. After his famous speech at the World Parliament of Religion in Chicago session and his three-year stay in the US, Swami Vivekananda, too, had returned to Kolkata in February 1896. He had alighted in Budge Budge then. Around a year later, in January 1898, he was at the Calcutta Jetties, where the Millennium Park now stands, to welcome Sister Nivedita. One year thereafter, the port’s first clock tower was inaugurated in 1899. Mariners entering the Kidderpore Docks and workers at what was then Asia’s largest marine workshop adjusted their timepieces with the Cooke & Kelvey clock. A second tower came up later at King George’s Docks, now known as Netaji Subhas Docks. These are among several interesting anecdotes that a motley group of heritage enthusiasts learnt on Boxing Day as Kolkata Port Trust’s very own raconteur, Gautam Chakraborti, revived the heritage tour — ‘A voyage through tide and time’— that had been introduced in 2018 but was suspended after the Covid outbreak nearly two years ago. “The idea is to offer tourists and Kolkatans a glimpse of the rich history of India’s oldest and only riverine port and how it helped the city grow into a bustling metropolis. It is difficult to visualize today, but a century ago, there would be scores of ships from all over the world anchored in the river between where Howrah bridge and the Second Hooghly Bridge stand,” said Chakraborti, who is also the Kolkata Port’s honorary heritage advisor and coordinator. The tour itinerary began with the Port’s own museum at Fairlie Place, boarding at the World-War famed Man of War Jetty and a steamer ride under the historic Howrah bridge that has recently received an LED makeover on the Port’s 150th official birthday. “The old pontoon bridge connecting Kolkata and Howrah was constructed in 1874. The Howrah bridge was inaugurated on February 3, 1943, right in the middle of World War II. To protect the Victoria Memorial Hall from bombardment by the Japanese Mitsubishi planes, it was painted black. But no such thing was done to the shiny Howrah bridge. It is a miracle that the Japanese did not target the bridge and it escaped unharmed,” said Chakraborti. The Port has plans to take the tour to another level with a rehauled 1942 Paddle Steamer hitting the water next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-steamer-ride-through-history-kopt-resumes-heritage-tour-on-boxing-day/articleshow/88510807.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Most of the shops are not housed in concrete buildings, inviting trouble from wild elephants.In Monombolly forest range, Thaimudi estate reports a greater number of elephant movements as it is the main migratory pathway for wild elephants.“The ration shop at Thaimudi estate supplies commodities to 120-80 families. The wild elephants often damage the ration shop for rice. When there is no rice stock in the shop, the wild elephants enter the tea estate staff quarters in search of ration rice. So, we have decided to set up a container ration shop as a pilot project at the Thaimudi estate soon,” deputy field director of ATR MG Ganesan said.It is estimated that it would cost around Rs 10 lakh to set up the shop in the metal container. “We have to buy a second-hand container where at least 150 bags of rice can be stored. The container will be fixed atop four pillars,” Ganesan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/shipping-container-to-house-pds-shop-in-thaimudi-estate/articleshow/88511446.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Doctors at JJ Hospital fix hole in 2-month-old boy’s heart sans surgery||MUMBAI: Doctors at JJ Hospital gave a new lease of life to a two-month-old boy by fixing a hole in his tiny egg-sized heart non-surgically. While closure of congenital holes without an open heart surgery is common in older children and adults, it is rare in such young babies, the hospital claimed. Born to Rahul (26) and Reshma Rathod (23) of Gulbarga in Karnataka, Kartik couldn’t breathe or sleep well. Every time he tried to breastfeed, his breathlessness would worsen. A series of tests at the Gulbarga hospital where Kartik was born on October 8, found that he had a 6mm hole in the heart, a condition called Ventricular Septal Defect. The hole occurs in the wall that separates right and left pumping chambers of the heart, causing the heart to pump blood from one chamber to other rather than to the body. It leads to exhaustion of heart, low blood supply to body, congestion of blood in the lung, among other complications. Rahul said the hospital could diagnose the condition within three days of his birth, but they didn’t have the expertise to operate. The father, who has been a daily-wage earner in Mumbai for years, decided to return to the city. After a BMC-run hospital also said the baby was “too small” to be operated upon, they approached JJ Hospital. Dr Kalyan Munde, head of cardiology department, said they dec-ided to intervene, but didn’t want an open-heart surgery that could entail complications. “We did a transcatheter procedure, which involved accessing the heart through a major artery of the leg. The catheter is used to carry an umbrella like device, called an occluder, to the defect. Once it reaches there, the device is placed to plug the hole,” he said. The baby’s condition started improving soon after the surgery and is sleeping and eating well now, he added. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-jj-docs-fix-hole-in-2-month-old-boys-heart-sans-surgery/articleshow/88511472.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa expert panel favours strict Covid-19 curbs||PANAJI: After the first case of the Omicron variant of Covid was detected in the state earlier in the day, an expert committee for Covid-19 management recommended that night curfew be imposed if the case positivity rate rises above 3.5%. On Monday, the state’s positivity was nearly 4%. The expert committee has also recommended that travellers be asked to produce RT-PCR negative reports before checking into a hotel. The RT-PCR test should be ideally done 72 hours prior, expert committee member Dr Dhanesh Volvoikar said on Monday. While the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recommends that states have restrictions in place if case positivity rate is 5% or more, Volvoikar said, a 3.5% benchmark should be considered in view of higher infectivity of the Omicron variant. Goa’s daily average of fresh infections has breached the 50-mark since Friday. Volvoikar said that the final decision about night curfew or restrictions to be imposed will be decided by the taskforce committee headed by chief minister Pramod Sawant. The committee is likely to meet on Wednesday. Regarding travellers being asked to submit a RT-PCR negative certificate, the expert committee member said even fully vaccinated people can develop an infection with the Omicron variant. “The committee felt that travellers be asked to produce RT-PCR negative reports irrespective of vaccination,” he said. The expert committee, he said, also discussed about laxed testing at border checkposts. “It is suspected that testing at borders is not being done properly and it needs to be counter checked. We don’t have proof but there is scope to believe that it is happening in a way it should not happen,” Volvoikar said. He said that the expert committee has not made any recommendations for schools, and the members felt that schools and colleges should be permitted to continue with the regime followed by them. Volvoikar also said that if people follow Covid appropriate behaviour, they can enjoy the festival. “The problem arises because people do not follow Covid appropriate behaviour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-expert-panel-favours-strict-curbs/articleshow/88531857.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Revamped Panaji observatory set to reopen today||PANAJI: The wait for students and amateur astronomers to go skygazing at the Panaji public observatory is finally over. The Association of the Friends of Astronomy (AFA) is reopening the observatory on Tuesday evening with added facilities, after months of renovation and delays in restarting operations. “We are now in the 40th year of the AFA, after the observatory was founded on December 26, 1982. This entire year will have 40 different programmes to mark the anniversary year. The observatory will be open to the public from December 28, onwards,” said AFA president, Satish Nayak. The renovated premises now features a cosmic museum that highlights the history of astronomy and space technology, the Aryabhata space library that has a collection of astronomical literature, a tinkering laboratory, a computer laboratory and space for astro-photography and robotics. An 80-seater auditorium has also been set up where film screenings and workshops will be conducted. The kids club and astronomy film club will also start its activities from January onwards. In the next phase of the renovation, a fully automated dome will be ready by February 28 – in time for National Science Day. Here, a 14-inch Celestron telescope will allow stargazers to have a better viewing experience. The dome will also feature simulations of the inside of a spacecraft. “The metal dome is specifically used for sky observation because it blocks 80% of the ambient light. The diameter of the dome is 5.5 metres long located in a square shaped room. This will be the first of its kind in Goa and will work on a mobile app,” Nayak said. Though the proposal for renovation started 10 years ago, the civil works took place only four years ago. The major works were nearing completion 1.5 years ago. However, the pandemic further delayed the process, pushing the inauguration to December this year after contributions from GSIDC, EDC and a few private donors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/revamped-panaji-observatory-set-to-reopen-today/articleshow/88532169.cms||Nida Sayed

Subsequently, other languages were also declared classical.“India is a multi-religious, multi-linguistic, multi-regional and multi-ethnic country. The country doesn’t need uniformity, but it requires unity and one way of preserving unity is respecting all regional languages,” Ramesh said. He stressed upon giving these languages full support by encouraging translations by the Centre.Vishnupuram Literary Circle honoured poet Vikramadhithyan with its Vishnupuram Award for the year 2021.

Home minister Araga Jnanendra, who is piloting The Karnataka Protection of Right to Freedom of Religion Bill, 2021, said, “We will bring the ordinance to the cabinet next week. We are planning to promulgate it in early January after getting the governor’s assent.” However, law minister JC Madhuswamy said the government will consider the timing of the joint session before pushing for the ordinance. However, law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy said it will also consider the timing of the Karnataka joint legislature session before pushing for the ordinance. “We have an option to get the bill passed in the council during the next legislature session — the joint sitting of the assembly and council — in January or February. But if the legislature session is delayed, we will take the option of promulgating an ordinance,” said Madhuswamy. The bill was passed in the assembly by voice vote on December 23. The government tried to get it approved in the council on Friday but was forced to defer it as it did not have the required strength. Social welfare minister and House leader Kota Srinivas Poojari told the House that the government will not seek the House’s consideration for passage as it wants it to take up the bill in the next session. “It is left to the government to decide when it wants to get the bill passed. They can even promulgate an ordinance since the bill has been tabled but not rejected by the council,” said council chairman Basavaraj Horatti. According to parliamentary rules, the government can promulgate an ordinance of the pending bill if it is not rejected in any one of the two houses. But it must get the approval of the legislature for the bill in the immediate next session after promulgating the ordinance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/anti-conversion-bill-karnataka-may-take-ordinance-route/articleshow/88512412.cms||B V Shivashankar

---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Omicron patients resisting hospitalization||VADODARA: With no symptoms or signs of any illness, most persons found carrying the Omicron variant of Covid-19 would be wondering why they were being hospitalized. Out of the 17 Covid-19 cases with the new variant reported in the city, the man from Manjalpur whose genome sequencing reports arrived on Friday night was the only one who had symptoms. Sources said between the day of collection of the sample for the RTPCR Covid-19 test and the arrival of the report of the genome sequencing, around one week passes. In the case of the Manjalpur man, the genome sequencing report came after 24 days. By the time the report comes and the patient is admitted, he may have actually turned Covid-19 negative. This happened in the case of the man from Manjalpur. The family had tested negative on December 17 itself, but another test was conducted on Saturday just because they were infected by the Omicron variant of the virus.  Most Omicron cases have been detected during routine screening or in contact tracing. Also, barring one case, all these cases are from countries that are not classified as ‘at risk’ countries. Health teams of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) are facing resistance from the patients when they reach to hospitalize them. Sources said that the person who had tested positive for Omicron has to be compulsorily hospitalized as per guidelines. “The patients are not willing to go to a hospital. We have to tell them that we may have to call the police or take other measures if they do not comply,” said an official. “We are following the guidelines that are relayed to us. Many patients who have tested Omicron positive will be discharged soon as soon as they test negative,” said medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel. He added that two consecutive negative tests were needed to discharge such patients. Infectious diseases expert Dr Hiten Kareliya said that in cases where aggressive treatment was not needed, the hospitals could be spared. “The hospital staff need not get exposed. If needed, isolation facilities can be created,” he said. He, however, added that the government may be of the opinion that keeping Omicron cases as in-patients will ensure they do not spread the virus further. Kareliya added that there was also a need for ensuring that any person who had come in contact with a Covid-19 patient isolated himself immediately if he had any signs of a respiratory tract illness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/omicron-patients-resisting-hospitalization/articleshow/88510194.cms||Sachin Sharma

Political parties and candidates were busy completing the formalities since authorities have made it clear that no one will be allowed inside the counting station without permissible identity cards or authority letter. “Since over 200 candidates are contesting the Municipal Corporation election, the state election commission has to issue a large number of cards. We have deposited the required forms of agents with their credentials. Many cards have been issued and the remaining will be issued by late night or before counting. This was the most important exercise for us,” said a senior AAP leader. On the other side, the BJP held a meeting of party workers and addressed their doubts. The saffron party distributed work among election agents who are to be stationed at counting centres.

---||Goa||Rs 2cr dues sought from yachting body by Jan first week||Panaji: The river navigation department (RND) has commenced the process to recover rental dues from Goa Yachting Association (GYA) with the Captain of Ports issuing a recovery notice for Rs 2 crore. GYA has been asked to pay the amount by the first week of January. A copy of the notice has also been sent to the chief minister’s office and revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate. RND has said that GYA is “illegally utilising the departmental property” at Dona Paula without paying any rent. The RND has gone ahead and served the recovery notice, which does not include penal interest, despite an ongoing case before the revenue department regarding ownership of the plot. The 43-year-long legal battle for ownership and possession of the prime land is playing out before Monserrate, as GYA wants the revenue minister to overturn the deputy collector and sub-divisional magistrate’s order awarding the land to RND. The Tiswadi deputy collector had adjudged RND as the rightful owner of the plot back in 1989 and on June 24, it dismissed a fresh claim made by GYA over the 251 sqm of prime land. “The office of the accountant general calculated the rental value of the said RND property at Rs 1.7 lakh per month and calculated pending rental dues to the tune of Rs 2 crore, excluding interest for recovery from you,” said Captain James Braganza in the recovery notice. On October 22, TOI had reported that the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) of India has opened an inquiry to estimate the quantum of revenue loss to the government exchequer due to GYA’s “illegal occupation” of RND property at Dona Paula. Subsequently, PWD was asked to estimate the rental value and had arrived at a rental fee of Rs 1.7 lakh per month. The law department also appointed a government advocate on December 15 to plead RND’s claim to the land. “You are hereby required to deposit Rs 2 cr to the office of RND at Betim immediately as pending rental dues for utilising the property within next 15 days,” said Braganza in his recovery notice dated December 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rs-2cr-dues-sought-from-yachting-body-by-jan-first-week/articleshow/88511920.cms||---

The police seized a fake Aadhar card and at least 12 leave and licence agreements with different names from the suspect’s possession. The police found an Aadhar card in the name of Dr Bashit Shah but with the photograph of the suspect, who was identified as Shaukat Ahmed Mohamed Ramzan Lone. Lone was arrested on December 23 and placed in police custody in a case of cheating and forgery. The police also arrested a lawyer from Bandra for providing the suspect with a notarised stamp on the leave and licence agreement prepared on a stamp paper, which was one of the 12 agreements seized from the suspected militant. The lawyer reportedly told the police that he had notarised the agreement paper after verifying the supporting documents that were attached with it and he had no role in any crime. The suspect and the lawyer will both remain in police custody till Tuesday. “The investigation is on to know since when Lone has been staying in Mumbai with fake identities. He was caught because of the fight he had with the hotel staff. We have seized his mobiles and another gadget, which is sent for forensic analysis to retrieve information,” said a police officer at the Sahar police station. The suspect was booked under Section 420 (cheating), Section 465 (forgery), Section 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and Section 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly used as genuine any document or electronic record) of the Indian Penal Code.

They recently analysed the report of a digital information kiosk at Select City Mall in Saket and found a lack of cyber awareness among people. According to the report, about 29% of the people said they would give money if their social media friends messaged them asking for help. “This could be a scam, as there are several cases where fraudsters have created fake social media profiles and duped people on the pretext of a medical emergency,” an officer said. Similarly, 52.02% of people were ready to share their details if they received an email about winning a lottery. “Frauds start asking for processing fees and you will end up losing a lot of money,” the officer further said. 18.56% of people said they would pay the money after receiving any email from their boss for payment to a certain account without any further verification. “The email could be from a deceptively similar email ID, so it is best to verify the details from the originator or your office,” another officer added. When people were asked while selling second-hand products online whether they would scan a QR code sent by the buyer for the payment, around 71% of people replied yes. “If you have to receive payment, there is no need for you to scan a QR code. Similarly, no bank staff will call to ask for OTP of any transaction,” the officer added. When people were asked whether they would pay money to a link of unsecure shopping websites claiming massive discounts on mobile phones and other items, 16.4% of people said they would pay up. Police said the interactive digital kiosk in the Saket Mall was set up during Cyber Awareness Month in September to make people aware of various modus operandi used by cyber fraudsters. Additional DCP (south) M Harsha Vardhan said based on the responses, South District has planned outreach programmes. “We will make focused awareness interventions. For example, less awareness about the role of QR codes in online payments will require a focused intervention,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cyber-criminals-on-the-prowl-here-is-how-not-to-fall-prey/articleshow/88510912.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Lose flab to help body fight Covid||AHMEDABAD: Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the population with comorbidities has remained a focus for the experts – Gujarat has recorded higher percentage of cases and deaths among those with existing health conditions. But what makes them more susceptible? A team of researchers from the Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PEDU) argue that obesity affects both immunity and inflammation in Covid-19 infection. The researchers have simplified several international researches to divide the impact in two cycles – immunity / comorbid pathway and inflammatory pathway. “The immune blood cells along with T and B lymph cells manage active and passive immune response. The research points that obesity limits the level of circulating T cells that affects antigen recognition,” said D Sivaraman, a research faculty in pharmacy department at PDEU. “Increased levels of leptin hormones due to obesity lowers the level of T helper cells (Th2) that produces antibodies by B lymphocytes.” The researchers pointed at studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) where hypertension, obesity and diabetes were found to be the most common comorbidities existing in Covid-19 patients. “In the cycle B, we can understand that the fat cells (adipocytes) secrete hyperactive leptin hormone that synergizes the production of inflammatory cytokines that results in the immune system going into overdrive and causing severe inflammation – known as cytokine storm. It causes multi-organ failure and is often found lethal,” said Pradip Kumar, a research faculty at PDEU. The experts thus recommended a well-balanced diet, at least some form of daily exercise and reduction in alcohol/ tobacco consumption or other stressors. “Studies have pointed towards good health benefits of a diet rich in polyphenols (nuts, vegetables, seeds, etc.) to alleviate oxidative stress. Moderate exercise improves the immune system and lowers susceptibility to respiratory infections,” said SS Manoharan, director general of PDEU. “Increased physical activity is also associated with mobilization of hematopoietic cells that facilitates antibody production (humoral immunity).” Doctors agree with the hypothesis. Dr Maharshi Desai, intensive care specialist and member of the Covid-19 committee formed by the state government, said that the patients with obesity have higher chances of getting critical and relatively longer hospitalization. Dr Amit Prajapati, a critical care specialist, said that in his experience, the majority of the patients below 50 years who died during the second wave had obesity as one of the existing conditions. “Not only for Covid, obesity also hampers recovery in other diseases, too. But in Covid, it was to do with inflammation and higher recovery time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lose-flab-to-help-body-fight-covid/articleshow/88510935.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Nagpur||Way to a politician’s heart is through the stomach||NAGPUR: The election for the MLC (local bodies’ constituency) is always considered as ‘horse trading’ poll. Though it enjoyed a clear majority, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) decided to move its corporators to tourist and pilgrimage places in BJP-ruled states, to prevent cross voting. Following instructions from top leaders, BJP corporators were tight-lipped about where they were being taken. The breakthough came at my weekly biryani dinner at Mominpura on Saturday night. A BJP corporator too was there, and let it slip that he and 30 other corporators were to leave for Goa next day. He was in Mominpura for dinner as he was going to miss it for next 14 days. Over some banter, he even divulged the timing. The picnic for 30 of 31 BJP male corporators had started in the city, with ruling party leader in NMC Avinash Thakre hosting a cocktail party at a dhaba on the city’s outskirts. When they reached the airport at midnight, they were shocked to see someone from the media there taking videos and photos. But they didn’t seem too worried, full of Dutch courage as they were. One corporator was reluctant to go to Goa, and requested Thakre to exempt him. Thakre asked a BJP MLA to look into it, and after some time the corporator arrived at the airport. While entering the airport, he couldn’t resist taking a jibe at Thakre, asking why he was not coming to Goa. The next day, three more groups of BJP corporators, including two groups of female corporators with family members, left for different states. The story on their return was the same, and this journalist knew the exact time the 31 corporators returned, and covered their arrival. All the corporators were happy after the sponsored tour with their colleagues, the first time in this regime since March 2017. But some corporators were dying to rush to a dhaba to have spicy saoji food, which they had missed outside of the second capital. One of the corporators said at the airport, they enjoyed stay in luxurious hotels, but did not like the food. “We had packed saoji masala, prepared to cook meals ourselves whenever we got a chance during the tour. But we were not allowed to use the kitchen at Goa or Mahabaleshwar. Finally, we booked an independent resort at our own expense, purchased mutton from the market, and cooked saoji mutton. It was delicious and gave us a taste of home,” he said. The picnic continued for the corporators in Nagpur too, as they were taken to resorts at Pench after arriving from different states. They were taken to polling centres in the morning on December 10, before being allowed to return home. So, a story that started with a tip off over dinner, saw the BJP corporators going on a picnic for 13 days, and ended with the BJP candidate Chandrashekar Bawankule, also former minister, winning with a big margin.

He had filed an application before the special court for exclusive trial of cases under SC/ST (POA) Act at Sivaganga, which was dismissed. Challenging the same, he filed the present appeal and also sought bail.The prosecution case is that 33 people were involved in the offence in which three people were murdered and five sustained severe injuries. The entire village was encircled by the appellant and other accused on the night of May 28, 2018. The murders were gruesome since the deceased had more than 30 cut injuries.

The incident happened on the Karur - Manapparai road on June 4, 2011 when Parthasarathy was travelling on his two wheeler. The bus which came in the opposite direction collided with his two-wheeler causing him severe injuries leading to his death on the way to hospital.His family members had filed a petition before the Karur motor accidents claims tribunal seeking compensation. Though the tribunal fixed Rs 5.30lakh as compensation after considering the materials available, it deducted 50% of the amount for contributory negligence and awarded a compensation of Rs 2.65lakh only. Aggrieved, the family members challenged it through the present civil miscellaneous appeal before HC Madurai bench in 2014. The appellant contended that the deceased was working as an electrician, agricultural worker and milk vendor. He was earning Rs 15,000 per month, but the tribunal had fixed only a notional income of Rs 5,000 a month, which was low. However, the transport corporation submitted that since it was a head-on collision, both the vehicles are equally responsible for the accident. However, the judge observed that the tribunal had failed to consider the future prospects of the deceased who was 28 years at the time. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-enhances-accident-relief-for-kin-of-victim-28/articleshow/88511490.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Flyer traffic from Mumbai to non-metros soars beyond pre-Covid times||MUMBAI: Rajkot is air-linked with Mumbai by an hour-long flight that has nothing in particular to make it stand out, except when Covid is factored in. When all domestic flights that operate out of Mumbai are considered, it is this city in Gujarat, along with a handful of others, that have surpassed their pre-Covid passenger traffic numbers. Rajkot has clocked the highest growth in passenger traffic—107%—when pre-Covid January 2020 numbers are compared with the current traffic. “With the ease in travel restrictions across India and more and more travellers being double vaccinated, Mumbai airport has witnessed over nine domestic destinations surpassing pre-Covid levels,” said Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL). Leading the growth trajectory is passenger traffic from Tier-II and Tier-III markets, it added. In the first 15 days of December, about 16,000 passengers flew between Mumbai and Rajkot, which was a 107% gr-owth as compared to the pre-Covid period—the first 15 day of January 2020. Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh comes in second with a 73% growth as co-mpared to pre-Covid times, according to MIAL data. But when the December data is co-mpared to January 2019 data, Jabalpur’s passenger traffic growth stands at 98%, the highest among this lot. Then there is Vishakhapatnam with a 68% growth (January 2020 vs December) and the rest are Aurangabad, Chandigarh, Gorakhpur, Kandla, Madurai and Srinagar (see box). For sure, all these cities register a much slimmer volume of passenger traffic than, say the bigwigs like Delhi, Bengaluru, and Panaji which are yet to surpass their pre-Covid numbers. Their smaller base numbers also explain the stupendous growth percentages these nine cities have registered. “Nevertheless, it is a clear indicator of the rising popularity of flights to non-metro destinations out of metros,” said an airline official. “The demand has far overtaken supply, which is why passengers to non-metros end up paying almost double the price for their flight tickets as compared to those who fly to metros, even when these tickets are booked in advance.” “Metro-to-non-metro traffic has seen faster recovery compared to metro-to-metro in FY 21 and so far in FY 22,” said Kapil Kaul of Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation. A sizeable chunk of metro-to-metro traffic comes from corporate travel, which hasn’t recovered entirely yet. Moreover with the Omicron scare, business travel recovery is likely to be further delayed. On the other hand, traffic to non-metros largely comprises visiting friends and relatives or leisure travel, both of which have recovered. TOI looked at advance purchase airfares on non-stop fli-ghts scheduled in the first week of April from Mumbai to these nine non-metros. But for Aurangabad, air fares were higher on all other routes. In fact, it was 2-3 times of what is offered for travel by train in a second class AC coach. Compare this with fares offered on flights between metros during the same period. The cheapest Mumbai-Delhi return fare began at Rs 4,800.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/flyer-traffic-from-mumbai-to-non-metros-soars-beyond-pre-covid-times/articleshow/88511603.cms||---

It was the second consecutive day for the state to record 175-plus daily cases. With the update, the active cases in Gujarat crossed 900 at 948 – the highest in the past six months. After six days, the state has not recorded deaths of any active Covid patients. The new positive cases include 52 in Ahmedabad city, 24 in Rajkot city, 20 in Surat city, 15 in Vadodara city, 12 from Rajkot, 8 from Valsad and 5 from Surat districts among others. Analysis of the active cases reveals that out of 948, 304 were in Ahmedabad alone – meaning one out of every three active cases were in the district. Surat accounted for 142 or 15%, Vadodara 120 or 13%, and Rajkot 115 or 12% - in all, four major districts accounted for 72% of the total active cases. After about a week, the state did not record any new Omicron variant cases. Gujarat has recorded 49 total cases out of which 13 are discharged and 36 are active. Vadodara has highest 13 active cases, followed by 11 in Ahmedabad. The state health department officials said that they have not reported any Omicron variant case with moderate or severe symptoms so far. “The cases are constantly on the rise – it would be too early to say that it’s third wave for India or Gujarat, but surely the cities are again clocking the same numbers that we had seen at the start of the second wave in March. The silver lining is, there are fewer hospitalizations, and even among those who are hospitalized those needing intensive care or oxygen is fewer,” said a city-based critical care expert, adding that all eligible must get vaccinated. Gujarat in 24 hours vaccinated 41,031 persons, taking the total to 8.81 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/active-covid-19-cases-cross-300-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/88510932.cms||---

They said injustice is being meted out to Adivasis for many decades because of non-inclusion of those villages that are predominantly Adivasi in the Fifth Schedule. Of these 805 villages, 553 are in Andhra Pradesh. They include some of the villages in Visakhapatnam district in Anantagiri, Devarapalle, Cheedikada, V Madugula, Ravikamatham, Rolugunta, Golugonda and Nathavaram mandals. While proposals were being sent to government for approval, MLAs of Narsipatnam, Chodavaram and Madugula allowed only villages in five panchayats of Ananathagiri mandal for inclusion in the schedule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/call-to-include-tribal-villages-in-5th-schedule/articleshow/88510334.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Cancellation of New Year events draws industry ire||Nagpur: With the Maharashtra government announcing a ban on large public gatherings and the civic authorities imposing a night curfew due to the threat of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, the New Year celebrations are set to be a sombre affair. The hospitality industry will be bearing the brunt of curbs imposed for the second year in a row. Hoteliers have slammed the decision, claiming they saw a glimmer of hope to recover pandemic losses but instead, had to cancel pre-booked New Year’s Eve reservations. Speaking to TOI, Ramesons Hotel owner Nitin Gopalani said, “People have been in panic-mode ever since the restrictions were announced. Along with New Year celebrations, wedding ceremonies are on the receiving end of the curbs. Such kind of haphazard decisions made by the authorities creates panic among the guests as well as hoteliers.” Olive Resorts owner Gaurav Chouksey said, “It’s quite unfortunate that the so-called experts don’t look at the hotel and food and beverage sectors as an industry. It employs a large number of the population and several affiliated businesses depend on it. Just because cases are on the rise in cities like Mumbai, you cannot penalize Nagpur. Imposing such restrictions is a non-scientific measure and a knee-jerk reaction by the authorities.” He added, “These state-wide curbs lead to direct benefits for neighbouring states. We have seen a lot of movement of people, from Nagpur to Pench, Madhya Pradesh, who are unwilling to shelve their New Year eve plans.” Micky Arora of Hotel Centre Point said, “There are various celebrations organized this time of the year as these seven days are crucial for the hotel industry. It would have been a better move to allow these gatherings under certain limitations after seeking permission from the concerned authorities.” He added that the decision of closing down eateries by 9pm and then reversing it in a matter of hours caused confusion among citizens and the Christmas night footfall was dampened. “We received cancellation calls for 17 to 18 reservations immediately after the news spread,” said Arora. Cinema halls were also affected by the rushed notice of the night curfew. Sanjay Surana, owner of Liberty Theatre, said, “The sudden announcement of curfew came as a mighty blow as we already had advance bookings for late-night shows. Now, customers are furious and asking for a refund, which is very inconvenient as the money has already been transferred to the bank accounts and banks are closed this weekend.” Dhruv Bhargava, a citizen who was gearing up for New Year’s eve celebrations, was disappointed. He said, “After almost 2 years of gloom and lockdown, I was looking forward to the New Year party but my plans have been spoiled because of the curfew. People were in a mood to get some well deserved respite but that is not to be.” (Reporting by Manshika Vaikkath; Inputs from Sahil Pawar)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cancellation-of-new-year-events-draws-industry-ire/articleshow/88510336.cms||Manshika Vaikkath

Livelihood of workers and sugarcane farmers depends on it,” said Venkatesan. The MP further said that CPI (M) state secretary K Balakrishnan has also met with the CM regarding the demand.Su Venkatesan also pointed out that the mill can be made to function in a profitable manner if the co-generation power plant at the mill is also made operational along with starting ethanol production.Tamil Nadu sugarcane farmers’ association state president, N Palanisamy, who is leading the protest, noted that this year, 1,850 acres of sugarcane has been registered for crushing at the mill and 60,000 tonnes of sugarcane is in the area of the mill. “Farmers are also ready to provide around 17,000 tonnes of sugarcane that are not registered for crushing. It will ensure continuous running of the mill,” he added.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/resume-operations-at-natl-co-operative-sugar-mill-mp-to-cm/articleshow/88511514.cms||---

---||Mangaluru||Authorities go easy on mask violations in DK||Mangaluru: Dakshina Kannada district seems to have been showing laxity when it comes to the implementation of the mask violation rule in recent months. The police, gram panchayats and urban local bodies in the district have booked only 2,500 cases of mask violations in December. The district had booked less than 500 cases in November, and nearly 700 cases in October. According to data available with the district administration, more than 1.1 crore cases have been booked in the district so far, which includes 36,000 cases in the first three months of the second wave from April. More than 18,000 cases were booked in June. However, a recent fall in the daily cases of Covid-19 has led to laxity in the drives against mask violations in the district. While the district has so far collected Rs 1.1 crore as a penalty for mask violations, Rs 1.06 crore was collected before November. The district had collected nearly Rs 32 lakh as penalty in June. However, only Rs 2.6 lakh was collected in December. Deputy commissioner K V Rajendra said that people should give emphasis to self-regulation, rather than waiting for the government to impose strict restrictions. “The district administration has been implementing all the guidelines of the state government. Self-regulation on part of people is important. The district has already undergone an economic crisis due to severe restrictions like lockdowns and other restrictions. People should not be irresponsible, just because the district administration is not imposing regulations and restrictions. People should be more responsible and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour while visiting crowded places,” the DC said. The district had recorded the highest single-day spike of 1,787 cases on May 15 this year. The district’s active caseload was also at its peak on May 15, with 13,194 cases. However, after the first week of November, the district was reporting less than 200 fresh cases. In December, Dakshina Kannada reported an average of less than 20 cases per day, and as on Saturday, that district has 161 active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/authorities-go-easy-on-mask-violations-in-dk/articleshow/88510335.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||FIR against cop accused of murder attempt quashed||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has held that the term “relative” does not include a girlfriend or a concubine, while quashing an FIR against a woman police constable, who along with her male colleague and his relatives, was booked by Dharur police in Beed district on July 16 for murder attempt, harassment and other charges following a complaint by the man’s wife. The complainant woman had accused her husband and the woman constable of having an illicit relationship, besides, accusing them and her in-laws of trying to set her ablaze (section 307 IPC) and subjecting her to harassment (section 498-A). The police also applied charges under sections 504 (causing intentional insult) and 506 (criminal intimidation) in the case. The woman constable had later moved a criminal application before the high court for quashing of the FIR. Lawyers Ashwini Lomte and S J Salunke, representing the woman constable, had submitted the applicant was not a member of the complainant woman’s family and the allegations against the applicant were made with “certain oblique motive”. The court also cited a 2009 Supreme Court judgment which held that “people who are relatives of the husband may commit an offence under Section 498-A IPC, however, the term relative of the husband does not include the girlfriend or concubine (i.e. a woman who lives with a man but has lower status than his wife)”. The complainant woman’s lawyer had cited a specific incident of June 18 when she followed her husband to a room where she saw him and his woman colleague in a compromising position. However, the HC bench of justice V K Jadhav and justice Sandipkumar C More observed that the charge of murder attempt was made mainly against the husband, mother-in-law and other family members. “Insofar as charge under section 498-A is concerned, in view of the SC judgment relied upon by the counsel for the applicant, the term relative does not include girlfriend or concubine. In view of the same, the charge under section 498-A as far as the applicant is concerned, is also not sustainable,” the bench said. The HC further observed that the charges of causing intentional insult and criminal intimidation were “absurd and vague in nature” and that there were no details as to what abuses were allegedly hurled by the applicant. On June 18 incident referred by the complainant's lawyer, the HC observed that no immediate complaint was filed about the same but the reference of the said incident was made only in the complaint filed on July 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/fir-against-cop-accused-of-murder-attempt-quashed/articleshow/88509714.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Madurai||MCQ pattern challenging and tough: CBSE students||Madurai: With the first term board examination under the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) new semester system for Class X and XII getting concluded this month, students and teachers of CBSE schools said some of the questions were particularly difficult to solve and the new pattern of objective-type questions was challenging.As per the new system, the academic year has been divided into two terms with two term exams. The first term exam is being held in November and December which has only Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) similar to that of the competitive exams. “Though students were able to do well with sufficient training, generally students were not comfortable with the question paper. Some of the questions, especially in subjects such as Maths and Accountancy, were usually four mark or six mark questions and are time-consuming to be worked out. Hence students struggled to finish the exam in time as they are not used to this,” said Aruna M Visvessvar, senior principal and correspondent, Adhyapana School. Many teachers and students also felt that the sudden change in pattern has been difficult to adapt to and that it may have been better if it was introduced from next year.“We first thought that objective type questions may be easier as we just have to choose the right option but it was not that easy. We needed to understand concepts really well to pick the right option as many questions were asked in a twisted manner. It was not easy to manage time too, especially with this being our first major exam since school reopened,” said S Manisha, a Class XII student. For toppers the questions were manageable, but for other students it was not so easy to cope with.“For students who score average marks, some of the questions were really tough. The questions were framed such that students needed to figure out which concept to apply and answer. For children as young as 15-16 years of age, it is not easy to do so quickly and easily lose time in some sections,” said Meera Radhakrishnan, a Class X Social Science teacher. Further, students and teachers also expressed concern over how far weightage will be given for scores in the first term exam in determining the final board exam score. “The board is yet to make it clear on whether and how these scores will be considered for the final board exam marks. Such ambiguity is unfair for students especially as they face a new pattern,” said Jayendran Mani, correspondent, Sri Jayendra Group of Educational Institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mcq-pattern-challenging-and-tough-cbse-students/articleshow/88511512.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The varsity had constituted a UDF committee to consider allocation of funds for activities like construction of new buildings and procurement of laboratory equipment. “At present, the university is receiving only Rs 600 per student per year as UDF contribution, which was implemented from the academic year 2012-13,” the panel said. “Keeping in view the fund requirement as well as government mandate for self sufficiency and reduction of capital grants by UGC as well as for creation of ICT-enabled infrastructure, the UDF amount should be revised to Rs 900 per student per year,” it said. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-decides-to-increase-varsity-development-fee/articleshow/88510929.cms||---

One may ask questions whether these efforts will prove effective in mitigating life-shortening pollution, dwindling water supplies, scorching heatwaves and onslaught of natural disasters like Taukte or even a natural calamity. The recent evaluation of climate Urban Climate Vulnerability Assessment (UCVA) study funded by the union ministry of environment and forest has found that Ahmedabad and Bengaluru are more vulnerable than Delhi, Mumbai and even Chennai. The study argues that in all seven cities citizens are exposed to climate-induced hazards. “The majority of population exposure in the cities falls in the range of above 20%, affecting 10% to 20% of the total population on average,” claims the study. Climate change hazards where population was directly affected remained varied. In Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Bengaluru, and Ahmedabad each experienced one to two events annually; Shillong and Srinagar sometimes experience more than two events annually. While in case of physical factors the study claimed “This was due to the deaths and casualties reported like the disastrous floods of 2005 in Mumbai, 2014 in Chennai and Srinagar and the 2010 heat wave of Ahmedabad.” In case of demographic vulnerability, which is largely constituted of migrant population, the study argues Bengaluru is the most vulnerable, followed by Ahmedabad and Delhi. “The decadal population density growth in these cities have recorded higher growth rate (above 10%) are Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Srinagar and Delhi. The reasons include an increase in the migrant/floating population.” It further added, “The index depicts that the projected population growth in the majority of the cities lies in high range that is above 10%. The increase in population indicates that the number of people exposed to climate-related hazards will increase in the future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abad-1st-when-it-comes-to-demographic-vulnerability/articleshow/88510949.cms||Paul John

A senior officer said in many cases the accused are alcoholics, and soon after being admitted to the jail, they often suffer from withdrawal symptoms. “Many also suffer from behavioural issues, and hence used to be referred to a counsellor.

Jail superintendent B T Obaleshappa told TOI, “A full-time counsellor was appointed about 10 days ago. We will be able to assess the impact on the inmates after some time. The counsellors help clear the doubts and mental disturbances that the inmates are going through. At the time of admission, the inmate has the opportunity to interact with the counsellor, or is introduced to the counsellor a day or two after admission. The counsellor is also reaching out to those who have been in jail for a long time and need help,” he said. The total number of inmates in the jail are 333, including six women, as on Sunday. Out of the inmates, nearly 70 of them are accused in various Pocso cases. Efforts are on to include them in the skill-development programme that is being planned.

However, the parents have not been found despite the case being lodged at the police station and the girl is staying at Shishu Grah. Officials claimed that if the parents are not found within next 60 days, then they will publish the details of the girl in newspapers and put her up for adoption The child was apparently left at the station by her parents and she said that they beat her up regularly and while she can tell their names, she is unable to give more details. The girl is severely malnourished and appears to be younger than her actual age though officials claimed that she has recovered well. Panwar Kiran, superintendent, Gandhinagar Shishu Grah told TOI, “We have written to the police as well regarding the girl’s parents but till now there is no clue about their whereabouts. It appears that the girl is from a northern state.

On Thursday, William, now 15, ran away from his Agripada residence after an argument with his family over his addiction. The local police didn’t register a compliant but spent days tracing the boy to a distant northern suburb and reuniting him with his family on Sunday. His family reprimanded him, took away his SIM card and sent him to a psychiatrist in order to check his internet gaming addiction, but the youngster always found ways to play on; on most days, he would walk into railway stations for Wi-Fi connection to continue playing. Smartphone addiction is now recognised as a mental health/behavior problem, especially among children and adolescents. Studies have shown that a little use of internet has a positive impact on children, while excessive use adversely affects their mental wellbeing. In William’s case, his parents took him to a psychiatrist a few months back to get counselling on the harmful effects of mobile addiction. Yet, on December 23, his mother couldn’t reach him and approached the Agripada police for help. Senior inspector Shriram Koregaonkar instructed API Datta Patil to begin the search operation for the minor. “The child’s mother told investigators that sometimes he would be so involved in these games that he would start shivering,” said a police officer. The teenager would reportedly become violent when his family asked him to keep his phone aside. He was initially addicted to playing PUBG, but started playing other games since it was banned in India in September. As these are multi-player games, he would play with some friends. “The boy’s mother would write down the names and phone numbers of the friends that her son played online with. This helped us a lot in his search operation,” said a police officer. When the family took away the SIM card from his phone to prevent him from playing the game all the time, “he would sit at railway stations to use the free Wi-Fi to play games,” said a police source. During inquiry, the family told police that they had a second home in Boisar, Palghar district. They also realized that he played online with a boy living close to their home in Boisar. “We contacted the Boisar boy through a video call and asked him about the missing teenager. He told us that the missing boy was staying with him,” said a police source. The Agripada family then immediately left for Boisar to take the child. Y P Singh, IPS officer-turned-lawyer, said that the government should set up counselling centres to tackle such issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-help-parents-trace-gaming-addict-son/articleshow/88511924.cms||Mateen Hafeez

---||Delhi||Delhi Covid curbs: Industries worried, but wait for clarity||NEW DELHI: With Delhi government planning to impose a night curfew from 11pm to 5am, industry owners are a worried lot. They have demanded that the government exempt factories from night curfew and said all workers could be checked for being fully vaccinated and allowed to work. “These days, profit margins are wafer thin and if night curfew is implemented, then it will impact our production. I request the government to exempt factory owners from the night curfew as almost 60% of our production work is done at night. Shutting down the factory during these hours will reduce output and impact our workforce’s earnings too,” said Sanjay Vig, general secretary, CETP Society, Industrial Area Mangolpuri Phase-I and II. Vivek Gupta, a factory owner in Jhilmil Industrial Area, said, “Almost one-third of our work is done during night hours. Night curfew will gravely impact production. If the output is low, then it will affect the labourers and other workers. We will have to reduce our staff strength.” However, Vikram Bhaduria, the owner of Alok Masterbathches, a factory that produces chemicals to package essential items like hand wash, has decided to wait and watch. “We will wait till proper orders from the government are circulated. Production is done in three batches in our Delhi unit, one of them being at night. The last time, after the lockdown it took us almost one month to be up and running fully,” added Bhaduria. His production unit is in Okhla Industrial Area. Brijesh Goyal, chairman of Chamber of Trade and Industry Owners Association, said, “We will soon be holding a meeting with industry owners to listen to the problems they might face. I will also write to Delhi Disaster Management Authority regarding the implementation of rules in markets and other crowded areas. It is the responsibility of the administration and not of shop owners. Further, we will wait for a proper order from the government regarding night curfew.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/industries-worried-but-wait-for-clarity/articleshow/88510953.cms||---

We have raised this issue a few times with the management, however, we have noticed that we are not able to get the complete amount that we were promised,” one of the KTC’s e-bus drivers said. The management at the KTC, however, said that the issue pertains to salary cuts only given to erratic drivers. “We have a general rule wherein we impose a salary cut on drivers who have proven to be responsible for getting into an accident. The salary cut is for the recovery of damage to the vehicle. When an EV met with an accident, a salary cut was imposed on the driver and other drivers were also warned,” said KTC general manager Sanjay Ghate. He added that the management is open to having a dialogue regarding the break up of the salary and salary slips. “Salary and the PF is systematically deposited in the bank account of each staff member. If they have an issue with it, they can reach out to us and we can resolve it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/drivers-of-ktcs-e-buses-want-clarity-on-payment-system/articleshow/88511941.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Rare collared pratincole spotted in Curtorim||PANAJI: A rare sighting of this visitor in the Maina-Curtorim wetland would have passed off as a routine one. For this forest official, its tail-to-wing length ratio sparked curiosity that helped add collared pratincole to Goa’s growing checklist of bird species. With this spotting, the new record has taken the total count of birds documented in the state to 483. Just over a month and half back, 11-year-old twins Gautam and Sidharth had swelled the checklist, spotting another rare visitor –– long-billed Dowitcher in the nearby Raia- Loutolim wetlands while out birding with their mother, Priya. “I noticed this single bird resting, motionless on the mud bank in the middle of the harvested Maina-Curtorim fields on December 13,” Mangirish Dharwadkar, who works with wildlife division, (south) Margao said. The spotting initially triggered some confusion if it was an Oriental pratincole or collared pratincole as both bear striking resemblance to each other. Small pratincoles in flocks of 100 or more are commonly seen but oriental pratincole and the collared one are rare. “The oriental was spotted and photographed in 2016 but collared pratincole has been spotted for the first time. All three are of the same size but the small pratincole has a plain grey colour and is easily recognized. But the other two have some similarities and birders get confused,” Justino Rebello, a senior birder said. Dharwadkar who was accompanied by other birders, his wife, Rupali Pandit, assistant professor of zoology in a Quepem college and Rebello, kept clicking photographs of the rare bird aware that morphological studies would help its identification process. Its slit-shaped nostril – oriental’s is egg-shaped – also tail-to-wing length ratio as compared to oriental’s shorter tail and its deeply forked tail as seen in flight, convinced the forest official about his find of a new record. Rebello also posted a picture on social media which only drew mixed reactions, though very few reacted and most answered correctly. Dharwadkar’s excitement grew after international experts endorsed his view. “To avoid confusion about the overlapping features between the two species, I had contacted Tim Inskipp, author of a book on Indian birds and Gerald Driessens, a Belgian expert on pratincoles,” Dharwadkar said. With a veritable checklist of common, less spotted and rare birds, new sightings inevitably turn out to be rare ones. The two rare pratincoles have been spotted in other parts of India, but are not known to be regular winter visitors. The wetlands along river Zuari form part of a bird corridor that needs to be protected, birders say. “The Maina-Curtorim and Raia wetlands are rich in avifaunal biodiversity. In 2013, spot-billed Pelican, Eurasian bittern in December 2020 were spotted in Savonem, Udo, Raia and Collared pratincole in Maina-Curtorim in December 2021 –– all rare ones,” Dharwadkar said. The traditional agriculture practiced by locals has drawn praise from others. “This wetland still attracts migratory birds. The credit goes to the local communities who persist with age-old tradition of raising two crops,” Philip Fernandes, a birder said. J Santano Rodrigues, chairman of Curtorim biodiversity management committee agrees with him. “Agricultural activities throughout the year help keep the local ecology clean from growth of weeds which is good for birds and other diversity,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rare-collared-pratincole-spotted-in-curtorim/articleshow/88531719.cms||Paul Fernandes

He is said to have sought an appointment with the chief minister to discuss the movie ticket prices issue which is the prime reason behind closure of the theatres.  Sources said Chiranjeevi has discussed the issue with the information, public relations and cinematography minister Perni Venkatramaiah (Nani) and requested him to ensure a meeting with the chief minister to discuss the issue. Though Chiranjeevi welcomed government’s decision to go for online ticketing system, he requested it to reconsider its decision on the ‘poor’ ticket prices as they are ‘fixed without any rationale.’  With Telangana government allowing the exhibitors to fix the ticket prices by giving minimum and maximum cap, Chiranjeevi wanted similar procedure to be adopted in AP to bail out the industry. He is expected to request the chief minister not to keep one or two persons in mind before taking such decisions which would impact the entire industry.  The war of words between the ministers and a few heroes suddenly escalated the situation prompting the state government to launch the crackdown on the theatres. The district collectors and joint collectors went on an inspection spree and issued notices to about 130 theatres in the state resulting in their sudden closure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/chiranjeevi-seeks-to-meet-cm-discuss-crisis/articleshow/88510372.cms||Samdani MN
---||Aurangabad||5 booked on charge of murder in Jalna||AURANGABAD: Jalna police have arrested three of the five suspects on charges of murder, criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence, after they allegedly killed a youth and later hanged his body to a tree to pass it off as suicide case. In addition to this, the suspects have also been slapped with sections of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of atrocities) Act. Though the caste factor does not appear to be the key reason for the brawl followed by alleged murder, but as the deceased belonged to the scheduled caste, the said sections of atrocities Act have been imposed. The deceased has been identified as Anil alias Appa Thorat of Khandewadi hamlet situated in Howra Roshangaon. The incident came to light on Saturday morning, when some villagers found his body hanging to a tree. Based on the complaint lodged by family members of the deceased, Maujapuri police registered an offence against the five suspects. Swinging into action, Partur sub-divisional police officer Raju More immediately arrested three accused — identified as Anju Rathod, Sandeep Rathod and Ravi Rathod, all residents of Khandewadi hamlet. Preliminary probe revealed that two days prior to the alleged murder, there was a heated argument between the accused and the deceased. The accused late on Friday waylaid the Thorat and assaulted him before taking him away with them. The next morning his body was found hanging to the tree. Maujapuri police station’s assistant inspector Vilas More said, “As it appears to be a pre-determined and planned act, they have also been slapped with charges of criminal conspiracy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/5-booked-on-charge-of-murder-in-jalna/articleshow/88509727.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Raj and a resolution to unfurl tricolour||AHMEDABAD : Many may not be aware of the fact that almost 93 years ago, under the British administration, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who was then the Ahmedabad municipality president, had gathered councillors support to pass a resolution — Resolution 868 of November 5, 1928 — to unfurl the tricolour on the municipality building. It was by December end, that a resolution was officially issued by the secretary of the general board of the municipality. This was the first time in Ahmedabad’s history that an official resolution was made to allow the tricolour to be flown on a British government-owned structure. On February 28, 1929, an elaborate ceremony for unfurling the tricolour was held, with Mahatma Gandhi in attendance. In an essay published in the Navajivan newspaper on March 17, 1929, Bapu wrote about the event. He wrote, “Only Sardar can show this kind of courage of unfurling the tricolour.” Bapu later remembered how Sardar during his tenure had installed Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak’s memorial statue in Victoria Garden in Ahmedabad. After Sardar, Daulatram Umedram Shah had taken over as chief officer and continued to keep the tradition of unfurling the tricolour every year. The tradition continued till June 1, 1943 after which the British pulled down the flag and replaced it with the union jack. Professor Rizwan Kadri of Shree Swaminarayan Arts College in Ahmedabad and city historian says, “Back then in the late 1920s even official letter heads of municipality officials carried the tricolour.” A book ‘Rashtriya Chadwad Ma Amdavad Municipality No Fado’, by India’s first Lok Sabha speaker G V Mavlankar, and Chandubhai Dalal, had mentioned how the tradition of the tricolour was kept alive. In the 1929 Navajivan article, Bapu had elaborately dwelt on bringing a standard in the flag. For instance, using khadi in place of cloth imported from Britain. He had cited how certain readers had objected to different colour tones for the tricolour||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/raj-and-a-resolution-to-unfurl-tricolour/articleshow/88510979.cms||---

Teams of volunteers comprising MCC officials, NGOs and students will stand near black spots, where motorists dump garbage by the side of NH-66, to create awareness on cleanliness. MCC has already formed a team of dedicated workers to carry out special cleanliness drives regularly. The team comprising officials and gang workers have been clearing waste from both sides of NH-66 in the city. The initiative was started following complaints from the public about motorists throwing waste by the roadside. MCC zonal commissioner Shabarinath Rai told TOI that it will be difficult to penalise motorists who litter the national highway. “It is difficult to track the vehicles from which waste is being thrown by the side of the highway. Hence, we are planning to launch an awareness drive on the national highway, by involving students and NGOs to keep roadsides clean. We will identify black spots on the stretch where awareness drives will be held. Volunteers with placards and banners will request motorists not to litter highways. Similar campaigns held by activists and students on the national highway near the Nethravathi River recently had a good impact. Soon after the Christmas holidays, we will launch drives after holding discussions with students and NGOs,” he said. On the highway cleaning initiative that MCC started recently, he said it was commenced as per the directions of commissioner Akshy Sridhar. “We have already started the national highway cleaning drive in Surathkal and Mukka. The initiative was planned after noticing rampant littering by motorists. We have plans to hold such cleaning drives at least for two days in a week. Teams of around 10-12 gang workers from Antony Waste Handling Cell, who carry out door-to-door waste collection and transportation in the city, will conduct drives on national highways regularly. The main objective of the drive is to keep the national highway stretch in the city clean,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mcc-plans-campaign-to-keep-nh-66-clean/articleshow/88510376.cms||---

Residents of the Wathar village spotted the carcass of the wild cat and informed the foresters of the Bamnoli range. With the help of the local residents, the leopard was taken to the veterinarian for an autopsy. Mahesh Zhanzurne, the assistant conservator of forest, said, “The male leopard weighed around 45 kg and was considered to be fully matured. It was declared dead when brought to the hospital. It died due to profuse internal bleeding. A speeding vehicle may have hit the animal. The internal organs are found to be dislocated, but there were no signs of poaching.” According to experts, the leopard may have come from the forest area in Koyna or Bamnoli. In January this year, a leopard was spotted along the national highway near Karad. Instances of leopard attacks in the region have also been reported a few times. In November, a 5-year-old boy was killed in a leopard attack in the Yenke village of Karad tehsil. The leopard was later caught and released in the wild by the forest department. The foresters are also trying to find the vehicle that might have hit the leopard. The incident might have occurred between 5 am and 6 am.

Due to a focus on their careers, and late marriages being the norm, getting pregnant in their 30s is common nowadays. Older mothers are financially secure and happy to put their careers on hold, while they bring up the baby. Also, with many celebrities embracing motherhood in their 30s and early 40s, many couples have questions about how safe it is to get pregnant in their 30s. Dr Sameena H, consultant, obstetrics and gynaecology, KMC Hospital, Mangaluru, said, “Nearly 90% of women who are planning their first baby and approach us are above 28, and by the time they conceive, they would have turned 30. About a decade ago, the trend was different. By the age of 30, women would have completed their family, and would come back to the doctor for family planning. These days women would like to start a family only once they are financially independent and professionally settled,” she said. Also, women want to enjoy the pregnancy and post-pregnancy phase. “We have also noticed that in case of an unplanned pregnancy, women are keen on termination rather than continuing it, and often during counselling, their concerns are either about not being financially prepared or that they want to pursue higher studies. These days, women are also particular, and they do not burden their parents with the medical expense of their first delivery,” Dr Sameena said. Dr Suhasini Inamdar, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, Motherhood Hospital, Bengaluru, said, “There is definitely a shift in the pattern of timing pregnancies. I see several of my patients are choosing to have a child in their 30s, rather than their 20s. Parenting requires a certain level of financial stability and maturity. The choice, though sensible, comes with its own set of challenges,” she said. She observed that age is a crucial factor when it comes to fertility and reproductive health. Fertility starts to decline in the 30s and reduces after 35. “This kind of pregnancy comes under high-risk pregnancy category, and late conception can be risky, as women may develop gestational diabetes, placental abruption, eclampsia, premature delivery and genetic abnormalities. If women are planning on getting pregnant in their 30s, it would be advisable to get a tab on their reproductive health. Women should not ignore prenatal care as it helps in avoiding unwanted complications before embarking on the journey of motherhood, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/more-women-embrace-motherhood-in-their-30s/articleshow/88510403.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The association has fixed the grape price at Rs 82 per kg for January. Similarly, the prices for February and March would be Rs 71 and Rs 62 per kg, respectively. The association members said that they have fixed the rates considering the per acre expenses and yield. The farmers would earn only 10% profit. Kailas Bhosle, a senior MRDBS office-bearer said the grape farmers across Nashik district have been incurring heavy losses due to unseasonal rains and hailstorms. Moreover, the Covid pandemic has also affected the grape farmers as they did not get better prices during the last two years. The government has introduced Minimum Support Price (MSP) for certain crops and fruits, however, MSP for grapes has not been introduced yet. Hence, we have decided that farmers will fix the prices of grapes that would be sold to traders. The grape season begins from January and continues till mid-April. The prices of the grapes will change every month. The vineyard yield is 6 tonnes per acre in January, which is comparatively low. The yield increases in February and March to 7 and 8 tonnes respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/grape-farmers-body-fixes-grape-price-at-rs-82/kg-for-jan/articleshow/88509763.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Kochi||GCDA to treat sewage waste from old residential buildings in Kochi||KOCHI: Heeding the request of a group of city residents, Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) has decided to treat sewage waste from old residential buildings at the authority’s sewage treatment plants at Marine Drive Ground and Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Kaloor. It is the huge land cost that forced the residents of old buildings, which do not have sewage treatment plants, to approach GCDA with the request. GCDA has decided to connect ducts from the nearby buildings to the plants of the authority, transport sewage waste to the plant through the ducts and treat the waste. For this, the authority will collect Rs 500 for 5,000 litres of waste from the buildings. Currently the plant at Marine Drive treats waste from 28 nearby buildings. “We will conduct a comprehensive survey in the area to identify the requirements. Based on the survey report, we will construct a new plant at Marine Drive. The existing plant is around 40-years-old and is functioning using old technology. After commissioning the new plant, we will demolish the existing plant,” said a senior official with GCDA. The land value in Marine Drive area comes to around Rs 40 lakh per cent. “House owners in the residential buildings will have to invest crores of rupees to buy land for setting up the plant. Besides, they will have to knock on many doors to get NOC for the plant and follow other procedures. All these require huge investment and it is a time consuming procedure,” said another official. The plant at Kaloor stadium is underutilized and a similar request from owners of nearby buildings came up before the authority. “If we link the sewage ducts from buildings along the Stadium Link Road and nearby areas to the Kaloor plant, we can increase its capacity utilization,” said the official. It has also been decided to treat the sewage waste from Government Medical College, Ernakulam, at the Kaloor plant until the ongoing work of the treatment plant at the medical college is completed. The renovation of Kaloor market is undergoing and a sewage treatment plant is also constructed along with the project. The authorities will extend the service of the plant to nearby buildings at Kaloor, if owners are willing to transport the waste from their buildings through ducts. Another plant is coming up at Rameswaram, where apartment facilities for residents of T & P Colony have been arranged under Life Mission. In view of all these, GCDA has invited expression of interest from consultants to study the projects. Since all the four plants are away from residential areas, GCDA hopes people will not raise objections to setting up sewage treatment plants. Setting up of sewage treatment plants has become a huge issue in Kerala due to resistance from locals, which invariably pose health and environment hazard in the state, inviting wrath of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) often.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gcda-to-treat-sewage-waste-from-old-residential-buildings-in-city/articleshow/88510414.cms||T C Sreemol

---||Ahmedabad||Spinning into GST quagmire||Ever since the goods and services tax (GST) council has proposed to change the GST rate on textile and apparel from 5% to 12%, apparel manufacturers are in jitters, and have raised red flags over an adverse impact on the industry time and again. This will particularly affect the demand for affordable clothing because apparel above Rs 1,000 was already taxed at 12% whereas that below Rs 1,000 — which is widely sold was taxed at 5%. With the proposed revision, affordable garments will become costlier, and manufacturers fear that it will not just impact domestic demand in a big way but in turn even hit production. Industry leaders express fear that the government’s plan to increase revenues through higher GST will backfire and will bring down the tax collection from current levels. Several representations have been made by industry associations comprising retailers, apparel makers and textile industry stakeholders urging the government to revoke the proposed change in the GST rate. Despite concerns expressed by the industry, the Union government is unlikely to defer implementation of the higher GST rate on certain textile products, as the decision was taken by the GST council, according to the Union finance ministry. "A delegation of the textile industry from the city tried to explain to the government about the adverse impact. Around Rs 4,500 crore has been invested for upgradation by the industries here and the hike in GST will give a major blow to them," said Bharat Gandhi, chairman, Federation of Indian Art Silk Weaving Industry (FIASWI). "Textile products are even for poor people. The hike in taxes will make the products costly by 20%," Gandhi added. Manufacturers, retailers fear decline in demand Clothing manufacturers and retailers fear that costlier apparel will cause a decline in demand for apparel. "The cost of apparel has already gone up by a sizeable 20-25% since Diwali in the wake of costlier raw materials and increased job work charges. With a surge in GST rates, there will be a further increase in the price of apparel, particularly those in the affordable segment," said Arpan Shah, honorary treasurer, Gujarat Garment Manufacturers’ Association (GGMA). "Costlier apparel will dent demand because the purchasing power of consumers has not dramatically improved over the past year and a half. We saw good demand during Diwali purely due to the festive season and pent-up demand, and post that, there is already a reduction in demand," said Shah. Slowing demand likely to affect employment During the Diwali festive season, apparel makers did good business fuelled by pent-up demand. Estimates by Clothing Manufacturers’ Association of India (CMAI) suggest that most retailers earned 90% of their festive season revenues during pre-Covid period. "Already with rising cases of Covid-19 and concerns over the Omicron variant, the consumer sentiment has dampened yet again with retail sales declining. At a time when industry was barely recovering from the pandemic-induced slowdown after a year and a half, a rise in taxation and costlier commodity will only derail this recovery further," said Rahul Mehta, chief mentor, CMAI. In fact, a study commissioned by CMAI projects that some 7 lakh jobs in the textile and apparel industry across the country will be lost over the next year if the tax rates go up. Industry players have also voiced concerns over unfair competition from players who are not under the ambit of GST. "The idea behind introducing the new tax rate was to give relief to textile industry players from an inverted duty structure. However, as per our findings, only 20% of the industry is impacted by an inverted duty structure and such a decision to increase tax rate will prove detrimental for 80% of the industry," Mehta further added. Plunging demand may hit productionTextile and apparel makers suggest a decline in apparel demand is expected to impact production in turn as well. Estimates by GGMA suggest that garment makers are already operating at 60% of the production capacity since Diwali. "With fewer sales, the production cycle will also be impacted to a great extent. With fresh concerns over Omicron variant, export order volumes may take a hit and it will be a double whammy for manufacturers if domestic demand also further declines," said Chintan Thaker, chairman, Assocham Gujarat State Council. Industry estimates suggest that textile production may drop by 30% in the wake of reduced demand and increased working capital needs. Retailers to take a big blowMarket insiders explain that the impact of the tax hike will be maximum on traders and retailers. Retailers sell products at competitive rates with a margin of 2-5% net profit and with the hike in tax they will be most impacted. "Small businesses will face tough situations as they need investment to buy products and pay taxes in advance while they get payment as per the credit cycle. All textile traders’ associations across India have opposed the hike," said Champalal Bothra, general secretary, Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (FOSTTA). "The textile products have already become costly due to rising costs and with an increase in tax will result in scared customers," said Sanjay Mehta, a fabric shop owner in Jhabua of Madhya Pradesh. Working capital need may go upIndustry stakeholders also warned of the dumping of cheaper textile products from neighbouring countries. The most common worry of all segments of the industry is the requirement of working capital. "We have a credit and payment cycle up to five months. A weaver or trader will have to pay GST for the same month, but one will get paid after three months or more. To avoid blocking a big amount they will reduce the size of business or start evading tax," said Ashok Jirawala, president, Federation of Gujarat Weavers Welfare Association (FOGWA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/spinning-into-gst-quagmire/articleshow/88511018.cms||Niyati Parikh

They were speaking in the backdrop of BJP leaders threatening to stall comedian Munawar Faruqui’s show in Hyderabad. “Faruqui has spent more than a month in jail. His shows are being banned. For how long will he be targeted? By targeting him individually, they are stopping him from earning a livelihood. When does this end?” asked Vivek Muralitharan, a stand-up comedian from the city. He said that he was not surprised by the reaction of a few politicians to Faruqui’s show. “I am not surprised, but this should not happen. It’s a reflection of the country we are living in. We will have to keep fighting for our freedom of speech.” Another stand-up comedian from the city, Rohit Swain, said, “It’s always on the back of our mind whether or not to crack jokes on a few topics, but we are not holding ourselves back. Our shows are getting sold out, people are coming. Though a few people have an issue, a majority are supporting us and I feel the stand-up culture will go on.” Stand-up comedians from the city said that they were very happy that IT minister KT Rama Rao spoke about the issue and welcomed them in the state. “It’s encouraging for us to see KTR supporting stand-up comedians. Every weekend there are at least eight to 10 shows happening in the city. Except for venue-based restrictions, there are not many restrictions here,” said Bhavneet Singh, another stand-up comedian. He said that a comedian should be held responsible only for bad jokes. “There is no bigger punishment for a comedian than people not laughing at their jokes,” said Singh, adding that comedy is a mirror to society. If someone has a problem with the content, it simply they have a problem with themselves and the society they are living in.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dont-punish-us-for-making-people-laugh-comedians/articleshow/88511008.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Once BJP wins the seat, our focus will be to ensure that this sense of belonging returns among the voters.” Speaking at a function held to inaugurate his election office in the presence of Union minister Shripad Naik, Prabhudessai said his endeavour would be to reach out to all BJP supporters who have, for some reasons, moved away from the party. “BJP has a strong voter base in Margao and efficient organisation will ensure that this constituency comes back to us,” he said. Prabhudessai, a real estate professional and past president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) has been associated with BJP since the time the party began its organisational work in Margao. A former chairperson of the South Goa Planning and Development Authority (SGPDA) and a former vice-chairperson of the Economic Development Corporation (EDC), Prabhudessai has also held important positions on BJP’s state-level committees in the past. BJP won the Margao constituency for the first time in 1994 with its candidate Kamat emerging triumphant. Kamat went on to win for three consecutive terms since 1994 on BJP ticket from Margao. However, when Kamat switched over to Congress in 2005, BJP’s fortunes in Margao slid dramatically and the party has failed to wrest the seat from Congress since then. “BJP scripted history in 1994 by winning the Margao seat. I am confident history will repeat this time,” Prabhudessai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/desh-vows-to-reach-out-to-voters-distanced-from-bjp/articleshow/88511567.cms||---

The project is being executed by the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA). The PMC will support in shifting of utilities like water pipeline valves, streetlight poles in the area, and acquisition of required land for the project. Additional municipal commissioner Kunal Khemnar, who will be the PMC’s coordinating officer for the project, said, “The civic body’s role will be to provide maximum assistance in execution of the project. The PMC’s many departments, such as water supply, electrical, land and estate will be involved in technical support and granting of necessary permissions or NOCs for the work. We will see that all these departments work in coordination so that the project does not face any hurdles because of delay in getting required permissions.” The project is a part of the Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar Metro line. The actual civil work is expected to begin in the next few days. Commuters who travel through the chowk daily want the authorities to complete the work at the earliest. Rahul Hegde, a resident of Aundh Baner road, said that the administration should also clear the bottleneck on Senapati Bapat road. Vijay Shah, another commuter, said that potholes and uneven road surface slow down vehicular movement at SPPU chowk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/special-officer-to-oversee-varsity-chowk-flyover-work/articleshow/88511003.cms||---

Director of College of Engineering Pune, BB Ahuja said that CoEP had received 100% allotments in both the rounds and to date, about 95% of the seats are taken. “Students are now going for their preferred courses rather than their preferred college. Hence they keep trying again in the next rounds hoping to get their favourite course. Currently, we are in the process of conducting college-level admissions,” he added. RM Jalnekar, director of Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, said that the institute plans to start the lectures for first-year students from the first Monday of January.  “While the classes will be online for three or four weeks, we will try for offline classes thereafter. During these three weeks, we will collect their vaccination data and depending upon their status, we will see whether to conduct batches in online, offline or hybrid mode. Almost 85% of our admissions were already over after two CAP rounds and some 300-odd seats remain in VIT and VIIT were kept for college-based admissions. Most seats are over. There will be another round of college admissions and we are sure, all seats will be taken by December 26-27,” he added. At Dr D Y Patil Institute of Technology, Pimpri, after the first two admission rounds, 87% of the seats were filled. Branches like Computer, AI & DS, IT, E&TC, Electrical, Automation & Robotics all received good responses, while branches like mechanical and civil have some vacancies but these are also expected to be filled in the college level round, college authorities said. “We have already started their sessions in online mode on different topics as a part of the induction program as per the guidelines of AICTE,” Somnath Patil, secretary of Dr DY Patil Unitech Society, Pimpri said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/first-yr-engineering-college-lectures-to-start-in-january/articleshow/88511029.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: 5% GST on auto bookings will make rides costlier, say customers||HYDERABAD: App-based autorickshaws which are one of the cheapest vehicles for hire in Hyderabad will not be the same from January 1, as the central government is all set to levy 5% GST on them. Passengers will have to face the tax brunt which would bridge the price gap between autos and cars in cab aggregator applications. Speaking to TOI, general secretary of Telangana auto drivers’ welfare samakhya A Sathi Reddy said the rides they get from apps would certainly decline from next year. “Already, the pandemic has reduced the number of passengers for autorickshaws and other restrictions put in place by the government. This would compound the issue for both auto drivers and passengers,” Reddy explained. App-based aggregators — Uber and Rapido — issued statements urging the Centre to withdraw the decision. Vamsi Krishna, an IT professional based in Jubilee Hills, said: “If GST is going to cost me more than a regular auto ride, then it’s back to square one. People will once again have to deal with autos on the road rather than app-based autos as that at least gives the possibility of giving a cheaper ride. Worse, fleecing passengers will prevail.” An Uber spokesperson said: “While we appreciate the need for the government to collect revenues, we urge it to reconsider this tax, which will end up hurting the earnings of auto drivers as well as the government’s digitisation agenda. We urge the government to reinstate the GST exemption for online auto products in the ride-sharing industry to ensure riders, drivers and cities can keep benefiting from the growth in this sector.” Auto drivers too opposed the move and asked the government to increase the meter fare which was last done prior to the bifurcation of AP in 2014. Sathi Reddy said while prices for essential commodities have increased drastically in the last few years, their requests to have the meter fare revised hasn’t even been considered. “Instead of GST, they could revise the existing fare,” Sathi Reddy added. Sources in the transport department said the app aggregators will now have to share their trip-wise revenue data. “Without the GST, there is a lack of accountability for app aggregators and there will always remain a grey area in their policy. It’s not just about generating additional revenue for the government,” an official from the transport department said.

---||Hyderabad||TRS & BJP heading towards another showdown over show||Hyderabad: TRS and BJP are heading towards yet another showdown with the saffron party threatening not to allow stand-up comedian Munawar Faruqui to perform in Hyderabad on January 9. BJP’s stand opposing Faruqui’s show comes days after TRS working president and municipal minister KT Rama Rao welcomed the comedian along with Kunal Kamra to Hyderabad. Incidentally, KTR’s invite to the comedians followed the BJP government in Karnataka cancelling Faruqui’s shows in Bengaluru. Faruqui took to his Instagram to announce his show titled ‘Dhando’ would be held on January 9 but did not disclose the venue in Hyderabad. Sale of tickets has commenced on an online platform. BJP leaders have written to DGP M Mahendar Reddy not to allow the show accusing the comedian of insulting Hindu gods during his show. Though KTR has already stated that “Hyderabad is truly cosmopolitan” and offers stand-up comedians an “open invite”, even the ruling TRS is treading cautiously. Telangana State Planning Board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar told TOI that no person has any right to hurt the sentiments of any religion, culture or community. “I don’t know what Faruqui has commented earlier in his shows that he is being opposed by some political party and groups. No person or party should belittle any religion and culture or even provoke,” he said. Earlier, KTR tweeted: “We don’t cancel shows of Munawar Faruqui and Kunal Kamra just because we are not aligned with them politically.” His tweet came following Faruqui’s show in Bengaluru got cancelled in November after protests by right-wing groups, who alleged he had hurt their religious sentiments. His shows in Gujarat, Gurgaon, Chhattisgarh, and Goa too were cancelled. Animal husbandry minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav said there was still time for the show and that law takes its own course.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-bjp-heading-towards-another-showdown-over-show/articleshow/88511017.cms||Roushan Ali

He said this will increase the carrying capacity of buses as double deckers can ferry 100 passengers, including standees in a single ride. “It will also reduce wait time for commuters at several bus stops, especially on corridor routes for office-goers,” he stated, adding there was an “adequate number” of small size buses, including AC Minis and Midis. While BEST presently has 48 non-AC double deckers, it has already floated tenders for 200 AC electric double deckers for which bids will be opened before month-end. And now, the GM has announced he will procure more twin-deck buses on ‘wet lease’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-to-get-200-ac-double-decker-buses/articleshow/88511034.cms||Somit Sen
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Migrant trouble: 3,650 cases in five years in Kerala||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As many as 3,650 cases were registered in Kerala by the police over the past five years, in which guest labourers were the accused, show records available with the force. As per the data, these figures raise concerns as the numbers rose consistently since 2016, except 2020 when Covid-19 began and many of them returned home. The number of cases in which the guest workers were accused were 639 in 2016 and it increased to 744, 805 and 978 in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. But in 2020, when a majority of the labourers left the state, the number of criminal cases dropped to 484. There are also instances when such labourers – who are involved in criminal cases here – left the state and caused a major headache for the police during investigation. Of the total guest labourers in Kerala, the government has data about one-third of them (approx), collected by the labour department under an insurance scheme. The department has data on 5.25 lakh labourers, of which approximately three lakh went back home during the lockdown. However, it is not known how many of them have returned to Kerala. During the tenure of the previous LDF government, the department had drafted an ordinance which made it mandatory for every guest worker, coming to the state, to register his/her details with it. However, the ordinance that was forwarded to the law department, did not make further progress. A study into the use of intoxicants by guest workers had shown that the use of pan masala and foreign liquor were common among them. Excise and police officers affirm that many who are returning to the state are carriers of ganja. “It is mostly for their own use, though some also find it an opportunity to make some money. The use of ganja and alcohol among them is a major reason why they are getting more and more involved in criminal activities here,” said a top police officer. On the flip side, labour department sources said that given their work and stay conditions, it isn’t surprising that they vent out their frustration leading to incidents like the one reported from Kizhakkambalam late on Saturday. “The department had earlier tried to conduct an inspection at Kitex, but wasn’t successful. Had officials met the workers there, they could have explained their grievances and such measures could have prevented incidents like the one that happened on Saturday,” said a labour department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/migrant-trouble-3650-cases-in-five-yrs/articleshow/88511037.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Hyderabad||25 lakh people eligible for precautionary dose in Telangana||HYDERABAD: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that people over the age of 60 with comordities will be given a precaution dose beginning January, it is estimated that nearly 25 lakh people in this category will require a precaution dose in the state. Nearly 65 lakh doses (including the first and second doses) have been administered to people over the age of 60 in the state. So far, this is the age group with the fewest eligible people. Telangana has the highest eligible population between the ages of 18 and 44, and nearly 2.73 crore (first and second doses) were distributed to these people. Another 1.17 crore doses (first and second doses) were administered to people aged 45 to 60. In the state, 3.97 doses of Covishield 3 were administered, and 54 lakh doses of Covaxin were administered. According to health officials, more than three-quarters of people over the age of 60 will have co-morbidities, making them eligible for the vaccine drive. “Nearly 20lakh to 25 lakh people in this age group may require the precautionary dose,” a top source in the health department said. Taking the state’s projected population into account, nearly 30 lakh more people in the 15-to 18-year-old age group will be added. “We need more clarity from the Union government on this, and then we’ll be able to derive the correct targeted numbers,” an official said. The state has been on the verge of achieving 100% vaccine first dose coverage, having given nearly 2.76 crore first doses, with a few districts exceeding targets. The state’s total eligible target population was 2.7 crore people. Health officials have been visiting homes of those who have not yet received their first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/25-lakh-people-eligible-for-precautionary-dose-in-t/articleshow/88511040.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Telangana’s private hospitals have procured 51.3 lakh doses ahead of booster drive||HYDERABAD: The booster dose drive in Telangana should go off without a hitch as new data shows the state’s private hospitals have procured the third-highest number of doses — 51.6 lakh — trailing only Maharashtra and Karnataka in the country. In another interesting trend, Telangana — with only 66,000 doses wasted out of over 4.5 crore doses administered — ranks among the top four in terms of the low number of doses wasted. According to experts, despite slight hesitancy and negligence on the part of a very small population, these two trends indicate that regular citizens will be interested in receiving the booster dose. “There is a good public-private partnership in the state. With Hyderabad being the hub of private hospitals, it is assumed high procurement by private hospitals will go a long way in fighting Covid-19,” said Dr Subodh Kandmuthan, director of the Centre for Healthcare Management, Administrative Staff College (ASCI). Telangana follows Maharashtra (1.5 crore doses) and Karnataka (57.43 lakh doses) with most Covid-19 vaccines procured by private hospitals by mid-December this year.  Telangana surpassed Delhi (30.98 lakh) in terms of private hospital dose procurement. Sources in the private hospitals said while the guidelines on precaution doses are to be released, even if there is a high demand, doses will be available in the state and those who can afford them will be able to take it without having to worry about availability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telanganas-pvt-hospitals-have-procured-51-3-lakh-doses-ahead-of-booster-drive/articleshow/88511031.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

In the pilot assessment of the affordable housing schemes carried out by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), it was also pointed out that there is still considerable scope of reducing heat gain in buildings, improving ventilation and day-lit areas to improve thermal comfort and reduce energy intensity of structures. The report, ‘Guidelines for Affordable Housing in Telangana’, was released by special chief secretary Arvind Kumar at a meet organised jointly by CSE and Administrative Staff College.“The report has underscored the importance of integrating thermal comfort requirements when real estate recovery is likely to add millions of dwelling units to formal housing stock in next 3-4 years in India. Else, the new infrastructure can lock in enormous energy and resources guzzling when India has to meet a target of billion tonnes of carbon reduction by 2030,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at CSE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2bhk-projects-lack-access-to-basic-services/articleshow/88511035.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

One case each surfaced in Prakasam and Anantapur districts. According to the state officials, a 48-year-old man returned from South Africa to Hyderabad on December 16 and subsequently proceeded to Ongole in Prakasam district. His sample collected on December 19 came back positive for the Covid-19 the next day. Genome sequencing conducted on his positive sample at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, confirmed it as the Omicron variant. In another case, a 51-year-old man arrived in Anantapur from the United Kingdom on December 18. His Covid-19 positive sample was also declared as the Omicron variant by the CCMB. Both patients have been kept in quarantine and are doing well. Andhra Pradesh public health and family welfare director Dr G Hymavathi said that all the primary and secondary contacts of both patients were tested and found negative for Covid-19. “A total of 67 international travellers and 12 contacts have so far tested positive for the pandemic disease.

---||Hyderabad||Cops remain clueless about motive behind fratricide||Hyderabad: Moments after allegedly killing sub-inspector Umesh Chandra, CRPF head constable M Stephen on Sunday morning turned the automatic weapon, AK-47, on himself, aiming it below his chin. He suffered critical injuries and is now battling for life at a health facility. Investigators, who are perplexed about the motive behind the murder, came to know that the sub-inspector was posted to CRPF 39th Battalion just 15 days ago. “Before joining the battalion, the accused and the victim were not known to each other. As such, there was no possibility of a grudge between the two to resort to such an extreme step,’‘ Mulugu police said. On Saturday, Stephen, a native of Tamil Nadu, was supposed to hand over mess in-charge duties to another constable. Police were verifying whether Stephen was having any issue with regard to handing over charge and if it had any link with the murder. However, the victim’s job had nothing to do with mess and he only went there to have breakfast. There were some persons nearby who were busy in their own work on Sunday morning, but suddenly heard gun shots. The murder took place in an open area, outside the dinning area. On the question why a head constable attached to the battalion mess was in possession of a weapon, the district police said that it was common for constables to have a weapon on them, keeping in view that it was a sensitive Maoist-affected area. The CRPF personnel of the battalion work in coordination with local district police to counter Maoists by conducting regular combing operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-remain-clueless-about-motive-behind-fratricide/articleshow/88511030.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Outsiders make beeline for ‘Hyderabadi New Year’||HYDERABAD: With over 15 states across the country imposing restrictions against New Year celebrations, Hyderabad, which has the least curbs, has witnessed a substantial influx of party goers from across the country this year. Hoteliers and tour operators point out that there hasn’t been any drop in demand due to the Covid situation. In an example of the huge demand sending prices skyrocketing, Brown Town Resort situated at Kanakamamidi increased their charges from Rs 7,000 last year to Rs 35,000 this year ‘in a bid to discourage crowds’. “We are fully booked for New Year’s Eve. No major event is being hosted. We are serving nine to 10 cuisines and a live band will be playing music,” Sanketh Reddy, managing director of Brown Town Resort, said. Even pubs in remote areas on outskirts of Shamshabad are expected to be jam packed this year. Gringo Shack, one such pub, has seen over 100 bookings already for December 31 night. “We are priced competitively and we have kept an entry limit. We already reached the limit. Entries will be allowed on 31st night only if there is a no-show by those who have made bookings,” Vidya Shankar, the event organiser for that day, told TOI. The average occupancy rate amongst hotels stands at around 80% during this new year eve, according to Telangana Hotels Association. Speaking to TOI, B Jagdish Rao, secretary of Telangana Hotels Association admitted that due to lack of government strictures, there has been an influx of people looking to celebrate New Year to Hyderabad. “Some hotels situated on the main roads have already touched 100% (occupancy rate). Hotels and restaurants impose Covid guidelines by themselves,” Rao told TOI. Tours and travel operators point out that a large chunk of people will be entering Hyderabad from Vijayawada, Kakinada and Vizag. Apart from them, people from other cities like Bengaluru, Chennai and several places across Kerala are looking forward to partying in the city. Party goers in the city who are desperately looking for a place to host a party point out that options are running out. “We checked Airbnb, Oyo resorts and even directly contacted farm houses, but the answer is ‘it’s already booked’. The ones that are available are insanely expensive and pubs are pretty unaffordable,” K Vamsi Krishna, an IT professional rues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/outsiders-make-beeline-for-hyderabadi-new-yr/articleshow/88511057.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Further he said, “The police must strengthen security here and allot more policemen to the Dabolim airport as such incidents have become common.” The police later managed to pacify the members of the association and send them back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/taximens-body-demands-action-after-attack-on-cabbie/articleshow/88532323.cms||---

In a letter to Sanjay on Sunday, KTR termed the proposed deeksha as an “opportunistic stunt” by BJP and said the saffron party should actually be holding a dharna at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi against the Modi-government for leaving the unemployed youth in the lurch. The minister also termed NDA government as “no data available (NDA) government” over its alleged refusal to provide any data sought by the state. He dared BJP to publish a white paper on jobs it has created or employment notifications issued, either in central government or in states where it is in power. “Has BJP government given more jobs than any of the states ruled by it?” KTR questioned. He also sought to remind the BJP state president that unemployment rate was the highest in the country in the last 40 years due to failures of the BJP government. “Let alone its slogan of ‘achhe din,’ Centre did not give a rupee after announcing a Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package to tide over the financial constraints arising out of the pandemic,” he said. The minister added that Telangana was among those states with the least unemployment rate. “In fact, the TRS government paved the way for reverse migration of people with employment opportunities. The state has provided 1.33 lakh jobs as against its promise of one lakh jobs,” KTR said. “Another 16 lakh jobs were generated ensuring investments of Rs 2.2 lakh crore. How many jobs did BJP give out of the 2 crore jobs per annum promised? How many jobs did youth from Telangana get from them?” he questioned. “In fact, the BJP state president should be using the deeksha platform to apologise to people for not being able to confront the Centre over its failure to fill up 15 lakh jobs under its purview,” KTR said. The TRS working president charged Sanjay of going on fast to provoke youth, divert them from education and their attempts to explore jobs, thereby playing with their lives. “TRS understands the aspirations of youth and would continue its work to create more jobs in private sector too in future,” KTR said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-deeksha-on-jobs-an-opportunistic-stunt-ktr/articleshow/88511077.cms||Roushan Ali

Reason: Special entry darshan tickets were stopped following the outbreak of the Covid pandemic. For six years, over 30 major post offices and another 1,200 sub post offices in Telangana would issue ‘TTD Seva’ tickets to customers. “We used to issue at least 300 to 500 tickets a day to our customers based on the slots given by the TTD, but we haven’t got TTD clearance to re-start seva tickets,” said a senior Telangana postal circle official. The tickets, costing Rs 300, could be availed by showing aadhaar cards as ID proof. TTD started allowing devotees in from June 11, 2020, after Covid-19 lockdown was lifted. However, it is taking long to get TTD nod to issue tickets at post offices, said the official. Currently, TTD issues all sevas tickets through TTD branch offices and official portal. Stating that people, mainly senior citizens, would benefit if they can get tickets by visiting post offices nearby, the postal official said it would be good if the service was started as soon as possible. When TOI contacted Kalvakuntla Vidyasagar Rao, who was a TTD member and TRS MLA from Koratla of Jagtial district, he said, “post offices issuing TTD tickets is a relief to hundreds of customers, who wait in long queues at TTD branch offices, to obtain seva tickets. In fact, TTD took the initiative to allot slots at post offices for the convenience of devotees. I will raise this issue in the next TTD Board meeting and ensure the service is re-started.” “I am eagerly waiting for TTD’s clearance to get tickets from the post offices,” said G Lakshma Reddy, a 60 year old. “I want to book TTD special entry darshan to visit Tirumala during the ensuing Sankranti festival.” Counters as well as requisite software is in place, just TTD’s nod is required, chief postmaster, Hyderabad GPO, A Subramanyam, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ttd-counters-at-gpos-deserted-as-ticket-services-yet-to-resume/articleshow/88511083.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Goa||I-League: Rajasthan United lodge protest against Punjab FC for fielding suspended player||Panaji: Rajasthan United FC took the field with just nine players on their I-League debut against Punjab FC on Monday. They fought and lost 0-2, but the debutants believe they deserve three points after lodging a protest against their opponents for fielding a suspended player. In their protest letter submitted to the match commissioner after Sunday’s encounter, Rajasthan United have said that Robin Singh was an ineligible player and could not have been part of the squad, after picking up a red card in the last official match that he played. “Robin Singh was issued a red card in his last I-League match of the 2019-20 season against East Bengal on March 9, 2020. It was in the 80th minute that Singh received a red card. Subsequently, the season ended, and he did not play any game under AIFF jurisdiction till today,” Rajasthan manager Gabriel Gomes wrote in his protest letter. The club has cited Article 46 of the AIFF Disciplinary Code which states that the limitation period for the enforcement of sanctions is five years. “This means his suspension gathered in that match still holds. He has not served his one-match ban and should not have been named in the squad by RGPFC,” states the protest. Robin was listed among the substitutes by Punjab for the opener, but the striker did not take the field. Interestingly, the former India striker – seated on the bench -- was red-carded in the 68th minute after what appeared like abusive behaviour towards match officials. CK Vineeth, another substitute, was also red-carded. Referee Jama Mohamed issued the marching orders after consultation with fourth official Akashkumar Kamleshkumar Mehta and match commissioner Ratheesh Kumar. “The AIFF disciplinary committee has already taken up the matter,” a senior official told TOI. “What remains to be seen is whether a player becomes active in the game, even if he has technically not taken the field. Robin did not have any role to play in the game. He was an unused substitute. The AIFF will have to refer to previous instances and decide on this matter.” The first team from Rajasthan to qualify for the I-League had only nine eligible players and could not register more due to the AIFF’s rule regarding registration of amateur players outside the transfer window. Rajasthan qualified for the I-League in October much after the summer transfer window had closed on August 31. The winter window opens on January 1, leaving the club to rely on free or non-contracted players and amateurs. The club is expected to be at full-strength when they face Aizawl FC in their next clash on January 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-league-rajasthan-united-lodge-protest-against-punjab-fc-for-fielding-suspended-player/articleshow/88530951.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

He alleged that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and his family members were cultivating paddy in 150-acre land at Erravalli of Gajwel constituency in the yasangi season. “KCR is saying there won’t be any procurement centres for paddy in the yasangi season. KCR must explain how, where and at what price he proposes to sell the paddy being cultivated in his 150-acre field?” asked Revanth.

Addressing the media, he said: “We have changed the venue from Dharna Chowk due to Covid- 19 restrictions, but what is the problem for the TRS government if we conduct Deekha at our party office?” He dubbed chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao an autocrat after claiming that hundreds of BJP and student activists were arrested on their way to participate in Deeksha. “The TRS government is afraid of losing power because of the growing support for the BJP and anti-establishment sentiment against their rule,” he said. More than 600 unemployed youth committed suicide in the state, Sanjay added. Seeking support for the agitation from the state’s intelligentsia, he stated that “they should condemn the attitude of the state government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-afraid-of-deeksha-demanding-jobs-bandi/articleshow/88511085.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||PM Narendra Modi must give clarity on reviving farm laws: TRS||HYDERABAD: The ruling TRS has demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should give clarity on the talk of the three central farm laws being revived after they were repealed a few weeks ago. Finance minister T Harish Rao on Sunday demanded that Modi should come clean on the issue and that Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar should withdraw his comments that the three draconian central farm laws could be revived in future. He also demanded that Union minister Tomar tender an unconditional apology to the farmers for his comments on farm laws revival as many farmers lost their lives during the year-log agitation against the draconian farm laws. The finance minister sought to invoke the blessings of the presiding deity at Komuravelli Mallanna temple in Siddipet district to give the required sense to the centre to take a correct decision on procurement of paddy from Telangana. Addressing a gathering after offering the silk clothes to Komuravelli Mallikarjuna Swamy at the temple along with animal husbandry minister T Srinivas Yadav and labour minister Ch Malla Reddy on Sunday, Harish said the three farm laws were repealed after more than one year of agitation and sacrifices of about 700 farmers. TPCC chief A Revanth Reddy also condemned Tomar’s statement that the farm laws might be revived. “The ‘suit boot ki sarkar’ of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is insulting the farmers by stating that the farm laws might be re-introduced,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pm-must-give-clarity-on-reviving-farm-laws-trs/articleshow/88511088.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Attack on minorities: Oppn leader writes to PM||Thiruvananthapuram: Opposition leader V D Satheesan has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his urgent intervention in preventing attacks against Christians in Karnataka, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. In his letter, the opposition leader said that it is disturbing to see that the right-wing groups showing allegiance to the RSS have unleashed attack on the Christians in states like Karnataka and Gujarat. He said that these are in violation to the right to life and religious freedom as guaranteed by the Constitution. Citing the instance that happened at Kolar in Karnataka on December 11 this year, where Christian groups were attacked and their religious texts were set on fire, Satheesan said that no one was arrested in connection with the incident and the police are hand-in-glove with the perpetrators. Satheesan said that as per the report of the NGO People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), as many as 39 attacks on Christians were reported in Karnataka in 2021 alone. In most of these cases, the minorities who suffered the attack were forced to shut down their places of worship and stopped from assembling for their Sunday prayers. He said that in most of these cases, police attacked the believers and the pastors instead of arresting the actual perpetrators. “The police had issued formal notices to the churches prayer meetings. The failure of the state further marginalises a minority community in how they live their lives struggling to access education, shelter, food, livelihood, and basic dignity even during the Covid pandemic,” he said. He further said that the decision by Karnataka government to bring a legislation on forced conversions has made the situation further volatile. These laws are being introduced to harass and intimidate minority communities, he said. Satheesan also recalled the incidents of violence in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, to request the Prime Minister to intervene and put an end to such atrocities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/attack-on-minorities-oppn-leader-writes-to-pm/articleshow/88511104.cms||---

The suspects shot an objectionable video of the girl and then raped her. Haveli police have intensified the search for the two men. On December 22, the Sahakarnagar police arrested Ishwar Shinde (20), Kunal Bhangare (19) and Nilesh Netake (21) of a village near Sinhagad fort for sexually exploiting a 12-year-old girl from a village located near the fort and also making objectionable videos of the girl. Haveli police said the minor girls were sexually exploited in the last two weeks of November. A team headed by senior police inspector Swati Desai of Sahakarnagar police found Shinde moving on the Taljai hill suspiciously. Police questioned him and studied his cell phone. The police stumbled upon an objectionable video clip of a minor girl in the phone and questioned Shinde. Shinde then narrated how he shot the video, while Bhangare and Netake sexually exploited the girl. The police invoked charges of an unnatural sex offense against the trio. The case was forwarded to the Haveli police station for further investigation as Sinhagad fort area comes under the jurisdiction of Haveli police. During the course of the investigation, inspector Sadashiv Shelar and his team learned that the three arrested men and their two accomplices have sexually exploited a 15-year-old girl from a village in the same fashion, and had shot her video in an objectionable way using their cell phone. Following this, the Haveli police registered another case under the Pocso Act against the three arrested men and two accomplices for sexually exploiting a 15-year-old girl and making objectionable videos using their cell phones. The police have also invoked provisions of unnatural sex offense against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/three-arrested-men-sexually-exploited-another-minor-girl/articleshow/88511089.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: From Old City bylanes to swanky IT offices||HYDERABAD: The son of a small-time businessman in the old city’s Kishanbagh area, Syed Jawwad Ali Hashmi had a choice of taking care of his dad’s business or eking out a career in engineering in Hitech city. After his father’s demise, Hashmi put in years of hard work in college to realise his dream of brushing shoulders with hundreds of young engineers as a business process associate (BPA) in a multinational company (MNC) in tech city for the last two-and-half years. Not just Hashmi, hundreds of techies living in non-descript bylanes of Old City are now making their way to the swanky offices of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, HSBC and dozens of other tech companies as IT and ITeS executives. These youth from Old City are now inspiring more youth to take the same path. “I am extremely satisfied with my position. I am so grateful to have achieved so much in these two-and-half years of my experience and looking forward to growing more in my career ahead,’’ Hashmi told TOI. “I mostly work on my own but when I need, I've always found that a team is there to help me around. The idea is to keep your eye on the goal and contribute well and never lose your focus,” he added. Most youths said that after overcoming an initial inhibition of working in a big office, they realised how there is no discrimination when a MNC hires an employee. “It purely depends on one’s qualification and skill and not from where you belong. So many educated and eligible youth from Old City are working in MNCs. Getting a higher role in a MNC is an extremely competitive process and the amount of skill sets that require and other attributes are at the highest level,” says Syed Ilyas Ali Hashmi from Bahadurpura. Dr Susanta Misra, a well-known career and hiring consultant in Hyderabad says that as the world continues to go through the process of digital transformation, there is an enormous number of new opportunities emerging which were not there even a few years back. “There are growing opportunities in data analysis, data engineering and data sciences areas where demand is far higher than supply,” he said. Meanwhile, Syed Mansoor Ghouri, from Tadbund, who works with Accenture suggested that MNCs should also start setting up offices in Old City. “It can be a step forward towards a big development in our city with lots of opportunities and recruitment,” said Ghouri. Other youth working in the IT sector said that transportation facilities from the area can be improved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/from-old-city-bylanes-to-swanky-it-offices/articleshow/88511094.cms||---

The incident took place around 5.30pm on Sunday owing to an old festering rivalry between them, the Alankar police said. Later at night, police detained three assailants. They are being questioned. Victim Anil Rajendra Jadhav had reportedly gone to drop his sister, who works at a fast food centre in Karvenagar, on his motorcycle. Cops said that this was when the suspects grabbed him and attacked him with sharp weapons. Jadhav sustained deep cuts on his head and shoulders. Later, he succumbed to his injuries. The entire incident was captured by closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, police said. A team was immediately deployed to look out for the three assailants, who were presumably found. Gaikwad told TOI, “We have detained three men for attacking Jadhav with sharp weapons and causing his death. Jadhav was unemployed and used to do odd jobs, sometimes working as a real estate agent. Jadhav had beaten up two of the assailants two days ago. They decided to take revenge on Sunday evening.” Police have filed a case of murder against the trio.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-men-kill-youth-with-sharp-weapons-in-karvenagar/articleshow/88511105.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana’s low tenant landholding bodes well for crop shift plan||HYDERABAD: Among top paddy cultivating states in the country, Telangana has the second-lowest tenant landholding at 17.3%. The neighbouring Andhra Pradesh has the largest tenant landholding at 42% in the country. At a time when paddy cultivation and farm laws are being hotly debated in the country, data obtained by TOI reveals that states with high paddy extent have a minimum of 22% tenant holding. The low figure in Telangana, according to experts, is a positive sign for the state, particularly as crop diversification is being considered. As per the NSO’s “Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households, Land and Livestock Holdings In Rural India” data, Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Punjab, Haryana and Assam are the other top paddy producing states in the country. According to the state's estimation, Telangana’s total agricultural landholding is 1 crore acres, with approximately 18 lakh acres under tenant holding. Experts aver that Telangana’s low percentage is due to landholding pattern, whereas the situation in Andhra Pradesh is due to social and cultural patterns as the majority of land-owning communities have migrated to other states and countries. “Going by Rythu Bandhu data, most owners in Telangana have small landholdings and they take extra land on lease for cultivation, which is good considering that unlike tenant farmers, owners will be more willing to experiment with crops and make changes even if it requires a little more investment,” said GV Ramanjaneyulu, agriculture scientist with the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA). Ramanjaneyulu, however, pointed out that MSP and other benefits go to landowners when it should go to tenant farmers instead. According to some observers, the tenant land percentage could very well be much higher in the state. But due to uncertainty surrounding MSP, it is estimated that small landholding owners who take extra land on lease for paddy may no longer do so. “Due to confusion over MSP for paddy, the land lease rates may drop to some extent. If benefits reach tenant farmers, it will help push required changes in the agriculture scene,” said Ravi Kanneganti of Rythu Swarajya Vedika.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ts-low-tenant-landholding-bodes-well-for-crop-shift-plan/articleshow/88511113.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Kochi||Kochi: Syro-Malabar priests observe hunger strike on Christmas||KOCHI: Priests of the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese observed a hunger strike on Christmas day from 10am to 3pm as a protest against the liturgical reforms being implemented by the leadership of the Syro-Malabar Church. The protest was held under the banner of Archdiocesan protection committee, an organization of priests. The priests said that the fast was held to protest the highhandedness and the decision to impose liturgical practices by the Syro-Malabar Church major archbishop Cardinal George Alencherry and the synod members. The fast commenced near the Christmas manger set at the Archdiocese headquarters here. Around 200 priests participated in the fast. “The mass facing the people was deeply ingrained in our hearts, culture, and spirituality. It was banned without even listening to the priests and laity,” said the priests. The fast is intended to convey the message that we would not bow down to the southern lobby of the Syro-Malabar Church, which was bent on adopting the outdated Chaldean practices, the archdiocesan protection committee said in a statement. Various dioceses in the Syro-Malabar Church had been following different modes of celebrating Holy Mass, an obvious difference being the priest facing the churchgoers during the ceremony in some dioceses and facing the altar in other dioceses. The unified way is a combination of both, and it was set to come into effect from November 28 across the Church but the metropolitan vicar of Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese formally declared that he was granting exception from the unified style of mass to the archdiocese as he received permission for it from Rome. His declaration was after a meeting with the Pope at the Vatican. Similar exception was then granted to Irinjalakuda diocese too. Cardinal Alencherry, however, on December 10 issued a directive to ‘correct’ the exemptions stating that the Church received a letter from Rome, which stated that an entire archdiocese cannot be provided dispensation from implementing the liturgical rules approved by the synod. Irinjalakuda diocese withdrew the exemption after this directive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/syro-malabar-priests-observe-hunger-strike-on-xmas-day/articleshow/88511115.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: MVA delegation seeks governor’s nod for speaker poll||MUMBAI: A delegation from the MVA government met governor B S Koshyari on Sunday to seek his approval for the election to the post of the assembly speaker on Tuesday. The governor has sought more information before granting his assent and the episode could well become another flashpoint between the state government and governor Koshyari. The delegation said Koshyari told them he would seek advice and get back on the matter by Monday. “We requested the governor to approve our programme for the speaker’s election. He said he will seek more information and revert. We are confident he will give his approval,” said revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat of the Congress after the meeting. He was accompanied by food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal of the NCP and urban development minister Eknath Shinde of the Shiv Sena. The state cabinet had approved Tuesday, December 28, as the date of the speaker’s election, a post which has been vacant for 10 months since Nana Patole quit to take charge as state Congress chief. The state also moved an amendment for the election to be held by voice vote rather than the earlier practice of a secret ballot. The move was triggered by concerns over cross-voting. The amendment was passed by the assembly despite opposition from the BJP, which argued that it was unconstitutional. The BJP also demanded that their 12 suspended MLAs be reinstated before the speaker’s election is held. “The amendment of holding the election through a voice vote follows the practice in the Lok Sabha. We have followed all the rules in making the amendment,” said Thorat. He also said the govenor is expected to act on the advice of the chief minister and the cabinet. The MVA government and Koshyari have long been on a collision course. A year after the government submitted a list of 12 nominees for the legislative council through the governor’s quota, he is yet to clear the names. Koshyari also questioned the Thackeray government for not reopening Hindu places of worship during the Covid-19 pandemic. The MVA has also retaliated against the governor by denying him the state aeroplane to fly to Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mva-delegation-seeks-guvs-nod-for-speaker-poll/articleshow/88511994.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

It decreased to 300 by 1pm, and 299 at 2pm and rose to 306 at 4pm. It was recorded at 304 on Saturday.The data of the past seven days shows that the air quality of the city was poor or very poor on all days except December 20, when the index was 192, which comes under “moderate category” with possible health impacts as “breathing discomfort to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases”.The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) authorities said it might be because of local factors. Ludhiana PPCB chief environmental engineer Gulshan Rai said, “As the temperatures have dropped, the pollutants are not getting dispersed, which is why pollution has increased. It will decrease after rainfall or wind blows pollutants away.”The PPCB officials said increase in vehicular traffic during the year-end also contributed to the rise in AQI, though its effect was not much.Residents are, meanwhile, suffering due to high pollution levels.“It is difficult to go out for a walk because of smog. Not only the children and the elderly, but even the youth are facing health issues due to the pollution levels,” said Mandeep Singh, a city resident.AQI indicates the quality of air in an area and takes into account respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and sulphur dioxide, ozone, oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide, benzene, xylene, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/city-breathes-very-poor-air-for-second-day-in-row/articleshow/88510526.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Ludhiana||7% GST hike from Jan 1, textile, garment inc angry with Centre||Ludhiana: With just five days to go for January 1, when the GST on textile and garments will increase from 5% to 12%, businessmen are furious. They have urged the Centre to reconsider its decision or they will be forced to start an agitation. They said the increase would not only lead to a hike in the rate of garments, but would also mean requirement of more funds to run businesses.Coming out heavily against the Centre, Harish Kairpal, president of Ludhiana MSME Association, said, “Only five days are remaining. Textiles and garments that right now are billed at 5% GST will become expensive. By putting such a huge tax burden on us, which will make our end products costlier, the government is forcing us on the path of agitation. It is our request to the Centre to defer this decision for six months at least or we will be forced to start a state-wide agitation.”According to Vinod Thapar, chairman of the Knitwear Club, “During the past few months, we have sent repeated requests and multiple representations to both the Centre and the state, asking not to increase the GST from 5% to 12%. But till now we have received no positive response. So, we have called a meeting of the business associations of the sector on Monday to chalk out our plan to counter this illogical move.”Atul Saggar, general secretary of Apparel Manufacturers’ Association, Ludhiana, said, “The government has not studied the ground realities. There is a big number of small factories and small-time retailers and distributors. So if the GST rate is increased by 7%, not only will the garment's cost increase for the consumer, but the investment in business will also shoot up for the factory owners who already are facing hardships.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/7-gst-hike-from-jan-1-textile-garment-inc-angry-with-centre/articleshow/88510522.cms||Mohit Behl

The accused cop is married and has a child. He was recently transferred to Balia district. The survivor, a paramedic, had lodged a complaint under IPC sections of rape and forceful conversation against another man in 2019. The accused constable then approached her on the pretext of helping her, and allegedly raped her at gunpoint while she was alone at home in December, 2020. According to the police complaint, the survivor had earlier fallen for a man who introduced himself under a pseudonym and had allegedly raped her on the pretext of marriage. After the woman came to know of his real identity, she lodged an FIR and stated that he was forcing her to convert. During investigation, the accused constable approached her and said he could help. The woman claimed that she tried to approach the authorities concerned but the accused convinced her to not lodge any complaint by promising to marry her. She then started living with him until she came to know that the constable was married and has a child in Bareilly. When she confronted him, he threatened her with dire consequences if she told the matter to anyone. The circle officer of the region said, “We have received a written complaint from a woman, who is a rape survivor. She said she was raped by a police constable. An FIR under IPC sections 376 (rape), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 504 (intentional insult) has been registered against the accused constable, and we have shared the information with the authorities where he is deployed at present. A departmental inquiry will also be conducted against the accused.

---||Goa||Goa among top 3 states in Centre’s good governance index||Panaji: Goa has emerged as one of the top three states with efficient governance models, ranking third in the Centre’s Good Governance Index (GGI) 2020-21, which was released on Saturday. Goa scored 5.35 as against a score of 4.29 in 2019, indicating a near 25% improvement over the earlier exercise conducted by the department of administrative reforms and public grievances. Among the 10 well-developed states, Goa tops the rankings in terms of public infrastructure and service utilities. The index also indicates that Goa has taken strong strides to improve the agriculture and allied sector industrial growth, social welfare and environment. In the overall healthcare sector ranking, Goa was placed third, behind Kerala and Maharashtra. While Goa remains the leader when it comes to availability of doctors at PHCs, many other states have shown a “worrying trend of decline” in doctors at PHCs. The report has also found a “marginal decrease in the percentage of doctors” available at PHCs in Goa. The index also takes into account actions to mitigate climate change such as polices, planning and initiatives taken by the government. In this aspect, Goa is firmly lodged at fifth place, suggesting that more needs to be done. In the evaluation of citizen-centric governance, particularly participation and transparency, Goa stands fourth, behind Haryana, Gujarat and Punjab. The ranking for GGI 2020-21 is based on ten sectors and 58 indicators. The sectors are agriculture and allied sectors, commerce and industries, human resource development, public health, public infrastructure and utilities, economic governance, social welfare and development, judicial and public security, environment and citizen-centric governance. The report was released on December 25, which has been designated by the BJP-led government as good governance day to commemorate the birth anniversary of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Among the better off states, Goa has shown the highest incremental change of 24.7% in 2020-21 over 2019. This is followed by Gujarat, with the second-highest incremental change of 12.3% change over 2019. However, when it comes to the Goa government’s economic management skills, the state is placed a lowly seventh among the Group A states. Goa is placed fifth with regards to welfare of the citizens particularly health, education, economy, employment and empowerment of the less privileged groups. Goa also showed a poor rating for aspects of the justice system such as access to the judicial system, judicial performance and human rights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-among-top-3-states-in-centres-good-governance-index/articleshow/88511663.cms||---

At first, they tried to douse the flames with fire extinguishers. But when the blaze spread, they called up the fire department.The firemen took more than four hours to control the situation. Material as well as machines kept inside the factory were damaged in the incident.The fire officials said they received a call at 6am that fire had erupted in Sungrace Fabric Private Limited. “When we reached the spot, there were flames all around at the second floor of the unit. First, we tried to stop its spread to other floors. The blaze had engulfed the big hall of the second floor. To give a vent to the smoke, we had to break the walls at five to six places. This also helped water reach each corner. There was heavy machinery, raw material, like yarn stock, and ready products in large quantities at the unit,” said a fireman.Sub-fire officer Aatish Rai said, “The factory workers told us that sparking triggered the fire and it spread in no time around 5.30am. They used fire extinguishers, but when they could not control it, they called us up. As the factory is spread over 3,000 square yards, it was tough to reach every corner. Water supply was arranged from an adjoining factory. The fire tenders made at least 40 rounds. Due to intense heat, even the walls and the ceiling of the building were damaged.”Meanwhile, the incident spread panic in the area. Arun Kumar, who runs Amit Hosiery near the garment factory, said, “Around 6am, I received a call from my staff about the fire in the adjoining factory. I rushed to the spot. Due to the blaze, walls of my factory were also hot. We announced a holiday in the factory on Sunday for safety purpose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/close-shave-for-workers-as-fire-rips-through-garment-unit-at-kali-sadak/articleshow/88510548.cms||---

Rubbishing BJP’s claim that TMC is anti-Hindu, Dhavalikar challenged BJP to explained why work of Kundaim Tapobhoomi has been pending. During late Manohar Parrikar’s tenure, he said, developmental works worth Rs 3 crore were sanctioned for Tabobhoomi but nothing has been done to date. BJP has taken away MGP MLAs but in the bargain has lost people’s respect, he said. Speaking on education, Dhavalikar said the governmen has forced online education on students even as several areas have poor internet connectivity. MGP functionary Ketan Bhatikar said Goans will not tolerate the BJP government’s attempt to sell government jobs. While another functionary Vinayak Gawas said, “This government has deprived people of employment in the mining belt. It has lost the right to govern.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vote-for-mgp-tmc-alliance-for-corruption-free-govt-dhavalikar/articleshow/88511662.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Mumbai||Ministers leading appellate bodies must drop political hat in Mumbai: High court||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has held that when a minister presides as an appellate authority under the law to decide even matters of defection she or he has a “more higher and solemn role” when the dispute pertains to rival political interest. The minister, who wears two hats, must drop the political hat while deciding appeals and act with complete neutrality as mandated by law, said Justice Girish Kulkarni. “Such role would require a high degree of consciousness of the responsibility attached to the office, impartiality and objectivity, coupled with maintaining the highest values of rectitude, to be adhered in discharging the adjudicatory functions,” said the HC on December 9, when disposing of petitions that sought disqualification of four Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Corporation corporators, including Vijaykumar Rai, Ashwin Kasodiya, Geeta Jain, for dishonouring the whip issued by BJP group leader Hasmukh Ghelot during the mayoral polls. Ghelot challenged the October 29 order of the divisional commissioner of Konkan Division dismissing his application for Rai’s disqualification. His application was under provisions of the Maharashtra Local Authorities Members’ Disqualification Act which the divisional commissioner first decides. The commissioner’s order can be appealed within 30 days before the state government and is heard by a minister. Ghelot alleged that the “minister would possess a bias” as he’s from Shiv Sena. “It cannot be overlooked that when the…minister presides as an appellate authority, he wears two hats. The first hat would be the adjudicatory hat conferring power, authority and jurisdiction to discharge functions as an appellate authority. The second hat, to be kept dormant, would be as a member of a particular political affiliation,” said Justice Kulkarni. He added that the minister “would necessarily be required to remove the second hat when he wears the hat of an appellate authority. Justice Kulkarni said, “It would be premature for the petitioner to presume any bias of the appellate authority, even before taking recourse to the appellate remedy.” The HC permitted Ghelot to file appeals before the minister and directed their expeditious disposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ministers-leading-appellate-bodies-must-drop-political-hat-in-mumbai-high-court/articleshow/88512005.cms||Swati Deshpande

Lourenco said he endevours that his constituency will be part of the ruling dispensation, and added that TMC has the capacity to form the next government. Last week, the former Congress working president resigned as an MLA and quit the party to join TMC. “I will go to my people to convince them of my decision,” he told reporters on Monday. Taking a dig at Congress for not supporting him in his constituency, Lourenco said, “I did everything on my own in Curtorim. I have spent my personal funds. I undertook all the works in my constituency without anybody’s help. Nobody even came and inquired, whether I faced any problems.” “If I am a part of the ruling government, then I can fulfil the wishes of some people. The youth of my constituency are seeking jobs, they have aspirations. How do I help the youth who want to start business? Despite being elected as an MLA, I was unable to carry out these works,” he said. Lourenco said that his decision to join TMC has surprised many people, including his supporters, well-wishers and close friends. The three-time former MLA said that he wants to assure the people of his constituency that there will be no compromise on the issues and interests of the state. “Many parties approached me, but I joined TMC. I see that it is a party that can defeat BJP. I have not joined BJP, nor shifted sides after winning elections,” he said. The former MLA said that he joined TMC which is ready to fight BJP on the streets. “Congress never moved a resolution to appreciate my work. They have not even felicitated me. I have worked in the agriculture sector for the past 15 years,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-spent-my-personal-funds-in-curtorim-constituency-lourenco/articleshow/88531765.cms||---

The team conducted autopsies of a few cattle on Sunday and the report is awaited. Most of the cattle that died were milch cows. Officials suspect that the cattle died of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), a highly contagious viral infection that afflicts livestock. However, the confirmation will come after the autopsy report is available. Budaun’s chief veterinary officer (CVO), Dr Arun Kumar, who visited the villages along with his team for inspection, said ,“We suspect the spread of Food and Mouth Disease may be the cause of death. We have started vaccinating the livestock. Lack of timely treatment leads to the death of cattle. We have sent the samples to the lab for further tests and we are trying to control the spread of this disease in the nearby villages.” The health department, meanwhile, has advised the villagers to bury the carcasses of the animals to ensure that infection, if any, does not spread among healthy animals. The high incidence of cattle deaths was reported from Bakarpur village and adjoining Barkhera village under Wazirganj police station area. The villages comprise a population of about 1,500 people. Their primary occupation is agriculture and dairy farming. In fact, almost every house has cattle. On Friday morning, residents of Bakarpur found some 20 cattle dead. All were fine the day before. The cattle deaths have come as a blow as many have invested a lot of money in buying and rearing buffaloes and cows. The local residents of Bakarpur then met sub divisional magistrate, Bisauli, Jyoti Sharma and requested her to take steps to save the cattle. On the directions of the SDM, Budaun’s CVO, Dr Arun Kumar, along with his team visited the villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/team-probes-cattle-deaths-after-100-die-in-1-mnth-in-2-budaun-villages/articleshow/88510570.cms||---

So far, 6,845 BMC staffers have been infected by the novel coronavirus. Of these, 6,145 had recovered as of the first week of December. The highest deaths, 54, were reported among employees in the solid waste management department, followed by the health department, which lost 43 employees. Last year, the BMC lost two senior officers to Covid-19. While deputy municipal commissioner Shirish Dixit (55) died at his Mahim residence in June last year, hours after he tested positive for Covid-19, assistant municipal commissioner of H-East ward succumbed to the virus the month after, July. BMC officials said requests for Rs 50 lakh compensation for the kin of around 200 employees were sent to the Centre and a few employees received the compensation. BMC gave compensation to the kin of a large chunk of its deceased employees. In May last year, the BMC had announced Rs 10 lakh compensation in case of death of its staff because of Covid-19. The amount was hiked following pressure from employee unions. BMC officials have been at the frontline in the fight against the coronavirus since March 11, 2020, when the first Covid-19 case was reported in Mumbai. “SWM (solid waste management) and healthcare workers have been on duty even during the stringent lockdown during the first wave and then during the second wave too. We have lost many staffers in the second wave. The SWM department had the highest deaths since its workers have been collecting waste even from Covid hospitals. The health staff have been treating those infected, so these departments have the highest fatalities,” said a civic official. The fire brigade carried out its duty right through the first and second Covid-19 waves and lost 12 employees. The BMC security department lost 14. Nine contract workers of the solid waste management department also succumbed to the infection. “BMC workers have been at the frontline everyday since March 2020. The BMC must set up a special cell to clear their dues and give them compensation. Their kin must be given jobs immediately after the death of the staffer. The BMC is spending so much money on fancy projects, it must give Rs 50 lakh compensation to all deceased employees,” said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. A municipal official said that the BMC first sends all applications of claims in the case of staff who have died because of Covid-19 to the Centre for compensation under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana. If the claims are rejected, the BMC gives Rs 50 lakh compensation and a job to a family member under its preferential treatment case scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-loses-over-250-of-its-staff-to-coronavirus/articleshow/88511634.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

He said that MGP has “sold” 31 seats to Trinamool for which Rs 1 crore has been transferred to the bank. “The remaining amount will be paid directly to the beneficiary,” Mamledar said. Mamledar alleged that Trinamool is showing only bags to the people as they have brought big money to Goa for election. “People of the state will reject Trinamool and it will not even win a single seat,” he said. “I know MGP leaders very well as I have been closely associated with them,” he said. Mamledar said that in the 2017 assembly election, MGP fielded candidates and claimed that they have been given Rs 80 lakh to spend during the election. The former Ponda MLA said that TMC is assuring tickets to more than three to four persons in one constituency. “That means it will cheat three people who they have brought to the party fold with an assurance of giving a ticket,” he said. He also said that women are being fooled by them by promising Rs 5,000 per month through Griha Laxmi. Reacting to the statement of TMC's Rajya Sabha MP from West Bengal, Luizinho Faleiro likening him to a passenger, Mamledar said it applies to Faleiro too. “If I am a passenger, then he is also a passenger. TMC has come with the bus and the passengers will get down wherever they want.” On the chief ministerial candidate, Mamletdar questioned, “Will Trinamool agree to the announcement of MGP president Pandurang (Deepak) Dhavalikar nominating his brother Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar as the chief ministerial face of the MGP-TMC alliance?" Mamledar, a former police officer, has had inimical relations with the Dhavalikars for a long time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mgp-tie-up-deal-with-trinamool-worth-crores-claims-lavoo/articleshow/88531793.cms||---

Sawant said one of the key differences Goa is witnessing in this election is the banner pollution started by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s and Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s political parties. Sawant said that pasting posters on public and private property is blatant disregard for authorities as well as Goa’s beauty. “Some of them are already facing complaints for defacement of public property. I have asked the authorities to deal with such menace strictly. I am confident that Goans will reject such forces in the upcoming elections,” he said. Recently, PWD had written to both the collectors for defacement of government property by political parties. “In the wake of the forthcoming assembly election political parties have defaced the government property, especially the piers/walls of vehicular underpasses in the elevated stretches of the national highways and other roads. You are requested to kindly take necessary action in the matter,” PWD chief engineer (national highway) D C Gupta said in a letter to both the collectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/poster-pollution-sawant-for-action-against-aap-tmc/articleshow/88531799.cms||TNN

The civic body is ready with its integrated command and control centre (ICCC) under the Smart City mission wherein cameras installed under the safe city project will be connected. The ICCC is expected to be inaugurated in the coming week.The officials said they would keep a tab on solid waste violators and those who harm the public property, like damage and encroachment of roads. “Over 300 new cameras are to be installed and these will also be connected with the ICCC,” the officials added. Under the Smart City mission, there is a provision to connect 1,742 cameras, out of which around 1,400 are already installed and will be attached with the ICCC. In addition to the 30 vehicle-mounted cameras, 600 infrared illuminators will also be part of the project, the cost of which is Rs 35.96 crore. There had been complaints of people and MC employees burning garbage instead of disposing it of. In the absence of any proof, no action could be taken, though there is a provision to impose a penalty for solid waste violation. But with CCTV surveillance, officials will be in a position to take action. Apart from this, garbage disposal in Buddha Nullah and Sidhwan Canal can also be checked. Screens have been installed inside the ICCC building and after inauguration, monitoring will start.Additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal said, “The project is ready and we will start it shortly. We will keep an eye on those who burn garbage, throw it anywhere on roadsides or in water bodies. Encroachment attempts will also be checked. More cameras will be installed under this project at a later stage.” The ICCC has been set up at Zone D office of the MC and in many cities such a project is already working.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/big-brother-to-watch-those-burning-trash-littering-roads/articleshow/88510593.cms||---

The MMC action follows an inspection by its sanitary inspector that revealed “huge amount” of unsegregated waste generated from the recent Saras exhibition organised by RDA lying dumped at the venue, and plastic waste being burnt in the open at the end of the 10-day event held at SGPDA parking ground. In his directions issued to the RDA South Goa district director, Fernandes pointed out that “the act of dumping of such waste in an unsegregated manned has created problems and hardships for the municipal council in safe disposal of municipal waste” and that it was prohibited under Solid waste management Rules 2016, Goa bio non-degradable Garbage Control Act 1998 and liable for penalty. In his directions to the SGPDA member secretary, Fernandes said that the SGPDA had engaged laborurers for cleaning and sweeping the plastic waste from the vent, and instead the waste was set on fire. He said that this has created an “environmental problem” and is prohibited under Solid waste management Rules 2016, Goa Bio non-degradable Garbage Control Act 1998, and Environment Protection Act, and is liable for penalty. Fernandes also censured the two officials for having organised the exhibition without taking valid permissions from the MMC and “thereby also creating financial losses to the council.” They have been directed to deposit the penalty amount within 24 hours. They have also been directed to appear before Fernandes on January 4, 2021, with written submissions and undertaking to the effect that the act won’t be repeated, “failing which MMC will initiate action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/margao-civic-council-fines-govt-officials-for-violating-waste-rules/articleshow/88511659.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: RAT, surveillance recommended to check Omicron spread & spike||Pune: In addition to conducting genomic sequencing of Covid-19 positive samples, increasing the use of rapid antigen test (RAT) over RT-PCR and regular undertaking of syndromic surveillance to quickly isolate and treat symptomatic persons can check spikes even without stringent curbs. The measures should focus on maintaining a fine balance between preserving lives and livelihoods, medical experts and epidemiologists have said in view of fear over the Omicron variants community spread. “The imperatives for the next few weeks or at least a month should address the threat of the new variant that India’s rural and peri-urban areas may also face in addition to urban areas,” senior clinical epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee said. In addition to conducting genomic sequencing of positive samples which is currently concentrated mainly in Mumbai, Pune, and Thane, it is prudent to step up syndromic or fever surveillance in the community especially in areas or pockets showing high positivity rate to rule out cluster formation, he added. The falling or rising trends of groups of symptoms (syndromic surveillance) in the community suggestive of Covid-19 can also guide authorities, experts said. Currently, fever surveillance has almost stopped or is carried out in a haphazard way and there is no uniformity, the experts said. Senior public health expert Dr Subhash Salunke, former advisor to the Maharashtra government on communicable diseases including Covid-19, said, “Fever or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance is key to keep a tab on early signs of picking up the spread of communicable diseases like Covid-19.” A focus on it by involving a sizeable number of private clinics and hospitals across the state including areas/districts with declining as well as those reporting some spike in Covid cases across Maharashtra including Pune is necessary, he added. There are a group of signs and symptoms such as fever, cough for respiratory infections and loose motions, vomiting, and diarrhoeal diseases for picking up suspected cases of different diseases including Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rat-surveillance-recommended-to-check-omicron-spread-spike/articleshow/88511679.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Rane also said that he has asked the CM to revert the land handed to the IIT back to the state revenue department. “With reference to all the cases filed against the villagers of Shel Melauli village in Guleli panchayat during the IIT protest, I have written a letter to chief minister @DrPramodPSawant to drop all charges against them. This issue needs to be put at rest as there will not be an IIT in Guleli and as decided by the cabinet,” Rane tweeted on Monday evening. “I have requested the CM through my letter and email to withdraw the cases with immediate effect. I shall be meeting with him in this regard to follow up on the same. I am confident that the CM will pay heed to my request in public interest,” said Rane. Rane’s statements come in the light of Shel Melauli villagers resuming their agitation, demanding withdrawal of the criminal charges filed against them and seeking reverting of the land handed over the IIT back to the state government. “In addition, I would also like to make a request to the CM, that the land that was transferred for IIT must be taken over by the government and reverted back to the revenue department,” Rane said. The IIT project planned at Shel Melauli was withdrawn in mid-January 2021 as protests from the locals intensified, leading to a clash between villagers and police personnel. The clashes resulted in criminal charges being filed against the villagers, which are yet to be withdrawn, even though the project itself at Melauli stands scrapped. At the height of the protests from villagers, Rane backed the villagers and said that he had not been informed that police force would be engaged by the government to diffuse the protests. Villagers said they are opposed to the project as they have been kept in the dark over its details by the state, until government surveyors were found surveying horticultural land of locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/withdraw-cases-against-locals-in-iit-matter-rane-to-sawant/articleshow/88531801.cms||---

The minister said his department is taking steps to ensure a fair and transparent recruitment process. He stated that rigging of recruitment exams was not limited to Maharashtra, and added, “Question papers of recruitment exams held in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh have also been leaked.” The minister gave the statement during his visit to Jalna, which he represents as guardian minister as well. The cybercrime branch of the Pune city police are currently investigating the alleged malpractices in the recruitment exam for the health department, TET as well as MHADA. The police have already arrested incumbent as well as former commissioner of Maharashtra state council for examination Tukaram Supe and Sukhdev Dere. Several other suspects, including former and current directors of GA software (the private agency hired for conducting the exams) Ashwin Kumar and Piyush Deshmukh, have also been arrested. Tope said, “The decision to consider the results of the recently concluded Groups C and D health department recruitment exams will be taken on the basis of police investigation findings.” Tope said he has made a suggestion: If the police find that the alleged malpractices during the exam were limited to a very few candidates, the recruitment exam may then be considered a qualifying exam, before a final recruitment exam or scrutiny is initiated.  “If this exam is considered a qualifying exam, then the top 10% candidates may be shortlisted for another exam,” he said. The health minister went on to announce that the department will also do away with the OMR answersheet system for the recruitment exams. He said: “There will be major changes introduced in the recruitment examination process, including steps to ensure there is no human interference in the end-to-end scrutiny process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/private-agencies-not-to-conduct-health-dept-exams-anymore-tope/articleshow/88509869.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Files have been kept pending for bribes. Otherwise, either the chief minister or Kavlekar himself should publicly announce that it is not so,” Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar alleged. Tulio D’Souza, Congress spokesperson said the party ill do away with Section 16B of the town and country planning Act, if Congress forms the next government. “Former TCP minister had said that Section 16B has been used as an ATM card,” D’Souza said.  Chodankar said the concern of the party has been Goa’s land which is under attack over the misuse of Section 16B. “Scrapping Section 16B will be the first decision once Congress forms the government,” said Chodankar. Congress also demanded that the permission issued to a high-profile project at Curca-Bambolim be revoked alleging that it was given despite a portion of the land under the project comes under no development zone. The party has already filed a complaint with the vigilance department and Lokayukta pertaining to the illegalities in granting permission to the project. Chodankar said that a ban on sale of agricultural land to a non-agriculture person will be part of their election manifesto. The party has condemned the Centre’s decision to freeze the bank account of Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/high-level-corruption-intcp-ministry-congress/articleshow/88531810.cms||---

Though the DMA has issued three reminders, CCP has yet to submit a reply. The DMA has sought information regarding financial irregularities and misappropriation of municipal funds by former CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues during his tenure with the municipal body. In May, TOI had reported that the civic body had flouted state government recruitment norms while hiring six staff members including a “garden consultant” who had been paid Rs 60,000 per month since October 2019. RTI documents to back TOI’s story showed that not only did CCP fail to obtain prior approval from the department of urban development, CCP also ignored the DMA’s directive issued in February 2020 which said that the appointments of some of the workers was rejected as there was “no sufficient justification for such an expenditure” for a garden consultant. A former CCP employee Gregory Jacques filed a complaint with the DMA and sought a probe into the matter. “This office is in receipt of a complaint dated October 27 from Gregory Jacques. In this regard, no reply has been submitted by you till date. You are requested to submit the Action Taken Report (ATR) in the matter within seven days from the date of receipt of this reminder,” said deputy director for urban development Vivek Naik. Officials said that while CCP is yet to reply to the DMA’s notice, CCP has gone ahead and renewed the contract of five of the staff members in question for another year, till December 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/municipal-admin-body-asks-ccp-for-report-on-recruitment/articleshow/88532360.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt misusing police force: Congress||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat unit of the Congress party alleged on Sunday that the BJP is misusing the police force to intimidate the opposition. According to the Congress, a group of about 40 policemen barged into an organizational meeting being held at Bharuch, under the pretext of looking for an accused who has been granted bail on the condition that he will not enter the limits of Bharuch district. Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president, Jagdish Thakor, and other office bearers were taking part in a district level organisation committee meeting when a posse of cops arrived at the venue at around 1pm, looking for one Sandeep Mangrola, an accused in a sugar co-operative case. “Although the police were told that Mangrola is not present in the meeting, the cops barged in and carried out a search. This is an attempt by the ruling party to intimidate the opposition. We have registered our protest in the matter,” said state Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi. Doshi added that the BJP government is resorting to such tactics because it has realised that people are fed up with the BJP and will vote for change in next year’s election. “This is a desperate attempt of the ruling party to silence the voice of opposition in Gujarat,” the spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-govt-misusing-police-force-cong/articleshow/88511147.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kochi: Guest workers run riot, revellers attack police||KOCHI: At least eight police personnel, including an inspector, were injured after guest workers clashed among themselves and later attacked police at the labour camp of Kitex group in Kizhakkambalam near here early on Sunday. Police have arrested 24 labourers for the violence while over 150 of them have been detained.  Sources said the incidents began when a group of migrant labourers, reportedly from the north eastern states, at the camp decided to conduct a Christmas carol. A few others objected to the celebration at night and entered into an argument, which later escalated into a brawl. The labourers, who were reportedly intoxicated, turned their ire towards police personnel who reached the spot to defuse the situation. Kunnathunad inspector V T Shajan and sub inspector A S Sajan had to be rushed to hospital. Images of Sajan in a blood-drenched uniform had gone viral on social media after the attack. A police jeep was set ablaze while another was vandalized by the miscreants using sticks and stones. “The labourers had a quarrel among themselves over the carol. There is an allegation that security personnel had used force on some of them. Later, police were intimated, a control room vehicle responded and they called for backup as the situation was worse than expected. The inspector had gone to the spot with around 10 policemen, when he was attacked and the police vehicle set on fire. Armed police were later deployed to bring the situation under control,” a senior officer with Ernakulam Rural police said. Kolencherry medical college sources said four policemen were brought there early on Sunday. "Four others, who came to the spot from the AR camp, came to the hospital in the morning. Inspector Shajan suffered a dislocation to a finger on the left arm and we are planning a surgery on Tuesday. One policeman suffered a deep wound on his lips while another had a tendon injury in his hand,” one of them said and added that none of the injuries were critical. Police have formed a special investigation team under Perumbavoor ASP Anuj Pallival. The 19-member team includes two inspectors and seven sub-inspectors. A battalion of 500 armed policemen has been deployed in the area. DIG Ernakulam range Neeraj Kumar Gupta and district police chief SP K Karthick visited the spot and met the injured personnel. “We will be taking strict action against all those involved," the SP said. The clashes also turned political as the Kitex group is headed by Sabu M Jacob, who is also the chief coordinator of Twenty20 Kizhakkambalam that wrested control of the panchayat in the last two elections. Ernakulam DCC president Mohammed Shiyas said Sabu was also responsible for the violence. “The company owner has the responsibility to inquire where his workers are getting drugs and intoxicants from,” he said, adding that the government and police have been supporting the company. Sabu dismissed the charges and said politicizing the clashes is an attempt to tarnish his company's image. He said such an incident was happening for the first time in the company's history and it needs to be probed how the labourers acquire intoxicants. All those detained could not have been involved in the violence and migrant workers in general shouldn’t be seen in a bad light, he added. The Kerala Police Association condemned the attack and demanded a comprehensive inquiry. It also sought proactive action to avoid repetition of such incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/guest-workers-run-riot-revellers-attack-police/articleshow/88511148.cms||---

The samples of parents of one of the returnees, who tested positive for Covid-19 recently, were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune. Vinay Gowda, the chief executive officer of Satara Zilla Parishad, said, “The Uganda returnees stayed at their house in Phaltan for a short duration before being taken to the Omicron ward at the civil hospital. After testing all the high-risk contacts of the three returnees, we found that their elderly relatives tested positive for Covid. The new Omicron variant spreads rapidly, and anyone coming in contact with the infected person, even for a brief period, gets infected. All the patients are asymptomatic, and the Uganda returnees are likely to get discharged soon.” Gowda said, currently, there is no reason to panic as the daily Covid count is limited to 20 to 25. However, an alert has been sounded at the administrative level. “As per the government policy, we are allowing home isolation to the persons returning to India only from no-risk countries. Now we will have to ensure that the home isolation is strictly followed. Also, we are ensuring that the pace of vaccination increases. At present, 64% of the beneficiaries above 18 years of age are fully vaccinated,” said Gowda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/number-of-omicron-cases-in-satara-district-rises-to-5/articleshow/88509879.cms||---

This time Madgaonkars will play a decisive role in forming a stable Congress government in 2022. I appeal to my fellow Madgaonkars to give me an opportunity to represent Margao for the eighth consecutive time,” Kamat said. Criticising TMC and AAP, Kamat said he was least bothered about the new entrants from outside the state. “Goans do not need parties from outside. Goa should remain in the hands of Goans. Just as Goa has defeated West Bengal in football whenever the two teams have played, I am confident Goa will kick the West Bengal party back to its state this election. Another party is promising free power, free water, etc to Goans. During my tenure as the chief minister, not a single Goan came to me asking anything for free. Goans are self-respecting people earning their living by the sweat of their brow. I am sure they won’t fall for their (false) assurances,” Kamat said. Freedom fighter Vaman Prabhugaonkar, vice-chairperson of Margao Municipal Council Dipali Sawal, South Goa district Congress president Joe Dias, and others were present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kamat-urges-madgaonkars-to-bring-back-govt-of-prosperity/articleshow/88531824.cms||---

Former CM Manohar Parrikar had devised a strategy in the 2012 polls by supporting independents/non-Congress candidates in Salcete constituencies and trading it off with their support for forming a BJP-led government. The exercise came to be known as Mission Salcete. “There is no need of any Mission Salcete this time,” Sawant told reporters at the launch of the election campaign of Fatorda MLA Damodar Naik at Fatorda. “Though we won’t field candidates on the party ticket in all eight constituencies, I am sure all BJP-supported candidates will win.” Sawant said that whatever development that has come about in Salcete has been during the last 10 years of BJP government. “Development of Salcete has always remained a priority for BJP during the last ten years. The fact that Goa has been ranked third in the centre’s good governance index is a reflection of the pro-people, pro-development governance BJP has provided to the state,” he said. He expressed his resolve to lead the state towards prosperity over the next five years. Coming down on MGP for its alliance with TMC and for certain remarks made by their functionaries, Sawant said, “Those who have come from outside the state should refrain from speaking on our culture and its conservation. These parties have no concern about Goa and Goans,” he said. Naik, in his address, said that he would lay stress on providing employment to locals if he wins the election. He said that whatever development that has been done in Fatorda was an outcome of the works he had initiated during his term as MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-need-for-mission-salcete-but-bjpmay-not-field-in-all-8-seats-sawant/articleshow/88531814.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: It’s time to Indianise the judicial system, says Justice Nazeer||HYDERABAD: Justice S Abdul Nazeer of the Supreme Court on Sunday said that there is every need to ‘Indianise’ the judicial system which is still riddled with colonial baggage.  Speaking as a chief guest at the national council meet of the Akhil Bharatiya Adhivakta Parishad (ABAP) at Hyderabad, the judge spoke of the ancient judicial system in India that demanded justice even from kings. “But today we pray for justice and call the judges as lordships and ladyships,” he said, stating that the lawyers must strive to bring Indianness into the judicial system. Justice Abdul Nazeer in his speech turned critical towards the current Indian legal system because it shows its colonial psyche while administering justice. “British colonialists protected their subjects only upon surrendering their rights to the rulers. In those days Justice could not be demanded, but rather it was allowed by the state as a matter of concession,” the apex court judge said. “This contrasts with the ancient Indian legal systems where justice could be demanded. Because Justice as a concept was inbuilt in Indian systems,” he added. Delving further into the subject, Justice Abdul Nazeer said mounting backlog of cases is rendering judges helpless. Disregarding certain cases as trivial is also part of a persisting colonial mindset, the judge said. “There is no doubt, this colonial legal system is not suitable for the Indian legal system. We have to eradicate the colonial mindset by Indianising our judicial system. It may take time, but I hope my words will evoke some of you to think about steps to decolonize the Indian legal system,” he said. “I firmly believe that such an attempt would be a worthy effort that could revitalize the Indian legal system and align it with cultural, social, and heritage aspects of our great nation,” Justice Nazeer said, adding that it would ensure a much more robust justice delivery system. “To achieve our constitutional goals, we must give due regard to the ancient legal practices. The role of the Indian Judiciary cannot be isolated from the social objectives of the nation,” Justice Abdul Nazeer added. Justice A Rajasheker Reddy of Telangana high court and others participated in the inaugural session of the two-day meet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/its-time-to-indianise-the-judicial-system-says-justice-nazeer/articleshow/88511335.cms||---

In all, 785 mucormycosis cases were reported across the district since the second wave of the pandemic began, out of which 84 succumbed to the infection. The remaining 701 managed to recover fully with many requiring major surgeries.  Out of the 701 patients that were cured, 423 were treated in hospitals run by the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), 103 were treated in SMBT College, 79 in Dr Vasantrao Pawar Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, 24 in General Hospital Malegaon, nine in DCHCs, 8 in Malegaon corporation hospital and 55 in Igatpuri civil hospital. “Nashik district today (on Sunday) has zero active case of mucormycosis and all patients undergoing treatment at various hospitals have been discharged,” Dr Sanjay Gangurde, ENT surgeon at civil hospital, said. The civil hospital that keeps record of all the patients pointed out that 511 of 701 had to undergo major surgeries including removal of eye or nasal portion where the fungus made its home. Mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, was present in general cases related and were reported at a rate of one case per month or even less. However, Covid-19 accelerated the rate of infection among people who were comorbids and administered steroids for saving their lives during the course of treatment. “Not every person, who was critical and administered steroids, had mucormycosis. But at the same time all the cases that were treated for the infection had history of Covid and the medicines included steroids,” a senior official from the district administration said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-active-case-of-mucormycosis-in-nashik-district/articleshow/88509897.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Nagpur||Contractor printed sign of officer on bill, accounts dept cleared it||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) accounts and finance department was allegedly hand in gloves with contractor Padmakar ‘Kolba’ Sakode in Bogus Contracts Scam. The contractor ‘printed’ the signature of a head of the department on a bogus file, and the accounts and finance department still cleared the bill and paid the amount to the contractor. A NMC official told TOI, “Bogus contracts worth Rs74 lakh came to fore in the library department. Education officer Priti Mishrikotkar is also head of library department. Contractor scanned signature of the officer and printed it on the note-sheets. The signature appears genuine in some files. But it is skewed in some files.” Despite the signature being scanned and printed, the accounts and finance department overlooked the discrepancy. The civic body has already suspended three staffers from accounts and finance department, and departmental enquiry (DE) is going on against five, including chief accounts and finance officer Vijay Kolhe. In health, solid waste management, and birth and death registration department, the contractor had reportedly forged signatures of officials and employees by pen. Another official from NMC said, “Initially, 41 files of health department were found to be bogus. Three bogus contracts were of Rs3 lakh and approved by Kolhe, who is head of accounts and finance department. Remaining bills were below Rs2 lakh so they were approved by accounts officer Rajesh Meshram, who has been suspended, and also arrested by police. Kolhe, in reply to show cause notice, claimed his signature was also forged in the file,” he said. Thus, the contractor and his team had forged signatures of over 10 officials and employees of health, solid waste management, library and birth and registration department. The seven-member committee headed by additional municipal commissioner Deepak Kumar Meena is yet to submit its report even though its deadline ended on December 23. The committee was formed on December 17 and deadline for submission of report was seven days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/contractor-printed-sign-of-officer-on-bill-accounts-dept-cleared-it/articleshow/88511153.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

This, they say, is among several other impediments caused to children as a result of the pandemic that began around two years back. Speaking at a workshop conducted by the Hear ‘N’ Say Clinic, Dr Garima Vegivada, clinical director of speech language pathology explained that there are indications of rise in ASD cases in the last one year, with most therapists seeing more cases than normal. “Kids require regular therapy sessions to improve their abilities, especially during the crucial ages of two to six years when maximum brain development takes place in the infant. But pandemic put a break on these sessions. The children were deprived of the therapy and lost unrecoverable precious years,” Vegivada said while addressing parents of children with ASD. Autism is a condition associated with sensory processing leading to difficulties in organising and responding to information received from the sensory organs. Persons with this condition face immense challenges in their day-to-day lives which impacts their physical and mental well-being and growth. The workshop provided four activities for kids and hands on training for parents to demonstrate behavioural issues and ways to handle them.

Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav told TOI that private companies will be roped in to set up the EV charging stations. “We will provide land to the firms on rental basis so that they can set up the EV charging points. The firms will have to incur the expenses towards setting up the charging points,” he said. “The private firms will be provided with the space on rent for a period of 25 years. This will help the owners of the electric cars charge their vehicles at a location of their convenience,” he said. The state government has already introduced EV policy to boost use of electric vehicles. Jadhav has already taken initiative in promoting EVs in the city. The civic body recently issued an order making EV charging points mandatory for all residential societies having 25 or more apartments with one EV charging station after every 25 flats. Moreover, the civic administration has also chalked out a new policy to procure electric and CNG vehicles for its various departments. The general body of the NMC, during its recent meeting, has given approval to the proposal of the civic administration to buy electric and CNG vehicles in future. Currently, the NMC has various vehicles like car, suction machines, garbage vans, mobile clinic, hydraulic platform that either run on diesel or petrol. But the civic body will now procure either electric or CNG vehicles as per the availability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-identifies-28-locations-for-electric-vehicle-charging-stations/articleshow/88509910.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Nashik||Nashik: Cops to keep strict vigil on drunk drivers on December 31||NASHIK: The city police officials have decided to maintain a vigil on drunk drivers on December 31, as there is always a possibility of motorists indulging in drunk driving during the New Year celebrations. However, the use of breath analysers for checking drunk drivers has been stopped by the police due to Covid-19. ACP Seetaram Gaikwad of the city traffic branch said, “There will be heavy police bandobast to nab the drunk drivers on December 31. If the traffic police suspect that a motorist could be driving under the influence of alcohol, they would simply take the person to the government hospital for a blood test and examination.” Gaikwad said that drunk driving not only puts motorists at a risk but also endangers the lives of others on the roads. Every year, on New Year eve, there is a heavy police bandobast in the city to prevent rash driving under the influence of alcohol. However, since the outbreak of Covid-19, the police have stopped using breath analysers. Only the motorists who visibly seem intoxicated are taken to hospitals for medical examination. If the driver is found to be drunk, he/she would be booked for drunk driving. On the backdrop of the same, this year till October 20, the city police have booked only 20 persons for drunk driving. Keeping in mind the tendency of a section of people on New Year eve, the traffic police have decided to maintain a full bandobast to ensure that people are not driving their vehicles after consuming alcohol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/cops-to-keep-strict-vigil-on-drunk-drivers-on-dec-31/articleshow/88509915.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Goa||AAP: BJP trying to polarise voters to hide its failures||Panaji: Stating that the BJP government has failed on all fronts, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) charged that the ruling party is using all means, including creating a communal atmosphere to hide its failure. “Today Goans celebrate each others festivals unitedly across all religions. However, BJP is creating a communal atmosphere across the country just to hide its failures,” said AAP vice-president Valmiki Naik. “These are only attempts to distract Goenkars from the real issues that are plaguing Goa like unemployment, failure to save Goan lives and social schemes not functioning properly,” said Naik. “BJP is polarising people due to religion just to hide their failures. They want to talk about everything, but the issues impacting Goenkars. High prices, no Griha aadhar or delayed Griha aadhar payments, plans on how to help the aam aadmi these find no mention in the BJP’s statements," said AAP functionary Adv Amit Palekar. “Goenkars will teach BJP a lesson and will not let them polarise their state,” added Palekar. AAP condemned the attack on Christians in some BJP -ruled states. Invoking the spirit of togetherness that’s intrinsic to Goan culture, the party demanded answers from the BJP for its inaction. AAP said that while Goans unitedly celebrated Christmas and have a history of living and celebrating together, BJP is trying to divide the people in an attempt to hide its failures in governance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-bjp-trying-to-polarise-voters-to-hide-its-failures/articleshow/88531865.cms||TNN
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ED to file chargesheet against Anil Deshmukh this week||MUMBAI: This week, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) will file a chargesheet against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh in the money-laundering case it is investigating against him. The agency had arrested Deshmukh in the case on November 2. He is presently in judicial custody. The ED expedited its probe to file the chargesheet within the stipulated period of 60 days of the arrest to prevent Deshmukh from obtaining default bail. The chargesheet is likely to include statements of state transport minister Anil Parab, former chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh and the 12 Indian Police Service (IPS) and State Police Service (SPS) officers who allegedly obtained desirable posting on Deshmukh’s recommendation, among others. The agency is investigating if these IPS and SPS officials obtained their posting through consideration during Deshmukh’s tenure. The ED has been unable to get a copy of the report of former state intelligence department commissioner Rashmi Shukla, who had recorded telephonic conversations of some influential persons who were allegedly discussing transfer-posting of police officers in exchange for money. The agency has examined the allegation that Deshmukh had favoured police officers for desirable transfer-posting for consideration based on related statements and documents collected during the probe. It will be the second chargesheet in the case. In August, the ED had filed its first chargesheet against Deshmukh’s Nagpur-based trust, Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, his then private secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-to-file-chargesheet-against-deshmukh-this-wk/articleshow/88511701.cms||Vijay V Singh

She said the central government will intervene if the exam paper leaks continued. Recently, the question paper for the recruitment exam in the health department was leaked causing inconvenience to thousands of students. “Papers are leaked before exams and while giving the exams. The candidates are unable to comprehend what is going on. The responsibility to conduct exams is given to the companies, which are blacklisted. Despite all this, I am unable to understand why the state government is not taking strict action. If such paper leaks continue, the Centre has to intervene and take steps,” said the minister speaking in Kolhapur.  Talking about the Covid pandemic and the expected third wave, the minister said the states have been given all the authority to decide to impose lockdown or not. “We are issuing guidelines. I hope they are followed in letter and spirit by the states. The state governments are given the power to impose lockdown,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/centre-will-intervene-to-stop-paper-leaks-bharati-pawar/articleshow/88509926.cms||---
---||Nagpur||VNIT shuts campus after 4 students test Covid positive||NAGPUR: The Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) in the city has shut the campus after four of its students tested positive for Covid and asked all students to return home. The classes will, however, continue in online mode. The infection broke out on the campus after BTech students started arriving in batches between December 20 and 23 for physical classes. Around 600 students had reached the campus for the classroom teaching, scheduled to reopen from January 3, first time after the pandemic started last year. The institute has also stopped all physical classes for MTech and PhD students, who had restarted attending in-person since November 15. They were supposed to be on campus for attending practicals. Now, February 18 has been fixed as the new date for restarting physical classes, depending on the prevailing Covid situation then. The institute’s decision has landed many students, particularly from far off places and foreign countries, in a quandary. For foreign students, it is nearly impossible to return as the airfares have skyrocketed to nearly Rs50,000 one way. The decision has not gone down well with the students. “This is unfair. It is our last year. We will never go to campus again. We had been eagerly looking forward to classroom teaching, campus life and hands on experience,” some students told TOI. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the Covid positive students have been shifted to MLA Hostel Covid Care Centre and AIIMS Nagpur. “Around 600 students and some staff members have been tested in the last couple of days. If the institute wishes so, students can be isolated on the campus itself,” he said. A VNIT spokesperson said one building was reserved to quarantine students arriving from different cities and countries. “As per protocol, we were conducting RT-PCR test of every student. Till the results came, they were asked to isolate in the designated building. They were allowed to move to hostel room only if they tested Covid negative,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson added 310 students are still in the hostel, while 242 have returned home. “We came to know about positive cases only from students. NMC officials didn’t inform us. They have also allowed students to travel to home town after giving samples,” the spokesperson added. The institute has also ruled out permission for students to stay back. “It is clear, the new variant — Omicron — spreads faster and we don’t know who is carrying what kind of infection. It is a matter of everyone’s safety. Students were unhappy and reluctant to go back. Some said they would go back after New Year celebrations,” the spokesperson said. The students faulted the campus administration for the outbreak. “There were no checks on the movement of students whose test results were pending. Everyone was allowed to have meals in the common mess. Students were ready to stay in rooms, but no arrangements were made for food delivery at the doorstep,” they said. They added that testing led to crowding and many moved out to get the free test done. “They were charging Rs700, so some of us decided to get a test done at government centre. International students were allowed to mingle with others without any quarantine,” they claimed. The spokesperson said the tests were done free of cost later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vnit-shuts-campus-after-4-students-test-covid-ve/articleshow/88511177.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The accused, Shanta Chavan, lives with her husband, a labourer, and their three children, including the deceased infant, in the Mahatma Phule slums in Kalwa. “Based on our initial investigation, we have found out that Chavan gave an excessive dosage of cough syrup to her infant son on Thursday as he was unwell and coughing frequently. We believe this led to his death,” said deputy police commissioner Avinash Ambure. The scared woman then dumped the body in a neighbourhood water drum in the early hours of Friday and approached the Kalwa police alleging her baby was missing. A kidnapping case was accordingly registered and the police launched search operations. The police checked the CCTV footage around the slums, but didn’t find anything suspicious. It was only when police teams searched the area that they stumbled upon the infant floating in a plastic water-filled drum near the family’s residence on Saturday morning. The infant was rushed to a public hospital where he was declared dead. The police subsequently questioned a few neighbours, including family members of the accused, and learnt the baby was ailing and was under his mother’s supervision. The mother’s role was exposed after she faltered several times during questioning by the police. The case was cracked within 24 hours by the police. “The woman told us she was scared of being reprimanded by her family after the baby fell lifeless after consuming the syrup and so she cooked up the story. We suspected something amiss, and she admitted to her crime during our interrogation,’’ said a police official. Chavan has been arrested for charges of murder and destroying evidence. “We are investigating the case further to know the motive,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-moms-excess-dose-of-cough-syrup-leads-to-infants-death/articleshow/88513608.cms||Manoj Badgeri

He visited Shrinath ji temple at Nathdwara. He addressed a gathering of BJP workers. While quoting the rape of a 15-year-old girl in Bundi and the recent attack on RTI activist, Poonia targeted the Congress and said a peaceful state like Rajasthan has become the capital of crime. During discussions with the BJP office-bearers, he inquired about the programms of the BJP in Rajsamand and talked about strengthening the party before the upcoming elections. Poonia targeted the Congress and said that the Congress government had promised loan waiver of the farmers in Rajasthan but has not yet fulfilled the promise. The tribal youths are demanding employment but no employment is been given. The unemployment rate in Rajasthan is more than 27% in the state and a peaceful state like Rajasthan has become a crime capital. Poonia said that Rahul Gandhi had come to Rajasthan to rally against inflation, but the inflation, corruption and anarchy in this country is all because of Congress party. Rajasthan has the most expensive electricity in the entire country. One village has boycotted electricity bills since many years. Higher VAT on diesel and petrol is in the state is the reason for rise in the inflation. The fuel prices in the neighbouring state is lower than Rajasthan, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-has-become-capital-of-crime-poonia/articleshow/88511188.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: 25 FIRs filed against illegal moneylenders, 35 arrested||PUNE: The Pune city police have registered 25 FIRs against illegal moneylenders and arrested 35 people, including a police constable, for their involvement in the illegal money lending business. Some of the money lenders were found to be charging as high as 60% interest rates on the money loaned. On Friday, crime branch officials arrested an illegal money lender from Yevalewadi for issuing threats to a businessman (32) from Kondhwa. The businessman had taken a loan of Rs8lakh from the moneylender about a year ago. The moneylender was demanding Rs22lakh, including interest and principal from him. When the businessman expressed his inability to pay the huge amount, the moneylender started issuing threats to him. Similarly, in a joint operation by the Pune city crime branch and Shirur police on December 19, six men, including a police constable and a moneylender, were arrested for kidnapping a businessman (33) from Shirur and keeping him in confinement at a tin-sheet room at Dhankawadi. Police teams raided the spot and rescued the businessman and later arrested the six men. The suspects had issued threats to the businessman, demanding 60% interest on the amount loaned. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said, “We have now focused our attention on illegal moneylenders operating in the city. They are not only harassing the victims but are also getting involved in the incidents of kidnapping, assault, house trespass and others.” Police have issued a dedicated phone number 9145003100 for people to complain against harassment by moneylenders. “The number of the cases against moneylenders has gone up in last two weeks after we started special drives. We have registered 25 cases in the last two weeks. Our action will continue,” Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/25-firs-filed-against-illegal-moneylenders-35-arrested/articleshow/88511187.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Pune||Pune: Bail for fashion designer accused of forcing girlfriend to lodge bogus FIR||PUNE: A sessions court in Pune has granted bail to a 29-year-old fashion designer facing charges of assaulting his girlfriend with a chopper and later forcing her to lodge an FIR claiming that the two were attacked and robbed of their valuables by three unknown persons in Bopdev ghat on the evening of August 16. The court granted the bail in the wake of some fresh revelations, relating to blackmailing, brought to its notice by the lawyer representing the accused. The woman, who works with a spa and massage centre, had said in the FIR on August 16 that she was attacked by three unknown men. Later, on September 5, her designer friend had approached the city police commissioner with an application complaining that the woman was blackmailing him for money and threatening him with false implication in the case. The Kondhwa police, investigating the case, arrested the fashion designer on September 14 and he has since been lodged in jail. Lawyer Zaheer Khan Pathan, representing the accused, told TOI, “We brought to the court's notice that it was after the complaint application to the police chief that the woman started implicating our client in the case, resulting in his arrest.” In the court, Khan submitted that the applicant intended to marry the woman, but learnt that she had multiple affairs and had previously blackmailed another person in a similar manner. In fact, the victim in that case had registered a complaint against her with the Kondhwa police and the matter was then compromised after the victim gave her money. The lawyer furnished to the court a couple of sonography reports as well as hospital's discharge report to establish that the complainant woman had undergone an abortion in the past to establish the multiple affairs claim. Sessions judge G P Agrawal, who heard the bail matter, referred to the FIR, chargesheets and annexed documents and observed in his order on December 24, “From the perusal of documents, it becomes evident that the informant (complainant) was having multiple affairs with different persons. The informant was pregnant by some other person prior to the incident. The informant started blackmailing the applicant and demanding money from him. The applicant also came to know that one person also filed a complaint against the informant and the said matter was compromised.” The court further noted that the accused has already been languishing in jail for over three months and any apprehensions about his tampering with the evidence can be taken care of by imposing strict bail conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bail-for-man-accused-of-forcing-girlfriend-to-lodge-bogus-fir/articleshow/88511200.cms||Vishwas Kothari
---||Agra||BJP will get 300+ seats in UP: Amit Shah in Kasganj||AGRA: Addressing BJP’s Jan Vishwas rally in Kasganj on Sunday, Union Home minister Amit Shah hailed the present law-and-order situation in the state under chief minister Yogi Adityanath, saying there have been no riots in the state during the past four-and-a-half years. He also claimed that BJP’s tally would cross the 300-mark in the upcoming 2022 assembly elections. Launching a scathing attack on previous governments run by BSP’s Mayawati and SP's Akhilesh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh, Shah said the duo, "Bua-Babua", could not bring development in UP as “they are helming jativadi (casteist) and parivarvadi (dynastic) parties''. "Earlier, there used to be a bahubali (strongman), a mini-CM, and a scam in each district. Now, under BJP government, there is one product, one industry and one medical college in each district," Shah said. Claiming that over 700 riots took place during Akhilesh Yadav's five-year rule, he said the common people were forced to migrate. "The situation was so bad that people used to hesitate in sending their daughters to schools and colleges. Now, all the goons have fled UP," Shah said. He also spoke about various projects and achievements of the Centre and state government. Shah said the recently inaugurated Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi used to wear a deserted look before it was beautified under the watch of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He mentioned the abrogation of Article 370. "Congress, SP and BSP opposed it but the PM still repealed Article 370 in August 2019. Terrorism prevailed during Congress’s rule at the Centre, but PM Modi carried surgical strikes across the border after terrorist attacks in Uri and Pulwama," Shah sai. Shah also praised the legacy of former CM and OBC leader Kalyan Singh, who died earlier this year, for “clearing the way” for the Ayodhya Ram Mandir. “Had babuji (Singh) not provided me margdarshan (guidance), poll victories in 2014, 2017 and 2019 would not have been possible,” said Shah.  Alluding to the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, Shah asked the crowd whether they would vote for the same people "who fired at kar sevaks". He was referring to the Mulayam Singh government's decision to open fire at the sevaks who had gathered near the Ramjanmabhoomi site in Ayodhya in 1990. Kasganj, where Sunday’s rally was held, is part of Etah parliamentary constituency from where Singh had been elected. Singh’s son, Rajveer Singh ‘Raju’, the current BJP MP from Etah, shared the stage with Shah.. Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, in his speech, said Akhilesh Yadav did not pay tribute to Singh, and asked the people to "avenge the insult" to Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/bjp-will-get-300-seats-in-up-shah-in-kasganj/articleshow/88509948.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Jaipur||Jaisalmer collector writes to ASI DG to allow repairs of houses in Sonar Fort||Jaisalmer: Highlighting the condition of dilapidated houses and deterioration of Sonar Fort, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, district collector Ashish Modi has written a letter to DG ASI, Delhi, and requested to give permission to permanent residents to who have submitted applications to repair their houses and to deploy a permanent officer here so that problems related to Sonar Fort can be resolved in time. Many buildings in the fort are getting dilapidated due to which some big accidents can take place. ASI and other agencies concerned are not taking care of the fort due to which it is losing its original form. There is continuous tampering with its original form and due to seepage of water in its foundation the walls and houses are getting dilapidated. Looking at it, Modi has written a letter to ASI DG which mentions that 1,500-1,800 people reside in the fort. Many of them have applied for permission to repair their dilapidated houses, but approval from the department is still pending. There are chances that these houses can collapse any day for the want of repair and cause loss of human life and property which will create public resentment and disrupt the law and order situation. Apart from this, the high court too has directed to immediately resolve the correspondence of petty repairs in the writ petition 5907/2003 on May 14, 2004. On November 23, many points were put forth in the fort conservation committee and discussion was held in this regard. For early execution of the pending applications of the residents, the local officers should be bound so that the residents can start the repairs.

Senior police inspector Mahendra Jagtap of Kothrud police station said, “The woman had taken a loan from the cooperative bank about 10 years back for the construction of a hospital. The woman repaid a part of the loan amount and had an outstanding amount of Rs 13 crore.” “The woman, however, failed to repay a few EMIs because of financial constraints and then the bank officials sent her messages asking her to repay the outstanding amount. The woman showed inability to pay the remaining sum, and the bank officials in August 2018 worked out a one-time settlement to close her loan account. The woman agreed to this deal,” Jagtap said. He added, “As part of the deal, the woman submitted cheques worth Rs 2.5 crore to the bank. However, the bank officials used her ID cards, documents and other details to open another account and deposited these cheques in that account without her permission. The bank should have deposited these cheques in her loan account." “By doing this, the FIR claims that the bank showed her account as NPA. This was done without her knowledge and by forging her documents to open another account,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/8-bank-officials-booked-in-rs-2-5cr-cheating-case/articleshow/88511191.cms||---

Works of these tanks are in the last phase. The completion of works and laying of pipeline is expected to boost water supply to about three lakh residents in the area. According to the plan, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will lay the pipeline on the 3-km stretch aligned to the canal. The civic authorities said that permission of the state irrigation department is necessary since the pipeline will be laid along the canal. The letter in this regard has already been submitted. The PMC plans to construct 82 overhead water storage tanks across the city under the 24x7 water supply project. Of these, works of 36 tanks have been completed. An official with the PMC’s water supply department said, “A plan to lay pipeline is ready. The work will begin after getting irrigation department’s nod. We are following up the issue with the department to avoid further delays. After getting necessary permission, the laying of pipeline can be completed in a couple of months.” Local residents from Hadapsar, Sadesatranali, Kalepadal have been complaining of low and erratic water supply and they want the situation to improve. Sudhir Mahajan, a resident of Hadapsar, told TOI, “The pressure of water in many clusters is low. The bigger housing complexes suffer a lot as they are unable to fill the water tanks. We have been told that the supply will improve once the works of overhead tanks and pipes get over. We want authorities to complete the work at the earliest.” Local corporator Nana Bhangire also informed that the work of the overhead tank at Kalepadal area has almost been completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lay-pipeline-boost-water-supply-pmc-tells-irrigation-dept/articleshow/88511207.cms||---

The spurt has given rise to concerns if the anticipated third wave has arrived. Experts say it is premature to say that, but cautioned that a steady rise in cluster infections could usher it. Over 55% of the new cases were reported from Mumbai. The city registered 896 cases as per state records, the highest in 205 days, while BMC said 922 cases were detected on Sunday (the discrepancy could be due to a lag in reporting). The rise in Maharashtra (1,648) is limited to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region largely that contributed to 72% of Sunday’s cases. Commenting on third wave fears, epidemiologist Dr Chandrakant Lahariya said the epidemic curve was flat at the national level. “For states and cities, it is too early to say,” he said. (See graphic for reasons being attributed to the case spurt.) Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the Covid-19 taskforce, said that although Mumbai has been witnessing an exponential rise in cases, it can’t be said that the third wave has arrived. “We have to watch the situation for the next two weeks. A continued rise in cases has the potential to trigger the third wave,” he said.

As of now, the third jab that will also be given to around three croreMumbai’s positivity rate, which hovered around 0.4% in the beginning of the month, has jumped almost five-fold to touch 2.6%. Dr Joshi said the sequencing of samples from non-travellers will provide a clearer picture about the strain circulating at present. “Fortunately, Covid deaths are not too high,” he added. On Sunday, Maharashtra added 17 deaths, a tad higher from 12 recorded on Saturday. The state’s cumulative deaths have now reached 1,41,433. After a day of reporting zero deaths, Mumbai registered two fatalities. The city’s Covid toll has now reached 16,370.

Till July this year, there were 2 lakh people who had pledged for the same and this number saw a leap of 1 lakh within six months and now the transport department officials will write to health department as well as principals of medical colleges to coordinate with them to increase the scope of organ donation. Mahendra Soni, transport commissioner, elaborating on the increase of 1 lakh said, “There are multiple reasons for this increase but the most important ones are that we made it compulsory for the applicants to either say Yes or No to organ donation option which previously they could have skipped. Another reason is that now there is a lot more focus by our staff to educate people about organ donation. There is a more concentrated effort by our department even at grassroot level. To involve other departments as well as increase the scope of organ donation, I will write to the health secretary as well.” A total of 2.9 applicants have pledged for organ donation while applying for their driving licences including learner’s licences. In 2018, state transport department incorporated a new category — asking applicants if they are an organ donor — in online applications for driving licence renewal as well as for issuance of fresh ones. The applicants, however, would choose the ‘skip’ option due to which it was replaced with ‘response’ in yes or no, in August last year. The desert state was also the first to issue driving licence bearing the ‘organ donor’ logo. Officials claimed that this initiative makes it simpler for authorities in case of an accident or if the individual is declared brain dead to retrieve his/her organs and donated to patients requiring a transplant. “One more reason is that a person feels a sense of pride after pledging for organ donation when he/she sees the organ donor logo on their licence. This has encouraged people to pledge for the same,” added Soni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/3l-applicants-of-driving-licence-pledge-for-organ-donation/articleshow/88511211.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

On Saturday, guidelines had been issued allowing parties till 10pm only, which have also been removed. Incidentally, many states like Delhi and Haryana have banned all gatherings while Uttar Pradesh has started imposing a night curfew which has also been announced by the Delhi government.

While only 2% of the 853 shops in the market functions every day, the agriculture marketing and agri business department that manages the market also lacks a strategy on utilising the Rs 77crore facility. The new proposal is expected to eat into the existing market’s prospects further. Except for a few shops occupied by farmers producers’ organisation (FPO), more than 90% of the shops in the Kallikudi market remains closed. Citing distance, traders are reluctant to use the market even after obtaining shops. It was in this backdrop that Trichy corporation floated a proposal for an integrated vegetable market on 22 acres in the city. While both the proposed market and Kallikudi market are situated on the same Trichy-Madurai NH, the site of the proposed market is 8 km from the city while Kallikudi is 13 km away. As the proposed market in Panjapur will have better facilities, chances of activating the underutilised Kallikudi market will become slimmer. “Now with a new market planned, officials must not forget Kallikudi, efforts must be taken to revive the market,” Vijayakrishnan V, a resident said. The only positive development for Kallikudi is a few apple importers using the cold storage space and shops but vegetable traders are still reluctant to use the market. While the market was demanded by export traders to be utilised as a special economic zone (SEZ) for agri products exports such as value-added banana products through Trichy airport, the demand was unexplored. “Traders are not preferring Kallikudi market, but we are open to new ideas to use the market. We will consult experts to put the facility to alternative use,” municipal administration minister K N Nehru said. Agriculture marketing department claimed it is still open to allot shops. The new market proposal in Panjapur may revive Kallikudi to serve as a satellite market, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/new-veggie-mkt-raises-doubts-about-kallikudi-markets-future/articleshow/88511221.cms||Deepak Karthik

On Sunday, Saini, an aspirant for Congress ticket, had convened a conclave of his community --Vishal Saini Sammelan. The community has a strong voter base in at least three constituencies in Haridwar. Congress state president Ganesh Godiyal and former CM Harish Rawat were also present at the event when the journalist asked Saini about his marriage. It is alleged that Saini, 67, had left his first wife along with three sons in 1995 and secretly married another woman without divorcing his first wife, Sumitra Devi, who has been staging a protest against him. The journalist has approached police to file a complaint, it is learnt. Local union of journalists has, meanwhile, condemned the act and called for Saini’s boycott. Members said they will burn the minister’s effigy on Monday in case action was not taken against him. Justifying his act, Saini who was a cabinet minister in Akhilesh Yadav’s government, said that some local politicians nursed grudges against him as he enjoyed popularity in Saini community spread across UP and Uttarakhand. “I want to contest from Haridwar so some people are hatching a conspiracy against me. The dharna is being held at the behest of my opponents to malign my image among people of Haridwar as the matter with that woman (his first wife) has already been resolved," Saini told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ex-minister-misbehaves-with-scribe-over-query-on-personal-life/articleshow/88508756.cms||Tapan Susheel
---||Mumbai||Poverty, unwed moms put Maharashtra at number 1 on baby desertion list||MUMBAI: Maharashtra saw the highest number of abandoned babies, foeticides and infanticides combined across the country between 2015 and 2020, accounting for 18.3% of the national tally of 6,459. While Maharashtra topped the list with 1,184 cases, Madhya Pradesh was second with 1,168 cases, followed by Rajasthan (814), Karnataka (771), and Gujarat (650). TimesViewThe abandonment of newborns is often a socio-economic issue born out of poverty and the fear of social stigma among unwed mothers. Instead of tackling it as a police issue where the mother is often identified as the culprit, there is a need for comprehensive social planning involving, among other things, education about contraception and social rehabilitation of the women. Helping such mothers or families could put a stop to newborns being dumped like garbage.A senior IPS officer said, “The cases and reasons vary in urban and rural areas. In urban areas, they could be socio-economic. While in rural areas, it could be the girl child issue.” In police parlance, abandonment is registered under three categories: infanticide, foeticide, and finally exposure and abandonment of a child. Investigators said infanticide and foeticide mainly occurs in the context of poverty, and female foeticide is perceived as an economic choice. Other reasons include the dowry system, deformed infants, famine, lack of support services and postpartum depression. Following the Covid outbreak, which affected the total number of births, Maharashtra also witnessed a dip in the number of newborns abandoned. According to data from the National Crime Records Bureau, 143 cases occurred in the state in 2020, as against 184 in the previous year. Most people, on being tracked down by the police, don’t take the child back due to social stigma. As recently as December 23, the Meghwadi police found a day-old boy on the roadside in Jogeshwari. “We immediately admitted the newborn to hospital. We are searching for the person who abandoned the child to counsel them,” said Sanjay Pimple, senior inspector at Meghwadi police station. On November 14, another newborn was dumped in a nullah in Ghatkopar. Abandonment, foeticide and infanticide are punishable offences. In August 2015, a couple who abandoned their female newborn in hospital were sentenced to a year in jail and fined Rs25,000. In September 2015, the Borivli police arrested a woman for dumping her female foetus. Former state DGP Praveen Dixit said, “It is necessary to record the DNA of every person in their Aadhaar card, which should be made compulsory. Once this is achieved, tracing parents and fixing responsibility will be an achievable goal.’’ RTI activist Jeetendra Ghadge said most of Maharashtra’s population is still socially and economically backward. “The government should focus on dealing with the social issue instead of punishing the mother. Instead of targeting the mother, individuals who force her to abandon the baby should be punished. A government helpline can also guide distressed women who find themselves in such situations,” said Ghadge. Raman Srinivasa, from the Vatsalya Trust in Kanjurmarg, said: “It’s not easy for any woman to abandon her newborn child. We receive at least 30 such babies in a year. Our trust takes care of such kids. Many of them are settled and married.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/poverty-unwed-moms-put-state-at-no-1-on-baby-desertion-list-in-mumbai/articleshow/88511744.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

Besides, Jaunsari, Gurmukhi and Bangla will also be taught in the primary schools. The decision was taken during a cabinet meeting chaired by CM Pushkar Singh Dhami on Friday. Notably, the state has a significant population of Sikhs and Bengalis in the Udham Singh Nagar district and the move to introduce Gurmukhi and Bangla in the syllabus is aimed primarily to reach out to these communities, observers said. As per the guidelines of the National Education Policy, 2020, an emphasis should be laid on teaching regional languages in schools. Some of the schools in the state, especially those in the Pauri district, are already holding classes to teach the Garhwali language to students. Several residents have applauded the decision saying that the use of Garhwali and Kumaoni by the younger generation in their daily conversations has significantly reduced as parents prefer English-medium schools for their wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-primary-schools-to-teach-local-garhwali-kumaoni-languages-as-well-as-gurmukhi-bangla/articleshow/88508764.cms||Mohammad Anab

It is the worst prolonged spell of “severe” days in December since 2015 when Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) started measuring the air quality index (AQI). Due to stubble burning and Diwali, November usually reports several “severe” days, but the number of consecutive “severe” days is usually lower in December. Track the pollution level in your cityCPCB data showed three consecutive “severe” days each in December of 2020 and 2019, four in 2018 and two in 2016. So far, seven “severe” air quality days have been seen in December this year. A higher number of such days (8) were seen in 2018 and 2019. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) said Delhi was likely to record “severe” days on Monday and Tuesday and significant improvement in air quality was expected from December 29 due to easterly winds at higher speed. The AQI on Sunday was 459. Experts said adverse weather conditions along with local and NCR pollution led to the long spell of “severe” days. Gufran Beig, founding project director, SAFAR, said, “It’s unusual for such a prolonged number of severe days to be recorded in December. Though adverse weather conditions played an important role, there is a possibility of unknown local sources of pollution.” Experts pointed out that the agencies concerned should focus on bringing down the emissions from local sources of pollution. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, “Clearly, local pollution can also have such pronounced and severe impacts when atmospheric conditions are adverse. This demands deeper action in all key sectors, including industry, power plants, vehicles, waste, household fuels and soil stabilisation, across 24 districts of the NCR to cut the base pollution.” Explaining the meteorological factors, RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD, said, “Due to high moisture content, there was no dense fog formation. The dense fog could have acted as a scavenger to reduce pollution. Light to calm winds were recorded this time, which affected the dispersion of pollution. Only feeble western disturbances impacted the region, which could have led to rain and helped in cleaning Delhi’s air.” Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory, said there should be a sound prediction system in place to protect people from such high exposure to pollutants and emissions from all sectors must be reduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/six-in-a-row-worst-severe-day-streak-for-dec/articleshow/88511231.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Trichy||Year of growth for Trichy||Trichy: Except for the pandemic and lockdowns, 2021 shall be remembered as an unprecedented and the most fruitful period for Trichy residents as far as infrastructure vertical is concerned. The long-pending development projects are now falling into place. The last quarter of 2021 has seen the much-needed push in the infrastructure and the real estate sector saw investments amounting to over Rs 1,000 crore. The key announcements include expansion of Trichy city, increasing the administrative zones of Trichy Corporation, an integrated bus terminus, integrated market and a truck terminal. Developments such as detailed project report preparation (DPR), fund allotment and floating of tenders for the maiden elevated corridor are all set to welcome 2022 as a year of growth for Trichy. Integrated Bus Terminus, Panjapur A two-decade demand of the city has borne fruits with Trichy Corporation preparing the preliminary work for establishing the integrated bus terminus (IBT) at Panjapur on the Trichy-Madurai highway. Of the total 575 acres available for the urban local body, the terminus will come up in 115 acres in the first phase at a cost of Rs 420 crore. Funds will be allotted for an omnibus terminal and supportive infrastructure, a truck terminal. “The integrated bus terminus proposal will be massive. Trichy will get infrastructure required to become a model city,” municipal administration minister K N Nehru said. Integrated vegetable market, Panjapur Aimed at making Panjapur locality a hub for new projects, the municipal administration department has planned to bring a new vegetable and fruits market in about 22 acres at a cost of Rs 110 crore. Situated on a network of national highways connected by the semi-ring-road, the market is set to become central Tamil Nadu’s largest market facility. City expansion after 10 years A decade later, Trichy city is in the process of expanding its boundaries. At least 20 village panchayats adjoining the urban local body may be amalgamated. With the number of administrative zones increased from four to five, the total number of wards in the city is likely to go up from 65 to 85 or more wards. Elevated corridors and bridges Three elevated corridors and one high-level bridge across the Cauvery were proposed in 2021 by the state highways department. The three elevated corridors include Odathurai-Mallachipuram via Kalaignar Arivalayam, Melachinthamani-Trichy railway junction via Gandhi market and Head post office to district court via Bharathidasan Road. A new ring road is also planned by the state highways department for a length of 44 km to link the highways. Smart cities mission projects Trichy Corporation that got Rs 1,000 crore investment in the smart cities mission programme has finally managed to inaugurate a few projects such as Uyyakondan riverfront development. Chathiram bus terminus renovation and Rockfort hillock illumination were likely to be commissioned soon. Defence land settlement After dragging for almost seven years, the state highways department finally managed to secure 0.66 acres of defence land to complete the Trichy junction RoB near Mannarpuram. The state highways department is set to launch the work on the Chennai arm of the RoB in three months. Graphics Trichy city in 2011 in 2021 Area: 167.23 sq.km 167.23 sq.km.

Health officials blamed the festival weekend for the dull response in the city. The scene was no different in the southern districts including Madurai which saw marginally lesser turnout compared to the previous week. In Madurai, as many as 75,628 beneficiaries were vaccinated against last week’s 78,717. Of these, as many as 41,515 beneficiaries were from rural areas and 34,113 from urban areas. The number of people taking the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine was nearly double that of first dose takers on Sunday. As many as 24,300 took the first dose and 51,328 the second dose. The Covid-19 vaccination coverage in the district remains below the state average but officials are hoping for the numbers to improve with such mega drives Trichy district has so far administered at least one dose of vaccine to about 18.71 lakh people as of December 25 while 11.35 lakh people have received both doses while the targeted population stands at 21.86 lakh. In Trichy, the district administration conducted camps at 197 locations in the city and 305 locations in rural areas. Contrary to expectations of a huge turnout due to the Omicron scare, the mega vaccination sites recorded a low turnout. Until Sunday noon, only 19,000 people were vaccinated in the camp. By the end of the day, around 50,000 people were vaccinated in the district. Thiruverumbur, Manapparai, Manikandam and Manchanallur in rural parts recorded a significant response, but the other parts of the district including Trichy city saw a low turnout. “It seems people are either in their relatives’ place or travelling or staying home with the family for the festive weekend,” a health official with Trichy corporation said. However, that alone does not appear to be the cause of the low turnout. The poor enforcement of mandatory vaccination status to access public places and publicity measures to familiarise the conduct of mega vaccination camps were also reasons for the “mega vaccination camps” not receiving the anticipated response. In Dindigul district, 57,564 beneficiaries took the jab and in Sivaganga 35,294. In Kanyakumari, as many as 22,638 beneficiaries were vaccinated. Health officials across districts said that with coverage for first dose now up to over 75% or even 80% in most districts, lesser number of people will come forward to take the first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/festive-weekend-takes-toll-on-mega-vaccination-camps/articleshow/88511224.cms||---

As per the analysis of social development for communities foundation, the state conducted around 15,000 to 16,000 tests daily last week. The number was 1.14 lakh between September 19-25. Health experts have recommended scaled-up sampling so that the positivity rate of the state can be detected and measures be taken accordingly. “The state is falling 35% short of its target of testing 1.75 lakh samples every week. Only 1.13 lakh samples were tested last week. Also, it’s high time all political parties and the public start following Covid-appropriate behaviour and get vaccinated,” said Anoop Nautiyal, whose foundation has been closely monitoring the Covid-19 situation in the state since its outbreak. Between September 19-25, the number of active cases was 228. And, after a gap of almost three months, Uttarakhand has recorded 237 active cases between December 19-25. Uttarakhand is yet to receive the genome sequencing reports of at least one dozen suspected cases, 8 of whom are from abroad while the remaining are the contacts of the person who tested positive for Omicron variant of coronavirus. It takes 5-8 days for the reports to come. “Covid-positive swab samples with cycle threshold (CT) value below 25 qualify for genomic sequencing as the viral load will be more in those with low CT value,” said a senior virologist from health department. The highest weekly tests (around 2.78 lakh) were conducted between April 25-May 1 this year. “In January, around 10 lakh children aged between 15 and 17 will be vaccinated,” said a senior doctor from the health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-records-188-covid-19-cases-in-1-week-highest-since-sept/articleshow/88508767.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Six-year-old gets brother’s murderers arrested||NAGPUR: A six-year-old girl helped her late 11-year-old brother Vansheel Doiphode get justice by ensuring that the two neighbours, who had allegedly thrashed him, landed behind bars. On the basis of the girl’s statement and the post-mortem report, Nandanvan police arrested two persons on Saturday for allegedly thrashing Vansheel who later succumbed to his injuries on December 18. Vansheel and his younger sister were whisked away on a scooter by Shreyas Meshram (20) and Saurabh Vairagade (21) on December 14. The siblings had been taken to an abandoned hutment at Bhootgalli in Juna Bagadganj where they were thrashed before being set free. The girl was lucky to escape with some scratches, but her brother sustained serious injuries. Despite feeling unwell, Vansheel did not reveal the names of Meshram and Vairagade fearing earning their wrath once again. His younger sister had unearthed the episode before their parents after Vansheel’s health had deteriorated. Vansheel’s father Harshvardhan, a Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) activist, is said to have warned Shreyas and Saurabh for manhandling his son in the past but the duo continued with their ways. Vansheel protesting the ‘thrashing for fun’ may have angered the two accused further. “Nandanvan police were reluctant to register an offence until CP Amitesh Kumar intervened. I still have doubts regarding their sincerity. My children were gagged and taken on a bike to a desolate place which is kidnapping but no charges were pressed,” said Harshvardhan. “My younger daughter is the eye-witness in the case. She revealed the entire episode before the police,” he said. Harshvardhan said even his younger daughter was thrashed by the duo. Eventually, the distraught father got support from his party which started a dialogue with the police to ensure that a murder case was registered. Nandanvan police, which arrested Meshram and Vairagade, procured their police custody remand till December 28. “The victim’s younger sister’s statement and the post-mortem report which indicated a head injury paved the way for registering the case as a murder,” said Nagrale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/six-year-old-gets-brothers-murderers-arrested/articleshow/88510698.cms||Soumitra Bose

He was rushed to MGM Hospital, Kamothe, by his bodyguards, where he was treated and discharged after six hours of observation. The snake was reportedly non-venomous. Khan went to his farmhouse for the holiday season and also to celebrate his birthday, which falls on December 27.  After his discharge around 9am, the actor returned to Arpita Farms, named after his sister. It is in a forested area, which is a 30-minute drive from the Kamothe hospital. “Khan informed us that after he spotted the snake inside his farmhouse, he used a stick to lift it to ensure it was not harmed. He wanted to release it in the forest, but before that the snake bit him on the hand,” said the hospital’s administrator Dr Kuldeep Salgotra. “He was brought in at 3.10am for treatment.”  The doctor said Khan was admitted in the casualty ward, but isolated from other patients to prevent crowding around him. “Khan’s bodyguards had brought along the snake, enabling us to identify if it was venomous or not. Though a snake expert was summoned to identify it, our medical team did not waste time and immediately started the line of treatment prescribed for snakebites. A clinical assessment was carried out by sending his blood sample for analysis on the possibility of venom in it and also its clotting percentage.”  Ulhas Thakur, a snake expert from Panvel said the reptile was eventually identified as a Wolf Snake, which is non-venomous. “But it resembled a Krait, which is venomous.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-salman-bitten-by-non-venomous-snake-at-farmhouse/articleshow/88513679.cms||George Mendonca

Only last week had Dehradun civic body removed hoardings installed along roads and other public places during the rallies of PM Narendra Modi, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and other politicians. “We have engaged a contractor who looks after sanitation work. A political party has to pay fee to put up signages,” said DMC deputy commissioner, Rohitash Sharma. On the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday, BJP workers put up hundreds of flags, posters and other promotional material ahead of Nadda’s visit. A volunteer near Bhel chowk said that they have been asked to cover all major city stretches and put up as much signages as they can at night. Political parties require permission from district administration for holding rallies and have to pay the DMC for such work. The defacement is, however, not appreciated by city residents. “There is so much to focus on cleanliness and beautification these days. The city has been defaced with so many hoardings and flags. Poles on the entire central verge on Rajpur road have multiple party signages. Promotion is understandable, especially with elections around the corner, but there should be some guidelines against defacement of public property,” said Rajib Ahluwalia, a Jakhan resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/posters-signages-put-up-ahead-of-naddas-visit-annoy-locals/articleshow/88508777.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

---||Trichy||Peafowls found dead in Trichy, poisoning is suspected||TRICHY: At least six peafowls were found dead on the banks of Ayyar river near Sobanapuram in Thuraiyur on Saturday evening in a suspected case of poisoning as farmers struggle to protect their crops from the birds which forage their fields. Forest department officials in Trichy said villagers of Maradi near Sobanapuram found the carcasses of the national bird and alerted them. They could not find poison-mixed grains around the area, but suspicions remain. The cause of the death could be ascertained only after the postmortem. “Six peafowls aged two to three years were found dead. From the feathers found scattered along the river bund and field, we believe around 15 to 20 peafowls might have died. A veterinary doctor visited the spot on Sunday, conducted postmortem and sent the samples to a lab to ascertain the cause of death,” Murugesan, forest range officer, said. Farmers say they are in a helpless situation as the birds destroy crops and cause huge damage to their produce. They have appealed to officials to take appropriate steps to control the menace. Farmers from Trichy, Perambalur, Ariyalur and Karur districts raise maize, groundnut, sunflower and vegetables. Peafowls are present in Thuraiyur, Uppiliapuram, Manachanallur and Pullambadi in Trichy district and Malayalapatti, Anukur, Esanai and other places in Parambalur. “I am cultivating paddy and all types of vegetables. The bird destroys sunflower and maize raised in our area. Normally, farmers sow 15 kg maize per acre. However, now they are forced to sow 25 kg fearing that peacock would eat everything,” said P Ramakrishnan, an organic farmer from Senkunam in Perambalur. Wildlife conservation biologist Q Ashoka Chakkaravarthy says human-wildlife conflict is not new to the country. It is increasing day by day not only in protected zones but in local ecological zones like villages as well. “Habitats of small wild animals like jackal and birds like peafowl are shrinking. Adjoining areas of reserve forest are becoming residential areas. A declining number of the predators of peafowl are the main reason for their increasing number. Jackals usually eat peafowl eggs. As the number of jackals is diminishing, the population of peafowls keeps increasing,” he said. Since there are no protected zones like sanctuaries in Trichy and surrounding areas, farmers face problems from wild animals like wild boar, peacocks and monkeys, he added. Using bird-netting to create a physical barrier and reflective ribbons are ways to tackle the situation, agriculture department officials said. The farmers from central region have urged forest minister K Ramachandran to provide reasonable compensation for crop loss due to wild animals and birds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/6-peafowls-found-dead-in-trichy-district-poisoning-suspected-as-they-damage-crops/articleshow/88511243.cms||D Vincent Arockiaraj

According to police, the accused was a ganja addict who committed the crime in a bid to snatch money from the victim’s belongings. A man was found dead with grievous injuries on his face and head on the banks of a canal near Shiva temple mandapam on the Madurai-Trichy highway on December 11. Thuvarankuruchi police, which conducted an inquiry, found that the deceased was a pilgrim from Bihar, but his name and other details could not be ascertained. The case was handed over to Manapparai special crime investigative team headed by sub-inspector D Nagaraj. The team recovered the broken parts of a triangular reflector from the crime scene. When the shopkeepers in the area were quizzed, it came to light that one I Savariraj, 40, an electrician and resident of Mukkan Bridge in Thuvarankuruchi was used to sleeping on the temple mandapam. After a search for more than eight days, police secured Savariraj. When they searched his bag, they found another part of the broken reflector. During interrogation, Savarijraj confessed to have murdered the pilgrim for money. He said when he reached the mandapam to sleep, he noticed the man sleeping with a bag. Savariraj took the bag by force and Rs 1,500 from it. When the man tried to resist, Savariraj attacked him on his face with a tool used for electrical works leading to his death. Sub-inspector Nagaraj told TOI that as an addict to liquor and ganja, the accused had a criminal record of attacking four people for money to buy liquor and ganja. During interrogation, Savariraj stated that he attacked the victim as he spoke in Hindi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/ganja-addict-nabbed-for-murder-of-bihar-pilgrim/articleshow/88511253.cms||---

This year, the cops have recovered over Rs 19 crore in cash, more than 49kg of jewellery and 7,000 stolen vehicles, data accessed by TOI showed. Significantly, the police recovered around 13,000 mobile phones stolen by criminals. Soon after taking charge, police commissioner Rakesh Asthana had instructed officers that apart from making arrests, they needed to focus on recovering the stolen goods and ensuring that these were handed over to the rightful owners in time. The over 49kg of jewellery recovered included 1,509 items of gold, 43 of diamond and 350 silver. An officer said the police had also arrested receivers of the stolen property. Snatchers usually look for soft targets and mobiles are the easiest to grab. “We have recovered 13,684 mobile phones. In several cases, we traced the original owners and, after following the legal process, the phones were handed over to them,” the officer said. An investigator said that, in many cases, the recovered mobile phones couldn’t be returned to the owners as they hadn’t reported the crime. Another officer said the main motive behind such crimes was the urge for easy money or the need to finance addiction. Delhi Police also recovered 5,830 two-wheelers, 339 TSRs, e-rickshaws and 926 four-wheelers during this period. “The second-hand market in other states plays a major role in the absorption of stolen vehicles. Vehicles stolen from Delhi are disposed of in other states,” an officer said. Data showed that 3,028 ATM and SIM cards were recovered from the criminals as well. “In several cases of ATM fraud, we noticed that the accused, on the pretext of helping a person, exchanged their cards. Later, after gathering the card details, they siphoned off the money," an officer said. About 544 laptops, PCs, CCTVs, HDDs and pen drives and 3,648 household items were also recovered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mobile-phone-tops-items-stolen-retrieved/articleshow/88510734.cms||Abhay Singh

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted very light rain on Monday and Tuesday too. Shallow-to-moderate fog is likely to persist for the next seven days. According to IMD, 1.4mm rainfall was recorded at Safdarjung, which is the city’s base station, between 5.30pm and 8.30pm. Palam witnessed 0.2mm rainfall during the same time. A Met official said: “Very light rain or drizzle is likely on Monday and Tuesday under the influence of a western disturbance.” On Sunday, the minimum temperature was recorded at 9.8 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal. The maximum temperature was reported at 21.4 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. The maximum and minimum temperatures may hover around 22 and 10 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Monday. There are chances of moderate fog on Monday morning. Though the minimum temperature is likely to hover around 10 degrees Celsius for the next two days, it is expected to dip to six degrees Celsius by December 31. “The minimum temperature is likely to drop from December 29 night,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. A Met official said cold-wave conditions may be experienced in the last two days of December in isolated parts of the capital. A cold wave had gripped parts of Delhi for three consecutive days from December 19 to 21. However, after back-to-back western disturbances impacted the region, the city got some respite. IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is four or more degrees below normal or when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degrees Celsius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/light-rain-in-parts-of-delhi-more-of-same-likely-for-next-2-days/articleshow/88511267.cms||---

Guru Katti, the president of Swarajya Vahan Chalak Sanghatna, a union of cab drivers, said around 30% cabbies have gone back to their native towns with their vehicles and are yet to return to the city. Another 30% of the cabs have been confiscated by the banks and other financial institutions because the drivers or the vehicle owners couldn’t pay their monthly EMIs on time, he said. “Around 8% to 10% of them have gone ahead and changed their commercial vehicles to private ones so that they can sell them at decent prices. The remaining drivers have decided to keep their vehicles at home and go in for some other profession,” Katti told TOI. Figures of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) show a sharp dip in the number of cab registrations. In 2021, there has been a drop of around 67% in registrations in the Pune RTO compared to 2020. When compared to 2019, the dip stands at 91%. Similarly, there has been a dip of around 67% in cab registrations in 2021 compared to 2020 in the Pimpri Chinchwad RTO. When compared to 2019, the fall is more than 90%. “Business has been badly hit because of the pandemic and it’s certainly not looking up either for cab drivers. Banks and financial companies started to hound many of us for EMIs, which was impossible to meet for most of us. Prices of fuel have been extremely high for almost a year now and that too has hit business,” Katti said. Anwar Shaikh, who runs a transport company, said he had seven cars but only two were operational now. “The drivers went back and didn’t return. One of the cars was taken away by the bank as I couldn’t pay the EMI. Business has improved a bit but it is nowhere near 2019. People force us to lower our cab rates and we have to oblige or else they will go to another company. The latest Omicron threat is a nightmare again,” Shaikh said.

---||Pune||RAT, surveillance recommended to check Omicron spread & spike||PUNE: In addition to conducting genomic sequencing of Covid-19 positive samples, increasing the use of rapid antigen test (RAT) over RT-PCR and regular undertaking of syndromic surveillance to quickly isolate and treat symptomatic persons can check spikes even without stringent curbs. The measures should focus on maintaining a fine balance between preserving lives and livelihoods, medical experts and epidemiologists have said in view of fear over the Omicron variant's community spread. “The imperatives for the next few weeks or at least a month should address the threat of the new variant that India’s rural and peri-urban areas may also face in addition to urban areas,” senior clinical epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee said. In addition to conducting genomic sequencing of positive samples which is currently concentrated mainly in Mumbai, Pune, and Thane, it is prudent to step up syndromic or fever surveillance in the community especially in areas or pockets showing high positivity rate to rule out cluster formation, he added. The falling or rising trends of groups of symptoms (syndromic surveillance) in the community suggestive of Covid-19 can also guide authorities, experts said. Currently, fever surveillance has almost stopped or is carried out in a haphazard way and there is no uniformity, the experts said. Senior public health expert Dr Subhash Salunke, former advisor to the Maharashtra government on communicable diseases including Covid-19, said, “Fever or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance is key to keep a tab on early signs of picking up the spread of communicable diseases like Covid-19.” A focus on it by involving a sizeable number of private clinics and hospitals across the state including areas/districts with declining as well as those reporting some spike in Covid cases across Maharashtra including Pune is necessary, he added. There are a group of signs and symptoms such as fever, cough for respiratory infections and loose motions, vomiting, and diarrhoeal diseases for picking up suspected cases of different diseases including Covid-19. In addition to fever surveillance, syndromic or symptomatic SARI surveillance will provide early warning signals not only for Covid-19, but also other endemic diseases which are perhaps more common now but likely to go undetected. Equally important is continued surveillance when trends are falling in some areas. “Any unusual rise in fever or combination of flu-like symptoms can allow for a quick reaction from public health authorities to investigate by confirmatory tests and epidemiological (disease-spread) investigation to enable control and elimination in a particular area,” Dr Banerjee added. Methods for surveillance should be simple so that even reporting by lay volunteers is possible and can be encouraged. “This lay reporting was used in the end-game of smallpox eradication,” he said. Sntinel surveillance is a higher level. “In this, both public and private hospitals can act as sentinels which can detect an unusual rise or fall of tell-tale signs and symptoms such as fever, body aches, cough, diarrhoea and others,” Dr Banerjee explained. The cases of fever medically termed as acute febrile illness have multiple causative factors. “Covid-19 is one of them. As there is a pandemic, it should be ruled out first,” Dr Aniket Joshi, member of the Association of Physicians of India (API), a pan-India body of physicians, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rat-surveillance-recommended-to-check-omicron-spread-spike/articleshow/88511270.cms||Umesh Isalkar

This is the sixth party office in Goa since it intensified its poll campaign. In Cumbharjua, several youths joined TMC in the presence of party functionary Kiran Kandolkar. He said that considering TMC has been in Goa for only a few months, this is a huge development. This not only will strengthen Goa TMC’s base but is also a testament to the fact that the youth are fed-up with the BJP-Congress nexus that has repeatedly betrayed the people’s mandate, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tmc-steps-up-campaigning-opens-6th-office/articleshow/88511787.cms||---

Police claimed that the vehicle was being driven at a high speed, which led to the accident. The deceased was identified as Ankit. His friend, Aditya and Rajkumar, both aged 35, are still receiving treatment at AIIMS Trauma Centre. All of them were working in a private company and living in Gurugram. According to police, at 7.40am, they received information about an accident near Mahipalpur flyover. “SHO Neeraj Chaudhary, along with his staff, reached the spot. They found the damaged car and rescued its occupants,” an officer said. Police said that the victims were taken to the hospital, where Ankit was declared brought dead. An officer said that the car collided with a divider and turned upside down. “We suspect that they were coming from Gurugram side and were going to their native village Rohtak. The car was being driven at a high speed and the driver was unable to control the vehicle, which led to the accident,” an officer said. An officer said that so far they have not found any evidence of them being drunk. However, the exact sequence of events will only be verified after the statements of the two injured men are recorded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-dies-2-hurt-as-car-hits-divider-on-flyover/articleshow/88510750.cms||---

The entry fee per person here is Rs 50 and bicycles are being provided on rent in Haiderpur where thousands of migratory birds camp during winter. In the first week of December, Haiderpur wetland was designated as the country's 47th Ramsar site and 2,463rd Ramsar site internationally. Ramsar is a wetland site designated under the Ramsar Convention, an intergovernmental environmental treaty established in 1971 by Unesco, which came into force in 1975. Haiderpur wetland, according to officials, covers an area of 6,908 hectares and is situated on the Muzaffarnagar-Bijnor border area in Uttar Pradesh. It was formed in 1984 by construction of Madhya Ganga Barrage at the confluence of Solani and Ganga rivers and is a part of Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary. A source of freshwater and groundwater recharge, Haiderpur wetland supports a variety of plant species, and is home to numerous animals, including swamp deer, otters, gharial and fishing cat. It plays host to more than 300 species of birds, many of which are migratory. Former divisional commissioner of Saharanpur, Sanjay Kumar, under whom the wetland was developed into a tourist spot and opened formally on November 14, 2019, said Haiderpur is one of India's finest birding hotspots. “The bird species count jumped from 146 in July, 2019, to 324 now. It has one the largest congregations of Bar-Headed goose, Greylag goose, Ruddy Shelduck and Ferruginous Pochard. Now, it is a Ramsar site,” said Kumar, who is currently the finance secretary in the UP government. "Since Haiderpur wetland has been declared as Ramsar site, footfall of visitors have increased. Earlier per day a dozen wildlife enthusiasts used to come. Now, numbers have reached 40 on an average," Mohanlal, a forester, said, adding that visitors enjoy the awesome scenic landscape in the presence of migratory and local birds. Bijnor divisional forest officer, Anil Kumar Patel said, "Haiderpur Wetland is an attractive place adjacent to the Ganga. There is also a boating facility. People can spot dolphins here as well." Tapesh Sharma, a doctor who frequents the area, said, "Haiderpur wetland is a peaceful place. We can enjoy nature and I, along with my family, come here every Sunday."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/haiderpur-wetland-abuzz-with-tourist-activity-after-being-part-of-ramsar-site/articleshow/88510065.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Delhi||‘Lack of sensitivity’ at family courts irks HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court has expressed displeasure over a “complete lack of sensitivity and maturity” shown by the presiding judges at family courts, saying courts are meant to assist the litigants. The court was hearing a petition filed by a woman seeking annulment of her marriage on the ground that her husband was impotent. The husband, in his written statement, had said that the marriage had not been consummated. The family court had rejected the wife’s petition. She moved the high court against the order. Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said since it was an admitted position that the marriage was not consummated on account of the man not being in a position to have intercourse, there was no impediment in allowing the petition. “We are unable to understand the logic or rationale of the family court,” the judges said in an order. The high court further said that it was of the view that the questions as to whether or not the husband was completely impotent was not relevant, especially when he had given his consent to the annulment of the marriage. “This is unfortunate though, because the man has no control over his medical condition, and he is blamed for his natural inability to have intercourse with a woman. In our view, there is no reason for such a man to carry any shame or guilt or feel embarrassed as he has no role to play in the way he finds himself. An admission with regard to impotency or the establishment of the said fact causes the man to lose face and his self-esteem, apart from lowering his image among his family, friends and acquaintances, as a section of the society looks down upon the man as a failure — even though he is not responsible for his medical condition. It takes courage for a man to admit that he is, indeed, impotent,” the order stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lack-of-sensitivity-at-family-courts-irks-hc/articleshow/88511275.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The penalty amount is to be deducted from Tilve’s salary in four equal installments of Rs 3,000 each beginning from the salary of December 2021 to March 2022. Nixon Furtado, a resident of Sernabatim, is the complainant in all four cases. He had sought information from Colva panchayat on various points under provisions contained in the RTI Act. As no information was furnished to him, Furtado appealed before the FAA which directed the PIO to furnish the necessary information within a stipulated time. The PIO failed to comply with the directions, prompting Furtado to approach the Goa State Information Commission. Terming Tilve “a habitual offender of the provisions of the RTI Act,” state information commissioner Sanjay Dhavalikar in his order observed that the PIO had “a particular modus operandi while dealing with RTI applications.” The commission termed the PIO’s conduct as “deplorable, disgraceful” which is “not at all in consonance with the aim of the act.” Earlier, in July 2020, the commission, in two separate orders, had imposed a penalty of Rs 3,000 each on Tilve, for failing to furnish information under RTI Act as directed by the FAA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/colva-pyat-secy-fined-for-not-providing-info-sought-under-rti/articleshow/88511799.cms||---

The announcement, made at BJP’s ‘Vijay Sankalp’ rally in Nandannagar (earlier called Ghat), is being seen as a move to appease priests and locals, who have for a long time been demanding that the town’s name be changed. Significantly, the state government had recently renamed Ghat block, also in Chamoli district, to Nandannagar.  Joshimath is the winter seat of the Badrinath deity and houses one of the four ‘maths’ established by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century, the other three being at Sringeri, Puri and Dwarka. While inaugurating and laying the foundation stone of various development schemes worth over Rs 56 crore in Chamoli district, CM Dhami said, "Our goal is to take development to the last person and in order to achieve this, we are working day and night." Incidentally, the BJP government in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, led by chief minister Yogi Adityanath, has also been on a name-changing spree ahead of next year's assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/joshimath-gateway-to-badrinath-to-be-renamed-jyotirmath/articleshow/88508820.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The protest has been ongoing since November. “The process of rehabilitating the kiosk owners with new kiosks is ongoing, but will take time. We are trying to complete the works as soon as possible,” Santa Cruz MLA Tony Fernandes said. Several illegal kiosks that lined the outside of GMC and over a dozen food vendors were razed in July as part of the four-laning of the Bambolim highway. Most of the vendors had set up their businesses outside the hospital over a decade ago. With the exception of five kiosks that had permissions from the local panchayat, none of the others had the requisite licenses. In August, the kiosk owners met Fernandes demanding allotment of space to restore the kiosks. In November they went on a protest. Fernandes had promised that they would be rehabilitated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/protest-by-gmc-kiosk-owners-enters-36th-day/articleshow/88511820.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Jabs for teenagers likely to boost private vaccination centres||PUNE: More private vaccination centres are likely to get reactivated in the wake of the Covid vaccine roll out for children aged 15 to 18 years from January 3, 2022. In Pune district, a total of 170 hospitals have mandatory approval to conduct Covid vaccination on their premises. Of them, almost 80% are lying dormant owing to low footfalls. A sizeable number of these centres are likely to gear up now as parents, living especially in city areas and having disposable income, are inclined to seek vaccination of their wards at private setups, experts said. The improved vaccine supply in government centres has made it easy for people to get free shots, resulting in private centres slipping into dormancy across the country. “The vaccination for children in 15-18 years’ age bracket is likely to revive Covid vaccination at private hospitals in Pune as there is more eagerness than hesitancy. Besides, the trend of kids’ vaccination is tilted more towards private hospitals than government-run hospitals, especially in city areas. Hence some of the dormant centres will get reactivated in January next year,” said Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India (HBI), Pune branch. “There is more eagerness than hesitancy among city’s parents for the paediatric Covid shot,” said paediatrician Pramod Jog. “Eagerness is there but many parents, I think, would take a cautious ‘wait and watch’ stand when it will actually come to vaccinating kids. Covid has largely spared children and many parents know this. The contagion is not a healthcare emergency the way it has been for adults,’ said a doctor from Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital. “Besides, some parents feel that their kids might have already had the infection due to one of the family members turning out positive in the recent past,” the doctor added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jabs-for-teenagers-likely-to-boost-pvt-vax-centres/articleshow/88511282.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The documentary titled ‘Mhadei: Life in Monsoon’, directed by Ashish Shah from Panaji for the Goa forest department, showcases glimpses of the richness of the biodiversity as well as the ecosystem of the Mhadei (known as the Mandovi downstream). The film was scripted by Nandan Saxena and was part of a documentary series produced by the department over a period of three-four years, covering various aspects of Goa’s forests, ecology and wildlife. The audience at the film festival appreciated the initiative to create awareness for protection and conservation of the Western Ghat region of Goa, said the film’s makers “I was extremely happy when I received the email from the organisers that our film had been selected for screening. Whatever collective efforts were made by us proved fruitful as the audience present at the screening got an opportunity to know the unknown facets of Goa’s natural beauty,” said Shah. Rising from the Western Ghats of Karnataka, the Mhadei plays a vital role in enriching the lives and livelihoods of people living along its course, which runs mainly through Goa. The documentary film will also be screened at the lnternational Film Festival of Agra, in Uttar Pradesh on December 27. It is among 25 films selected from out of 100 entries submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goan-film-featuring-mhadeis-biodiversity-screened-in-dhaka/articleshow/88511854.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Delhi||Stop, look, listen: Shed the heard mentality||NEW DELHI: Do people actually listen to what others are saying? Or, are they simply waiting for their turn to speak and make a point? Just because we are hearing something, does it mean that we are actually listening to what’s being said? While at first glance, the answers to most of these questions might be in the affirmative, a deeper reflection is likely to throw up a different take. Stressing on the importance of listening for creating a better environment in different aspects of life, the Listening Inn Foundation on Sunday carried out an awareness campaign at Connaught Place. The initiative, which is now a little over a year old, aims to build a community of listeners who are trained to be more aware and empathetic. The initiative was started by Jaskiran Gill, a former engineer by profession. While one may confidently declare oneself as a “good listener”, more often than not, the statement is accompanied with another self-declaration that “I am good at fixing problems”, says Gill. The urge, more often than not, is to make the conversation about oneself, he adds. “Listening is about the person who is speaking and not about themselves. To be a better listener, you have to be open to learning, identifying your own biases and judgments and being ready to unlearn them. Asking the right kind of questions and building empathy are other aspects of being a better listener,” Gill explains. In today’s fast-paced society, especially in the backdrop of the Covid pandemic, the feeling of being “unheard” has only increased. Only rarely do you find one taking a step back and trying to understand the other person’s perspective. But listening is a skill that can be taught, Gill says. “People either don’t have the time, or they only pretend to listen. A conversation is a two-way process and listening is one skill that does not get the attention that it needs. Even for a child, we see people rejoicing when they utter their first words. But when it comes to listening, it is just assumed that they can do that. A majority of the people assume that just because we are hearing, we are listening when the fact is that it is all about asking the right kind of questions and understanding the other’s perspectives.” As part of the campaign on Sunday, volunteers caught up with people in the inner circle of Connaught Place as they tried to bridge the communication gap by striking up a conversation and making people reflect. One passerby, who claimed to be a good listener, added a caveat: “I listen intently, but only if it is a topic that I am interested in. Otherwise, I tune out,” he said. Through the conversation, the volunteers then urged him to reflect on the same. Similarly, an auto-rickshaw driver complained that he felt his children didn’t listen to him because of “a communication gap”. The foundation, which has trained hundreds of people with diverse backgrounds and age groups, also provides both short and intensive trainings. “We also provide listening services, which is not a mental health service, but just a platform for people who feel that they have nobody to share things with. Experiential trainings happen where people are made to introspect and identify biases. We are also looking forward to training sessions with universities and colleges, as it is important to create an empathetic environment in college, especially for youngsters,” says Gill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stop-look-listen-shed-the-heard-mentality/articleshow/88511313.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

Comorbid citizens from the pool of around 13.27 lakh senior citizens (above the age of 60 years) will also be able to opt for the booster dose on doctors' recommendation. “We will be able to fetch the exact number of beneficiaries from the 15 to 18 years age group this week, and accordingly we will work on the strategy of 15-18-year-olds’ vaccination from January 3,” said Sanjay Deshmukh, the assistant director (medical) of the Pune circle.

---||India||Must teach ancient Indian jurisprudence, throw out colonial law system: Nazeer||NEW DELHI: In a spirited ‘back to the roots’ call, Supreme Court Justice S Abdul Nazeer on Sunday said the surer yet arduous way to free administration of justice in India from the colonial psyche is to teach law students about ancient yet advanced legal jurisprudence. He said the legal norms developed by great personalities like Manu, Kautilya, Brihaspati and others were worth studying and emulation. Quoting liberally from the jurisprudential works of great sages and thinkers as narrated in scriptures, Justice Nazeer said, “Even though it may be an enormous and time-consuming effort, I firmly believe that it would be a worthy endeavour which could revitalise the Indian legal system and align it with the cultural, social and heritage aspects of our great nation and ensure more robust delivery of justice.” Pitching for the introduction of ancient Indian jurisprudence as a subject in law colleges, Justice Nazeer said, “There can be no doubt that this colonial legal system is not suitable for the Indian population. The need of the hour is the Indianisation of the legal system. The eradication of such a colonial mindset may take time but I hope that my words will evoke some of you to think deeply about this issue and steps that need to be taken to decolonialise the Indian legal system.” He said, the future of the rule of law and parliamentary democracy in India depends to a great extent on the ability, wisdom and patriotism of our future lawyers and judges. “Such lawyers and judges will only grow from the social soil of India and will be nurtured by its social atmosphere. Great lawyers and judges are not born but are made by proper education and great legal traditions, as were Manu, Kautilya, Katyayana, Brishaspati, Narada, Parashara, Yajnavalkya and other legal giants of ancient India. The continued neglect of their great knowledge and adherence to the alien colonial legal system is detrimental to the goals of our Constitution and against our national interests,” he added. Speaking on ‘Decolonisation of Indian Legal System’ at the Akhil Bharatiya Adhivakta Parishad’s National Council meeting at Hyderabad, Justice Nazeer said the concept of demanding justice was inbuilt in the ancient Indian legal system. In contrast, under the British colonial system, which persists even today, justice has to be requested in the most polite manner while addressing the judges as ‘Lordships’ and ‘Ladyships’. The judge said under Indian jurisprudence marriage was a duty, a job to be performed as one of the many social obligations, which everyone had to perform. “But, the pre-occupation of western jurisprudence with rights has resulted in marriage being looked upon as an alliance from which each partner tries to get as much as he or she can. The high rate of divorce is the result of neglecting the ‘duty’ aspect of marriage,” he said, adding “the word right (adhikar) does not occur even once in the whole of Anushasan Parva or the Arthasastra. Indian jurisprudence is founded on theories that rights are corollaries of duties.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/must-teach-ancient-indian-jurisprudence-throw-out-colonial-law-system-nazeer/articleshow/88512602.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The state public health department recorded at least 31 fresh cases, including one from Pune rural. The state’s tally of confirmed Covid-19 cases linked to the Omicron variant reached 141 and the district’s tally 42. The official report also said 29 of Sunday’s 31 cases involved asymptomatic patients. The remaining two patients were exhibiting mild symptoms. Pune ZP chief executive officer (CEO) Ayush Prasad said despite reporting a fresh Omicron positive case and 15 earlier cases, there has been no local transmission so far. He further added that the health department is working on the contact tracing of the high-risk close contacts of the positive patients. At present, more than half of the patients are asymptomatic in nature, he said. Additional district health officer Abhay Tidke said, “On an average, we are tracing at least 15 close contacts to make sure there is no local transmission of the contagion.” On Sunday’s findings, the 31 positive Omicron cases were from Mumbai, two from Thane and one each was from Pune rural and Akola. The report added that there are six positive patients, who are below 18 years of age, while three are above 60 years old. The report from the state public health department stated that 61 people, who were earlier diagnosed with the contagion, have now been discharged after negative RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) tests came from their tests. Till date, the state has reportedly carried out an RT-PCR test of nearly 33,717 travellers at the airport, of which 208 have come positive for Covid-19. At the moment, the state is also carrying out surveillance of people who are returning from non-risk countries. Over 737 samples have been sequenced. The state-run BJ Government Medical College in the Sassoon General Hospital has the central coordinating laboratory. The remaining four research-cum-laboratories that are part of the Pune Region Genomic Consortium are the National Institute of Virology (NIV), the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), and National Institute of Cell Science (NICS).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/highest-single-day-positive-cases-of-new-variant-in-maha/articleshow/88511336.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The bicycles have been gifted by some Kolhapur-based residents. Some of them had earlier visited Gaganbawda to spend a weekend. One among them had spent some time with the local residents over a cup of tea, and had asked them about how they lived in such a thickly forested area and managed to get day-to-day things. Mahadev Narke, a Kolhapur-based college professor, said, “While chatting with the residents, we came to know about the hardships that the girls faced, especially in terms of going to school. The students had to walk up and down several kilometres every day just to get to their schools. Often, they missed their classes and sometimes returned home after dark.” The Kolhapur group then decided to extend some help to the girl students. “We posted our experience with the residents and also shared photographs. We appealed for donations andreceived a great response. We bought the new bicycles for 20 girls,” said Narke. There are over 108 Dhangarwadas in the district, located within the forest areas away from villages or towns. These hamlets lack basic amenities and the young men from these places mostly work in the cities and towns. Upon learning about the initiative taken by the Kolhapur-based residents, district collector Rahul Rekhawar joined in and attended the small function organised at the Vesaraf hamlet to gift the bicycles. The residents said that for the first time, any government official has visited their place and they were overwhelmed by his presence. Rekhawar shared his thoughts with the students and learnt about the needs of the residents. He then asked the officials assisting him to ensure that the basic needs of the residents are fulfilled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-group-gifts-bicycles-to-20-girl-students-of-forest-hamlet-collector-impressed/articleshow/88522742.cms||---

In his message, he thanked the people of state for maintaining peace and harmony and prayed for the development of Bihar. “Even in difficult times, we need to keep faith in God,” he said. The 308-year-old Padri Ki Haveli in Patna City was reverberated with Christmas carol and spontaneous cultural events. Cakes were distributed and a decorated Christmas Crib, which represents how Jesus was born, was opened for devotees. The devotees gathered in the morning for Christmas service and shared greetings with each other. Fr Pius Prashant, parish priest of Queen of the Apostles Church at Kurji, said the mass prayer was conducted in two shifts at 7am and 8.30am. “The celebrations began with carol singing, which was followed by prayer service. We have prayed for the well-being of everyone and distributed 2,000 woollen blankets among the underprivileged living in the neighbourhood. The church remained open for non-Catholics till 6pm,” he said. Devotees also lit up candles at St Joseph’s Pro-Cathedral Church at Bankipore. The tradition of putting a symbolic baby Jesus in the crib was followed. The priests said Christmas was about spreading the message of love and peace across the world. Festivities continued throughout the day on Saturday at homes and eateries. Abhishek Patrick, a resident of Hajiganj, said after prayer service at the church, they decorated their home with tree, Christmas goodies and lights. “We ate sumptuous food with family members and relatives, distributed cakes and shared greetings with friends and relatives,” he said. Raymond Osta, a resident of New Patliputra, said he offered prayer with his family members at Sacred Heart Church, Patliputra. “We have distributed ration and blankets among 100 underprivileged families,” he said. The churches will hold a special prayer service from 8am on Sunday on the occasion of Holy Family Day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/christmas-celebrated-with-pomp-and-gaiety-in-patna/articleshow/88496661.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Delhi||Market crush in Delhi: Where mind is without fear?||NEW DELHI: People were yet again seen out in large numbers on Sunday throwing Covid-19 norms to the wind. There was absolute chaos at the gates of Sarojini Nagar market when the district administration temporarily closed them as a crowd-control measure. “A colleague fell down and got injured while trying to stop the crowd from entering the market. There was complete chaos as people did not follow directions easily,” said an official, who was a part of the sub-divisional magistrate’s team. Connaught PlaceCompared with a few days ago, there was a heavy deployment of policemen, civil defence and BSF personnel at the market to manage the crowd. Out of the five gates, only two were open to allow shoppers inside, but they were closed in the evening owing to crowding. Continuous announcements were being made on loudspeakers asking people waiting outside to return home and those who were shopping to finish quickly and go back. “I’m from Jammu. We had heard a lot about markets like Sarojini Nagar and Lajpat Nagar. But the officials here say that the market has been closed. This is a disappointment. As it was not something important, we are returning home,” said a shopper waiting in a long queue along with his family members. The officials said the market usually operated till 10pm, but was shut down early on Sunday. “We are facing many challenges in stopping the crowd. We have orders to stop people from entering now, so we are doing it. There is no exact way to know how much crowd we should allow inside, but for now no one can enter,” said Pankaj, a police constable posted at one of the gates. Besides a few patches, the market was full to the brim with people shopping and eating. There was little scope for social distancing as people were rubbing shoulders with each other to shop from hawkers. Odd-numbered shops were closed on Delhi government’s directions. “This is a festive period, so the crowd has swollen. As odd-even is in force, fewer shops are open. This is forcing shoppers to enter the few open shops, making social distancing difficult. It’s injustice if the odd-even rule is only for Sarojini Nagar market and not for others. This has put our customers in a lot of discomfort,” said Ashok Randhawa, president of Sarojini Nagar Mini Market Association. With the number of Covid-19 cases increasing and to avoid a “super-spreader” event, Delhi government had ordered Sarojini Nagar market to operate on an odd-even basis over the weekend considering the large footfall seen in the last few days. Despite court orders, hawkers were seen inside the market without masks, putting themselves and others at risk. Even though the government has been continuously warning people not to let their guard down because of the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases and the fear of the Omicron variant, protocols are continuously being flouted in public places. Similarly, in Connaught Place, people were seen not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. There were large crowds at popular eating joints and people were taking photographs without wearing masks. At Khan Market, there was a sparse crowd and most people were wearing masks properly, barring a few exceptions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/market-crush-where-mind-is-without-fear/articleshow/88511352.cms||---

Speaking after inaugurating the new CPM district committee office in Kasaragod on Sunday, Vijayan said that some sections were opposing the project just because they don’t want it to be implemented by the LDF government. “They are telling they won’t allow it to be implemented now. If not now, then when? A democratic government is obliged to admit the just opposition raised by the people. But some are opposing the project saying they don’t want it to be implemented during our tenure. The LDF government will not give in to the arrogance of those who say that they won’t allow the project to be implemented in the state,” the CM said. He added that the main issue is whether the state needs the project or not. “If the state needs a project and if the project is vital for the Nava Keralam, then it is up to the government to implement it,” he added. Explaining the benefits of the project, he said that the SilverLine would enable people from the northern most district of Kasaragod to cut short the travel time to reach Thiruvananthapuram to just four hours from the 12 hours taken now. People from Ernakulam would be able to reach anywhere in the state within two hours, he said. Stating that communalism of all shades should be opposed staunchly, Vijayan said that minority communalism will become fodder for majority communalism. Both are complementary to each other. CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said that UDF has been adopting a narrow-minded stand towards the SilverLine project. He added that people from outside the project areas were also raising protest against the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/if-not-now-then-when-will-silverline-happen-asks-cm/articleshow/88510138.cms||---
---||Delhi||Party well and truly over this year as night curfew leaves Delhi restaurants high and dry||NEW DELHI: About 600 restaurants and clubs across the city have alcohol licence. While each of them had planned daily events, apart from private parties, through the festive week culminating in a major gala night on New Year’s Eve, now they are staring at losses running into crores because of the curfew order passed by the government. Rising Covid-19 cases, spread of the Omicron variant and measures to contain the virus turned the most sought-after week for the restaurant industry into a nightmare. What was looking like a dream season a fortnight ago is turning out to be a complete washout. While dining places can expect some business during lunch and early dinner hours, nightclubs and high energy bars are the worst affected. Restaurateur Vishal Anand of Moonshine Food Ventures said the year ended on the worst possible note for the industry. While Christmas Day saw 50% cancellations, almost all New Year bookings had been cancelled. While Noida and Gurgaon had already announced night lockdown, Delhi’s decision to impose curfew meant that the last week of the year, which was usually the best week for business, was totally ruined. An artiste manager said this was also the time when the NCR generated thousands of jobs due to special events. Most anchors, DJs, bartenders, performers and artistes stood to lose their earnings due to the cancellations. A bar owner said most outlets had paid a hefty fee to renew licences recently hoping to make the most of this festive season. Ashish Begwani of Ophelia and Toy Room said many places were busy planning expansions and hoping to open new outlets to reap profits this festive season seeing the positive sentiment. This was reviving the market as new places were being leased and jobs were being created. “These knee-jerk decisions to impose curfews impact the market sentiment. The industry will lose many talented entrepreneurs and professionals due to such decisions,” he added. National Restaurant Association of India’s Delhi chapter head, restaurateur Priyank Sukhija of First Fiddle Restaurants, said he was yet to understand the logic behind night curfew. As shops, public transport, markets and offices stay open during the day, restaurants and bars seem to be the only ones targeted through this order. “The restaurant industry hopes that the government will allow service in restaurants and bars as most outlets follow strict Covid protocols,” he added. A hotelier who had live singing events planned said he had to cancel them as no one would leave at 9.30pm on New Year’s Eve. “Night curfew will mean endless checks and dissuade people from stepping out. However, while these measures may seem extremely harsh, they are a welcome precaution than having complete lockdowns and multiple job losses,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/party-well-and-truly-over-this-year-as-night-curfew-leaves-city-restaurants-high-and-dry/articleshow/88511377.cms||Amin Ali

On January 20, 2018, at Lover’s Beach, Betalbatim, the accused murdered D’Costa by slitting his neck with a sharp knife, and after committing the crime, the accused concealed the blood-stained weapon in the bushes and took away the gold items on the person of the deceased, cash and two mobiles, and concealed them at different places. The prosecution led by counsel D M Korgaonkar examined 28 witnesses in the case. “All the circumstances stood proved by the prosecution, and all the circumstances taken together are sufficient to hold the accused guilty of murder beyond all reasonable doubt,” judge D’Silva observed. The judge also observed that the accused had pre-planned the crime as he had purchased a knife about two days prior to the incident, primarily to cause death and commit robbery of the gold ornaments, which were on the person of the deceased, and fled from the scene of occurance. The fine amount of Rs one lakh shall be paid to the wife of the deceased, the court ordered.

The same centres will also be used to administer booster doses to health and frontline workers and senior citizens with comorbidities. “We have the infrastructure in place. There is no dearth of vaccines. We are waiting for a nod from the Swasthya Bhawan to begin the vaccination process for children and booster doses for health and frontline workers along with senior citizens with comorbidities,” said a senior KMC health department official. According to a KMC health department official, at present the civic body has over 150 primary health centres which will be made functional keeping in mind the vaccination needs of the children in the wake of Omicron spread. “These urban primary health centres are being run as Covid vaccination centres. But most of these are lying idle. These centres can play a pivotal role in catering to the vaccination needs of children, frontline workers and senior citizens,” said a KMC health department official. The KMC health department will also take help of vaccination mega centres to cater to the vaccination needs. “We can administer 300 doses daily from an urban primary health clinic. In case of the mega centres, the number of daily doses will cross 500,” said a health department official. According to a KMC official, all medical officers in-charge of the primary health centres have been asked to take necessary steps so that the vaccination for children could get started from January 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-to-convert-health-clinics-into-jab-units-for-kids/articleshow/88510818.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||‘Vax for children to help check Omicron spread’||Kolkata: With 15-18 age group being brought under the vaccination fold, a part of the most vulnerable section has been included in the drive, felt experts in Kolkata. This will help check transmission of Omicron that has been affecting a large number of children and young adults worldwide. A seven-year-old kid and a 17-year-old are among the confirmed Omicron cases in Bengal so far. “This was necessary since children and teenagers are the only unvaccinated section and remain most vulnerable to Covid and any of its variants. It would have been better if we could include the 12-15 group now. Many countries have already vaccinated their children last year. With the below-15 group excluded, we are yet to offer protection to the paediatric population,” said paediatrician Shantanu Ray. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist Sauren Panja, however, felt that the step was a timely one and will soon lead to the inclusion of the younger age groups. “We will probably see the below-15 section being included next month. They are vulnerable and I believe that the health authorities recognize that,” said Panja. Paediatric surgeon Satarupa Mukherjee of BM Birla Hospital described the move as a ‘right step’. “This opens up the vaccination drive a lot more and will surely pave way for the vaccination of those below 12 years. They have suffered a lot, more due to the restrictions that prevented children from attending school for two years. Vaccination finally brings a glimmer of hope. In due course, they should be able to return to school and outdoor life,” she said. Several private hospitals in Kolkata are gearing up to augment facilities at their paediatric wards and training their doctors and nurses to be ready for a sudden spurt in paediatric Covid admissions, which is being feared during the impending third wave. Even though most paediatric wards at these hospitals still have enough vacancies, a swift rush of patients is not being ruled out. The state government has already augmented children’s wards at multiple government hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-for-children-to-help-check-omicron-spread/articleshow/88510837.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Goa||With Lourenco out, Sardinha’s son eyes Cong Curtorim ticket||Margao: Congress’ headhunting exercise for its candidate in Curtorim constituency hasn’t made much headway, even as Shalom, son of South Goa MP Fransisco Sardinha, has also laid claim to the party ticket. Shalom told TOI on Sunday that he has already made known his willingness to the party leadership to contest as a Congress candidate. “If the party feels I am worthy enough to be its candidate, I will be more than happy to contest,” he said. Shalom said that though other parties had approached him to contest on their ticket, he had declined the offers as, he said, he had already assured the ex-Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco of his support this time. Lourenco’s exit from Congress – he is likely to be the TMC candidate – has led the party to search for his replacement as his name figured in the first list of candidates released. Though the party moved swiftly to contain any voter resentment following Lourenco’s resignation, it had to abort its plans of holding a public meeting in Curtorim on two occasions in a week. The meeting has now been planned for Wednesday where party workers are expected to put up a united front. Apart from Shalom, there are three other aspiring for the party ticket from Curtorim. These are Congress Curtorim block president Milagres Fernandes, former Rachol sarpanch Joseph Vaz and Camurlim sarpanch Basil Fernandes. Curtorim constituency has generally been a bastion of Congress party. Lourenco has won from this constituency three times on a trot, once on a Save Goa Front party ticket and twice on Congress ticket. “We have a strong base in Curtorim and we will win the Curtorim seat 100%,” Congress South Goa district president Joe Dias told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-lourenco-out-sardinhas-son-eyes-cong-curtorim-ticket/articleshow/88511428.cms||---

District collector of Ahmednagar R B Bhosale along with civil surgeon Dr Bhushankumar Ramteke and district health officer Dr Sandeep Sangle visited the school and interacted with the teachers, children and parents, and took stock of the situation. The institute is part of central schools meant for talented students in rural areas. Bhosale said all children were either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and their condition was stable. “All children are mostly asymptomatic and because they have to be institutionally quarantined they now have been admitted to a rural hospital and Dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC),” Bhosale said. The other children will stay in the school till the mandatory 14-day observation period is over. On Friday, 19 children had tested positive for the contagion following which swab samples of 410 children were immediately collected. Parents of the children had gathered outside the school and demanded that their children be handed over to them because none of them were ill. The administration, however, pointed out that it was not possible especially because the children had to be quarantined. The residential school started functioning from early November as they had a program starting in mid of December. The first child tested positive for Covid around 10 days after the gathering. Citing the school’s example, health authorities have appealed to the citizens and schools to be cautious while conducting any program or gathering and stick to Covid appropriate behaviour so that the infection does not spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/52-fresh-covid-cases-reported-in-ahmednagar-school/articleshow/88509580.cms||Abhilash Botekar

According to the Nashik circle health officials, as soon as the task force announces details, the directives regarding the vaccination process will be issued to the health officials. An official from the district health office, said, “We are preparing for the vaccination of the children. We will seek the data on beneficiaries in the 15 to 18 age group from the education department to facilitate the vaccination drive.” The health officials would target the children studying in schools and junior colleges, as well as, the dropouts. The aim is to ensure that all eligible children get vaccinated at the earliest. The estimated number of children in the 15 to 18 age group in the Nashik rural areas (15 talukas excluding Nashik and Malegaon corporations) is 1,63,458. Within the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) limits, there are 72,168 children in the vaccination age group, while in the MMC limits, there are 25,000 children. The officials further said the vaccination will likely take place at school or college premises so that the children can be vaccinated in a time-bound manner. “While different vaccination camps were organised in the colleges for the vaccination of students above 18 years of age, a similar approach is likely to be taken for the age group of 15 to 18 years,” the officer said. Meanwhile, “precautionary” doses would also be given to the healthcare workers (HCW) and people above 60 years of age having comorbidities. So far, in Nashik district, 68,037 healthcare workers have received the first dose and 55,317 have taken their second shots. The HCWs include doctors, nurses, medical and non-medical staff at the hospitals who are treating Covid patients. In the case of senior citizens with comorbidities, the citizens can obtain a certificate from their doctor mentioning the health issue based on which the “precautionary” dose will be administered, the officer said. The official also pointed out that the necessary changes in CoWIN application for age-inclusion and to make room for the third dose are underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vax-drive-for-15-18-years-group-to-start-from-jan-3/articleshow/88509583.cms||Abhilash Botekar

All of them have been put under institutional quarantine, a state health department official said. The four suspects flew in Air India flight AI-164 from Heathrow in London. The flight had 198 passengers while 180 of them — aged above five years of age — underwent tests. “Four flyers were found positive for Covid-19 at the airport. Their samples will be sent for genome sequencing on Monday,” said health services director, Ajay Chakraborty. The four were initially directed to the dedicated isolation facility for Omicron suspects at the state-run Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General Hospital (ID&BG). They were later transferred to private hospitals on request. The 44-year-old man admitted to the Dhakuria unit of AMRI is a resident of Kaikhali while the 24-year-old man and the 31-year-old woman, both residents of Shyambazar, are admitted to AMRI’s Salt Lake unit. The five-year old girl admitted at AMRI Mukundapur is a resident of Prince Anwar Shah Road. She is the first child to be put under institutional quarantine in Bengal as a case of Omicron suspect. “The girl is completely asymptomatic. Since the parents are not allowed inside, a nurse will give company and take care of her,” said a source of the hospital chain. Currently, five Omicron-positive patients are in hospital isolation. None of them have severe infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/5-yr-old-3-other-uk-flyers-new-o-suspects-in-state/articleshow/88510848.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Entries from 15 countries were screened at the International Golden Mirror Film Festival. The event was organised by Chicago-based Amit Chowdhury and Kushal Bose along with friend Amlan Dutta, who shifted to Kolkata from Chicago just before the Pujas. “We got a lot of help from Amitrup Dutta, Indranil Ghosh, Abir Mondal and Ranajit De. Monalisa Dasgupta flew down from the US to participate. She, along with 23 others, attended the event to receive their awards personally,” Dutta said. The festival saw the presence of actors Kinjal Nanda, Anuradha Mukherjee, Debjani Chatterjee, director Arjunn Dutta and music director Ranajay Bhattacharjee, among others. According to Ghose, any effort made during a pandemic to support cinema ought to be lauded. “That’s why I went to support this initiative. I’m glad that so many young film-makers participated in this festival,” Ghose said. Actor Sukriti Lahori, who was also felicitated at the event, loved Promita Bhowmik’s ‘Porichoy’. “It just had two characters and went on to win the best film award. Sudipta Chakraborty won the best actress award for the same film,” she said. Mukhopadhyay remembered how 75 years ago, avant-garde French film-maker and critic Alexandre Astruc foresaw a kind of cinema which is made as smoothly as effortless writing. “At this festival, some of the films that were shortlisted bear testimony to such kind of claims made by Alexandre. Most of the films curated for the festival make a personal statement about our emotional experiences of love, loss and nostalgic regret for time that doesn’t exist,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/us-based-film-buffs-host-festival-in-city/articleshow/88510847.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The accused, Subhajit Pal (26), was found wearing a jacket with reflectors in a CCTV footage but cops could not identify him as his face was covered by a mask. However, Pal, while roaming around the road in Salt Lake, bumped into a team of policemen on night patrol and cops recognised him with the help of his jacket, which reflected the headlight of the police van. Over the last few weeks, several thefts and pickpockets were reported from petrol pumps, markets and shops in Salt Lake. “In multiple CCTV grabs, we found the man wearing the same jacket. We alerted all the police stations in the area about the criminal. Finally, he landed in the police net and the jacket with reflectors around his chest helped us locate him,” said an officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate. “The youth’s movement was also suspicious. We asked him to stop but he started running. We became sure that he was the accused in several theft cases and caught him. We are trying to recover the stolen items from him,” said an officer of Bidhannagar North police station. The accused is a known criminal who was arrested multiple times earlier, according to the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jacket-with-reflectors-lands-thief-in-cop-net/articleshow/88510849.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The decision came into effect on December 25. Earlier, the temple used to be open for darshan till 10 pm. Bhagyashree Banayat, the CEO of the Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust (SSST), Shirdi, said the decision has been taken in view of the new guidelines issued by the state government against the backdrop of an increase in the number of Covid cases.

On October 7, the government had permitted the reopening of religious places with certain conditions. Given that the number of Covid cases has started increasing again, the state government, on December 24, issued new guidelines with restrictions from 9 pm to 6 am.

A handful of passengers had come from Germany, Doha, Paris and Kenya. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC's executive health officer, said that 34 of 74 Omicron patients treated in Mumbai have been discharged.  State officials said that of the 31 new detections, 29 are asymptomatic while two have mild symptoms. The majority, barring those under 18, are vaccinated partially or fully.

This includes 65% of the beneficiaries who have fully vaccinated with both the doses. Moreover, the city has also witnessed a rise in number of beneficiaries taking the second dose of vaccine during the last two months. Around 28% beneficiaries took their second dose in the last two months. Around two months ago, only 74% of the total beneficiaries were partly or fully vaccinated. This included 37% fully vaccinated people. A civic official said apart from first dose, the number of beneficiaries taking the second jab has also increased. “Panic about the new Omicron variant of Covid among the people has led to rise in vaccination figures. We have already started four 24x7 vaccination centres in the city to facilitate beneficiaries to take jabs as per their convenience,” the official said. These four 24x7 vaccination centres are New Bytco, Zakir Hussain, Swami Samarth and Indira Gandhi hospitals — all run by the civic body. “Our priority is to get all the beneficiaries fully vaccinated,” the official said. Around 1.10 lakh beneficiaries are yet to get the first dose of the vaccine. Some of the beneficiaries, who are yet to get the first jab, belong to the slums. “There may be some beneficiaries who are unable to get the first or second dose due to their working hours. Hence, those working throughout the day can get vaccinated at night at any of the four 24x7 vaccination centres,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-92-fully-or-at-least-partly-vaccinated/articleshow/88509593.cms||Tushar Pawar

Though light and sporadic, the rain and clouds will pull the mercury up and the chill – which has already got reduced - may disappear till January 30, said the Met office. The mercury, though, will start plunging from December 31 and may drop to 13 degrees on the New Year day. “A western disturbance is now approaching central India from Jammu and Kashmir. It will eventually turn towards the east, triggering clouds and rain in Bihar, north Bengal and western parts of Gangetic Bengal. So, the western districts of Bankura, Purulia and Birbhum will receive moderate showers under its impact,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das. He added that temperature will now remain above normal and a cloud cover persist till the WD dissipates. “The temperature has already crossed 15 degrees in Kolkata and we may see a further rise over the next 48 hours. It will cross 16 degrees by the middle of the week even as it remains cloudy,” added Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/met-spies-drizzles-in-kol-this-week/articleshow/88510852.cms||---
---||Goa||Ahead of seat-sharing, GFP begins campaign in St Andre||Panaji: While Congress and Goa Forward Party (GFP) are yet to finalise their seat-sharing agreement, GFP president Vijai Sardesai and GFP candidate for St Andre Jagdish Bhobe commenced their door-to-door campaign in the former Congress constituency. Sardesai said any delay in campaigning would hand BJP an advantage in the ensuing polls.  While Congress has declared its first list of candidates, it has not yet formalized its seat-sharing arrangement with GFP. GFP’s Mayem candidate Santoshkumar Sawant has also commenced his campaign in Mayem. “We are active where we have a presence. Where Congress has a greater presence and we are not present, we do not want to disturb them,” Sardesai said. “If we wait for seat-sharing to be announced and then start campaigning, it will be too late and that will be advantageous for BJP. Our coalition’s focus is to defeat BJP. Everyone wants BJP to be thrown out. The seat sharing will be announced in due time.” Incumbent St Andre MLA Francisco Silveira, who got elected on a Congress ticket, switched over to the BJP along with nine other Congress MLAs. This created a vacuum for the grand old party in St Andre and GFP has tried to capitalize on this. The St Andre Congress block committee, however, had urged Congress to retain the seat.  While the St Andre block has no problem with the alliance, they have explicitly told election observer P Chidambaram, Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao and state Congress president Girish Chodankar that the ticket should not be given to a candidate of another party.  Sardesai also accused BJP of trying to create sectarian fissures and hoodwink Hindus by promising to reconstruct temples that were destroyed by the Portuguese. “Sawant has been unable to complete the restoration of the Saptakoteshwar temple, which began three years ago.Nearly 40% of the work still remains pending,” Sardesai said. “He (Sawant) should remember that Goans are not fools and will not get diverted from core issues like closure of mining, safety of women, destruction of environment and others by announcing construction of temples,” Sardesai said. He also said that there is speculation in political circles that the elections could be postponed because the BJP is not confident of winning the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ahead-of-seat-sharing-gfp-begins-campaign-in-st-andre/articleshow/88511545.cms||---

Besides, 1,601 cases of murder, including 240 dowry deaths and 1,352 cases of rape were also registered at various police stations till October 2021, the police added. The state government was under attack from opposition parties, which alleged rise in crime against women and targeted political killings. It may be stated here that BJP leader Jeet Ram Munda was killed in Ormanjhi in Ranchi in September while another BJP worker, Ram Munda, was attacked in Jamshedpur in November. A VHP member, Mukesh Soni, was killed this month in Ranchi district while another one was injured in Jamshedpur in November. In cyber crime, Jamtara and Deoghar districts remained the hubs of cyber criminals. Out of 919 cases, 717 were pending before various police stations. However, police had arrested 824 criminals in connection with various incidents. A CID official said, “It is not only Jamtara where cyber criminals are active.” “A large number of cases registered in Jharkhand had links with Bharatpur in Rajasthan.” On the organised crime front, extortion by criminals, mainly the Aman Sao gang and the extremist organizations, including the Tritya Sammelan Prastuti Committee and the People Liberation Front of India members was unabated. They mainly targeted the coal traders, brick kiln owners and the government contractors. Police registered 16 cases against Sao and 10 against another gang leader, Aman Singh, and arrested a horde of criminals associated with them. Inspector general (operations) and Jharkhand police spokesperson Amol Homkar said, “Police remained highly alert on various issues, including extremist activities, crime against women and cyber crime.” “ The status of crime against women was regularly reviewed to pass necessary instructions. Deputy superintendents of police were posted in areas witnessing high number of cyber crime. Our focus was also on checking inter-state groups involvement in promoting illegal opium cultivation in the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cyber-crime-still-a-major-challenge-for-state-police/articleshow/88510459.cms||Sanjay Sahay

---||Ranchi||Ahead of anniv, BJP releases ‘chargesheet’ against Hemant govt||Ranchi: The opposition BJP on Sunday released an eight page aarop-patra (chargesheet) against the JMM-Congress-RJD government helmed by chief minister Hemant Soren ahead of its second anniversary, citing how derailed law and order, corruption, lack of development among others have halted Jharkhand’s progress. The party also announced a dharna on Monday in all blocks and social media campaign against lawlessness in the state on December 29, the day the Soren government will celebrate two years in office. State BJP president Deepak Prakash and Dhanwar MLA Babulal Marandi released the “aarop-patra” in the presence of media in the party office. Talking to reporters, former chief minister Marandi, cited the “ills” plaguing Jharkhand. “Two years down the line, this government under the tribal CM has ended up being undemocratic, visionless and anti-people,” he said, adding that of all, atrocities and crime against adivasis and marginalized has brought infamy to the state. “Altogether 3,200 rapes, 3,486 murders, 224 dacoity and 1,271 cases of loot were recorded so far under this government. This apart, instances of Naxal incidents, too, have shot up. Such is the situation that people fear to venture out of home after dusk,” Marandi alleged. In terms of corruption, the government is setting new records everyday. “The recently published preliminary test results of Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) has exposed the underlying mess and corruption in the examination-conducting body. More than working for people, the ministers and MLAs of the government are busy managing the tenders. In several districts, illegal sand mining is continuing unabated. The list of corruption is endless,” he said. Prakash mocked the government for failing to provide jobs and leaving youths in the lurch. “The government promised 5 lakh jobs per year or unemployment allowances, youths today feel duped by this government. Due to wrong policies of the government, people are even losing their existing jobs across different departments,” said Prakash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ahead-of-anniv-bjp-releases-chargesheet-against-hemant-govt/articleshow/88510487.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Two freight trains collide in Simdega, services hit for 24 hrs||Ranchi/Gumla: Train movement between the busy Hatia-Bondamunda route, which connects Jharkhand and Odisha, were affected for close to 24 hours after two goods trains collided head on between Pakra and Kurkura railway stations in Simdega district late on Saturday night. The incident happened around 9.36 pm on Saturday when an iron ore-laden goods train, which was headed towards Bokaro Steel Plant from Rourkela, rammed into an empty goods train which was headed towards Bondamunda station from Hatia station in Ranchi. Owing to the collision, the railways diverted the Allepy-Dhanbad Express, Puri-Hatia Express, Jammu Tawi- Sambalpur Express through Chandil and Muri. In a statement, the Ranchi railway division said the Hatia-Jharsuguda Memu passenger and Rourkela-Hatia Memu passenger trains were cancelled. Vasco De Gama- Jasidih Express, Malda-Surat Express, Sambalpur-Benaras Express and Hatia-Yeshwantpur Express were also diverted earlier in the day. The impact was such that many as 11 freight coaches, called N-boxes in railway parlance, were damaged after being derailed while three engines were damaged. The loco pilots and assistant loco pilots, identified as Ranjit Kumar and Sanjay Kumar (of the iron ore-laden train) while Ashok Kumar Singh and Ranjit Kumar Rajak (of the empty train) escaped unhurt. The collision completely stalled railway movement in the 93-km stretch between Hatia and Bano stations. Four giant cranes, weighing 140 tons each, were moved in from Bondamunda and Hatia into the accident site to clear the wreckage and restore movement. Senior officials from the Ranchi railway division of the South Eastern Railways rushed to the site to oversee the wreckage clearance work. The SER pressed a five-member probe team to the spot to inquire into the incident. “ A detailed investigation is under way to ascertain the cause of the collision while work is being done on war footing to restore movement by 5 pm,” senior divisional operations manager Aditya Kumar Choudhary told TOI. However, repairs were still under way till 7.30 pm. According to preliminary evaluation, the financial losses incurred by the Indian Railways due to the collision is anywhere between Rs 50 and Rs 60 crore. Each of the engines cost around Rs 20 crore, railway sources said. In May this year, the Hatia-Rourkela passenger train was derailed onto soft earth with 84 passengers after rolling into a sip siding line from the main line in Kanaroan station along the same route. In 2017, a loaded goods train had rolled back in the same stretch and rammed into a another freight train, instantly killing two loco pilots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/two-freight-trains-collide-in-simdega-services-hit-for-24-hrs/articleshow/88510566.cms||Dhritiman Ray

District administration sources said cabinet ministers, MLAs from the ruling and opposition parties will also be invited to attend the programme where thousands are likely to attend from Ranchi and 23 other districts . The event comes at a time when the Centre has sounded an alert to all states to bring back fresh curbs as Covid-19 cases across the country are witnessing a surge. Jharkhand had 316 active cases on Saturday evening, of which 125 active cases have been recorded in Ranchi district alone. On Saturday, 58 new infections were reported statewide, the state health department’s Covid-19 bulletin said. According to the October 30 guidelines of the state disaster management authority (SDMA), outdoor congregations exceeding 500 people have been prohibited as a preventive measure against mass transmission of Covid virus. “The event will be held by seeking an exemption from the SDMA, which was done during the recent cricket match between India and New Zealand at the JSCA International Stadium in Ranchi,” an official in Ranchi administration said. Disaster management minister Banna Gupta did not answer TOI’s calls when contacted. Ranchi deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan and subdivisional officer Deepak Kumar Dubey did not respond to TOI’s calls either when contacted to enquire about the Covid-19 protocols which will be put in place at the venue. Sources in the chief minister’s office said beneficiaries of various government schemes will be brought in from all the 24 districts. That apart, the government is likely to roll out strategic action for malnutrition alleviation and anemia reduction (SAMAAR), a 1,000-day anemia and malnourishment eradication campaign in the state. Besides SAMAAR, the Soren government will also roll out a new tourism policy and ink a formal agreement with the Hyderabad-based Indian School of Business for forest products mapping and their market linkages. “That apart, the ongoing ‘government at your doorstep’ function will also conclude at the event,” an official in the CMO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/amid-virus-threat-6k-to-attend-cms-anniv-party/articleshow/88510508.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||India||Decision to jab 15-18 age group backed by data: NTAGI chief||NEW DELHI: The government’s decision to start Covid immunisation of children in 15-18 age bracket is based on scientific assessment of local as well as global data that shows 75% of Covid deaths in children during the last two years have been in this age group, National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) chairman NK Arora said. “Assessment of data from last two years shows 75% of deaths in all children — less than 18 years — due to Covid-19 are among 15-18 years. This is also the age when children interact more with adults. Worldwide, the vaccination is given step wise in this manner. We have also done vaccination on the same scientific principles. Our own data shows that complications among children below 18 years are concentrated in the age bracket of 15-18 years. This is the reason for prioritising this age bracket for vaccination in children,” Arora said. He stressed that vaccinating this age group will also reduce the risk of transmission through these youngsters to their family members. The comment came in the wake of some experts raising concerns about the government’s decision to start vaccination of children in 15-18 age bracket, saying the disease is mild in children. According to Arora, the disease is very mild in children below 10 years and also the chances of severity are very low among them. However, among those above 12 years the impact of the disease is mostly like that on adults. He also said that 10-15% of children between 15 to 18 years have comorbidities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/decision-to-jab-15-18-age-group-backed-by-data-ntagi-chief/articleshow/88512654.cms||Sushmi Dey

Madhya Pradesh reported nine cases, all of them foreign travelers. MP home minister Narottam Mishra confirmed on Sunday that Omicron cases were detected in the state, hours after TOI had published a report in its edition in the morning that a private lab at Indore had confirmed eight cases. Later in the day, a 23-year-old man who had returned from Dubai on December 17 also tested positive for Omicron. “All nine Omicron cases are fully vaccinated, including one from the US who has taken a booster dose. Six have been discharged and the other three are either hospitalised or in home isolation,” Indore chief medical health officer Dr BS Saitya said. Himachal reported its first case — a 45-year-old woman who had arrived from Canada on December 3 — just a day before PM Modi’s scheduled public meeting in Mandi. Maharashtra reported 31 cases, its single-highest detections in a day, taking the state tally to 141. Twenty-seven cases were found in Mumbai, including patients found positive during screening at the airport. Kerala reported the second highest daily cases, 19, taking the state’s tally to 57, the third highest in the country after Maharashtra (141 cases) and Delhi (79 cases). Rajasthan and Gujarat have 49 cases each. Haryana reported seven new cases raising the state’s tally to 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/omicron-hits-mp-hp-indias-tally-crosses-500/articleshow/88512688.cms||---

A 70-mile (112-kilometer) stretch of Interstate 80 was shut Sunday from Colfax, California, through the Lake Tahoe region to the Nevada state line. The California Department of Transportation also closed other mountain routes while warning of poor visibility and slippery conditions for drivers. “Expect major travel delays on all roads,” the National Weather Service office in Reno, Nevada, said on Twitter. “Today is the type of day to just stay home if you can. More snow is on the way too!” The weather service issued a winter storm warning for greater Lake Tahoe until 1 a.m. Tuesday because of possible “widespread whiteout conditions” and wind gusts that could top 45 mph (72 kph). The latest in a series of blustery storms hit Southern California with heavy rain and wind that flooded streets and knocked down power lines late Saturday. Powerful gusts toppled trees, damaged carports and blew a track-and-field shed from a Goleta high school into a front yard two blocks away, according to the Santa Barbara County Fire Department. No injuries were reported. More than 1.8 inches (4.5 centimeters) of rain fell over 24 hours in Santa Barbara County's San Marcos pass, while Rocky Butte in San Luis Obispo County recorded 1.61 inches (4 centimeters), the weather service said. Los Angeles International Airport said a “storm-related electrical issue” forced a partial closure of Terminal 5, causing post-Christmas passengers to divert to other terminals for certain services. “Cancellations and delays are possible, so it will be important to check your flight status today if flying through Terminal 5,” LAX tweeted. In the San Bernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles, crews were repairing a section of State Route 18 that washed down a hillside after heavy rain late Thursday. The closure of the major route into the Big Bear ski resort area could last for weeks, officials said. The continuing storms were welcomed in parched California, where the Sierra snowpack had been at dangerously low levels after weeks for dry weather. But the state Department of Water Resources reported on Christmas Eve that the snowpack was between 114% and 137% of normal across the range with more snow expected. Friday night into Saturday, 20 inches (50 centimeters) of snow fell at Homewood on Lake Tahoe's west shore. About a foot (30 centimeters) was reported at Northstar near Truckee, California, and 10 inches (25 centimeters) at the Mount Rose ski resort on the southwest edge of Reno.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/major-storm-dumps-snow-closes-mountain-routes-in-california/articleshow/88512720.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi imposes night curfew; schools & cinemas likely to be shut as next move||NEW DELHI: In view of a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases this week in Delhi, a night curfew between 11pm and 5am has been imposed in the national capital from Monday, December 27. Delhi reported 290 fresh cases on Sunday, up from 102 six days ago.  The test positivity rate crossed the 0.5% mark, taking Delhi to the cusp of the first level - the yellow alert - of a Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for imposing and lifting of restrictions. GRAP will come into force if the positivity rate remains above 0.5% on Monday. Night curfew is also one of the measures laid down in GRAP. Covid Tightens Grip, GRAP May Force Schools & Cinemas ShutEven though GRAP calls for curfew from 10pm to 5am, sources in the Delhi government said that the current order had kept the curfew from 11pm. The graded action plan was approved by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in July this year to bring clarity on which activities are allowed under what circumstances in case of a surge in Covid-19 numbers. There are four levels of GRAP, with colour-coded alerts called yellow, amber, orange and red. Different activities would be allowed with varying degrees of restrictions, with most activities being allowed with some curbs in level 1, and level 4 being almost close to a complete curfew. "The decision was taken in a high-level meeting on Sunday and the proposal was sent to the LG and DDMA chairman Anil Baijal for his approval," a senior Delhi government official said, adding that the proposal received the approval on Sunday evening. A night curfew is already in place in neighbouring UP and Haryana between 11pm and 5am and is being imposed in Delhi. Sources said that the curfew would ensure that celebrations on the New Year's Eve and the days prior to it don't lead to any crowding or a super spreader event. "We expect the night curfew to curb the spread of the infection to an extent before other restrictions come into place," he said. After the night curfew, if GRAP comes into effect, the activities that would immediately close are schools, colleges and any educational, training or coaching institution, cinema halls, multiplexes, banquet halls, auditoriums, assembly halls, spas and wellness clinics, gyms and yoga institutes, entertainment parks, amusement parks, water parks etc. Sports complexes and swimming pools would also remain closed except for national or international sporting events. While no social, entertainment, religious, political or festival-related gathering is allowed even now as per the latest DDMA guidelines, religious places would remain open, but no visitors would be allowed. Private offices would be allowed to open with 50% staff from 9am to 5pm during imposition of first and second levels, which would also see Delhi Metro being allowed to operate with 50%, and then 33%, seating capacity and no standing passengers, while bus travel would only be allowed for those in exempted categories. While shops dealing in essential goods would be allowed during all levels of GRAP, those dealing in non-essential goods and malls would be allowed in odd-even manner between 10am and 8pm, and 10am and 6pm, during first two levels, while only standalone shops would be allowed between 10am and 6pm in the orange and red levels. Restaurants and bars would only be allowed to open with 50% capacity during the yellow alert for a specified time. While restaurants are allowed to run home deliveries or takeaways in the later three levels, bars would remain closed. Up to 20 persons would be allowed for marriage gatherings and funerals in the first two levels and 15 persons in the latter two. A night curfew was previously imposed in Delhi in the month of April to restrict the movement of individuals between 11pm and 5am, except for certain categories of individuals who were exempted by the DDMA. It is expected that government officials engaged in essential services and healthcare personnel from the private sector would be allowed to travel on production of a valid ID card. Pregnant women and patients requiring health services would also be exempted, apart from those travelling from or to the airport, railway stations or ISBT, on production of valid tickets. Individuals who work in commercial and private establishments that provide essential goods and services are also likely to be exempt. This includes those working in shops dealing with food items or medicine and medical equipment, those working at banks, telecom and IT-enabled services, delivery of all essential goods through e-commerce, fuel stations, power sector, manufacturing units of essential commodities, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-imposes-night-curfew-cases-at-199-day-high-of-290/articleshow/88512763.cms||---

Active cases had slipped to 98 on August 20. Five Sharjah-returned flyers, at least four VNIT students and 13 cops who had returned from bandobast duties in Gondia for ZP elections were among those who tested positive. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said that the flyers were shifted to AIIMS Nagpur. “Two of them left for Amravati. The collector was informed about their positive result. Positive patients were also shifted to GMCH and IGGMCH. NMC’s Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital and IGR too have beds while MLA Hostel has 300 beds. All positive cases shall continue to go into institutional quarantine till beds are available,” Joshi said. The district has witnessed 78 cases from December 1 to 24. The last two days have added 56 cases. The district’s overall test positivity rate (TPR) is now 11.72%. The TPR for the day was 0.96%, indicating that a lot of close contacts from the previous day’s cases have tested negative. The month’s TPR stood at 0.23%, a slight rise from 0.22% a day before. The day’s new cases included 27 from city limits, two from rural and three from outside district. Dr Atul Somani, physician and intensivist, said that whether this is start of a new wave or not will depend on people’s behaviour. “We might quickly go into the third wave if people violate norms. Festival time, New Year and vacation period can all be trigger for a surge in cases. We should restrict ourselves. We can’t change the course of the disease. This might be same variant and a different variant. So, we have to reduce the incidence. It might explode if we don’t take care,” Dr Somani said. He added that breakthrough infections are common now and people need to overcome fatigue. “Even doctors are fatigued seeing Covid patients. Mask is most important as it blocks the virus entry into the airways,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/active-cases-in-ngp-dist-past-100-after-32-new-infections/articleshow/88511173.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

This is the 42nd tiger death in the state this year. As reported, the animal was rescued from a culvert pipe amid high drama on Thursday from Pombhurna forest range in Central Chanda. Despite best efforts by veterinarians from Wildlife Research and Training Centre (WRTC), the animal couldn’t survive. “The tigress was severely dehydrated, moderately anaemic, cachexia and brought in a critical condition. The lower jaw was totally broken with fractures of mandible bilaterally, loss of musculature, distorted floor of the mouth cavity,” said Dr Shirish Upadhye, director of WRTC. He said necessary treatment was offered with intravenous fluids, antibiotics and supportive therapy was instituted along with dressing of oral wounds. “The tigress couldn't swallow the boiled egg or the raw egg offered to it,” said Dr Upadhye. Blood profiling was also undertaken that showed severe generalized infection. On Sunday evening its condition became more critical, with compromised cardiorespiratory functioning and the tigress died around 7pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rescued-tigress-succumbs-to-injuries-at-gorewada/articleshow/88511186.cms||---

"The imperatives for the next few weeks or at least a month should address the threat of the new variant that India's rural and peri-urban areas may also face in addition to urban areas," senior clinical epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee said. Senior public health expert Dr Subhash Salunke said, "Fever or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance is key to keep a tab on early signs of picking up the spread of communicable diseases like Covid-19."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/surveillance-more-rat-can-check-spikes-sans-curbs/articleshow/88512838.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The patient is a 29-year-old woman who had gone to Dubai with her husband on December 8. They returned on December 20 and tested positive for Covid-19 on December 21. Both were admitted to AIIMS Nagpur. On Monday, the genome sequencing report of the woman came positive. “She is absolutely fine,” said doctors. Now, the number of Omicron patients in Vidarbha has reached five. TOI has confirmed inputs that S gene drop has been detected in RT-PCR tests of at least 20 Covid-19 positive patients in the last four days, indicating that Vidarbha may witness a sharp rise in number of Omicron patients in the next two weeks. The relief factor is that no Omicron patient has turned serious or critical in Vidarbha. Three patients have already been discharged from hospital after full recovery. Overall, Vidarbha reported 21 new cases on Monday. Though, the number is less as compared to Sunday when 40 cases were reported, it cannot be taken as an indicator that infection has gone down. The number of tests reduced to 4,325 – less than half of Vidarbha’s daily average testing. It was due to Sunday and Christmas weekend. The test positivity rate (TPR) on Monday also neared 0.50%, which is ‘high’ for Vidarbha where TPR was as low as 0.10% earlier this month. The day also saw 13 patients recovering in the region. Now, 165 patients are under treatment, with 109 of them in Nagpur alone. Nagpur district reported 13 new cases in the last 24 hours, including eight from Nagpur city. Of the seven patients recovered in the district on Monday, five were from Nagpur city. Wardha: Two patients recovered on Monday, taking total recoveries to 48,109. None was detected positive for Covid from 122 tests. There are three active cases now. Amravati: The district on Monday detected four patientsafter 557 tests. Active cases increased to 10. Chandrapur: Solitary detection and no recovery took the number of patients under treatment in the district to six on Monday. . Yavatmal: The administration received 519 reports and only one came positive. There are 12 active cases. Akola: There were zero new cases from 196 tests in the last 24 hours and no recoveries. There are six active cases. Washim: No new case was detected in Washim which maintained its ‘zero Covid’ tag. Yet the district collector issued order for fresh restrictions from Monday. Buldhana: All the seven tests conducted came negative. There are 10 active cases. Bhandara: All 13 tests conducted came negative. There are no active cases. Gadchiroli: One of the seven under-treatment patients recovered on Monday. All 335 tests conducted in the last 24 hours came negative. Gondia: The district reported two new cases while one patient recovered. Three patients are under treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-reports-3rd-omicron-patient-vid-cases-dip-due-to-low-testing/articleshow/88530600.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nagpur||Amid Covid scare, life as usual on VNIT campus save classes||Nagpur: Students moving around, faculty busy with academic activities, and sound of construction work from different corners keep piercing the serene silence every now and then on the sprawling campus. The scene at Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) appeared just like any other normal day. While PG students and PhD scholars seemed rejoicing the campus life, the stay has been cut short for many undergraduate students. BTech students have started leaving for home in batches. “We got train reservation for later dates,” said a group of students from north India. TOI saw some students being picked up by their families, while some left in cabs after the institute deferred January 3 reopening of BTech physical classes. The decision was taken after three boys and one girl student tested Covid positive. The students cited examples of medical colleges and other residential technology institutes where physical classes continued even after some students tested positive. “Only four students out of the 600 tested are positive. The college administration should have been prepared. Many were asked to return while they were still in train or flight,” they said. The students accused the college administration of not taking their views into consideration. “Only students are tested, not the faculty or other staff. Anyone is freely coming in and going out of the campus. They are blaming us for bringing the infection inside. We are all negative,” they said. VNIT director Pramod Padole said the institute wanted to keep the situation under control. “We had permitted only fully vaccinated with a latest RT-PCR negative certificate to enter the campus. Over 90 students had taken only the first dose, so we asked them to continue with online classes from their homes. The four were found positive in the drive taken by us,” he said. He said, “The decision to defer restarting BTech physical classes was taken as cases were rising everywhere. In November, we had planned the January 3 reopening. We have just ensured avoiding situation like in March 2020 when students had to be sent home in panic.” As on Monday, 110 students were on the campus and they too are expected to leave soon. Padole added MTech and PhD students requiring campus stay are less in number as compared to BTech. “All administrative and academic activities are going on as usual. MTech students working on projects are allowed as they need lab access. PhD students stay outside, so the risk is less,” said Padole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/amid-covid-scare-life-as-usual-on-vnit-campus-save-classes/articleshow/88530648.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The minister said he is pushing a Rs150 crore project to build what would be the country’s first ever agro-convention centre near Telangkhedi. Spread in an area of 12 acres, it would come up on Panjabrao Krishi Vidyapeeth (PKV) land. “With this, all my aspirations for bringing up new projects in Nagpur would be completed,” he said. The minister was addressing the closing ceremony of Agrovision expo, which started on December 24. Gadkari has been patronizing the event for the last 13 years. “There are also plans to acquire 4 acres of public utility land in front of Radisson Blu Hotel on Wardha Road for Agrovision Trust. This will become a permanent site for holding the yearly exhibitions. The area will have a training centre and also a market place for farmers to sell their produce directly. However, this is at a very initial stage and the land has not been acquired yet,” he said. On the Telangkhedi project, he said it would come up on the PKV land and the implementing agency would be the state public works department. “The entire project would require Rs150 crore, which may not be readily available. I plan to tap different sources from both the Centre and the state to get the funds,” he said. Gadkari said he plans to get the project approved from the Union agriculture ministry as the detailed project report (DPR) is already ready. The design has been prepared by architect Habib Khan. There are plans to have a permanent convention centre so that farmers from throughout the country can visit the place. The land will also be used to provide practical understanding of new farming techniques, he said. Sources aware of the plans said the land chosen for the project is located towards Dabha. It’s 30 acre land parcel belonging to the PKV, out of which part would be used. The existing Futala beautification project entails a cost of Rs150 crore. Work on the fountain project is already in advanced stages. The work is being implemented by the Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation and Nagpur Improvement Trust. There are plans to have laser fountain show at the Futala, also known as Telangkhedi. A viewers gallery is also being built near the lake’s embankment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadkari-draws-rs150cr-plan-on-pkv-land-near-futala/articleshow/88530662.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nagpur||Gadkari’s transport ministry issues advisory for automakers on flex fuel engines||Nagpur: Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari said an advisory on flex fuel engine has been issued on Monday. He signed the paper while in Nagpur to attend the Agrovision Expo — an event on agriculture which he has been patronizing since the last 12 years. Talking to newspersons on the sidelines of the expo’s closing function, Gadkari clarified that the advisory does not make it mandatory for automakers to have flex engines. It is only an advisory. However, three major companies, Suzuki, Hyundai and Toyota, have agreed to make the flex engines, he said. A meeting of all automakers would soon be held in Delhi, said Gadkari. Flex engine enables running a vehicle both on petroleum fuel and ethanol. Gadkari has been promoting use of ethanol has an alternate fuel. Ethanol is also a by-product of the sugar industry. The erstwhile Purti Group promoted by Gadkari also has sugar factories. Now run by his sons, two new companies — CIAN Agro and Manas Group — have been created out of the Purti Group. Gadkari has also been encouraging farmers to grow sugarcane, and success stories of farmers were highlighted during Agrovision too. Ethanol is also being blended in petrol. Gadkari said, “There will soon be cars and motorbikes running on ethanol, and farmers would be the fuel producers. There would be pumps for vending ethanol. I have insisted that farmers, who would be the source of fuel, should be allotted the vending stations.” Apart from sugarcane, Gadkari has also been strongly pushing to make ethanol from other biowaste like rice-straw. Gadkari also promotes growing of bamboo, saying that like ethanol the state government has already allowed blending bamboo with coal as feed stock for power plants. With all the power plants clubbed, there is a need for 25 lakh tonnes of bamboo. The supply in Vidarbha is far beyond the need. This would get bamboo a higher price than sugarcane, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadkaris-transport-ministry-issues-advisory-for-automakers-on-flex-fuel-engines/articleshow/88530672.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Kolkata||Yaas and Tauktae in top 5 global climate disasters of ’21: Report||Kolkata: A new report by Christian Aid, ‘Counting the cost 2021: a year of climate breakdown’, identifies 15 of the most destructive climate disasters of the year. The report includes cyclone Yaas, which hit coastal Bengal in May. Ten of the events cost $1.5 billion or more each. Most of the estimates are based only on insured losses, meaning the true financial costs are likely to be much higher. Cyclones Tauktae and Yaas are ranked as the 4th and 5th most expensive disasters in 2021 respectively. They accounted for $1.5 billion and $3 billion in losses. The worst disaster was Hurricane Ida, which struck the US in August, costing $65 billion and killing 95 people. July floods in Europe cost $43 billion and killed 240 while floods in China’s Henan province caused $17.5 billion in destruction, killed 320 and displaced over a million. While the report focuses on financial costs, which are usually higher in richer countries because they have higher property values and can afford insurance, some of the most devastating extreme weather events in 2021 hit poorer nations, which have contributed little to causing climate change. Some of the disasters in 2021 hit rapidly, like Cyclone Yaas, which struck Bengal and Bangladesh in May and caused losses valued at $3 billion in just a few days. Four of the ten most costly events took place in Asia, with floods and typhoons costing a combined $24 billion. Such climate devastation is set to continue without action to cut emissions. Insurer Aon warns that 2021 is expected to be the sixth time global natural catastrophes have crossed the $100 billion insured loss threshold. All six have taken place since 2011, and 2021 will be the fourth time in five years. Report author Dr Kat Kramer, who is Christian Aid’s climate policy lead, said: “The costs of climate change have been grave this year, both in terms of financial losses but also in the death and displacement of people around the world. Be it storms and floods in some of the world’s richest countries or droughts and heatwaves in some of the poorest, the climate crisis hit hard in 2021. While it was good to see some progress made at the COP26 summit, it is clear that the world is not on track to ensure a safe and prosperous world.” Dr Anjal Prakash, research director at the Bharti Institute of Public Policy, Indian School of Business, is coordinating lead author in the IPCC’s special report on oceans and cryosphere in a changing climate. He said: “It is the industrialised north that has contributed to much of the climate change we see today. Those countries had agreed to mobilise $100 billion of climate finance per year by 2020 but failed to meet this goal. During COP26, the countries of the global south came with an expectation that the gathering will show them a roadmap in achieving the global goal on adaptation funding, which was a major constituent of the Paris Agreement.” “As this new report documents, India is one of the countries which is greatly disadvantaged by climate change induced disasters. Adhering to the principles of climate justice, the countries of the global south must call for technology transfer and adaptation finance for the countries th-at have not contributed historically to climate change but are bearing the brunt,” he said. Rachel Mander, who is a member of the Young Christian Climate Network and took part in a walking relay to Glasgow for COP26, said: “Climate change will bankrupt us, and along the way we will lose so much more than money. To avoid this eventuality we need to take courageous action, making sure that the burden of costs are distributed and do not worsen global inequality.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/yaas-and-tauktae-in-top-5-global-climate-disasters-of-21-report/articleshow/88511277.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||Dissent, candidate pick under lens in Bengal BJP review||Kolkata: The hunt for “Trojan horses” in the Kolkata civic polls surfaced in the borough-wise BJP review meeting when a number of party candidates complained against insiders trying to create hurdles, helping rival Trinamool Congress take advantage of the dissent. Bengal BJP leaders will meet national general secretary (organization) B L Santhosh at a meeting in Kolkata on Monday. Several party workers pointed out that candidate selection too contributed to the disparity in BJP’s borough-wise vote share. While BJP was able to garner 20% vote share in borough IV and more than 14% share in boroughs V and VII, it struggled to cross the 10% mark in at least six others. Workers pointed to a lack of coherence at grassroots level that affected the party’s performance in the Kolkata civic polls. Bengal BJP co-observer Amit Malviya, who conducted the meeting, wanted to assess what brought the party’s vote share down within six months. Earlier, BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh had said there were 10-15 more wards where the party could have done better. On Sunday, party workers said the organization in Kolkata was weak to resist rigging and false voting. In several wards, party agents were pushed out and workers intimidated, they claimed. Ghosh had alleged that Trinamool had brought cadre from outside to ensure false votes. “Our candidates and agents were beaten up and detained at the police station,” said a BJP leader in Kolkata. “In ward 83, the BJP candidate’s wife campaigned for TMC while Rupa Ganguly had vowed to campaign for the Independent candidate in ward 86. Such incidents have sent wrong message to the party’s rank and file,” the leader added. Malviya assured party workers that Trinamool would not get a chance to repeat the same during upcoming municipality polls in districts. Bengal BJP leaders would now stay in touch with Union home minister Amit Shah over the “partisan approach” of police and administration. A detailed plan would be prepared, keeping Delhi leaders in the loop. “Trinamool will now face resistance in every district if they try to rig polls. Our organization was comparatively weak in Kolkata, but it will not be the same in districts,” said Agnimitra Paul, Bengal BJP general secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dissent-candidate-pick-under-lens-in-bengal-bjp-review/articleshow/88511373.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||SEC might revise civic poll plan; CM Mamata Banerjee to call on assembly speaker||KOLKATA: The State Election Commission is likely to amend the civic poll plan it had submitted to the Calcutta High Court after the West Bengal governor tweeted that he didn’t give assent to the Howrah Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2021, proposing separation of the 16 wards of Bally from HMC. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee will call on assembly Speaker Biman Banerjee on Monday, sparking speculation that the latter might drop the bill without waiting for Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar’s assent “indefinitely”. The governor had hinted that he might reserve the bill for the President’s consideration under Article 200 of the Constitution. Dhankhar also criticized education minister Bratya Basu following his comment that the state government was exploring legal options to make the CM chancellor of universities. The CM might also discuss with the speaker some changes in the rules of business of the assembly in an attempt to enhance powers of the assembly secretariat. The SEC, in the backdrop of confusion over the Howrah bill, might announce polls to four municipal corporations — Bidhannagar, Asansol, Siliguri and Chandernagore — instead of five, leaving out Howrah after Dhankhar contradicted the Bengal advocate general’s submission to the HC stating that the bill had got the governor’s assent. On Sunday, state election commissioner Sourav Das said: “We can hold the Howrah and Bally polls if we get clearance from the state government.” Das further said the notification was not likely to be issued on Monday. The commissioner will hold a press conference on Monday to announce details of the election programme for the remaining 109 civic bodies. The Howrah bill, passed in the assembly in November, sparked a row between the speaker and the governor, who sought clarifications from the state government over the grounds for delinking the 16 Bally wards from HMC when the same government had proposed their merger in 2015. Dhankhar came down heavily on the speaker, saying he was “crossing his limit” after Banerjee said the governor was sitting on the bill passed by the assembly. Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy said the governor should “understand his limitations” and refrain from “insulting” the speaker. “Banerjee is an MLA and speaker of the West Bengal assembly. The governor is only the Centre’s appointee. Any insult to the speaker won’t be tolerated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sec-might-revise-civic-poll-plan-cm-to-call-on-assembly-speaker/articleshow/88511381.cms||---

Soon after SI Umesh Chandra (57), who had joined the unit two weeks back, slumped to the ground, head constable M Stephen (45) also shot himself. He is now in critical condition and is undergoing treatment in a government hospital, but faces charges of murder and suicide. Officials said it is still a mystery why Stephen allegedly opened fire at the SI. “The SI came to have his breakfast at the mess where Stephen is posted as in-charge. For unknown reasons, an argument broke out between the two and Stephen using his service weapon, an AK-47, opened fire,” said a senior officer. Umesh Chandra, who hails from Bihar, died on the spot and for some time, the whole battalion was in a state of shock as many did not realise what had just happened. Not sure how many bullets were fired: SPStephen sustained bullet injuries on his torso. Officials said they are waiting for the post-mortem report to know the number of bullet injuries Chandra sustained. “We are not sure how many bullets were fired in the murder and attempt to suicide incident. The investigation is still being done and we will get clarity only after the post-mortem report. We found that there was no previous enmity between the two. Unless we talk to the injured constable, who is in critical condition, we cannot say what triggered the firing,” Mulugu superintendent of police Sangram Singh Patil told TOI. After the CRPF informed the Mulugu district police about the murder, they reached the spot and shifted the body for a post-mortem examination and the injured head constable was taken to a hospital. Assistant superintendent of police (Eturunagaram) Ashok Kumar said that a case was registered under section 302 (murder) and 309 (attempt to suicide) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-crpf-man-kills-si-at-breakfast-table-in-mulugu-shoots-self/articleshow/88512969.cms||---

This is the second instance of a contact testing positive in the state. With the three new cases, the total count of Omicron cases in the state so far has touched 44. Of the 44, 10 patients completely recovered and were discharged two days ago. Although it is still too early to reach any clear understanding of the new variant, officials say that they are banking on the RT-PCR tests to see if patients test negative after 14 days. “Since all the 10 were asymptomatic, it is too early to say anything about the virus. However, there was no involvement of the lungs in any of the cases,” said a source from the state health department. A total of 11,493 passengers have landed at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, including 248 who landed on Sunday. Two passengers tested positive in the RT-PCR test done at the airport and their samples have been sent for genome sequencing. Meanwhile, Telangana saw 109 new cases of Covid-19 cases and one death. A total of 3,167 reports are still awaited. The number of active cases in the state stood at 3,417. A total of 190 patients were declared recovered on Saturday. The GHMC (GHMC) recorded 69 cases on Saturday, while neighbouring Medchal Malkajgiri recorded seven cases, Ranga Reddy recorded 10 and Sanga Reddy recorded one new case. Outside of Hyderabad city and its outskirts, Hanamkonda in Warangal with seven new cases recorded the highest number of cases outside of GHMC limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-3-persons-test-positive-for-omicron-tally-at-44-in-telangana/articleshow/88513020.cms||---

All the remaining active cases, who had a S-gene drop and suspected to be infected with Omicron, are undergoing treatment. This included actor Vadivelu and some members of his film crew, who returned from the UK recently. Chief minister M K Stalin on Sunday inspected infrastructure, amenities and availability of medical oxygen here to tackle the Omicron strain. Around 1.15 lakh beds are ready, and steps are being taken to create another 50,000 beds if warranted, said an official release. In Tamil Nadu, 610 tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday -- this was marginally higher than the numbers reported in the last two days. Chennai topped the chart with 171 new cases. With ten more people dying, TN's death toll increased to 36,735. But the state has received applications from 42,600 people for the CM's ex-gratia of Rs50,000 for every covid victim. The government claims that 20,900 have received this amount till date. It has spent Rs104 crore towards this. As far as vaccination is concerned, more than 17.3 lakh people got inoculated through the state's 16th mega vaccination camp on Sunday. Among them, nearly 70% got their second doses. TN still has more than 90 lakh people who are still due for their second dose. The release said that 58% of the state's vaccine-eligible population have got their first dose and 86% were fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, the government is gearing to begin administration of booster doses for frontline workers and vaccination for children (aged 15 to 18). Health minister Ma Subramanain said TN has over 1.4 crore frontline workers and they will start getting booster shots from January 10. For children (15-18 age), health officials will vaccinate them at their respective schools and special camps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-18-suspected-omicron-patients-discharged/articleshow/88513094.cms||---

One of the nine Omicron patients got infected despite having taken a vaccine booster dose in the USA. All nine are foreign travelers. This grim news comes amid signs of a Covid surge in MP - 207 cases have been detected in a week. Home minister Narottam Mishra announced on Sunday that eight Omicron patients have been detected in Madhya Pradesh. TOI had carried a report the same morning on the eight cases being detected at a private lab in Indore. "Six of them have been discharged and the other two are in hospital. They do not have cough, cold or any other Corona symptom. I believe they will also go back (home) soon," Mishra said in the morning. A few hours later, a ninth foreign returnee tested positive for Omicron. He had returned from Dubai on December 17, and the National Centre of Disease Control (NCDC) sent his report to the district authorities on Sunday. "All nine Omicron cases are fully vaccinated, including one from USA who has taken a booster dose. Six have been discharged and the other three are either hospitalised or in home isolation," Indore chief medical and health officer Dr BS Saitya said. The other eight include a 26-year-old woman who returned from Tanzania, two men, aged 20 and 31, who came from the USA, two men, aged 26 and 31, who flew in from the UAE, a 23-year-old man from Ghana and a 23-year-old woman from the UK. MGM Medical College dean Dr Sanjay Dixit said, "All the Omicron patients are asymptomatic, as severity is reduced because of the vaccine. Vaccines definitely reduce severity and fatality, so people should go for full vaccination." Omicron can dodge antibodies, masks are a must Dr Dixit cautioned that Omicron mutation has shown the ability to escape antibodies formed either due to natural infection or vaccination, so people should follow all Covid precautions. "Around 3,000 foreign travelers have landed in Indore (since the Omicron scare erupted), 26 of whom tested Covid-positive," minister Mishra said. Officials say 1,103 Covid samples have been sent to NCDC from Indore division for genome sequencing. Reports of around 100 are awaited. Indore reported 19 new Covid cases on Saturday night, taking its tally to 1.53 lakh. The new cases were reported from 15 areas including two from Rani Bagh area. The district has 120 active cases, the highest in six months. "Around 3,000 foreign travelers have landed in Indore (since the Omicron scare erupted), 26 of whom tested Covid-positive," the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/9-omicron-patients-detected-in-madhya-pradesh-amid-covid-surge/articleshow/88513120.cms||Antriksh Singh

---||Bhopal||OBC quota: Madhya Pradesh govt withdraws panchayat poll ordinance||BHOPAL: Around 10 days after the Supreme Court stayed OBC reservation in panchayat polls, the Madhya Pradesh government on Sunday withdrew an ordinance brought about to annul the process of delimitation and reservation rotation set by the Congress government in 2019. It's being seen as one step closer towards cancellation of panchayat polls. A state cabinet meeting was held on Sunday to withdraw the ordinance - an indication of the urgency with which the government is moving. On December 23, a joint resolution was passed by the BJP and Congress in the assembly that the panchayat polls should not be held without OBC reservation. The first phase of panchayat polls is scheduled on January 6. "Now, we hope that justice will be done to OBCs and they will get their due," PCC chief Kamal Nath tweeted, adding that Congress had carried out a sustained campaign against the "unconstitutional way" the poll was being conducted by the state government. Legislative affairs minister Narottam Mishra told mediapersons that the cabinet's decision had been sent to the Governor. Panchayat minister Mahendra Singh Sisodia, who was at the press meet, said it would be up to the state election commission to decide whether to hold panchayat elections. "The cabinet's decision to withdraw the ordinance is likely to pave the way for cancellation of the panchayat poll process in the state," Mishra said, hastening to add: "This is my opinion." Truth prevails: Nath on poll ordinance  Two days ago, Mishra, the government spokesperson, had suggested that panchayat elections should be postponed because of the Omicron threat. Mishra said there was nothing wrong with the ordinance but Congress "created trouble". "We consulted legal experts, including the law department and the advocate general, before withdrawing the ordinance," he said. Both ministers accused Congress of scuttling the poll process by moving high court and Supreme Court over delimitation and reservation rotation. CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan is committed to providing reservation to OBCs, the ministers said. Congress leader Kamal Nath hit back by saying: "We said from the very first day that the government is going to conduct panchayat elections in Madhya Pradesh in an unconstitutional way, and it should immediately withdraw the ordinance. We were making this demand since day one." "There should be delimitation but the Shivraj government kept adopting a stubborn attitude, Nath remarked, adding: "We spoke strongly on this, from the streets to the assembly. We opposed this government decision and today, finally, truth prevails. Truth may be disturbed but not defeated."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/obc-quota-madhya-pradesh-govt-withdraws-panchayat-poll-ordinance/articleshow/88513136.cms||---
---||Noida||Why Ghaziabad and Noida must increase Ganga water supply||Noida/Ghaziabad: The mushrooming high-rise apartments in Noida have led to a proportional rise in the demand for Ganga water supply. Currently, there is a demand for over 400 million litres per day (MLD) of Ganga water for the city’s nearly 10 lakh population, but the Noida Authority can only provide 240 MLD of the river’s water and an additional 90 MLD normal water. In neighbouring Ghaziabad, a recent survey by the civic corporation showed that against a daily demand of 371 MLD, the GMC provides only 264 MLD, indicating that nearly 24.8 lakh residents were facing a daily shortage of 107 MLD. In face of the supply shortage, there has been excessive exploitation of groundwater in the twin cities over the last few years. According to KK Jain, the secretary-general of Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Association (FONRWA), an umbrella body with 180 member RWAs of the city, groundwater has depleted to nearly 150 feet beneath the surface in Noida, of which about 4-5 feet depletion was recorded over the last year. “This is a year-on-year scenario. It is high time that the supply of Ganga water is increased to deal with the rising demand of Noida,” Jain said. Currently, the Noida Authority has begun work on the second phase (to supply 37.50 cusec water) of the 50 cusec Ganga water project and expects to complete it by 2022. According to officials, of the total 50 cusec capacity of the project, Ghaziabad will get only 25% water share. “The remaining 75% share (or 37.50 cusecs) will be supplied to parts of Noida and is expected to benefit residents of nearly 26 sectors, mostly along the Noida Expressway. The project will cost Rs 228.14 crore,” an official said. In Ghaziabad, where Ganga water is supplied to only Vasundhara, Indirapuram, Vaishali and Kaushambi areas, a ward-wise survey by the civic body’s waterworks department revealed that of the total 100 wards, there were 63 wards that were reeling under water scarcity. The over 107 MLD shortage is affecting over 3.5 lakh households,” said GMC commissioner Mahendra Singh Tanwar. The biggest demand and supply gap was noted in wards 50 (9.71 MLD) and 93 (9.61 MLD). To boost the water infrastructure, Tanwar said, sizable funds will be allocated under the 15th Finance Commission. “In addition, we are also concentrating on recycling water which by an estimate will generate 40 MLD of water,” added Tanwar. The Ganga water treatment plant at Pratap Vihar, currently, has two projects: a 50 cusec plant and a 100 cusec plant. The project engineer at the plant Adwitiya Sharma said, “The 50 cusec plant provides 120 MLD of Ganga water to Noida, GMC, UP Housing Board and GDA colonies. While the 100 cusec plant produces 245 MLD of water, of which Noida gets 80% while GDA gets 15% and colonies administered by UP housing board gets 5%.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/why-ghaziabad-and-noida-must-increase-ganga-water-supply/articleshow/88511643.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

Those missing were identified as Leonsingh Raja, 38, who ran a grocery shop in Tirusulam; his daughter Percy, 16, a Class XII student; and his brother's son Livingston, 19. Police said that the three were part of a 20-member group from Tirusulam that had boarded two vans to the church on Christmas day. The mishap occurred while they were returning to the city after offering praying at the church. Since the water flow in the river was heavy, the district administration had banned people from venturing near it. Despite the warning, passengers of the van got into the river near Chengalpet to click selfies. Fellow passengers said Raja’s family went deep inside the river, and were washed away, police said. Quoting eyewitnesses, police said that Raja tried to rescue his children but lost his balance. Some passengers stepped into the river but could not trace them. Fire and rescue services personnel were alerted, but even they could not locate the trio. The search operation continued on Sunday as well but rescue workers could not locate the three people.

For this, Rs 1.6 crore will be spent on constructing carriage tracks. GNIDA officials have identified about 400 vendors so far. Among other projects, there is a plan to convert Jalpura into a smart village for Rs 5.7 crore. The tender to select the contractor has already been floated. Around 40 other projects are in the pipeline, such as maintenance of a few sectors and villages, commercial belts in some areas and augmenting infrastructure in crematoriums. “With the setting up of vendor markets, hawkers will be able to stand at one place and sell their products instead of encroaching different areas across the sectors and creating problems for the residents,” said AK Arora, general manager at GNIDA. In 2019, GNIDA had identified about 400 vendors registered in Greater Noida. The list will be examined by a district-level vendor committee after which spaces for vending zones would be allotted. “Only those vendors who were serving in Greater Noida for long had made it to the list,” said Deep Chandra, the GNIDA additional CEO. Asked about the smart village programme, Arora said, “We are working on developing 124 villages, 14 of them in the first phase. Jalpura has been added to the list. The tenders for the first phase have already been issued.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gnida-nod-to-funds-for-vendor-markets-smart-village/articleshow/88511651.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

---||Nagpur||DDMA seeks state nod for curbs from 9pm||NAGPUR: Though the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had stayed its decision to impose Covid curbs within a few hours of issuing orders, the authority on Sunday sought state government’s permission to impose restrictions on commercial activities, eateries, cinema halls, functions, including weddings, between 9pm and 6am. TOI had reported on Sunday about DDMA’s decision to impose restrictions. Collector R Vimala and municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B had issued orders for its implementation. However, following alleged pressure from officials of state’s disaster management, relief and rehabilitation department and guardian minister Nitin Raut, the collector, who is chairman of DDMA, had stayed the order and decided to implement December 24 guidelines issued by the government from December 28 in rural parts of the district. Staying his decision dated December 25, Radhakrishnan issued an order on Sunday to implement the government’s new guidelines in the city with immediate effect. He made it clear that restrictions would be incorporated after due issuance of public notice by the DDMA and it’s decision on the basis of local situation. “City continues to be threatened by the spread of Covid-19, especially the Omicron variant, and rapid increase in the number of cases in the city recently. It is imperative not only to continue but also to tighten the measures to prevent the rapidly spreading virus. Stricter measures are needed in view of the upcoming festivals, New Year celebration and to prevent danger to human life, health and to break the chain of transmission of virus effectively,” he said. In the order dated December 24, the government had given powers to DDMA for deciding appropriate restrictions with a condition to give adequate public notice before enforcing the curbs. Despite DDMA being empowered to take a call, sources from the collector’s office and NMC said, the state’s disaster management, relief and rehabilitation department had directed the authority to send a proposal. Vimala told TOI, “The decision on restrictions was taken collectively by all DDMA members after detailed discussion in the meeting held on Saturday. City had experienced severe loss of lives during the second wave. There is need for effective implementation of Section 144 approved by the government. Therefore, all members were of the opinion that restrictions after 9pm will help in implementation of Section 144.” “Some people contacted the government and we received instructions for not implementing anything more than what the state order says, without prior permission. Therefore, my order was suspended till December 28. We are expecting reply from the government by Monday evening,” she said. Collector and civic chief stayed their orders without holding DDMA meeting again. It was reportedly mandatory for them to hold the meeting for revising the decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ddma-seeks-state-nod-for-curbs-from-9pm/articleshow/88511259.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Chandigarh||Haryana: Statue desecrated in Ambala church, cops book 2 suspects||AMBALA: A statue of Jesus Christ was allegedly desecrated by two unidentified persons at a church in Ambala Cantonment on Saturday night. On the basis of CCTV footage, the police are trying to identify the miscreants and have registered a case of hurting religious sentiments on the complaint of Father Patras Mundu of Holy Redeemer Church, Ambala. The glass cover of the statueThe Ambala church desecration comes after rightwing activists disrupted two Christmas-related events in a school in Gurgaon district’s Pataudi and in a hall at Kurukshetra. Gurgaon has already been facing massive right-wing protests against Friday namaz being offered in open spaces. A group of men, who identified themselves as members of the Dharam Jagriti Mission, barged into Pataudi and stopped the ‘Christmas Milan’ programme alleging that it had been organised to “brainwash children” and “prepare them for conversion”. They also raised ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans from the stage. In a somewhat similar incident, Bajrang Dal members disrupted a Christmas event at a private place in Kurukshetra, alleged that it was an attempt to convert people, and played ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ on the music system on the stage. In both Pataudi and Kurukshetra incidents, no police complaint has been filed till now. However, Ambala parish priest Father Mundu filed a police complaint. In his complaint he gave the details of the desecration: “Around 12.30 am, two suspects entered the church property by jumping over the gate. They roamed inside, vandalised electric lighting, and while on their way out around 1.40 am, desecrated the statue of Jesus Christ. It is a very sensitive issue for the Christian community and our religious sentiments are deeply hurt. In the CCTV footage, it is very obvious that this has been done intentionally.” “This church is very old and was established in the 1840s. There’s never been any such incident in the past. Christmas prayers were completed by 9.30 pm, people left by 10 pm, and by 10.30 pm, the entire church, including the gate, was closed,” he said. When asked about the series of incidents against the Christian community in the state on Christmas, Haryana home minister Anil Vij said in Chandigarh, “We have started efforts to arrest the accused persons. Three teams of CIA-I and II and SHO Ambala Cantt have been formed to arrest them. We have obtained CCTV footage, in which, two youths can be seen committing the crime. On the basis of the CCTV footage, we are hopeful that such elements will be arrested very soon.” ‘Action will be taken on complaint lodged by the church authority’The Haryana police reiterated that it would arrest the two suspects in the Ambala church desecration case at the earliest. The police authorities denied having received any formal complaint in the incidents that took place in Kurukshetra and Pataudi. “We shall ensure the strict punishment of suspects after their arrest. Rest we are waiting for the formal complaint into the alleged incidents of Kurukshetra and Gurgaon. Accordingly, further action will be taken,” said the Haryana police spokesman. Ambala police additional superintendent of police Pooja Dabla said, “We received the information about the incident in the morning, and the DSP, SHO, and CIA teams reached the spot immediately. CCTV cameras at the church were examined and two suspects were spotted committing the crime, either in mischief or to hurt religious sentiments. The matter will be investigated thoroughly and the accused, once identified, will be rounded up soon. We will also check the cameras outside the church to establish their identity. Action will be taken on the basis of a complaint lodged by the church authority.” Ram Kumar, DSP Ambala Cantt, said, “We have registered a case against two unknown persons under Sections 295-A (acts intended to outrage religious feelings), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs 50), 452 (house trespass) of the Indian Penal Code and started the investigation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-statue-desecrated-in-ambala-church-cops-book-2-suspects/articleshow/88513242.cms||JK Singh
---||Business||Omicron fails to dampen spirits for growth push in 2022||The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has clouded the growth outlook in India but experts are “cautiously optimistic” about the economic recovery sustaining the growth momentum against the onslaught of the virus. The optimism is driven by record vaccination, greater awareness about virus management and better emergency response in case of a surge in infections. While some states are bringing in measures such as night curfew to combat any sharp spike, there is a growing feeling that authorities may not need to resort to strict curbs that may affect economic activity. Experts reckon that there could be a short term impact on some sectors but it is unlikely to be as severe as seen in the previous surges. “Uncertainty with respect to the transmission, virulence and immunity evasion of the Omicron variant is clouding the economic outlook once again. Exactly a year ago, we were grappling with ambiguity with respect to virus mutations and efficacy of vaccines. But, 2021 has also helped us understand the virus better, helping in turn policymakers to create better health infrastructure and carve more chiselled restrictions to limit economic spillovers,” said Yuvika Singhal, economist at analytics firm QuantEco Research. “Against this background, despite the risks of Omicron being very real, we continue to believe that domestic growth inflation dynamics will remain favourable in FY23. On GDP, we are estimating a growth of 7.5% in FY23 (against 10% with mild downside risks in FY22) driven by a combination of continued rollover in pent up demand along with an uneven pick-up in private capex in select sectors,” said Singhal. Economists said the RBI is likely to persist with efforts to support growth for now and may postpone any moves to raise interest rates to mid-2022. While inflation may prove to be an obstacle in the short term, the need to shield the economic recovery would be the dominant factor driving the central bank’s decisions. The Budget for FY23, which is likely to be unveiled in February, would also be a key factor in the RBI’s decision. “While the emergence of Omicron has reignited uncertainty, we are cautiously optimistic that the economic recovery in India will become more durable and broad-based in the coming year. Rising confidence should support a return of consumption to normalcy, boosting capacity utilisation and setting the stage for broadbased capacity expansion by the end of 2022. Moreover, the solid expansion in direct taxes will allow the government to prioritise growth-enhancing capital spending,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings agency ICRA. “With a higher inflation target than other central banks, the monetary policy committee (MPC) can justify prioritising growth for some more time. Nevertheless, the base case of gradually strengthening economic activity suggests that it is only a matter of time before the MPC starts to raise rates,” said Nayar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/omicron-fails-to-dampen-spirits-for-growth-push-in-2022/articleshow/88513247.cms||Surojit Gupta

On Mumbai police move against Nitesh Rane, Narayan Rane said, “Arrest for what, what has Nitesh Rane done? The people in power in the state are afraid of facing us in the coming Sidhudurg District Bank election and hence are doing this out of political vendetta.” The Kandivali police have issued sumons to Nitesh Rane with regard to an attempt to murder case. “Let the state government do whatever it wants to, Nitesh has done nothing wrong and their is no involvement of his in the incident as they are claiming,” Rane said. Rane also said there is no need for Nitesh to go in hiding as he is an MLA. “He is in Sidhudurg district only and we will take legal help to stop people from spreading false news through media about him and his arrest,” the Union minister said. The former CM was speaking to media after arriving at Nagpur Airport on Monday. Rane said he is in the town to attend the Agro-Vision Exhibition and so media should ask questions relating to farmers and their issues.

It was placed second in social development and welfare. While AP achieved 10th rank in overall performance in GGI report released by the Centre on Saturday, the state fared way ahead of many states in AAS. The GGI report was readied by the department of administrative reforms and public grievances. It is a biannual exercise taken up by the Centre. The Centre has constituted a Group of Secretaries (GoS) to make suitable recommendations to take up the GGI study. The Centre considered the performance of different states in 58 parameters in 10 key sectors before giving the ranks. Interestingly, AP has scored well in many sectors including agriculture. Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs) have won laurels from NITI Aayog and also the agriculture ministry. RBKs are being developed as one-stop solution to all the grievances of the farmers' right from sale of seeds, pesticides, fertilisers to the procurement of agriculture produce. Almost 100% growth in agri, allied sectors  The state government has linked entire data of farmers with the RBKs to implement the welfare schemes including the free crop insurance. The growth of food grain production, horticulture produce, milk production, meat production, and egg and poultry production were taken into consideration in AAS. Implementation of crop insurance was also a key indicator. Enrolment of agriculture markets for e-market system was also a parameter. The growth rate in agriculture and allied sectors touched a remarkable double-digit at 11.3 from 6.3 in 2019. This is almost 100 per cent growth rate. While the growth in the horticulture produce is 12.3 per cent from a mere 4.7 per cent, milk production set a new record at 11.7. This was around 1.4 per cent in 2019. It was a bumper-to-bumper record in meat production as it touched 10.3 per cent from minus 6.7 per cent. AP's performance in crop insurance implementation is a model as it scored 26.1 per cent on the table of 30. In the last study, AP's score stood at 20.2 Gujarath is next to AP in crop insurance with 23.1 per cent. Haryana is the leader in the crop insurance indicator as it scored 34 per cent points. Telangana scored just 20.8 in crop insurance segment while its overall growth rate in agriculture and allied sectors is just 2.7 against AP's 11.7 per cent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/andhra-pradesh-tops-in-ggi-ranking-in-agriculture-allied-sectors/articleshow/88513276.cms||Samdani MN
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Non-cooperation by executive a problem, says CJI NV Ramana||VIJAYAWADA: Lack of legal scrutiny before making legislations and non-cooperation by executive have become impending problems of judiciary, observed Chief Justice of India, Justice NV Ramana, even as new age crime involving technology has become a major challenge. He said a popular mandate cannot become a defence for arbitrary laws. Unfortunately, parliament, which introduced standing committees to enhance scrutiny of bills, is not being optimally utilised. He said the new age crimes involving advanced technologies are throwing new challenges to the judiciary. Justice Ramana categorised the challenges ahead of Indian Judiciary into two categories of new challenges and perennial issues which have been concern for many years. Laws cannot lag too far behind changing technologies: CJIHe outlined the need for domain expertise, absence of well considered legislation, non-cooperative executive, dysfunctional criminal justice system, new threats to the judiciary and increasing judicial resilience as the new age challenges. Improving judicial infrastructure, filling of vacancies and ever increasing of caseloads have been the perennial issues which need to be addressed on a war footing basis, said Justice Ramana. Justice Ramana stressed on the need for domain expertise in the field of science and technology in view of increasing number of cases that involve advanced technologies. The cases like sale of illegal material on dark web, identity theft, fraudulent transactions, money laundering, crime funding through virtual currencies, hacking, spread of defamatory content and hate speech are throwing new challenges before the judiciary which require deep technical understanding. The CJI observed that the laws cannot lag too far behind changing technologies. "We are still discussing issues related to internet, while technologies are talking about the Metaverse". To bridge the gap between changing technologies and judiciary, continued training from technical experts and keeping pace with the times in updating legal education is required, he said. He was delivering the fifth endowment lecture of late Lavu Venkateswarlu, father of Supreme Court judge, Justice Lavu Nageswara Rao, on the subject of Indian 'Judiciary - Challenges of Future', here on Sunday. Justice Ramana raised concerns over increased attacks on judiciary both physical and casting aspersions on social media platforms. Concerted campaigns are being run on social media against judges if parties do not get a favourable order. "These attacks appear to be sponsored and synchronised. The specialised law enforcement agencies need deal with such malicious attacks effectively. Unfortunately, they are not taking any action unless a court interfere and pass orders. The governments are expected, and duty bound to create secure environment for judiciary to function fearlessly", he said. Responding on the criticism that judges themselves are appointing judges, Justice Ramana said that it is one of the widely propagated myth. The fact is judiciary is one of the players involved in the process. Many authorities are involved including the union law ministry, state governments, governor, high court collegia, intelligence bureau and the topmost executive who are all designated to examine the suitability of a candidate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/andhra-pradesh-non-cooperation-by-executive-a-problem-says-cji-nv-ramana/articleshow/88513278.cms||Srikanth Aluri

A 45-year-old woman, who had arrived from Canada on December 3 and was home isolated for 14 days, has tested positive for the new Covid-19 variant. Haryana also reported seven new cases of Omicron from Panchkula, Karnal, Yamunanagar and Panipat districts, raising its total tally to 13. One case each was reported in Karnal and Panchkula, two in Panipat and three in Yamunanagar. Last Wednesday, the state had reported three Omicron cases each from Gurgaon and Faridabad. The Mandi woman’s RTPCR sample examined at IGMC, Shimla, on December 12 had found her Covid-19 positive and her sample was later sent to National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi, for whole-genome sequencing (WGS). While she tested negative for Covid after her RTPCR test on Friday, the genome sequencing report for Omicron came positive on Sunday. Officials said the woman is fully vaccinated, having taken her second dose of Astrazeneca Covid-19 vaccine on April 25. She was in home isolation and her contacts were also tested negative for the disease. National Health Mission director, Shimla, Hemraj Bairwa said, “There is no need to panic. The contact tracing was done on priority. Her primary contacts have been tested negative.” Report of six more samples sent for WGS is still awaited, while three more samples are being sent for WGS to Delhi, Bairwa added. PM Modi will be attending a function at Paddal ground of Mandi on the occasion of the completion of four years of the Jai Ram Thakur government in the state. Thakur has claimed that more than 50,000 people will come to listen to Modi on Monday. Meanwhile, Congress has slammed the government for organising this function amid Omicron scare. Congress state chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore said while other states are imposing night curfew to contain spread of Omicron, “Himachal government will be celebrating its four years’ rule by gathering thousands of people”. On Saturday, Thakur had said there was no need to worry as the hill state has not reported any case of Omicron and the government was in no mood to impose any restrictions. Three found infected in Yamunanagar are contacts of a traveller from the Netherlands and in the age group of 30 to 32. The patient from Panchkula is a student and returned to India from the UK via Dubai. In Panipat, one patient had travelled abroad and is her father’s contact. Karnal patient is also foreign-returned. All are stable and in home isolation, said Haryana DGHS Dr Veena Singh. A government spokesperson said all lists of foreign travellers received from the civil aviation ministry are being shared with the districts for enhanced surveillance. All district surveillance officers have been directed to ensure a follow up travellers and their contacts on a daily basis on phone for 14 days and pay physical visits on every third day. They have also been directed to conduct mandatory RT-PCR test of all international travellers on the eighth day of arrival, or earlier if found symptomatic. 2,167 international passengers in a monthA state government spokesperson said 2,167 international passengers arrived in Himachal since November 20, according to the list shared by the Centre. While 1,747 passengers were eligible for RT-PCR test, 420 were not as some could not be traced, others had completed 14-day home isolation, or returned or were staying out of Himachal. “The testing was done on the eighth day after arrival or when the symptoms appeared,” the spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/day-before-pm-narendra-modis-event-himachal-pradesh-reports-its-first-omicron-case/articleshow/88513326.cms||Suresh Sharma

One case each surfaced in Prakasam and Anantapur districts. According to the state officials, a 48-year-old male returned from South Africa to Hyderabad on December 16 and subsequently proceeded to Ongole in Prakasam district. His sample collected on December 19 came back positive for the Covid-19 the next day. Genome sequencing conducted on his positive sample at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, confirmed it as the Omicron variant. In another case, a 51-year-old male arrived in Anantapur from the United Kingdom on December 18. His Covid-19 positive sample was also declared as the Omicron variant by the CCMB. Both patients have been kept in quarantine and are doing well. Andhra Pradesh public health and family welfare director Dr G Hymavathi said that all the primary and secondary contacts of both patients were tested and found negative for Covid-19. "A total of 67 international travellers and 12 contacts have so far tested positive for the pandemic disease. All these samples were sent for genome sequencing," said Dr Hymavathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/omicron-tally-increases-to-6-in-andhra-pradesh-as-two-more-test-positive/articleshow/88513334.cms||---
---||Business||Cairn drops lawsuits against govt in US, UK||NEW DELHI: Cairn Energy has dropped lawsuits against the government and its entities in the US and the UK. It is in final stages of withdrawing cases in France and the Netherlands, which were filed to get back about Rs 7,900 crore that were collected from it to enforce a retrospective tax demand. As part of the settlement reached with the government to the seven-year old dispute over levy of back taxes, the UK company has initiated proceedings to withdraw lawsuits it had filed in several jurisdictions to enforce an international arbitration award, which had overturned levy of Rs 10,247 crore retrospective taxes and ordered India to refund the money already collected. Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said Cairn on November 26 withdrew the lawsuit it had brought in Mauritius for recognition of the arbitration award and took similar measures in courts in Singapore, the UK and Canada. On December 15, it sought and got ‘voluntary dismissal’ of a lawsuit it had brought in a New York court to seize assets of Air India to recover the money due from the government. On the same day, it made a similar move in a Washington court where it was seeking recognition of the arbitration award. Recognition of arbitration award is the first step before any enforcement proceedings like seizure of assets can be brought. Sources said the critical lawsuit in a French court, which had attached Indian properties on the petition of Cairn, is in the final stages of withdrawal. Paper work is expected to get completed in the next couple of days. The attachment of Indian assets, including some flats in Paris, in July used by the Indian government staff had triggered scrapping of a 2012 amendment to the Income Tax Act that gave taxmen powers to go back 50 years and slap capital gains levies wherever ownership had changed hands overseas but business assets were in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cairn-drops-lawsuits-against-govt-in-us-uk/articleshow/88513370.cms||---
---||Business||Lamborghini India sees highest-ever sales in 2021||NEW DELHI: Italian super sports carmaker Lamborghini had a record year in India in 2021, exceeding the peak sales it hit in 2019, when it had sold more than one car per week. The surge happened even as the economy was limping out of the Covid-induced slowdown, and automakers across the world fought a production shortage due to semiconductor crunch. Part of German auto group Volkswagen, Lamborghini sells cars such as the Huracan and Aventador in India, apart from the Urus SUV that it had introduced in 2018. In 2019, the company had recorded its biggest volumes in India at 52 units, considered healthy as its cars are priced upwards of Rs 4 crore (on-road). Sharad Agarwal, head of Lamborghini in India, said that the bounce-back for the brand had been faster in 2021 than what it had anticipated, especially as India had just started to come out of a deadly second wave of the coronavirus and there was uncertainty about performance of business and the economy. “However, the demand has been surprising, and we now have a waiting period between seven months and one year on some of our models. While 2020, the year when the corona outbreak hit the world, was a challenging one for us just like the rest of the industry, things changed positively since October last year. Demand has been strong since,” Agarwal told TOI. The boom in the world of startups, which is throwing up millionaires at a lightning speed, is one of the pillars that the company is benefiting from. “A lot of our buyers today are first-timers into the brand, and not from the traditional multi-generational business families. They want to reward themselves for hitting success early on.” Despite this being a niche market, Lamborghini has also been driving in new models and variants in India almost in line with their global launch (such as Huracan STO). The company has made a conscious effort to go deeper inside the country, and expose the wealthy in the hinterland to its products and their performance. “They have an aspiration to buy our cars, but are not sure of where to drive. We create special events where they can come and drive.” Lamborghini recently completed sale of 300 units in India since it began business in the country, and the last 100 came in the previous two years, against the 7 years it took to crack the three-figure mark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lamborghini-india-sees-highest-ever-sales-in-2021/articleshow/88513423.cms||Pankaj Doval

The inoculation drive for this age group begins in just about a week from January 3. This apart, around five lakh frontline workers, over seven lakh healthcare workers and about 1.1 crore senior citizens in the state will be eligible to receive the ‘precaution dose’ from January 10. While the detailed guidelines on vaccination of children as well as the third dose for adults are yet to be issued by the Union health ministry, the state health officials have done the basic number-crunching. “Our data on children eligible for the vaccine and adults for the third dose is ready,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar, who is in charge of the overall vaccination programme in Bengal. “Vaccine supply should no more be an issue and we have sufficient infrastructure. Our preliminary preparation is also on. We only need the detailed guidelines from the Centre to finalise the rollout,” he said. Even though two vaccines — ZyCov-D and Covaxin — have received emergency use nod for children above 12 years in India, the drive for kids will begin only with Covaxin. The state currently has 50 lakh doses of Covaxin in its kitty. ‘Expect younger kids to be included in phases’Earlier, the Centre had set aside one lakh doses of ZyCoV-D for Bengal for a pilot launch on adults. But since the launch has been put on hold, these doses have not been handed over to the state but are kept at the central vaccine warehouse in Hastings. “Getting children into the vaccination drive is a welcome move. But I would have expected the drive to begin with children above 12 years of age. But then there would be logistics issues. Hopefully, be included in phases,” said senior paediatrican Apurba Ghsoh, director, Institute of Child Health Kolkata. For booster doses, there is still is no clear guideline on the time gap between the second dose and the third dose. Of the total 1.1 crore senior citizens in the state, over 80 lakh have already taken both shots of the vaccine and a majority of them would have some comorbidity and will require the booster dose, the health officials pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/50-lakh-children-in-west-bengal-eligible-for-vaccination-1-2-crore-adults-for-third-jab/articleshow/88513440.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Mumbai||Over 55% of Maharashtra's Covid-19 spurt on Sunday reported from Mumbai||MUMBAI: Driven by a sharp spike of cases in Mumbai, Maharashtra saw a 64-day high in new Covid infections on Sunday. The spurt has given rise to concerns if the anticipated third wave has arrived. Experts say it is premature to say that, but cautioned that a steady rise in cluster infections could usher it. Over 55% of the new cases were reported from Mumbai. The city registered 896 cases as per state records, the highest in 205 days, while BMC said 922 cases were detected on Sunday (the discrepancy could be due to a lag in reporting). The rise in Maharashtra (1,648) is limited to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region largely that contributed to 72% of Sunday's cases. Commenting on third wave fears, epidemiologist Dr Chandrakant Lahariya said the epidemic curve was flat at the national level. "For states and cities, it is too early to say," he said. (See graphic for reasons being attributed to the case spurt.) Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the Covid-19 taskforce, said that although Mumbai has been witnessing an exponential rise in cases, it can't be said that the third wave has arrived. "We have to watch the situation for the next two weeks. A continued rise in cases has the potential to trigger the third wave," he said. Mumbai's positivity rate, which hovered around 0.4% in the beginning of the month, has jumped almost five-fold to touch 2.6%. Dr Joshi said the sequencing of samples from non-travellers will provide a clearer picture about the strain circulating at present. "Fortunately, Covid deaths are not too high," he added. On Sunday, Maharashtra added 17 deaths, a tad higher from 12 recorded on Saturday. The state's cumulative deaths have now reached 1,41,433. After a day of reporting zero deaths, Mumbai registered two fatalities. The city's Covid toll has now reached 16,370. Active cases in Maharashtra inched closer to 10,000 (9,813), while that for Mumbai reached 4,295. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said a combination of reasons could have led to the rise. There have been several cases where foreign returnees tested negative at the airport and subsequently positive at home when tested after a few days. "Some of them could be actively spreading infection before we are able to detect them. Our data shows that over 80% cases are coming from building residents and not slums," he said. While hospitalisations have increased marginally, there has been no significant rise in critical cases. Joy Chakraborty, COO of PD Hinduja Hospital, said that from 4-5 daily admissions seen a few weeks ago, the numbers have increased to 11-12 now. "But ICU admissions have not seen any major shift," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/over-55-of-maharashtras-covid-19-spurt-on-sunday-reported-from-mumbai/articleshow/88513467.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||World||New York sees increase in hospitalized children as Omicron hammers US||WASHINGTON: With Omicron cases on the rise, New York health officials have reported an increase in hospitalized children, as the White House promised Sunday to quickly resolve the United States' Covid-19 test shortage. The New York State Department of Health warned "of an upward trend in pediatric hospitalizations associated with Covid-19," in a statement Friday. In New York City, it "identified four-fold increases in Covid-19 hospital admissions for children 18 and under beginning the week of December 5 through the current week," it said. Approximately half of the admissions are younger than five, an age group that is vaccine ineligible, the department added. The number of Covid-19 cases in the United States is on the rise, with an average of nearly 190,000 new infections daily over the past seven days, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. The arrival of the new Omicron variant, compounded by holiday celebrations that typically include travel and family reunions, have caused a rush on tests in the United States, where it is difficult to get one in many locations. Top US pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci on Sunday acknowledged a Covid "testing problem" and vowed to make more tests available to Americans next month. "One of the problems is that that's not going to be totally available to everyone until we get to January and there are still some issues now of people having trouble getting tested," Fauci told ABC News. "But we're addressing the testing problem," he added, saying it should be corrected "very soon." On Tuesday, President Joe Biden announced a raft of new measures as the United States battles its latest Covid surge, including shipping half a billion free home tests in the wake of the Christmastime testing crunch. However, the White House, whose strategy has for weeks been mainly focused on vaccinations, has faced strong criticism over the fact that many tests won't be available until January. Fauci on Sunday emphasized that the administration was ramping up to tackle the spike and stressed that Omicron was "extraordinarily contagious." Apart from overwhelming hospitals and Covid testing sites, the Covid variant has forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights in the United States, as crews called in sick or had to quarantine after exposure to the virus. Recent studies in South Africa and Britain indicate that Omicron was less likely to lead to hospitalization than the previous strains of the virus and that the duration of hospital stays and oxygen needs for patients were lower, Fauci noted. But he also warned that Omicron's apparent lower severity is likely to be neutralized by how fast it is spreading. "The issue that we don't want to get complacent about... is that when you have such a high volume of new infections, it might override a real diminution in severity," Fauci said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-york-sees-increase-in-hospitalized-children-as-omicron-hammers-us/articleshow/88513481.cms||---

Recounting the sleepless night, residents told TOI that they recited ‘Hanuman Chalisa’, played loud music and stayed awake all night out of fear. Anju Yadav (40) of Seemantnagar, Kalyanpur, said she started chanting ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ after she came to know that a leopard was roaming in the colony. “My five-year-old child was playing outside the house. All of a sudden my husband took our son inside. He told me that there was a leopard in the colony,” she said. Asha Devi, 50, of the same colony, said: “I was scared when I got to know about the feline in the locality. I locked myself up in the house and also asked others to stay indoors.” In Adilanagar, locals claimed that the response of police and forest department teams was delayed and added that they were not fully equipped to deal with the beast. Syed Anas, whose CCTV camera captured the leopard’s footage which later went viral, said: “I am not able to sleep or go out for work as I have two children in the house. We cannot rest till the leopard is captured. I will probably go to stay at my relative’s place till the leopard is captured.” “We were returning home on Kanchana Bihari Marg from a wedding ceremony around 9pm. No taxi or e-rickshaw driver agreed to ferry us to Kalyanpur due to the scare. After several requests, a taxi driver agreed to drop us in return of high payment but he too left us 200 metres away from our house. We had to walk down to our house. We heaved a sigh of relief after we locked ourselves in the house,” said Anita Singh. On Picnic Spot road, residents did not sleep and played loud music to keep the leopard away. Residents of Paharpur, Phulbagh, Sector-H of Jankipuram remained indoors and did not even talk to journalists. “We have locked our rooms and collected all food stuff in a room on the second floor. We won’t go downstairs or open the gate till the leopard is caught,” said Rashi Jauhari of Jankipuram. In Paharpur, two neighbours even roped in a watchman wielding a gun to keep away the feline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-residents-lock-themselves-up-play-music-to-ward-off-big-cat/articleshow/88513546.cms||---

Both are relatives of the city’s first case —20-year-old resident of Italy who had tested positive on December 11 when he was visiting relatives here. He had landed in the country on November 22. One of the new patients is an 80-year-old man suffering from hypertension. He is asymptomatic. He is isolated in a hospital. On the last re-test on December 24, he tested positive. He will be re-tested on January 1. The second case is a 45-year-old man. He reported RT-PCR negative on December 24 and has been discharged. The Italy returnee had been asymptomatic throughout and was fully vaccinated with Pfizer vaccine taken in Italy. He has already been discharged. Samples of five of his contacts were sent to National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi. Genome sequencing reports of the remaining three are pending. They all had tested negative on December 24 and discharged. “All the Omicron cases had been fully vaccinated. That might be the reason they are asymptomatic,” said the official. At the same time, the Covid positivity rate which was less than 1% for four months, has increased to 1%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/omicron-count-touches-3-in-chandigarh-kalka-woman-is-first-case-in-panchkula/articleshow/88513526.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Time and place are yet to be finalised,” Dhindsa told TOI. The Union minister and BJP’s election in-charge in Punjab Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, and former chief minister and Punjab Lok Congress head Capt Amarinder Singh would also be present in the meeting, confirmed Dhindsa. Amarinder had announced an alliance of his party with the BJP on December 17. The SAD (Sanyukt) core committee had held its meeting in Chandigarh on Saturday and had authorised Dhindsa to take the final decision. The Rajya Sabha member said that he would try his best to convince the BJP leadership to accept some of their demands about the welfare of Sikhs and Punjab. “We believe that the BJP can work for the welfare of Punjab and provide a secure and stable government in the state,” he added. The SAD (Sanyukt) president said after the alliance, all three parties will field their candidates based on the criteria of winnability. Dhindsa's son Parminder Singh is the MLA from Lehra assembly segment in Sangrur district and a former cabinet minister. The SAD (Sanyukt) had received a major blow as its stalwart leader and former Khadoor Sahib MP Ranjit Singh Brahmpura had rejoined the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) along with other leaders of the party on December 23, after three years. But, Dhindsa had rejected SAD patron and five-time chief minister Parkash Singh Badal’s appeal to rejoin the party, stating that he had quit the SAD on the issue of principles and since nothing had changed in the last three years in the SAD, he will never join the SAD again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-sanyukt-chief-dhindsa-says-alliance-with-bjp-likely-to-be-announced-today/articleshow/88511568.cms||Sanjeev Verma

---||World||No long-distance road trips for Afghan women without male escort: Taliban||KABUL: Afghanistan's Taliban authorities said Sunday that women seeking to travel long distances should not be offered road transport unless they are accompanied by a close male relative. The guidance issued by the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, which also called on vehicle owners to refuse rides to women not wearing headscarves, has drawn condemnation from rights activists. The move follows the Taliban barring many women in public-sector roles from returning to work in the wake of their August 15 seizure of power, and as girls remain largely cut off from secondary schooling. It also comes despite the hardline Islamists seeking to project a moderate image internationally in a bid to restore aid suspended when the previous government imploded during the final stages of a US military withdrawal. "Women travelling for more than 45 miles (72 kilometres) should not be offered a ride if they are not accompanied by a close family member," ministry spokesman Sadeq Akif Muhajir told AFP on Sunday, specifying that the escort must be a close male relative. The new guidance, circulated on social media networks, also asked people to stop playing music in their vehicles. Weeks ago, the ministry asked Afghanistan's television channels to stop showing dramas and soap operas featuring women actors. It also called on women TV journalists to wear headscarves while presenting. Muhajir said Sunday that the hijab, an Islamic headscarf, would likewise be required for women seeking transport. The Taliban's definition of the hijab- which can range from a hair covering to a face veil or full-body covering -- is unclear, and most Afghan women already wear headscarves. Human Rights Watch blasted the guidance. "This new order essentially moves... further in the direction of making women prisoners," Heather Barr, the group's associate director of women's rights, told AFP. It "shuts off opportunities for them to be able to move about freely, to travel to another city, to do business, (or) to be able to flee if they are facing violence in the home", Barr added. Early this month, the Taliban issued a decree in the name of their supreme leader instructing the government to enforce women's rights. But it did not mention girls' access to education. On Sunday, Afghanistan's Minister for Higher Education Abdul Baqi Haqqani said the authorities were discussing the issue. "The Islamic Emirate is not against women's education but it is against co-education," Haqqani told reporters. "We are working on building an Islamic environment where women could study... it might take some time," he said, without specifying when girls might return to school and university classes across the country. Women's rights were severely curtailed during the Taliban's previous stint in power in the 1990s. They were forced to wear the face-covering burqa, only allowed to leave home with a male chaperone and banned from work and education. Respect for women's rights has repeatedly been cited by key global donors as a condition for restoring aid. The UN has warned that Afghanistan faces an "avalanche of hunger" this winter, estimating that 22 million citizens face "acute" food shortages.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab bizmen tired of graft, now investing outside state: Delhi min Jain||Patiala: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday met traders and businessmen in and around Patiala, listened to their problems and sought suggestions for a permanent solution to their issues. Addressing the gathering, Jain said, “Businessmen of Punjab are deeply troubled by corrupt politicians and officers. Those in power ask traders for a share in the business. Tired of corruption, today the businessmen of Punjab are leaving Punjab and investing outside.” Accusing the ruling Congress government of corruption and bribery, Jain said, “The traders of Punjab have to do a lot of unnecessary paperwork and pay bribe in government offices before starting their business. Due to the corrupt system, the government office has become a center for extorting money from the people. On the contrary, these corrupt leaders of the corrupt system call the businessmen as thieves, whereas, a thief is a bribe giver not a taker.” He said that to get rid of corruption, Congress, Captain, Badal and BJP will have to be ousted from power. Jain promised that the Aam Aadmi Party government would free the people of Punjab from government offices and unnecessary paperwork. Under the ‘Door Step Delivery Programme’, all the necessary paperwork will be done by the government employees at the homes of the people at a nominal service charge. He said that the policy of Aam Aadmi Party is to provide good facilities to the people free of cost. “If people get free education, medicine and electricity, then people’s money will be saved. With the remaining money, people will buy goods from the market. This will increase demand, increase production and increase employment,” he said.  He promised the people that after March 2022, the responsibility of education and medical treatment of all the people of Punjab will be taken by the AAP government of Punjab so that people can spend their money on other essential facilities and needs.  Jain said that due to lack of employment and opportunities for higher education, youth of Punjab are drowning in drugs or going abroad after spending lakhs of rupees. “Hundreds of youths are committing suicide without hope. Aam Aadmi Party promises the people of Punjab that if its government is formed, not a single person of Punjab will be forced to go abroad. To fulfill their dreams, all the facilities and resources will be made available to the youth in Punjab itself,” said Jain. He also promised Punjab will become the first corruption-free state of the country if AAP government is formed. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-bizmen-tired-of-graft-now-investing-outside-state-delhi-min-jain/articleshow/88511614.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Smoke-spewing factories, brick kilns choke Jhajjar||Jhajjar: Home to 415 brick kilns, 650 industries, 16 hot mix plants and five stone crushes, Jhajjar is one of Haryana’s 14 districts in the National Capital Region which has recorded a steep slide in air quality, a direct corollary of air fouled by dirty diesel exhaust fumes, construction dust, rising industrial emissions, road dust and crop burning. The average air quality index (AQI) in the district has been recorded in the ‘very poor’ category since November. While the average December AQI (until 25th of the month) was recorded at 320, the overall November AQI was around 347, several notches up from an AQI of 293 recorded in the corresponding period last year. Elderly people, used to the clear, sunny winters, said the morning sky glowed like an ominous shade of orange. “We can barely see down the street these days during the morning walks. Stepping out for a walk or work early in the morning or late at night cause breathing issues. The pandemic has made the situation scarier,” Suresh Singh, a resident of Sector 16, said. With infrastructure projects underway in areas like Beri Road, Badli Road and Sector 9 bypass, residents said there was no respite from suspended dust particles. “The problem is that these suspended particles linger even after the air has cleared. Scant rainfall year after year ensures that it does not settle down. These tiny specks, we fear, can increase the risk of acute respiratory infections, especially in children and older adults,” Karamvir Dahiya, a resident of Beri Road, said. ‘All is not local’ Experts claim the source of air pollution in Jhajjar is not entirely local. “Jhajjar is not a very urbanised district and does not have many active and modern sources of emissions but is surrounded by industries and brick kilns that are major pollution sources. It is also a major rice cultivation region in the state and sees some instances of stubble burning,” Shubhansh Tiwari, a research associate at Amity Centre for Air Pollution Control, told TOI. Executive director of research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) Anumita Roychowdhury, meanwhile, pressed for a holistic mitigation plan. “Pollution sources do not change through the year. What changes in winter is that cold air settles close to the ground and trap pollutants. When Delhi and its surrounding cities choke, it’s not necessarily when stubble burning is at its peak, but when weather conditions are conducive. It is the same here,” she said. Action still not taken The district at present is dependent on its lone ambient air quality station at Bahadurgarh mini secretariat. This, experts said, was insufficient to screen the air quality of a district spread across 1,834 square kilometres.  The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), however, has no plan to increase the number of air monitoring stations. “We have installed an online station to monitor the ambient air quality of Bahadurgarh town and have two manual ambient air quality stations. We also have prepared an action plan to mitigate pollution in the district,” Dinesh Kumar, the regional officer of HSPCB, said.  Civic agencies, including the municipal council, traffic police, HSIIDC and the pollution board, have begun a crackdown on illegally parked vehicles on the congested roads, he said. The civic agencies will start sprinkling water on dust patches, mechanical sweeping of roads, and initiating work to fill potholes. The pollution board has been tasked to ensure that all building materials are covered and anti-smog guns installed at all construction sites, Kumar said, adding work is on towards phasing out petrol and diesel vehicles that are over 15 and 10 years old, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/smoke-spewing-factories-brick-kilns-choke-jhajjar/articleshow/88511647.cms||Ipsita Pati

As the centre announced vaccination for children (15 to 18 years) from January 3, 2022, on Saturday, the health department has stepped up its preparation. However, they have not received any guidelines from the Centre yet. Parents have been eagerly waiting to get their children inoculated as, since November, children had started contracting the virus. Moreover, Covid cases have been on the rise. After school children had started getting infected, parents had demanded the continuation of online classes following which the state government had to issue a separate guideline on it. A private school’s hostel had witnessed more than 10 covid cases. The health department’s figures showed that 35 children, who were under 18 years, were found infected with corona in November. However, the health authorities had claimed that the majority of them had no link with schools as they had Covid history in their families. "We have estimated that more than 51 lakh children will be eligible for vaccination, who belong to the 15 to 18 years age group," said Dr Raghuraj Singh, project director (vaccination), health department. The step will help in the normalisation of education in schools and it is expected that it will reduce the hesitation of parents in sending their children to school. Dr Singh said in December, more than 1 crore people received vaccination shots in the state. "The vaccination has scaled up in the state as we are conducting ‘har ghar dastak’ campaign by going door-to-door. Also, as the festival season ended in November, more people are coming for vaccination," he said.

The portal, with video fencing with remote connectivity and a live dashboard for easy monitoring, will be operational within a week, said HSPCB secretary S Narayana.  The move comes after the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR and adjoining areas on December 20 directed the state to commission a portal by January 22 over the spike in air pollution during winter owing to a combination of adverse meteorological factors and local emission due to C&D waste, dust, waste burning, vehicular emissions and stubble burning.  “The technological shift will help project proponents to self-audit and certify compliance of stipulated dust control measures and strengthen monitoring of dust control measures at C&D sites. The project proponents are also expected to upload the self-declaration on a fortnightly basis,” Narayana said.  According to the officials, the PCB will make it mandatory for all C&D projects on more than 500 square metres to register with the web portal, install reliable and economical PM2.5 and PM10 sensors at project sites and link them to a platform with live dashboard accessibility for CPCB, government agencies and administrative departments concerned. The C&D sites will also have to ensure the implementation of dust control measures, including covering construction material and debris, using water sprinklers and anti-smog guns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/jan-launch-for-portal-to-analyse-hourly-air-pollution-data-from-cd-sites/articleshow/88511666.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While police have identified the accused as Sonu (35) and his accomplice Asim Ali alias Haseen Saifi, both residents of Ghaziabad, no arrests have been made so far. In a police complaint, Ghaziabad-resident Vakil Mailk, who holds a diploma in mechanical engineering, told police that he had come in touch with Sonu in November 2020 and the latter had promised him a job in Dubai. Sonu had claimed to have worked in Gulf countries for five years and took Rs 1.10 lakh from Malik on the pretext of a job offer, flight ticket and visa. “On August 6, 2020, Sonu gave a (job) offer letter to Malik with a monthly salary of Rs 50,000. In return, he demanded Rs1.10 lakh. Of the total, Malik gave the accused Rs 85,000 soon after getting the offer letter, while the remaining sum was paid after the accused gave him an air ticket to Dubai. The flight was scheduled on December 12, 2020,” a police officer said. At the Delhi airport, Malik was, however, denied entry and told that the ticket was fake, police said. When Malik contacted Sonu, the latter allegedly gave him another air ticket to Dubai for January 2021, this time from Mumbai airport. “Once again, when the victim reached Mumbai to catch the flight, he learnt that the ticket was a fake,” police said, adding that a complaint was submitted when Sonu allegedly refused to return the money. According to police, the two accused have duped five more people using a similar modus operandi. Another victim, Aarif, in his complaint has claimed that in December 2020 he had given Rs 1.5 lakh to Sonu in return for a job in Dubai. “Soon after taking the money, Sonu changed his number. He also threatened me with dire consequences when I asked him to return the money,” the complainant said. SP-City-1 Nipurn Aggarwal said that on the basis of these complaints, police have lodged two FIRs against Sonu and his associate in Madhuban Bapudham police station under IPC Sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 120B (criminal conspiracy), 504 (intentional insult) and 506 (criminal intimidation). “Investigation is underway and soon arrests will be made,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/6-cheated-of-rs-10l-with-promise-of-jobs-in-dubai/articleshow/88511687.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

The person questioned is an alleged drug peddler and related to Rano village former sarpanch Gurdeep Singh, who was arrested in November last year by Ludhiana unit of anti-drug STF for being part of international organised drug racket being run from Australia. Gurdeep was among the four arrested in the case leading to seizure of 5.39 kg heroin, three illegal weapons with live cartridges, Rs 21 lakh cash and eight high-end cars. Another officer of Khanna police said they had started questioning the wife of Gagandeep Singh after finding lacunae in her statement. Jaspreet had earlier told police that Gagandeep had left the house alone on his two-wheeler. However in CCTV footage recovered by police, a woman was captured riding pillion with Gagandeep. The white-coloured two-wheeler has been recovered from the parking outside Khanna Bus Stand. On condition of anonymity, a police officer said, “Initially, we did not suspect she could a role as claimed to have strained relations with her husband. He used to spend days away from home. She had told us that Gagandeep left the house alone on his scooter on Thursday and never returning. However, now the police have got some CCTV footage in which the couple were seen riding on the same scooter on the same day. Moreover, Gagandeep had given his wife about Rs 1 lakh just two days before the blast.” “As per her initial statement, we were trying to trace the scooter in Ludhiana. We thought he must have parked it near the court complex or near the bus stand, however it was found in Khanna. Gagandeep could have taken a bus from there, travelling in public transport with explosives is not practical. We suspect that Gagandeep came with someone, who dropped him at the court complex,” the senior cop added. On without registration car recovered from the court complex, the same officer said police were trying to get details of the vehicle. “As of now, it does not seem that Gagandeep used that car, however the probe is still on,” the officer said. Dismissed from Punjab Police for drug peddling, Gagandeep Singh, 31 of Khanna, is the prime suspect in the Ludhiana court complex bomb blast. So far, police have already brought out two jail inmates Ranjeet Singh Cheeta and Sukhwinder Singh alias Boxer on production warrant for questioning. A female cop, said to be Ganagdeep’s friend since his days as a policeman, is likely to be called again for questioning. Both Ranjeet and Sukhwinder are alleged to have links with Pakistan’s ISI. Body crematedGagandeep’s body was cremated in presence of his family members amid heavy police presence at a cremation ground in Khanna town on Sunday afternoon. Gagandeep’s wife Jaspreet, his father Amarjit Singh, elder brother Preetam Singh Rinku attended the funeral. Amarjit, who was among the first to reach the cremation site, didn’t respond to questions from mediapersons. Rinku said that they didn’t know anything and he didn’t tell them where he was going. He added that the whole family was very upset. The brother of deceased said after coming out of jail on bail, Gagandeep started cloth trade but mostly operated from home. He refused to respond to further questions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ludh-court-blast-gagandeeps-wife-another-jail-mate-questioned-by-cops/articleshow/88511683.cms||Shariq Majeed

During media interaction, the CM said that in this land of martyrs, a memorial of that great martyr Baba Sangat Singh Ji too would be established at Fatehgarh Sahib. He said that Baba Sangat Singh Ji was martyred at Sri Chamkaur Sahib by the Mughals, who mistook him to be Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji and his body was brought here from Sri Chamkaur Sahib. Channi further said that in Sri Chamkaur Sahib, which he represents in the Vidhan Sabha, the eldest sons of Guru Sahib Ji were martyred and at Sri Fatehgarh Sahib, the youngest sons of Dasmesh Pita Ji were martyred, hence both these places have a connection. He disclosed that the Punjab Government has decided to link both the places as a mark of respect to the hallowed martyrs. The Hoshiarpur main road till Sri Chamkaur Sahib beyond the Grand Trunk Road, Sirhind, would be inter connected and the circuit has been named as Mata Gujri Ji Marg. Besides, the chief minister added that a letter has been written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to accord it the status of National Highway. The Punjab chief minister also said that the martyrdom of Dasmesh Pita Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji’s younger sons and Mata Gujri Ji is unparalleled in the history of mankind.

Udham Singh was born in Sunam town of Punjab on December 26, 1899. During the event, activists and writers demanded that the Centre should make efforts to bring back his belongings, including a pistol, from London and Pakistan. The befitting memorial should be completed at his native town, they said. Earlier, questions were raised over Udham Singh’s statue in Sunam not resembling him. Activists of farmer organisation BKU (Ekta Ugraham) paid floral tributes to freedom fighter at its ongoing protests across districts and remembered his supreme sacrifice. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) state secretary Shingara Singh Mann said freedom fighters were the real heroes of the nation, but governments had been shying from recognising their acts and in following their footsteps. Box No ad by Punjab, criticised Writers Chaman Lal and Rakesh Kumar raised questions over Punjab government not issuing an advertisement to mark the birth anniversary of Udham Singh. Haryana government has issued the ad.

Earlier this month, Moscow submitted draft security documents demanding that Nato deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back its military deployments in central and eastern Europe. Putin has urged the West to move quickly to meet the demands, warning that Moscow will have to take “adequate military-technical measures” if the West continues its “aggressive” course “on the threshold of our home”. Asked to specify what Moscow’s response could be, he said “it could be diverse”, adding without elaboration that “it’ll depend on proposals military experts submit to me.” The US and its allies have refused to offer Russia the kind of guarantee on Ukraine that Putin wants, citing Nato’s principle that membership is open to any qualifying country. Putin said that Russia submitted the demands in the hope of a constructive answer from the West. “We didn’t do it just to see it blocked... but for the purpose of reaching a negotiated diplomatic result that would be fixed in legally binding documents,” Putin said. He reaffirmed that Nato membership for Ukraine or the deployment of weapons there is a red line for Moscow. “We have nowhere to retreat,” he said, adding that Nato could deploy missiles in Ukraine that would take just four or five minutes to reach Moscow. “They have pushed us to a line that we can’t cross.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/putin-says-he-would-mull-options-if-west-refuses-guarantees-on-ukraine/articleshow/88513736.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Clear legal hurdles: Asst profs to govt||Bathinda: Newly selected assistant professors have urged the Punjab government to speed up the legal process to vacate the Punjab and Haryana high court’s stay on the selection procedure. The selected assistant professors assembled in Bathinda on Sunday and asked the government to take up the issue on priority or they will start a protest. The next hearing in the case has been fixed for January 6. Punjab government, in November 2021, had advertised 1,158 posts of assistant professors for government colleges of Punjab. Out of these, 850 were selected and appointment letters were provided to nearly 650 candidates, but the stations could not be allotted and a score of writ petitions were filed in the high court. The main pleas in these petitions were five extra marks given to guest faculty working in government colleges and the reservation roster made as horizontal instead of vertical. As per horizontal reservation roster, if a reserved category candidate is selected on general seat, then equal number of vacancies are emitted from concerned reserved category. In vertical roster, even if a reserved category candidate is selected on a general seat,the number of seats in the reserved category remains intact. A member of the core committee of a newly floated organisation of the assistant professors, Karamjit Singh, told TOI that the selections were made as per exams held from November 20 to 22, writ petitions had been filed. “The state government has rectified the anomalies of extra marks and reservation roster, yet some issues remain. We want the government to rectify other issues before January 6; if the code of conduct is imposed, our appointments may get stalled,” he said. There is a sanctioned strength of 2,053 teachers in 66 government colleges, 16 of which have started this year. Out of these, 906 had been working as assistant professors in these colleges on monthly wages of nearly Rs 24,000 per month. Apart from them, there are 224 working as part-time assistant professors who are getting Rs. 21,600 as basic pay and dearness allowance (DA) totalling nearly Rs 53,500 per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/clear-legal-hurdles-asst-profs-to-govt/articleshow/88511699.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Pubs, hotels say late Covid curbs will take fizz out of New Year business||BENGALURU: Businessmen and trade representatives in Bengaluru feel the new Covid-19 curbs will greatly impact their earnings in a crucial week. In fact, some sectors have openly criticised the government for selective enforcement and that too without consultation. PC Rao, president, Bruhat Bangalore Hotels Association, said hoteliers and restaurateurs weren’t consulted during formulation of these guidelines and the new directives will be detrimental to them and the city’s economy, especially after two dull business years. “We’d made arrangements for parties. Hotels and clubs have sold tickets and planned events which must now be cancelled. Kar nataka used to ear n Rs 6,000 crore from its hospitality sector in just a month. From bars and pubs alone, the government makes Rs 24,000 crore in excise duty. Just during New Year, transactions from this sector are worth Rs 500 crore. Imagine the kind of loss we will incur,” Rao told TOI. The late call to curb year-end activities is the biggest dampener, said representatives from the sector. “From ordering cakes, to arranging tables, DJs, and food, we were prepared for business. This is going to hurt us bad,” said a hotelier. Pub owners, for whom business picks up only after 8pm, said the curfew (December 28 to January 7)will have a significant impact. “How are malls and movie halls being allowed to operate at full capacity? Aren’t people more vulnerable to infection in a tightly ventilated theatre than in a cafe or pub, where they might only sit for one hour,” a pub owner wondered. With night curfew from 10pm, they must start winding up by 9pm. “We are OK with operating at 50% capacity, but we don’t understand how night curfews are scientific,” the founder of a popular pub said. Amit Roy, partner of Watsons, said days leading up to the New Year are most profitable in the whole year. “Business on New Year’s eve makes up for 50% of our December revenue. How am I to pay rent and salaries if there is no earning?” he said. Shopkeepers and other business owners said they’ve cooperated with the government on lockdowns and restrictions, but decried what they termed “inequalities in implementation of Covid-19 protocols”. Many pointed out that while politicians and religious leaders have been given the leeway to conduct large rallies without Covid-appropriate behaviour, small and medium business owners have been made to bear the burden of regulations. Mayank Rohatgi, secretary, Bangalore Commercial Association, said: “We have around 200 shops in Commercial Street and our average turnover is Rs 50 crore a day; we pay Rs 100 crore as GST every month. The average rent for a store here is Rs 3 lakh per month and lockdowns or not, we have to pay. The government charges approximately Rs 18 crore in GST only on our rent bills every month. So, every loss to us is a loss to the government, because we cannot pay taxes in full or on time.” Brigade Shops & Establishments Association, which had already decided not to deck up the highstreet for New Year, is concerned about business now. “We collectively decided against decorating Brigade Road to maintain public health and safety. However, business in the areas has declined by 80% in the past two years,” said Suhail Yusuf, secretary, of the association. Rudramurthy, general secretary, Autorickshaw Drivers Union, said: “Prices of LPG cylinders have doubled over these two years. How are we supposed to make a living? Prices of essential commodities, fuel and public utilities should be regulated and even lowered.” Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce president Jayaraj said movie hall owners will adjust to the night curfew and schedule shows accordingly, but they too are anticipating a drop in earnings. Dr IS Prasad, president, FKCCI, urged the government to relax norms for the hospitality industry and strictly implement masking and vaccination protocols for the crowd instead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-pubs-hotels-say-late-covid-curbs-will-take-fizz-out-of-new-year-business/articleshow/88513769.cms||Sanika Athavale
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: 2 days after civic body dumps BVG, trash chokes Walled City||JAIPUR: Two days after dismissing BVG India Limited from door-to-door garbage collection, sanitation condition in Walled City has been severely hit. Tonnes of garbage is lying on roads with just 100 hoopers available with the corporation to collect trash from homes. BVG had 200 hoopers for the entire Walled City. JMC-Heritage has 100 hoopers of its own. The corporation has decided to function in two shifts. Residents complained that hoopers were coming twice or thrice a week but now with just 100 hoopers, piles of garbage can be seen at every corner. Kamal Kumar, a resident of Gangori Market, said hoopers are not coming since last five days. “With no company employed for sanitation, garbage depots are overflowing.” Many councillors are questioning the decision to remove the firm without any alternative. Rajat Bishnoi, councillor of ward 9, said there is a need to have an alternative before terminating the contract. “When there was no alternative, why was the firm removed? Already two hoopers in the ward weren’t enough and even if the corporation sends hoopers two times a day, they will not be able to cover the entire ward. This is such an unplanned and hasty decision,” said Bishnoi. The commissioner of JMC-Heritage Avadhesh Meena said they are trying to manage the sanitation properly. “Apart from the employees of the municipal corporation, all efforts are being made to ensure cleanliness by making full use of the available resources. About 4,700 sweepers are working in both the shifts. In two days, over 700 tonnes of garbage was lifted from the city. About 16 units are working continuously for garbage collection in all the zones. Hoopers are continuously running for door-to-door collection of garbage," said Meena. Councillor Sunita Mahawar supported the move saying that with the company exiting the scenario we can work fast to improve the sanitation condition. We should wait for some time to let the corporation work properly. Cleaning is being done from 6am to noon and from 2pm to 10pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-2-days-after-civic-body-dumps-bvg-trash-chokes-walled-city/articleshow/88513796.cms||---

Nasa chose India among seven countries for a pre-launch briefing three days ago on its website about the mission—the quest to behold light from stars and galaxies and scour the universe for hints of life. Lucknow-born Hashima Hasan, Nasa’s JWST programme scientist, represented India. Before the precious cargo rocketed away from South America’s northeastern coast, she spoke in Hindi and said: “With unprecedented infrared sensitivity, it will peer back in time over 13.5 years to see the first galaxies born after the Big Bang.” A doctorate in theoretical nuclear physics from Oxford University, she had earlier worked with Tata Institute for Fundamental Research (TIFR) and Barc in Mumbai—the city where she met her future husband at the Taj Mahal hotel. “When the Russians launched Sputnik and my grandmother gathered the whole family early one morning to see the satellite pass overhead, I wanted nothing more than to explore space,” Hasan wrote on the Nasa website. She said she promised herself that one day she would work for Nasa after it landed a man on the moon. She had her mother, teachers and colleagues encouraging her all the way-—from Oxford to TIFR to Nasa, where she joined in 1994 as a visiting senior scientist to manage missions and research programmes in astrophysics. In another Indian connection, Nasa chose a painting by schoolgirl Gaurilakshmi to highlight among other children’s artwork at the launch of the telescope. Nearly 25 years in the making, JWST is the next generation space science observatory following the Hubble Space Telescope. It will be positioned at a spot called Lagrange Point 2—1.5m km from earth or more than four times beyond the moon. Equipped with four instruments, its mission span stretches from five to 15 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/touch-of-india-in-nasas-10bn-most-powerful-telescope/articleshow/88513790.cms||Srinivas Laxman

Singh was a victim of the December 8 helicopter crash in which India’s first Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, his wife and 11 others lost their lives. The PM said after receiving the Shaurya Chakra in August this year, Singh had written a letter to his school principal where he shared his learnings from life with students. He did not boast of his valour; instead he referred to his failures. He talked about how he converted his shortcomings into abilities. Singh had written: “ It is ok to be mediocre. Not everyone will excel at school and not everyone will be able to score in the 90s. If you do, it is an amazing achievement...However, if you don’t, do not think that you are meant to be mediocre. You may be mediocre in school but it is by no means a measure of things to come in life. Find your calling...do your best.” The PM said: “The mantra he has given to rise from average to extraordinary is equally important.” Modi also said Singh had asked students to “never lose hope”. The PM said many lives engaged in the service of the country “teach us a lot. Such was the life of Singh”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/marks-not-benchmark-of-success-pms-tribute-to-group-captain-singh/articleshow/88513801.cms||---

With this, the big cat population in the reserve has gone up to 78. The image of the tigress with a cub was captured in a trap camera in Halonda area in zone-10 of RTR. An official said, “This is the first litter of the tigress, which is the daughter of T-60. Monitoring in the area has been increased. “The cub is around three months old. The Ranthambore Tiger Reserve-1 has 20 adult males, 30 adult female tigers and 28 cubs.” The news has elated wildlife lovers, however, increasing tiger population in the reserve means that space for big cats is decreasing. The Ranthambore reserve has a core area of 392 sqkm with a buffer zone of 1,342 sq km. Of the total area of a little over 1,700 sqkm in RTR, only 600 sqkm can be used by tigers. As per a rough estimate, a male tiger requires approximately 25 sqkm and a female about 15 sqkm. The tiger population has been steadily increasing in the state. In November, T-63 was spotted with triplets in Chinawali top in the Khandar range. As tigers in the reserve are squeezed for territory due to high density, the chief conservator of forest (CCF) had put forward a proposal to relocate six of them. Three tigers and three tigresses were zeroed in for shifting and the proposal was sent to the chief wildlife warden (CWLW). The list consisted of male tigers T-113, T-121 and T-123 and female tigers T-119, T-124 and T-126. Sources said that senior forest officials were divided on the matter to shift tigers after receiving the proposal. “There was a view that the tigers should not be shifted from Ranthambore fearing territorial fights. Territorial fights will always occur in nature and the forest department should not intervene in the process,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajasthan-ranthambores-t-99-gives-birth-to-cub-reserves-tiger-count-reaches-78/articleshow/88513846.cms||---

The leader of the opposition, who was speaking at the ‘Vipaksh Apke Samaksh’ programme in Nuh, said it was time for the people to give a befitting reply to the government. “This government neither got any new development work done for Mewat (now Nuh) nor implemented the approved schemes of the previous governments,” he said. “Mera paani utarte dekh, kinare par ghar mat bana lena, mein samundar hoon, laut kar zaroor aaoonga (Thinking the tide has ebbed, don't you dare build your house on the coast, for I am the sea, I will surely come back),” said Hooda, quoting from a popular couplet that has often been referred to by politicians in their speeches. The Congress leader said he interacted with the people of Haryana, who, he claimed, were angry with this government over rising inflation, corruption and unemployment. “Government offices are lying vacant, there are no employees. Schools are empty because there are no teachers. And in hospitals, there are no doctors,” he said. Former minister Captain Ajay Yadav said if Congress returned to power, pending demands such as rail connectivity to Nuh, a university for the area and development of the Mewat canal would be done. Aftab Ahmed, the MLA from Nuh, took a jab at the government over unemployment. Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Singh Hooda said the present government had “derailed the process of development” not just in Nuh but the entire state. “Before 2014, Haryana was number one in per capita income, per capita investment…. Today, it tops in unemployment, crime, atrocities on farmers, corruption and so on,” he added. DS Hooda said the government had set several records that previous regimes had failed to do even in 70 years. “In the 70 years before this government was formed, petrol, diesel, cooking gas and fertilizers had never been so expensive. Bank loans, atrocities on farmers and unemployment have touched a new high now,” he said, adding that BJP would receive the first blow in the UP elections next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/no-teachers-in-schools-no-docs-in-hosps-hooda-in-nuh/articleshow/88511778.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

After a lull for three months, Covid cases have started seeing an uptick again. In the 26 days of December, the city has added 447 new Covid cases, 269 of which are active. Of these patients, 267 are recovering at home. On Sunday, 68 people tested positive. The number of patients is the highest since June 1, when there were 89 cases. But the recent rise in cases could also be attributed to the fact that Gurugram has intensified testing of late. Between December 19 and Sunday, the number of tests has increased from 3,666 to 5,083. Officials said the four areas proposed for micro-containment zones have three or more cases each. The proposed areas are a flat in Tower 1 of Amber Court Essel Tower in Sector 28, which has five active cases; Tulip Purple in Sector 69, where there are four active cases; Block C of Palam Vihar, with three patients, and a house in Sector 45 with three cases. Door-to-door screenings will be carried out in houses in these areas along with regular sanitisation. These areas can be de-notified after 14 days, depending on the number of cases. At present, the city has nine micron containment zones in three areas. “We have been observing a rise in cases because of a general laxity in maintaining Covid protocols. Many of the patients are related to each other. It is being seen that one member with a history of recent travel is infecting others in the family after returning home. We appeal to people to isolate themselves if they start observing Covid symptoms,” said Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer. Since most of the patients are in home isolation, police have been monitoring their movement by geo-tagging their phone numbers. On December 16, the district administration had notified nine containment zones. Before that on November 18, the city had three containment zones, which were later de-notified. The number of containment zones had peaked during the second wave in April and May. The idea behind containment zones is to arrest the spread of the infection by early detection of a patient and breaking the chain of transmission. The protocols include geographic quarantine, social distancing, enhanced surveillance and intensified testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/cases-again-at-6-month-high-call-for-4-new-containment-zones/articleshow/88511777.cms||Ipsita Pati

As part of the drive, which is likely to start from January 3, the health department has started scanning data on the number of eligible children. According to preliminary data, the city has around 7.5 lakh children aged between 6 and 18 years. The health department will now have to find out how many of them fall in the 15-plus category. For this, the education department will come in handy. Data on the number of children has been sought from 127 government and 232 private schools in the district. “We will hold a meeting of the district task force on Tuesday, when we will share details with the schools on how to set up vaccination camps. First, we will finalise the data and segregate the numbers in keeping with their age. We have already written to the education department for a list of children as soon as possible,” said Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer. “After sorting out the data, the next step will be to carry out an inspection of the schools where vaccination camps can be set up,” the CMO added. Not just schools, inoculations for the children can also take place in primary and community health centres, he said. Initially, kids are likely to be given Covaxin, Yadav said. “We are getting vials of Covaxin. No fresh training is required for that. The health department has experience of handling this vaccine,” he added. Meanwhile, 76 government vaccination sites will be set up on Monday. While Covishield will be given at 69 sites, Covaxin will be administered at six centres and Sputnik V at one site. On Sunday, a total of 7,231 people in the 18-44 age group were inoculated. In the 45-plus category, 1,145 people took the shots. As many as two healthcare workers and seven frontline workers also received the jabs. In all, 8,385 jabs were administered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/covaxin-for-15-plus-category-likely-from-jan-3/articleshow/88511784.cms||Ipsita Pati

School owners and associations have alleged that many parents submit fabricated income certificates to get their wards admitted under the EWS category. “On many occasions, schools have found that parents who own cars and rent apartments in affluent areas submitted false income certificates to get their kids admitted in the private schools. Every year, we file multiple complaints about such cases. So, we don’t see the point of giving admissions and free education based on a mechanism that is flawed and dotted with malpractices,” said Yashpal Yadav, state president, Haryana Sikshan Sansthan Sangathan. Based on the allegations, schools have also asked the education department to verify the documents of eligible students. According to the education department, it doesn’t have the authority to verify income certificates issued by the district administration. “Certificate verification is not under our authority. All the parents submit an affidavit and income certificates issued by the tehsil office. If anyone has an issue, they can take it up with the department concerned and its officials,” said an education department official. The schools, however, accuse the department of washing away their hands off the issue and assert that the onus of certificate verification should not be on them. “It’s a government scheme. Adding the burden of income verification on us is unfair. If we do that, we’ll be accused of finding reasons not to give admissions,” said a principal of a private school. Admissions under the EWS category has been in complete disarray since the pandemic started. After postponing it due to lockdown last year, the government dragged its feet till October this year. Following multiple complaints about the delay, it finally issued a notification, directing schools to admit EWS students. In the first week of December, the relevant exams were conducted, and 40,000 students were found eligible. But the private schools are unwilling to admit any, saying their finances have been hit by the pandemic and most of the session is already gone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/pvt-schools-question-validity-of-income-certificates-hold-up-ews-admissions/articleshow/88511783.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

To this effect, some of the RWAs have made it mandatory for people to be double vaccinated if they want to enter the society from January 1. "While the situation is still under control, there seems to be an upward trend in the number of cases detected every day. Considering this we have made it mandatory for all visitors and vendors to be double-vaccinated to enter the society from January 1. "As of now, no cases have been reported in the society but we cannot let our guard down as some of the cases have been reported in the neighbouring societies," said Pranav Kumar, RWA president of IREO Uptown in Sector 66. During the ‘second wave’ of the pandemic, many RWAs had established Covid Care facility to provide support to the residents as the healthcare system in the city crumbled due to the high number of cases. "With the looming threat of a possible ‘third wave’ we have started preparing for a Covid Care facility in the community centre. Beds have been set up and all the medical equipments and supplies including oxygen cylinders and concentrators are being arranged. "Doctors who are residents in the colony have also agreed to support us, if required. We are also planning to tie-up with some hospitals. We don’t know how severe this wave is going to be but we don’t want to be unprepared as we were during the ‘second wave’," said Dhruv Bansal, a member of Qutub Enclave RWA. The RWAs have asked those residents who are showing any symptoms such as cold and cough to keep themselves isolated till they get tested . Rao Dharamveer Singh, RWA of Mapsko Casabella said, "A family living in the society has been found to be positive but they are recovering at home. We have shunned all the community celebration and are encouraging residents to avoid large gathering looking at the spike in the number of cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/with-spike-in-covid-19-cases-rwas-gear-up-to-fight-virus-once-again/articleshow/88511791.cms||Akanksha Gupta

The city is likely to witness more rain in the next two days under the influence of a western disturbance, according to Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). Residents woke up to shallow fog on Sunday morning, with the minimum temperature at 11.7 degrees Celsius, five notches above the normal and up from 8.4 degrees Celsius on Saturday. Cloudy and hazy conditions prevailed through the day, making the weather colder by 6 pm. Meanwhile, the relative humidity oscillated between 87-88% during the day. The minimum temperature may drop by two to four degrees after December 29. “Presence of clouds during the day prevented the entry of sunlight, causing a fall in daytime temperature, and the same clouds at night prevented heat radiation, causing a rise in minimum temperature. However, once the north-westerly winds from the snow-clad mountains start blowing into the city, the minimum temperature is likely to drop,” an IMD official said, adding that a fresh western disturbance is likely to affect Haryana from January 1. According to the forecast, there will be cloudy conditions on Monday, too, with a possibility of scattered drizzle and shallow to moderate fog in the morning. The maximum and minimum temperatures may hover around 19 and 12 degrees Celsius, respectively. The city air quality, despite the rain, remained 'very poor' for the sixth straight day on Sunday. The AQI reading was 375, marginally up from 349 on Saturday. According to IMD, cloudy conditions and low ventilation prevented pollutant dispersal on Sunday. However, some improvement is expected in the coming days if the city receives good intensity rainfall, which would help wash away accumulated pollutants in the atmosphere. Three of the four monitoring stations in the city, including Vikas Sadan, Sector 51 and Teri Gram, recorded 'very poor' AQIs of 372, 384 and 377, respectively. The AQI at Gwalpahari was not available due to insufficient data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/light-rain-in-city-more-likely-for-next-2-days/articleshow/88511817.cms||Akanksha Gupta

With registries of thousands of flats stuck, buyers who took home loans have started receiving notices from banks — both state-run and private ones — demanding a 2% additional interest over the designated rates. The bank notices have cited delay in registry of flats as the reason. They have referred to certain conditions mentioned in the sanction letter that was signed between the buyer and the bank during the disbursement of home loans. Under these terms and conditions, a flat buyer needs to submit papers related to the execution of sale deeds within 60 days of being offered the possession letter by the developer. If the document is not submitted, the buyer will have to pay an additional 2% interest per annum over and above the prevailing rates. As the bank will command a penal interest and compound the balance amount on a monthly basis, non-payment of such charges could affect the credit score of the buyer in the future. Buyers of flats in the sectors earmarked for developing Sports City are the ones hit the hardest. Many buyers handed the fresh notices have approached the lead bank manager of the district and sought his intervention. Among them is Narendra Kumar, a central government official who bought a 3BHK flat in Civitech Stadia in Sector 79 in March 2017. Kumar paid Rs 68 lakh for his flat, for which he had taken a loan of Rs 58 lakh. Kumar’s monthly EMI of Rs 56,500 could go up by at least Rs 5,000 if the 2% additional interest was levied. “A couple of months ago, I received a notice from my bank, which said I’ll need to pay an additional interest as I had not submitted the sale deeds after receiving possession of my flat. They cited a section from the agreement letter,” he said. Kumar, who took the loan five years ago, said he had responded to the notice and was expecting a solution soon. Buyers of the Sports City project have been offered possession of their flats and are staying there for the past three years with their families. However, a logjam between the Noida Authority and the private developers who built the apartment complexes in sectors 78, 79, 101, 150 and 152 has been delaying the execution of sale deeds or registries. Even after paying the land premium, builders of the Sports City project are not being allowed to execute the tripartite agreement with the Authority and the buyer as no sports infrastructure or facility has been developed by them in keeping with the norms. Subodh Goel, the managing director of Civitech Developers and general secretary of CREDAI in western UP, said, “I have not been informed about the matter. But I will take it up with the banks that have issued notices and explain to them the situation.” Lead bank manager Ved Ratna said a meeting would be held soon. “Since the matter concerns multiple banks and financial institutions, we will take up the representations of the affected buyers in a meeting with the district magistrate. We might have to approach the Reserve Bank of India for further directions,” Ratna added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/stuck-registries-of-flats-in-noida-may-inflate-emi-for-homebuyers/articleshow/88511393.cms||Shalabh

The victim was on his way back home after buying a sprinkler for his field when he was surrounded by the three men on a motorcycle around 8 pm. Janakraj claimed that he was threatened and was asked to hand over all his belongings. When he resisted, one of the three men slashed his thumb with a knife following which he fell to the ground. Another accused pointed a pistol to his head following which they took his mobile phone and Rs 8,000 in cash from him. The accused were on a motorcycle and had their faces covered with a muffler. After being assaulted, Janakraj was rushed to the hospital and had 11 stitches on his thumb. "My thumb was hurt following which I was taken to the hospital. The incident was unexpected. It took me a full day to recover after which I filed a complaint at Bhondsi police station," Jankraj told TOI. A case has been filed against three unknown men at Bhondsi police station under sections 392 (punishment for robbery), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), 34 (Common Intention) of IPC and relevant sections of Arms Act.

---||Gurgaon||GMDA ties up with private firms to maintain green belts across city||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) will be stepping up efforts to tie-up with private companies to efficiently maintain green belts across the city. According to officials, directions to this effect were given by Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who is also the Chairman of the GMDA, during the authority’s meeting earlier this month. At the meeting, Khattar suggested that the responsibility of maintaining green belts be increasingly given to private companies, with belts being allocated to them for maintenance and a focus on horticulture development. He had further recommended that competitions be arranged between companies as well for ranking the "best maintained" green belts on various parameters. Officials from the GMDA, speaking on the condition of anonymity, however, said this task is easier said than done, but assured they would be making efforts towards this end. "We have Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with companies interested in maintaining green belts as part of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Overall, 60 MoUs have been signed so far, several of which are for green belts. This work is already being done and if a company is found to not be maintaining as per required standards, we will cancel the MoU following a review after three months," said a senior GMDA official who did not want to be named. "However, it is not easy to get people to undertake such projects. When an institution or company has a green belt near their location, they are still willing to undertake the work because they also benefit from it, but nobody wants to maintain a belt if it is not in their area. However, we are willing to give such responsibility to anyone who comes forward, so that they at least maintain what is near their location," added the official. Apart from roping in companies to maintain green belts, officials said that the chairman has also directed that roads be identified each month for beautification of green belts, which should afterwards be kept well maintained. Khattar further directed that efforts be stepped up to remove encroachments and, once this is done, steps be taken to take possession of the land and avoid further encroachment, with "personal responsibility" of officers also being fixed in this context.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gmda-ties-up-with-private-firms-to-maintain-green-belts-across-city/articleshow/88511825.cms||Sakshi Dayal

Additional DCP (Traffic) Rajendra Singh said heavy vehicular traffic is likely across all major roads of the city. According to police, like in other major recruitment tests held previously, temporary or ‘satellite’ bus stands have been made to facilitate the entry of students coming from different districts. According to additional DCP (Traffic), Rajendra Singh Sisodiya, over 3.40 lakh students are expected to appear at different centres in the city. The exam will be held in two shifts every day, each shift will see nearly 85,000 students. These bus stands have been set up at Transport Nagar, especially to cater to buses coming from Delhi road, the second one is at Rotary Circle for buses plying on Jaipur-Agra road, another bus stand is located on Taro ki Koot for buses ferrying students from Tonk road.

Meanwhile, two more projects are underway at the police training centre at Bhondsi and along the GMDA-operated treated water pipeline in Sakatpur-Gairatpur Bas. Ahead of monsoon this year, the authority had developed water bodies in three creeks in the Aravali hills with check dams around them, which helped check waterlogging on Golf Course Road, officials said, besides enabling in-situ water conservation. Recognising their utility, GMDA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sudhir Rajpal, at a meeting of the Core Planning Cell (CPC) earlier this week, had directed officials to see if they could build more check dams in other areas. Moreover, he had directed officials to make “all possible efforts” to use rainwater in the green belts and other similar spaces in Gurgaon. “The direction given at the CPC meeting was to see if there are any other places where this kind of a measure will help resolve waterlogging issues,” said a senior GMDA official who did not want to be named. Meanwhile, Bhondsi is set to get two concrete check dams by March 2022. “We have already developed a water body in the police training centre at Bhondsi, where water used to flow down from the hills and create problems. Two concrete check dams will also be created over there by March next year, in time for the monsoon. In addition, we will be giving shape to and fixing water bodies along the Sakatpur-Gairatpur Bas treated water line,” said the official. Apart from these, this kind of intervention is not required anywhere else, according to GMDA. “There are no other areas in the Aravali hills or the city where the creation of check dams is required. If we identify a requirement later, we will develop more check dams,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/after-golf-course-rd-success-2-more-check-dam-projects-underway-gmda-mulls-more/articleshow/88511832.cms||Sakshi Dayal

Pataudi Road is among the crucial stretches in the city, connecting the new sectors with other parts and witnessing a lot of vehicular movement. The overflowing drain poses an accident risk to motorists who try to avoid the dirty water. Moreover, the stretch witnesses traffic jams during peak hours due to its condition. Bholu, who runs a tea stall in the area, said that the overflowing drain creates an unhygienic condition, giving off a foul smell and aiding the breeding of mosquitoes. “For over six months, we have been witnessing the overflowing drain, and the conditions have only worsened. Thousands of vehicles commute on this road daily and face difficulties due to its condition. Also, the dirty water often enters my shop. Locals have put sand on the road to prevent flooding, but it has been of little use," he said. Locals claimed they registered several complaints on the matter, but the authorities have failed to take any action so far. Dharamveer Pawar, one of them, said, “We made several complaints, but it seems like no one is bothering to fix the issue. The authorities concerned need to find a permanent solution in this matter.” Meanwhile, Mandeep Dhankar, executive engineer, MCG, said that the drain line is damaged and lying open at various places on the stretch, with people throwing polythene and trash into it, further blocking the drain. “We have already prepared an estimate for the repair of the drain line, and work will start by early next year,” Dhankar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/drain-overflows-triggers-snarls-on-pataudi-rd-poses-health-risk/articleshow/88511860.cms||Akanksha Gupta

When all domestic flights that operate out of Mumbai are considered, it is this city in Saurashtra in Gujarat, along with a handful of others, that have not only recovered from the pandemic, but have far surpassed their pre-Covid passenger traffic numbers. Rajkot has clocked the highest growth in passenger traffic—107%, that is—when pre-Covid January 2020 numbers are compared with the current traffic. “With the ease in travel restrictions across India and more and more travellers being double vaccinated, Mumbai airport has witnessed over nine domestic destinations surpassing pre-Covid levels,” said Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL). In the first 15 days of December, about 16,000 passengers flew between Mumbai and Rajkot, which was a 107% growth as compared to the pre-Covid period—the first 15 day of January 2020. Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh comes in second with a 73% growth as compared to pre-Covid times, according to MIALdata. But when the December data is compared to January 2019 data, Jabalpur’s passenger traffic growth stands at 98%, the highest among this lot. Then there is Vishakhapatnam with a 68% growth (January 2020 vs December) and the rest are Aurangabad, Chandigarh, Gorakhpur, Kandla, Madurai and Srinagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/9-mumbai-air-routes-see-traffic-higher-than-pre-covid-levels/articleshow/88514002.cms||Manju V

US West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 41 cents, or 0.6%, to $73.38 a barrel by 0053 GMT. The contract did not trade on Friday because U.S. markets were closed for the Christmas holiday. Brent crude rose 40 cents, or 0.5%, to $76.54 a barrel after settling down 0.92% on Friday. Both contracts jumped 3% to 4% last week after early data suggested that the Omicron variant of COVID-19 may cause a milder level of illness. However, the highly transmissible variant is causing Covid-19 case numbers to surge across the world. In the past three days, thousands of passengers travelling during Christmas have been stranded after U.S. airlines cancelled flights due to Covid-related staffing shortages. In Europe, natural gas prices touched record highs last week on tight supplies, supporting Brent crude prices. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that the European Union can only blame its own policies for record gas prices, saying some of its members resell cheap Russian gas at much higher prices within the bloc. Looking ahead, oil investors are focused on the next OPEC+ meeting on Jan. 4. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC and allies including Russia, known as OPEC+, will meet to decide whether to go ahead with a 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) production increase in February. Russia believes oil prices are unlikely to change significantly next year with demand recovering to pre-pandemic levels only by the end of 2022, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/oil-prices-mixed-us-crude-falls-after-covid-19-flight-cancellations/articleshow/88514059.cms||---

Bharadwaj claimed that a well-organised mafia milks these cows, but releases them onto the streets for feeding, where they take to eatng garbage. "The question arises why these cows are not being taken care of inside gaushalas?" he said. The MLA said cows often consume polythene bags from dumpsters. "The plastic lodges in their intestines, leading to painful deaths," he said, further alleging that the corporations have been withholding money for cow fodder for the past three years. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said unfounded charges are levelled at municipal corporations to deviate public attention from rising pollution, collapsing health and bus services etc. He said there is no doubt the corporations should pay more attention to this issue but said residents of Greater Kailash assembly area wish to know what their MLA Bharadwaj has done to shut dairies operating from his constituency.

---||Kolkata||Back to drawing board, private hospitals in Kolkata plan to acquire fresh vaccine stocks||KOLKATA: With the Centre announcing vaccination for health workers, the 15-18 age group and for senior citizens with co-morbidities, private hospitals in Kolkata are scurrying to bolster their stocks ahead of January 3 when the drive begins for the youngest segment so far. Most had stopped acquiring vaccines since November when attendance had dropped to just a handful of second dose recipients. With the queues set to lengthen again, hospitals are back to the drawing board, chalking out a new strategy, employing additional personnel and ordering fresh stocks. At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), stock of Covidshield is down to 10,000 doses. “Out of this, we need around 6,000 doses of booster shots for our healthcare workers across all our units in the city. We plan to procure another 5,000 doses of Covishield for booster doses of frontline workers, senior citizens and for people who have not taken their second doses yet. For children between 15-18 years, we plan to order 5,000 doses of Covaxin,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. He added that the hospital will wait for the guidelines from state government on further details in terms of the modalities of administering the vaccines as per the recent announcement. Peerless Hospital has a stock of 12,200 doses of Covishield and just 390 doses of Covaxin. “We plan to acquire both and will order once we finalize our requirement. A meeting is due on Monday after which we will arrive at the exact numbers. But we will acquire enough to last at least for all the groups,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. He added that hospitals were still waiting for more clarity on the modalities. It’s still not clear if only Covaxin can be administered to the 15-18 age group, he said. Most private hospitals are running low on Covaxin doses since it has had a low demand. The vaccination team of Belle Vue Clinic will meet on Monday to chalk out the volume of fresh orders to be placed. The hospital has run out of Covaxin. “We will place an order as soon as the portal opens. We now have a stock of 6,800 Covishield doses, out of which 2,000 will be used for our doctors and health workers and the remaining 4,800 for the 60-plus recipients. We will place an order for 10,000 Covaxin doses for the 15-18 group,” said CEO P Tondon. Medica Superspecialty Hospital is left with several lakh doses of Covishield and a few thousand doses of Covaxin. “So, we will not require fresh stocks immediately. But since the crowd will be back, we are making arrangements to deploy enough personnel at the vaccination counters and guide and counsel the recipients,” said chairperson Alok Roy. A strategy for the next phase of vaccination will be decided in a meeting at AMRI Hospitals on Monday. AMRI is now left with 8,000 Covishield doses and 3,500 Covaxin doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/back-to-drawing-board-pvt-hosps-plan-to-acquire-fresh-vax-stocks/articleshow/88510291.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The couple is demanding the chief minister to visit the spot and hear their grievances. Govindpura police along with district administration officials from Bhopal and Raisen, BMC rescue team, ambulance, SDERF team and others have camped under the overhead tank and were continuously counselling them to come down. But the couple are not listening to the officers. The administration has arranged for food and water supply for the protestors. The teams have tied nets under the tank. Ritesh, 47, a resident of Bhojour district, along with his wife Seema, 40 and their three children including son, 15, daughters 13 and 6 years in age, climbed on the tank on Saturday afternoon. Ritesh alleged that an “influential man” has encroached upon his land and has been harassing him and his family. He alleged that the Raisen district administration and police did not listen to his complaint so he had to opt for this step. This is the third time the couple along with their children climbed atop an overhead water tank. Earlier they climbed on an overhead water tank in Misrod on August 26 and December 11 and created long suicide drama. They alleged that the assurances given to them by officials were not fulfilled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-30-hours-on-couple-kids-still-perched-atop-overhead-tank/articleshow/88514080.cms||---

During the last season when restrictions were severe due to the pandemic, the total revenue was only Rs 8 crore. In 2019, when there were no restrictions, the revenue was Rs 156 crore. This season, Rs 31 crore income was received from the sale of ‘aravana’, Rs 29 crore as offerings and Rs 3.52 crore through the sale of ‘appam’. There were days when the number of pilgrims went up to 43,000. Meanwhile, the temple was closed after mandala puja on Sunday. The temple will be opened for Makaravilakku festival on December 30. Devotees will be allowed darshan from December 31. Makaravilakku is on January 14. Traditional forest path to be opened: Devaswom minister K Radhakrishnan said on Sunday that the traditional forest path to Pamba from Erumely would be opened for pilgrims during the Makaravilakku festival. Pilgrimage would be allowed through the Erumely-Mukkuzhy-Azhuthakkadavu route from December 31, he said. He also said that pilgrimage via Sathram needs the clearance of the government. This route would also be made fit for pilgrimage before December 30, he said. Meanwhile, forest officials said that the 18-kilometre forest path from Azhuthakkadavu to Pamba has been repaired.

Profits rose 9.0% on-year in November to 805.96 billion yuan ($126.54 billion), well off the 24.6% gain reported in October. For the January-November period, industrial firms' profits rose 38.0% year-on-year to 7.98 trillion yuan, slower than the 42.2% rise in the first 10 months of 2021, the statistics bureau said. Zhu Hong, senior statistician at NBS, said while state efforts to cool soaring wholesale prices in November took cost pressures off downstream industries, the curbs meant the contribution from the mining and raw material sectors to overall profit growth weakened. "But companies still face great cost pressures, and the improvement in profits for downstream sector needs to be further consolidated," Zhu said in a statement accompanying the data release. China's red-hot factory-gate inflation cooled slightly in November, driven by a government crackdown on runaway commodity prices and an easing power crunch as Beijing scrambled to lessen the crippling economic effects of surging costs. The world's second-largest economy, which has lost steam after a solid recovery from the pandemic last year, faces multiple challenges as a property downturn deepens, supply bottlenecks persist and strict Covid-19 curbs hit consumer spending. The country's property distress has also hurt the steel sector while production of cement, glass, and household appliances remains vulnerable to falling demand. At a key agenda-setting meeting this month, China's top leaders pledged to stabilise the economy and keep growth within a reasonable range in 2022. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) this month cut the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve and lowered the one-year benchmark lending rate to stimulate growth. The industrial profit data covers large firms with annual revenue of over 20 million yuan from their main operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/chinas-industrial-profit-growth-tumbles-as-raw-material-prices-fall/articleshow/88514029.cms||---

In response, BJP pointed out that “Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is 49 years old”. Addressing a Congress workers’ training programme in Bhopal on Saturday, Singh had said that he was told this by AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who is leading the party's election campaign in Uttar Pradesh. “Priyanka Gandhiji has started a vigorous campaign in UP, called ‘Mein Ladki hoon Ladh Sakti Hoon’,” Singh told Congress workers, urging them to campaign with the theme song of the movement that is based on the Mahisashur Mardini Stotra. He then said that during a conversation, Priyanka told him, “Digvijaya ji, women who are in their forties and fifties are influenced by Modi. But girls who wear jeans and keep mobile phones are not impressed.” Singh asked members of the Mahila Congress to speak to such young women. State BJP spokesperson Neha Bagga reacted by saying, “Priyanka Gandhi is 49. That says it all. Having said that, it is not just the Union government’s schemes for women but also a deep bond that connects Prime Minister Narendra Modi with women voters. Women can see that Narendra Modi’s efforts are directed at not just securing the present but also ensuring a brighter future.” In his speech, Singh had also pointed out the lacunae within Congress. “Congress had become a party in power and had got used to being in government. After the government went, things got destabilized,” he said. “Being in power is everything for a person who is not attached to the ideology of the party.” In a veiled attack on civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, he said, “You know the history of those who left (Congress). Had they fought unitedly against the British, then perhaps the British would have left in 1857. You need to connect with ideology if you have to fight the government. Join the party whose ideology you believe in. If you don’t believe in Congress’ ideology, then don’t be here. But if you believe in it, then remain undaunted. You shouldn’t fly with the wind whichever way the power is. We don’t need people like that,” he said..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/priyanka-gandhi-vadra-says-pm-modi-gets-support-of-only-women-in-40s-50s-digvijaya-singh/articleshow/88514123.cms||---

Mishra says the video hurts religious sentiments. “Some vidharmis (heretics) are constantly hurting Hindu sentiments.  This video is one such condemnable attempt. I warn Sunny Leone ji, Shaarib and Toshi ji to understand. If they don’t apologise and remove the song within three days, we will take action against them,” Mishra told reporters on Sunday. “Hindus worship Maa Radha and the song has hurt their sentiments,” he added. The song, released last week, is sung by Shaarib and Toshi. On December 22, Leone had tweeted, “New song alert, party vibes only with #Madhuban!’, and shared a video of the song. In October, Mishra had issued a 24-hour ultimatum to fashion and jewellery designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee to withdraw an advertisement with “objectionable and obscene” portrayal of Mangalsutra, warning that an FIR would be lodged and police sent after him. The designer withdrew the ad. “Toying around with our culture and social spirit in the name of creativity cannot be accepted,” Mishra had said. He had also spoken out against an ad that featured a lesbian couple marking Karwa Chauth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/take-down-madhuban-mein-video-or-else-madhya-pradesh-minister-narottam-mishra-to-sunny-leone/articleshow/88514193.cms||---

The accused was identified as Lovleesh Sharma, a resident of Bakhtawar Pur. He had done LLB and tried for judiciary exams, but he failed. The accused wanted to create an impression in his neighbourhood that he was a judge. "He started introducing himself as a chief judicial magistrate (CJM) to throw weight around and on inquiry, he revealed that he had obtained a pistol from one Rakesh, a resident of Bihar," DCP (central) Shweta Chauhan said. Police said that around 7.30pm on Saturday, assistant sub-inspector (Paharganj circle) Jaswant was conducting checks at Rani Jhansi Chambery. "During checking, he stopped a vehicle coming from the wrong side from Rani Jhansi road with a red beacon. The vehicle was being driven by Sharma," an officer said. The vehicle was stopped and Sharma was asked to produce his driving licence, on which he started an altercation with traffic staff and introduced himself as CJM Gurugram. "When he was asked to produce his ID card, he started threatening the staff. The staff of Paharganj police station was informed and they reached the spot," an officer said.

Haryana has been a hub of Murrah buffaloes and bulls in the world, with some of these bulls turning into a brand for their owners. Some sources have claimed that a bull was recently sold for Rs 11 crores, however, there has been no confirmed report of such a deal. Rushtam, a buffalo owned by Dalel Singh of Gatauli village in Jind district, has emerged as a champion bull by defeating others on various parameters in a cattle fare organised in Solan, Himachal Pradesh, on December 18. Nine-year old Rushtam, 15 feet long and around six feet tall, was awarded the “Krishak Ratna” award worth Rs 5 lakh, with his oiled body and smooth grey-black hide being the talk of the town. Dalel Singh informed that the bull produces nearly five ML sperm and can be extracted three times. “This exercise is followed every three months for a period of about 15 days. One shot of sperm generates 400 straws, which are sold for Rs 400 per straw. Thus, it produces about 10 thousand shots every three months,” he said. Singh said Rushtam’s feed include 8 litre milk, 300 gram desi ghee, 3 kg chana, half kg methi, 100 gram badam, 3.5 kg carrot, every day besides fodder. The bull is taken for stroll for nearly 2 to 3 km every morning and evening. Dalel Singh said that Rushtam has won 26 national titles in the bull championships across the country, besides six international titles. “Rushtam has fathered 50 thousand calves till now,” he claimed. The bull is famous for its beauty and quality of semen, which ensure a handsome yearly income up to Rs 20 lakh for its owner. Some other bulls in Haryana are also equally famous. Yuvraj of Kurukshetra, Bajrangi of Chandoli village in Kurukshetra , besides Rustam of Jind district, are counted among the best. Karmbir Singh, resident of Sunaria village in Kurukshetra district, is the owner of Yuvraj. He said that he had been emotionally attached to Yuvraj, who is now 18 years old. “Despite high prices, I have rejected many offers to sell Yuvraj”. Yuvraj has been a national champion and had fathered thousands of calves across the country. Dalel Singh said that there are many parameters for selecting best bulls in the championships.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/haryanas-murrah-buffaloes-now-a-brand-some-bulls-worth-crores/articleshow/88514272.cms||Vijender Kumar

---||Business||Asia stocks, oil struggle as Omicron worries weigh||TOKYO: Asian stock markets were generally weaker with U.S. crude in holiday-thinned trading on Monday, as uncertainty over the economic impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant weighed on investor sentiment. U.S. airlines have cancelled or delayed thousands of flights over the past three days due to Covid-19-related staff shortages, while several cruise ships had to cancel stops after outbreaks on-board. In Asia, China reported its highest daily rise in local Covid-19 cases in 21 months over the weekend as infections more than doubled in the northwestern city of Xian, the country's latest Covid hot spot. Japan's Nikkei lost 0.20% while South Korea's Kospi fell 0.11%. Mainland Chinese shares, though, were mixed, with Shanghai's benchmark sliding 0.37% but an index of blue chips edged 0.05% higher. Australia, Hong Kong and Britain are among markets closed Monday for holidays. "There is concern over the widening spread of the Omicron variant, which is overall making people cautious about taking stocks higher" in Japan, said a market participant at a Japanese securities firm. Wall Street trading resumes later in the global day following a holiday on Friday. U.S. stocks closed at records on Thursday amid signs Omicron may cause a milder level of illness, even as the highly transmissible strain led to a surge in case numbers around the world. Emini futures point to a 0.1% rise for the S&P 500 when it reopens. In the foreign exchange markets, the U.S. dollar continued to languish near the bottom of its range of the past month against a basket of major peers, after hitting a 16-month high in November as Federal Reserve policymakers turned more hawkish. The dollar index was about flat at 96.116, towards the bottom of the range from 95.544 to the 16-month peak at 96.938 reached on Nov. 24. In the crude market, U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures fell 59 cents to $73.20 a barrel. The contract did not trade on Friday because of the U.S. market holiday. Brent crude though rose 26 cents to $76.40 a barrel, rebounding from Friday's 71 cent decline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/asia-stocks-oil-struggle-as-omicron-worries-weigh/articleshow/88514395.cms||---
---||World||Covid vaccination mandatory in Singapore from February 2022||SINGAPORE: Singapore has made Covid vaccination a mandatory condition for the approval of new applications for work passes, long-term passes and permanent residence in Singapore from February 1 next year. Those renewing their work passes will also have to be vaccinated, The Straits Times reported, citing the multi-ministry task force (MMTF) on Covid. The new order will not apply to children aged below 12 and those who are medically ineligible for vaccination, it said. The new measure, announced on Sunday, is a part of the nation's adjustments to dealing with the Omicron variant. "These measures will help sustain our high vaccination rates and facilitate the safe reopening of our society and economy," the Singapore daily quoting the MMTF said. At the point of application, employers will have to make a declaration that their work pass holders and dependants are fully vaccinated upon arrival in Singapore. Work pass holders must submit or present their vaccination certificates as part of the verification process. Those with digitally verifiable certificates will have to upload them to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority's Vaccination Check Portal system. Those without digitally verifiable certificates will have to present their vaccination certificates to airlines or ferry operators, or at the checkpoint, before boarding. People who cannot produce the necessary documents will not be allowed to board the plane or enter Singapore, unless prior exemptions have been granted. Individuals who were vaccinated overseas must update their vaccination records in the National Immunisation Registry (NIR) and will be given a grace period of 30 days upon arrival in Singapore to undergo and show a positive serology test result taken at a public health preparedness clinic. "Should they test negative, they will be required to complete the full vaccination regimen in Singapore or their passes may be revoked,” the task force said. As for dependents of work pass holders, the vaccination condition will not apply to children aged below 12. Pass holders who are medically ineligible for vaccination will have to submit a doctor's memo at the point of application and undergo a medical review upon arrival in Singapore. Those applying for permanent residence, student passes and long-term visit passes will have their vaccination status verified when their passes are issued. Their vaccination records will have to be updated in the NIR. If applicants are unvaccinated or vaccinated overseas but test serology negative, an indication that the body has not produced antibodies in response to vaccination, they will have to complete the full vaccination regimen in Singapore to fulfil the vaccination condition before they can be granted permanent residence or long-term passes. The vaccination condition will not apply to permanent residence, long-term visit pass and student pass applicants for those who are aged below 12 years old, as well as those who are medically ineligible for vaccination. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health (MoH) has warned that unvaccinated workers will no longer be allowed to return to the workplace from January 15, even if they have a negative pre-event testing (PET) result. The ministry had said in October that unvaccinated people would not be allowed to enter the workplace from January 2022, unless they had tested negative for Covid-19. "Following the review and discussion with tripartite partners, we have decided to remove the PET concession for unvaccinated persons to return to the workplace from January 15, 2022,” the Channel News Asia quoting the MoH said. Partially vaccinated workers, those who have taken at least one dose of vaccine but are not yet fully vaccinated, will be granted a grace period until January 31 to complete the vaccination regime, the ministry said. During the grace period, they can enter their workplace with a negative PET result.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/covid-vaccination-mandatory-in-singapore-from-february-2022/articleshow/88514155.cms||---

There are plans to run the vehicle on Nagpur-Raipur and Nagpur-Jabalpur routes in coming weeks. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, who has been patronizing the exhibition, is also a strong advocate of alternate fuel. The company now has two Nagpur-based entrepreneurs at the helm. Formed in October 2019, Super Transit Services originally had other individuals in the management. “So far we have had CNG buses but now we have launched a bus which runs on LNG too, which his more economical,” said Aman Shaikh, a managment official. He is set to take over as director along with Kalyan Deshpande, also from Nagpur. The move was prompted by opening up of the country’s first commercial LNG filling station by Baidyanath Group in Nagpur. Shaikh said, “We have converted an Ashok Leyland bus into LNG. It has taken an investment of around Rs15 lakh. It is an over 5 years old but that also proves that on LNG even an old bus runs better. The operating costs come down by 35%,” he said. Super Transit plans to lease out buses from the existing operators and convert vehicles into LNG. The first bus that is planned to run from Nagpur to Raipur is expected to be launched in 2-3 weeks. The bus belongs to Mahendra Travels, a Raipur-based transporter. “Another bus of a different transporter that would ply on the Nagpur-Jabalpur route is also expected to be running soon,” he said. As a part of its long-term strategy, there are plans to start filling stations across the country. To begin with, 10 stations will be started including some in Vidarbha. “This will allow starting bus operations on other routes too,” he said. Like Nagpur and Raipur or Jabalpur, there are other cities in the country which are separated by distance of 250 to 300 kms. There are plans to start the services between such cities including Delhi to Manali. The company plans to raise money for setting up the filling station through clean energy funds. Meanwhile, Rawmatt Industries Private Limited, which already has a CNG pump, now plans to start a bio-LNG filling station in the city. The company will be making its own bio-CNG. Kaustubh Gupta of Rawmatt said that there are plans to manufacture bio-LNG through rice-straw and sell it to the retail sector. “We would be starting with a 10 tonne capacity as the operations are expected to begin in next 6-7 months. Both LNG produced from hydrocarbon deposits and that made from the bio-waste can be used in the same vehicle,” said Gupta. “As the number of filling stations increase, it is expected that the demand for LNG would be created to a level that there is enough offtake for Rawmatt’s production,” said Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lng-bus-may-soon-run-on-nagpur-raipur-route/articleshow/88511262.cms||Shishir Arya

The 500 metric tons of food aid was shipped by INS Kesari, which entered the Maputo Port on Saturday, to support Mozambique in coping with the ongoing drought and concurrent challenges of pandemic in the country. “With India also remaining committed to supporting the capacity building efforts of the armed forces of Mozambique, the two fast interceptor craft and self-defence equipment were handed over to them,” a Navy officer said. The Mission SAGAR deployments to India’s extended maritime neighbourhood are being conducted in close coordination with the ministry of external affairs and other agencies of the Indian government. INS Kesari had undertaken similar missions in May–June 2020 to provide humanitarian and medical assistance to Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles, Madagascar and Comoros, including deployments of the Navy’s medical assistance teams in multiple locations. “The Navy has deployed ships to 15 friendly foreign countries under SAGAR missions since May last year. These deployments spanned over 215 days at sea and delivered a cumulative assistance of more than 3,000 metric tons of food aid, over 300 metric tons of liquid medical oxygen, 900 oxygen concentrators and 20 cryogenic containers,” the officer said. “While undertaking these missions, Indian ships have traversed a cumulative distance of close to 40,000 nautical miles, which is nearly twice the circumference of earth,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-delivers-food-aid-to-mozambique-under-sagar-mission/articleshow/88514443.cms||Rajat Pandit

The weather office on Sunday predicted some spells of rain between Tuesday and Friday in several parts of the state, including Lucknow. It will be followed by drop in temperatures and fog around the new year’s eve. State Met director JP Gupta said a western disturbance is hovering over the Himalayas and causing rains and snowfall in the northern hill states. Simultaneously, a cyclonic circulation has developed over Rajasthan, he added. The two factors together would cause widespread rains in north and northwest India, he explained. “In UP, light rains in some parts are expected on Tuesday. The rainfall activity will intensify on Wednesday and cover many parts of the state. Thursday and Friday may also witness brief spells of rain in some parts. The weather will gradually become clear from Saturday,” said the Met director. Lucknow may get rainfall on Tuesday and Wednesday. The mercury levels would remain low during the day in these two days, but night temperatures are expected to remain above normal. However, as soon as the western disturbance fizzles out, cold winds from snowclad mountains would start lashing the state and the city from Friday-Saturday, leading to chilly conditions and fog, he predicted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-brace-for-rainy-week-fog-to-cloud-new-year-eves-revelry/articleshow/88514622.cms||---

Speaking at a press conference on Sunday in Karachi, Rashid said the roots of the mafia in this country are so deep that the government couldn't get a hold of them, Dawn newspaper reported. "People are blaming us for the situation [inflation], but it actually happened because of past rulers," the Pak minister said while admitting "it is our mistake that we couldn't explain it to the people." Rashid also accepted the country was facing a gas crisis at the moment, adding "it is a reality". According to the media reports, people in Pakistan don't have enough to cook their daily meals because successive governments handed out gas connections like sweet cakes. Pakistanis are now staring at hours-long gas outages. Over former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's possible return to Pakistan, the minister said the convicted leader had left the country after much drama, adding "probably he is healthy as he did not consult any doctor (in London) since the time he made it there". He also accused Sharif of attacking the judiciary and giving statements on the army while sitting abroad. Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader and former PM Sharif's likely return has intensified the political environment in the country posing further challenges to the Imran Khan government. Amid the country's already tense political environment, a new heated debate has erupted over Sharif ahead of the next general elections, according to Geo TV. Imran Khan's government has faced challenges and his own popularity is on the wane with the recent reverses for his party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf in the local body elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/imran-khan-govt-failed-to-hold-the-corrupt-accountable-admits-pakistan-minister/articleshow/88514689.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Christmas ushers in joy, people throng churches||By Godhooli Sharma & Vertika Sonakia LUCKNOW: Dressed in colourful attire with Santa caps on their head, people celebrated Christmas by visiting churches, playing games, sitting around lit-up bonfires and relishing a heavy feast. Along with churches, the markets also got crowded by the evening as many came out of their homes to throng food joints. Such was the crowd that many prominent cities witnessed traffic jams but no one seems to be complaining. Many revelers were seen taking customary selfies in front of giant illuminated trees and the holy crib. Bhawna Victor, who visited Central Methodist Church, was happy to get into the celebration mood in the church after a long time. Victor said, “The church offered service in an online mode last year which is why getting back to the church for Christmas celebrations makes me more excited.”This year we had an option between online and offline service sessions, but we chose to visit the church in order to get the essence of the festival. On one hand, we are happy to celebrate the festival together, but at the same time we are missing the people who attended the session virtually," said Abhinav Lall. Swati Agrawal, who visited St Joseph’s Cathedral and wanted to teach her three-year-old daughter about equality and love for all religions said, “I believe my daughter should understand that we are an Indian before being a Hindu and in order to introduce her to the festival I brought her to the church today. I hope my daughter becomes a secular individual when she grows up.” Many residents visited malls and shopping complexes which were well decorated in view of the festival. Shraddha Saxena, who visited a city mall with her kids in order to spend some quality time, said, " We got some selfies clicked at the mall and ended up having our lunch at a famous food joint .” While some enjoyed their families, Diksha Rupani visited an old age home with her loved ones. It was a time for family bonding for many people who were in their hometown. Riya Singh, resident of LDA Colony said, "We started decorating the house two weeks ago. There was a small gathering at our house on Christmas in the evening. We have invited close friends and family" At All Saints Garrison Church, Lucknow, presbyter in charge Rev Henry Johnson said, "In order to make us the sons of God, the Son of God himself came to earth on this day as a human." The service at Bethel Fellowship of Believers Church was conducted by the Pastor Rev Suresh Mathews. Games for children and youth were organized by Ekta Masih.

Addressing DMK workers in the city on Sunday at an event to launch the party’s membership drive, Udhayanidhi said that he wanted to serve as a bridge between the chief minister and people. The Chepauk MLA was responding to remarks by former minister Pongalur Palaniswami and electricity minister Senthil Balaji that Udhayanidhi should soon become the deputy chief minister or at least a minister. “Pongalur Palaniswami and Senthil Balaji said I should become a minister. But I don’t nurse such desires,” he said. Over the past few days, several DMK leaders including some ministers have said that Udhayanidhi should become a minister. “All I want is to serve people always, be one among you as a DMK worker and discharge my duty to serve the masses,” he said. Ever since the DMK returned to power, Udhayanidhi has been travelling across the state, participating in party events and public meetings inviting criticism from opposition parties that he was de facto deputy chief minister. “I want to stand alongside you and work for the kazhagam till the end. I want to support you in serving the people, serve thalaiavar (chief minister M K Stalin). In fact, I want to act as a bridge between you and thalaivar,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/not-keen-on-becoming-minister-udhayanidhi-stalin/articleshow/88514703.cms||---

The government jobs will be given on compassionate grounds on the basis of eligibility, the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kohima/centre-to-set-up-committee-for-afspa-repeal-nagaland-cm-neiphiu-rio/articleshow/88514748.cms||Bhadra Gogoi
---||Guwahati||Vandals target churches in Haryana and Assam||AMBALA/SILCHAR: Two intruders in Haryana vandalised Ambala’s heritage Holy Redeemer Church early on Sunday and allegedly desecrated Jesus Christ’s statue, according to a CCTV footage that shows the unidentified duo loitering inside the British-built shrine for more than an hour past midnight. In Assam’s Barak Valley district of Cachar, a group of young men claiming to be Bajrang Dal activists, barged into a Silchar church during Yuletide prayers on Saturday night and demanded that the Hindus present there leave immediately. The youths, wearing saffron scarves, allegedly said the Hindus inside the church should instead have been celebrating “Tulsi Diwas” that coincides with Christmas. Once the Presbyterian Church was cleared of Hindus attending the evening prayer, the group shut the gate and allegedly manhandled those who objected to it, sources said. A local Bajrang Dal functionary later said the youths were merely trying to prevent crowding inside the church because of the risk of Covid. Cachar SP Ramandeep Kaur said seven suspects had been detained. The Ambala intrusion was Haryana’s third such incident in the span of a day after suspected right-wing activists disrupted Christmas-related events at a school in Gurgaon’s Pataudi and inside a public hall in Kurukshetra. Punjab police registered a case against the duo based on a complaint by Father Patras Mundu of Holy Redeemer Church. “Around 12.30am, two suspects entered the church by jumping over the gate. They roamed around, vandalised electric lighting and around 1.40am, desecrated the statue of Christ...our religious sentiments are hurt. In the CCTV footage, it is very obvious that this has been done intentionally,” the complaint states. Haryana home minister Anil Vij said the police would soon arrest the culprits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/vandals-target-churches-in-haryana-and-assam/articleshow/88514802.cms||BB Goswami
