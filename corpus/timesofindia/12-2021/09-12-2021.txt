The interim Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, had directed the delegation to visit Nagaland. Singh, who was in a sit-in demonstration at the airport along with his other colleagues decrying the 'illegal detention', asked how the Jorhat administration could restrict their movement to another state. The administration had cited the prevailing law and order in Mon and its neighboring areas as the reason for issuing the order. Jorhat district magistrate Ashok Kumar Barman stated that the prohibitory order has been issued in view of restrictions imposed by the Nagaland government on the movement of civilians and others from the Assam side to the Mon district. "I am satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to prohibit their movement considering the present sensitive situation in the border areas and apprehensions of breach of peace and tranquility in the border areas of Jorhat district," read the order. As per information available with the Jorhat administration, along with the three Congress leaders, Lok Sabha MP Anto Antony was also scheduled to arrive in Jorhat on Wednesday. "Our Congress delegation, which was set to leave for Mon today, has been detained. If there is a law and order problem, the Nagaland Police would have stopped us from entering Nagaland. Why is the Assam Police stopping us at Jorhat?" questioned Singh. He sniffed a conspiracy and alleged that the government feared the Congress delegation would unearth the truth and reveal it to the nation. Lok Sabha MP from Kaliabor in Assam, Gogoi, termed the restriction on their movement as an attack on democracy. He blamed the Union home minister, Amit Shah, and the Assam chief minister for allegedly barring their entry into Nagaland. "We are staging a dharna against the government for curbing our democratic rights. We were going to console the families who lost their members in the Mon firing," said Gogoi. Meanwhile, leader of opposition in the Assam assembly and CLP leader, Debabrata Saikia, demanded that the state government take the decision to withdraw the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which is being blamed for the death of the villagers in Mon. The entire northeastern region erupted in protest and demanded the withdrawal of the ‘draconian’ AFSPA so that Mon-like incidents were not repeated in the region. "The cabinets of Nagaland and Meghalaya governments have decided to withdraw AFSPA. In such a situation, the Assam government should also withdraw the law," said Saikia. Leading students’ body, the North East Student Organization, will stage a protest across the region on Thursday demanding justice for the civilian victims and withdrawal of AFSPA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/congress-delegation-to-nagaland-stopped-at-jorhat-airport/articleshow/88172703.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Congress leader Ivan D’Souza, who was on the flight, told TOI that the manoeuvre scared the living daylights of all the passengers on board. When the flight was circling, D’Souza said, the pilot announced that he had missed the approach and the winds were not favourable. ``The flight was almost near to the tarmac, when all of a sudden the pilot took off the flight with the engine straining. We all thought that our fate would be like the Air India Express tragedy of 2010,’’ he noted. The flight was supposed to take off at 7.30 pm from Bengaluru, but was delayed and took off an hour late. The flight landed at MIA at 9.45 pm. ``The pilot announced on board the flight that the wind was against the approach and it was not safe to land the flight,’’ said another passenger who called TOI immediately after landing. The airline did not give any details. ``We could see the tarmac so close. Perhaps the tyres were inches away from touching the ground. Everybody on the flight panicked as the flight, which was wheels down and about to land, took off with the engine screaming,’’ said yet another passenger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/passengers-panic-after-flight-takes-off-close-to-landing-at-mangaluru-airport/articleshow/88172694.cms||Stanley Pinto

The victim has filed a case on December 7 with the Saki Naka police after the fraudster fraudulently made her part with the one-time password (OTP) to reverse the fraudulent transactions that he carried out from her two credit cards. The fraud occurred on December 2 when the senior official searching on the internet to buy liquor came across a fake number 18004120308 tagged with Living Liquidz shop. The money was siphoned after the victim called the fraudster to check for a delay in the delivery. “Many people have fallen victim so far while trying to book wine online. We have sought details from the bank to track the money trails to locate the accused. Also, we are tracking the call records to locate the fraudster,” said a Saki Naka police officer. The fraud occurred between 4.30 pm and 7.30 pm when the SEBI official called on the number and asked if they would make home delivery. In the complaint, the official said, “The fraudster gave a mobile number to communicate further. After placing the order, the fraudster identified as Pankaj Sharma asked me for an advanced payment. When I asked that they never ask for money in advance, the fraudster said that their online payment machine is not working and made me part with my credit card details.” The official paid Rs9,590 but hours passed by and the delivery was not made. “I then called on the same mobile number and checked the delay. The fraudster said there was an error and he did not receive the money. I was speaking with the fraudster when Rs 62,000 got debited from the card. When I questioned him, he said it got debited by mistake and said he will reverse the transaction. He generated another OTP and another Rs 61,000 got debited. When I confronted him, he told will reverse the sum and made me share another OTP and Rs 20,200 got debited. It was then I realized I was duped,” her complaint mentioned. The cyber police had compiled a list of 73-plus telephone numbers that the scamsters had used for defrauding the customers willing to purchase liquor online. Despite repeated warnings, people call up these numbers, they get through a google search to purchase liquor online. “The citizens do not visit the genuine/authentic websites and instead pick up these numbers from a preliminary Google search. Association of Progressive Retail Liquor Vendors (APRLV), Mumbai has also declared that to tackle these frauds the association has decided to accept Cash on Delivery (COD) and not to ask the customers for online payment before stocks are delivered to them,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/senior-sebi-official-duped-in-online-wine-order-fraud/articleshow/88169784.cms||V Narayan

He did not believe in being a status-quoist. In meetings, he would often go on the offensive in his typically blunt manner but if you knew your stuff and spoke with conviction, he would always listen intently,” said a senior military officer. Gen Rawat, appointed the CDS on December 31, 2019 after three years as the Army chief, did ruffle many feathers among both serving officers as well as the vocal veteran community.

He was 63. CDS Rawat's wife Madhulika and 11 other personnel were also killed in the crash. A decorated military man, General Rawat took over as the firstHe publicly junked the Navy’s long-standing case for a third aircraft carrier and rejected the IAF’s concerns over integrated theatre commands. During a seminar, he even went so far as to dub the IAF “a supporting arm” in war-fighting akin to artillery or engineers in the Army. Several proposals mooted during Gen Rawat’s tenure, ranging from measures to slash non-operational military flab and the pension bill to “monetisation” of defence land and restrictions on CSD purchases, sent shockwaves down the ranks. Unfazed by criticism, he rarely pulled his punches and remained outspoken while pushing firmly ahead with his agenda. Even his critics would acknowledge that his determined thrust to build an integrated land-air-sea war-fighting machinery through theatre commands and other means is desperately required for India amidst the limited budget for military modernisation. File: Chief of Army Staff General Bipin Rawat on a two-day visit to J&K after the scrapping of Article 370 in 2019. (PTI)“Gen Rawat may have sometimes behaved as a bull in a china shop but it was urgently needed in the backdrop of the three services continuing to indulge in petty turf wars. Yes, theatre commands will have some adverse impact on the individual services but it’s mandatory for the overall good,” said another senior official. The son of a Lt-General, Gen Rawat began his military career with a flourish by winning the coveted “Sword of Honour” at the Indian Military Academy when he was commissioned in the 5/11 Gorkha Rifles in December 1978. In December 2016, the Modi government superseded two senior Lt-Generals, Praveen Bakshi and P M Hariz, to appoint Gen Rawat as the Army chief, contending that merit rather than mere seniority had been considered for his appointment. But some interpreted the move as Gen Rawat being close to the government. Gen Rawat responded to the confidence placed in him by showing his mettle during the 73-day face-off at Doklam near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction in 2017 after Indian troops proactively blocked China’s attempt to extend its motorable track towards the Jampheri Ridge, which overlooks India’s strategically-vulnerable Siliguri Corridor.

While the exact cause behind the crash is not known yet, official sources said the accident may have happened due to poor visibilityThe government then appointed him as the CDS of the 15-lakh strong armed forces, a four-star general like the Army, Navy and IAF chiefs but the clear “first among the equals” as the permanent chairman of the chiefs of staff committee. He also became the secretary of the new department of military affairs in the defence ministry. The government contended Gen Rawat would push the boundaries to drive the desperately-needed integration among the three Services, which often pull in different directions in planning, procurements, logistics, doctrines and operations. In an interview to TOI last year, which created quite a stir in the defence establishment, Gen Rawat had said, “We are not expeditionary forces that have to deploy around the globe. We have to guard and fight only along our borders and, of course, dominate the Indian Ocean Region. So, we should not go in for large amounts of imports by misrepresenting our operational requirements.” “We should boost `Make in India’ by hand-holding our domestic industry even if they deliver weapons with only 70% of the GSQRs (general staff qualitative requirements or technical parameters) in the beginning…given the opportunity, they will eventually deliver cutting-edge technology,” he had added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/challenged-status-quo-pushed-reforms-even-if-it-ruffled-feathers/articleshow/88173830.cms||Rajat Pandit
---||Kolkata||Early winter hopes bring cheer to apparel shops and eateries||The nip in the air has been around for some time now, but the rain and overcast skies have made way for an early winter in Kolkata. With the Met department predicting Celsius to slide below 15 degrees from December 15, many are making a beeline to buy woollens and winter garments. The demand, according to retailers, has shot up and they are expecting it to rise further. What’s more, the early winter buzz has also made bakers and restaurateurs hopeful of brisk business in the coming weeks, going by the trend in recent years. sale of woollen garments goes up Kokhon Ghosh, who sells woollen garments in Gariahat, said his sale is already 20% higher than last year. “The demand for cardigans and pullovers went up from Monday after the weekend rain and chill. However, unlike last year, when people were homebound and had time to knit, the craze for wool yarns is missing this year.” According to Uday Kumar Shaoo, secretary of SS Hogg Market Traders Association, the demand for winter garments is 30% more than last year and it is gradually increasing. “At New Market, the sale of woollens peaks from December 15 to January 15. But people have already started buying from last weekend, especially sweaters for kids. Woollen socks, mufflers, scarves are also in high demand,” said Uday, adding, “We get a lot of customers from the hills looking for woollen clothes. Last year we missed them because of the pandemic. This year we are hopeful they will be back.” K Vijayan, the general manager of a shopping mall in Kolkata, said the nip in the air as well as the effects of Cyclone Jawad have motivated shoppers to start their winter shopping early. “At our mall, almost all the clothing brands have doled out a wide collection of woollen garments. The sale has already started in earnest. With double vaccination in place, people are comfortable shopping. We are expecting a surge in the sale of winter garments during mid-December.” Restaurants expect more footfall Meanwhile, restaurants are all geared up to welcome patrons in the festive winter season. A number of special events like live music and other performances are in the works while keeping safety guidelines in mind. With the mercury dipping, restaurants started doing better business from the first week of December itself and are expecting the figures to improve in the coming days. Anirban Sengupta, co-owner of a rooftop cafe in Southern Avenue, said the weather plays a vital role in deciding their footfall. “People tend to dine out more during winter because of the soothing weather,” he added. This winter, city eateries and clubs are expecting 35% to 50% higher footfall compared to last year because of two reasons. “First, people who have not been able to step out last year due to the pandemic, would make up for that in a big way this year. Second, since nightclubs and restopubs are off-limits because of the night curfew, that crowd will shift to bars and restaurants,” added Anirban. Anticipating a larger footfall, Nitin Kothari, owner of a Park Street restaurant, has started taking all the necessary precautions to ensure safety. “100% of our staff is double vaccinated and no one will be allowed without masks. Besides that, we are sticking to our usual menu because that’s our speciality. We don’t change our menu based on the occasion and people love us for that,” he said. ‘Celsius to drop consistently’ As Cyclone Jawad has passed, there is no further chance of any rainfall in Kolkata now and the sky will be mostly clear. According to the Met department, the temperature has started dropping consistently from Wednesday onwards. Regional Meteorological Centre director GK Das said, “There is a nip in the air after the rainfall. But the temperature will drop to 15 degrees Celsius or below after December 15. There is no further chance of any rainfall now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/early-winter-hopes-bring-cheer-to-apparel-shops-and-eateries/articleshow/88168578.cms||Ruman Ganguly

The chopper crashed just seven minutes before it was to land at the Wellington helipad. “It was very misty in the morning. I saw the chopper flying just 200m above my house. It hit a huge tree and crashed with a bang. People living nearby ran away from their houses,” said Prakash, a resident of Burliar hamlet who saw the chopper crash from just 100 feet away. Prakash and other residents in the locality rushed to the crash site where they found the chopper burning.

Around 200 dwellings are located in a scattered manner close to the accident spot. A Sivakumar, another villager and among the first to reach the spot, said there were 11 people in the burning chopper while three were found a few meters away, apparently flung out by the impact. They had severe burn injuries. “One of the injured was groaning. In a muffled voice he asked us for water,” Sivakumar said.

He himself made it very clear that as the country’s first-ever CDS, his mandate was to push ‘jointness and integration’ among the Army, Navy and IAF despite stiff resistance, whileBy 12.40pm, the first rescue team, comprising fire service personnel and health workers, had reached the spot. Air Force personnel joined the operation and handled the technical issues while dismantling pieces of the chopper during the rescue operation. Rescue efforts were hampered by absence of vehicular access to the crash site and the absence of a water source to put out the fire. It took a few minutes for hoses to be connected to each other from the fire tenders to get closer to the crash site, and more than 2.5 hours to put out the fire in the chopper. C Dandapani, a fireman, said since ambulances could not reach the spot, they got bedsheets from the residents to carry the injured from the gorge. “We first rescued the three found outside the chopper and sent them to the Army hospital in Wellington,” he said. By 1.30pm, at least seven bodies had been recovered, but rescue operations got delayed subsequently as bodies were found trapped under the chopper debris. It was only at around 4pm that the last body was retrieved. Subsequently, the crash site was cordoned off. Of the 14 who were on board, two were rescued alive. However, one died on the way to hospital. All the 13 bodies are at the Wellington military hospital for a post-mortem.

It has also referred these cases to the collectors of the concerned districts, where the former MPs lived, for the recovery of the outstanding amount till December 2012. The ministry’s submission is part of the PAC’s reported on “Functioning of Directorate of Estates”, which was tabled in both houses on Wednesday. A CAG audit tabled in the Parliament in August 2016 had flagged how the DoE had failed to recover the licence fee dues from different allottees. According to the PAC report, when the ministry was asked about the recovery of the licence fee on August 21, 2020, it submitted a written reply mentioning, “As per Section 14 of the Public Premises (Eviction and Unauthorised Occupants) Act, a certificate of recovery of arrears in respect of 442 former MPs has been sent to (the) collectors of their districts of permanent revenue for recovery as arrears of land revenue. They will recover the dues of the government through their system of recovery.” The DoE was yet to recover Rs 6.85 crore from former occupants of government accommodations. The parliamentary panel, in its observation, said that the DoE may earnestly pursue the damage recovery cases under the Act that have been forwarded to the collectors. “The committee hopes that with the disbursement of salaries through PFMS portal and the consequent posting of the status in regard to licence fee in the rent account of the allottees, the problem of overdue will be resolved in the near future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/directorate-of-estates-files-damage-recovery-cases-against-442-ex-mps/articleshow/88174031.cms||Dipak K Dash

While the exact cause behind the crash is not known yet, official sources said the accident may have happened due to poor visibilityThe IAF court of inquiry will establish the exact reason that led to the crash, but experts point out that the Russian-origin Mi-17 V5s are extremely reliable helicopters compared to the obsolete Cheetahs and Chetaks still being operated by the armed forces. While a Mi-17 V5 has powerful engines and advanced avionics, weather radars, autopilot systems, and IAF crews are well trained to fly them under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), a helicopter remains an extremely complex machine that can suddenly suffer a technical snag.

The fairway of the golf course at Wellington Gymkhana Club has a helipad with unidirectional approach that's usually used for flights from Sulur or Coimbatore,” said former naval aviator and test pilot Commander K P Sanjeev Kumar (retd). “Such flights are undertaken under VFR (visual flight rules), which basically means `see and avoid’.

The fact that allies NCP and Shiv Sena appeared on the opposite sides of the discussion, with Pawar’s outfit echoing the Trinamool line on the need to rope in “all” non-BJP parties while Sena backed Congress’s primacy in any future initiative, made clear the flux that the opposition bloc is in at present. The opposition leaders across parties argue that there may be a merit in the demand to expand the like-minded bloc but TMC’s “virtually anti-Congress” line, an effort to get the party to concede leadership, will not wash. “If somebody is uncomfortable with the UPA, there can be a new formation and more parties can be invited. But Congress has to be the big player in the grouping, it still has support of major regional parties. Trinamool seems to be abhorrent of the idea of giving Congress importance. This is not likely to work,” an opposition leader from a non-Congress party said. At the core of the raging row triggered by Trinamool is the leadership issue. While TMC is pitching Mamata as the presumptive leader, most parties are of the view that the ticklish subject should be left for 2024. Interestingly, as NCP spokesman Nawab Malik on Tuesday stressed the need for inviting more parties to join the opposition bloc and argued that there were more anti-BJP parties outside UPA then within, he refused to touch upon the leadership issue. Even Sena leader Sanjay Raut, who met Rahul Gandhi and told reporters that he had urged him to take the lead in opposition unity, parried queries about who should be on the top of the anti-BJP grouping. Trinamool’s anti-Congress line, even at the risk of appearing to play solo, has been on full display during the winter session of Parliament. While all the opposition parties including NCP and Shiv sena have been attending the daily strategy meetings chaired by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, TMC has stayed away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tmcs-anti-cong-pitch-reveals-fault-lines-in-opposition-bloc/articleshow/88174244.cms||---
---||World||Instagram boss tells US lawmakers app 'can help' teens||WASHINGTON: Instagram's boss on Wednesday pushed a rosy view of the photo-sharing app's impact on teens in testimony to US lawmakers that was at odds with damning news reports based on the firm's own research.  Adam Mosseri argued the service could help struggling young people, after documents leaked by a company insider raised worries of harms, including a 2019 study saying Instagram makes body image issues worse for one in three teenage girls.  "Sometimes young people come to Instagram dealing with hard things in their lives. I believe Instagram can help many of them in those moments," Mosseri wrote.  "This is something that our research has suggested as well," he added in written testimony prepared for his appearance before a Senate commerce subcommittee.  His statement comes as the social media networks run by Facebook parent Meta battle a crisis fuelled by the company's own research, and which has rekindled a years-old US push for regulation.  The documents leaked by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen also include a 2020 report stating that 32% of teenage girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made it worse.  Facebook has pushed back fiercely against a string of Wall Street Journal reports based on the findings, and a subsequent series for a US media consortium, arguing its research was mischaracterised.  Senators Richard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn are leading the hearing, the latest in a series probing how social media could be making teens feel worse about themselves.  "These half-measures are not enough. Instagram must create tangible solutions to improve safety and data security," Blackburn tweeted ahead of the hearing. 'Never fully safe'Facebook has bounced back from other scandals like the one involving Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm that used the personal data of millions of Facebook users to target political ads.  In that case, CEO Mark Zuckerberg went to Washington to apologise, and the company agreed to a $5 billion settlement with US regulators.  However, the leading social media network faces at least one investigation spurred by the latest crisis: a consortium of US states announced in November a probe of Meta's techniques for enticing young users and the potential resulting harms.  Facing pressure, the company announced in September a "pause" in developing a version of Instagram for kids under 13 as criticism built over the platform's impact on young people's mental health.  On the eve of Wednesday's hearing, Instagram announced new protections for young users like suggesting a break if they have been spending a lot of time on the platform.  The timing of the announcement drew a wary reception from lawmakers, who questioned whether it was an effort at distraction ahead of the hearing.  Stephen Balkam, founder and CEO of advocacy group Family Online Safety Institute, said pre-hearing announcements are a Washington tradition but noted they won't make the app's problems go away.  "Instagram is safer than it was. I think Instagram is less toxic for teens than it was. But it will never be perfect, it will never be fully safe. But then that's true of all social media," he told AFP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/instagram-boss-tells-us-lawmakers-app-can-help-teens/articleshow/88174273.cms||---

---||India||Government accepts demands, farm stir may end soon||NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday agreed in principle to all the suggestions of the protesting farmer unions, including their demand of "unconditional" withdrawal of cases registered against farmers and their supporters, and sent a revised draft proposal that could now set the stage for an announcement of winding up protest sites along Delhi borders possibly on Thursday itself. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) — a joint platform of farmer unions — unanimously agreed on the government's fresh proposal which reached them as an "unsigned" note, and requested the Centre to send a "formal communication signed on the government's letterhead" so that it could take a call on lifting the morchas (protest sites) on Thursday. This would mark the end of the more than year-long agitation. "We have accepted the revised draft given by the Centre over our demands. We will hold a meeting again on Thursday as soon as we receive a formal signed letter from the government and decide accordingly. The protest is currently still under way," said Gurnam Singh Charuni of BKU, Haryana, and Ashok Dhawale of All India Kisan Sabha, two of five leaders assigned by the SKM for discussions over the pending demands. Responding to clarifications sought by the SKM, which on Tuesday rejected the government's initial "conditional" proposal to withdraw the cases provided the farmers end the agitation, the Centre on Wednesday removed the "condition", and said it was agreed that the cases against farmers and their supporters would be withdrawn by UTs (Delhi and Chandigarh) and central agencies such as the railways with immediate effect. "The state governments of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana too have agreed to withdraw the cases with immediate effect... The Centre would even request the states to initiate the process of withdrawal of the cases," said the note. On the mandate of the proposed panel on minimum support price (MSP) on which the unions sought clarifications, the government said the mandate of the committee, having representations from the SKM, other farmer organisations, states and the Centre, would be how to ensure MSP to all farmers. Noting its earlier assurance on MSP, the government also clarified that quantum of the procurement at support price would not be reduced in any state wherever it's currently being done. On the compensation issue, where the unions wanted the government to follow the model of the Punjab government to provide financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh each to kin of the farmers reported to have died during the protests and government job to one of the family members of the deceased, the note said the governments of UP and Haryana have, in principle, agreed to this suggestion. Even on the issue of the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, the Centre clarified that the proposed legislation would not be introduced in Parliament without discussing it with SKM. Though the government's revised draft proposal continued to be silent on the demand that pertains to the arrest and dismissal of Union junior home minister Ajay Mishra on the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, SKM leaders said they would discuss the issue while taking a call on suspending the protests on Thursday. Issuing a formal statement on the government's revised draft proposal, the protesting farmer unions said, "A consensus has been arrived at within SKM accepting the proposal. Now, a formal communication signed on the government's letterhead is awaited. SKM will meet again at noon on Thursday at Singhu Border to take a formal decision thereafter to lift the morchas."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-accepts-demands-farm-stir-may-end-soon/articleshow/88174335.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||India||Stopped man from disrupting Ayodhya case: Ranjan Gogoi||NEW DELHI: Had an unnamed person not been denied entry into the courtroom on October 16, 2019, the day on which the Supreme Court reserved its verdict in the fiercely-contested Ayodhya land dispute case, the hearing may have been disrupted and the unanimous 5-0 historic verdict in favour of the Ram Temple might not have been delivered on November 9, 2019. This hitherto unrevealed incident that had the potential to sabotage the Ayodhya land dispute proceedings before a constitution bench, which lasted for 40 days since it commenced on August 6, 2019, has been unveiled by ex-CJI and now Rajya Sabha MP Ranjan Gogoi in his autobiography ‘Justice for the Judge’, released Wednesday by another former CJI, S A Bobde. Gogoi reveals that the person, identified in the book as a representative of one of the litigants, was denied entry into the courtroom on his (Justice Gogoi’s) instructions as he sensed that "his objective was not well-intended but aimed at disrupting the hearing". Justice Gogoi retired on November 17, 2019. The SC had decided 21 appeals, which challenged the 2010 Allahabad High Court’s Ayodhya verdict that had divided the plot three-ways, and a large number of intervention applications. "Had he been able to do that (gain entry into the courtroom), the court proceedings would have been affected and the case may have had to be adjourned," the author said. Like the unanimous Ayodhya verdict, which unprecedentedly did not reveal the name of the judgment author, Justice Gogoi did not reveal the identity of the man. "I will never reveal his identity," he told TOI. In his book, Justice Gogoi narrates the incident with all details except the name of the person. An hour and half into the hearing on the last day of arguments before the bench also comprising Justices S A Bobde (who succeeded Justice Gogoi as CJI), D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer, CJI Gogoi says he had received a note "at about 11.30am or 12 noon" from then secretary general (Sanjeev Kalgaonkar) stating that a representative of one of the litigants was seeking permission to enter the SC. "I sent a handwritten reply to the Secretary General saying that under no circumstances was the person to be allowed entry. A bona fide visitor to the SC in connection with his case is always entitled to a visitor’s pass through his advocate-on-record. Since this person was approaching the Registry or the secretary general for the entry, I sensed that his objective was not well-intended but aimed at disrupting the hearing," Justice Gogoi writes. "Had he been able to do that (gain entry into the courtroom), the court proceedings would have been affected and the case may have had to be adjourned. The secretary general acted as he was instructed," he says. But the unidentified man appeared to have kept on renewing his request for entry into the courtroom, he adds. Justice Gogoi reveals, "During the lunch recess, he (the secretary general) sought further instructions. I enquired whether he could maintain the status quo (keeping the man away from the courtroom) for another two hours. He assured me that he could. The hearing resumed at 2 o’clock and a little after three, I closed the hearing by saying ‘enough is enough’ and ‘judgment is reserved’. This is how the hearing of one of the longest disputes in legal history and one of the most fiercely contested cases in the Supreme Court came to an end." Justice Gogoi says, though he maintained a calm exterior during the stressful and surcharged arguments lasting months, it caused much of internal "stress, anxiety and trauma" and he twice refused to go to court. He said his wife Rupanjai, with whom he shared his discomfiture and stress, had persuaded him to go to court. On the second occasion, though she urged him to attend court, he refused to go to "budge from the chamber" after reaching the court. Justice Bobde called off the hearing, citing the CJI was unwell. Another cause for the distress for the judges during Ayodhya hearing was publishing of "negative statements by activists and lawyers on one or other unrelated issue", which Justice Gogoi surmises was "perhaps to disturb the peace which was required to decide a case of such magnitude". The continuous hearing and an unanimous verdict took a toll on Justice Gogoi, who writes, "I do not remember getting more than three to four hours of daily sleep during the entire period of the Ayodhya hearing. Negative comments on the feasibility of completion of hearing; statements by activists about the misplaced priority of the SC in taking up the case and wasting judicial time and, to top it all, the Damocles’ sword-like deadlines for completion of the different stages of the case kept reminding me what was at stake, the consequences to me and the institution, and its reputation if the case was to remain inconclusive before my retirement." "Even some of my colleagues were highly skeptical. Why has this madman put the reputation of the Supreme Court at stake, was the topic of several private conversations amongst the judges. But, the way things progressed and ended convinced me that there was a divine force which made the conclusion of the case, regardless of the way the judgment went, possible," he wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stopped-man-from-disrupting-ayodhya-case-gogoi/articleshow/88174419.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Now battling for life in the military hospital at Wellington in Tamil Nadu, the IAF officer had survived a life-threatening emergency while flying the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft in October last year. A Shaurya Chakra, the country’s third-highest gallantry medal, was conferred on him on Independence Day this year for his quick-thinking and actions during the emergency. At that time, he had little inkling that another tough test for survival awaited him just a few months away. Group Captain Singh was on board the ill-fated chopper as he was the liaison officer for the visit of chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat to the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington. He’s currently posted as an instructor there. His gallantry medal came when he was a Wing Commander with the Tejas fighter squadron of the IAF. He was on a test sortie on the newly-inducted Tejas jet on October 20 last year to check out the aircraft’s “flight control system and pressurisation system”. But while flying at a high altitude, the fighter’s pressurisation system failed. Group Captain managed to identify the problem and initiated descent to a lower altitude for landing. But more challenges awaited him. During descent, the flight control system failed as well, leading to a total loss of control of the aircraft. The aircraft lost altitude rapidly, and even as it was pitching up and down viciously, Group Captain regained control. This also happened a second time but instead of abandoning the aircraft and ejecting, he chose to bring it under control and land it safely. This action of his, said his Shaurya Chakra citation, “allowed an accurate analysis of the fault on the indigenously designed fighter and further institution of preventive measures against recurrence”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iaf-man-battling-for-life-cheated-death-last-year/articleshow/88174450.cms||Rajat Pandit

In a letter to states and Union territories, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan asked them to ensure no cross-infection takes place and adequate precautions are taken to prevent Omicron’s transmission to other patients and healthcare workers. The Centre also stressed the need to regularly review and ensure that samples of Covid-positive international travellers and their contacts as well from people in emerging hotspots are promptly submitted to INSACOG laboratories for genome sequencing, according to protocol. It is imperative that states and UTs follow a mission mode and work with a focused approach in quickly tracking primary and secondary contacts of positive cases and facilitate their testing, Bhushan said. It is critical to track all contacts of such cases and quarantine them, he added. Community surveillance should be prioritised to follow up positive cases, as well as their contacts, on a daily basis to monitor their clinical status and keep a check on symptoms, the letter said. “International travellers, who have arrived in the community, also need to be monitored by district surveillance teams and their testing on eighth day needs to be ensured if they have come from ‘at-risk’ countries,” it said. States and UTs have also been advised to undertake increased surveillance for detecting unusual events such as new clusters of Covid-positive cases and breakthrough and reinfection cases. Bhushan suggested states and UTs utilise the ‘eSanjeevani’ telemedicine platform and call centers, and plan home visits by special teams to contact those under home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/earmark-separate-isolation-areas-for-omicron-hit-govt/articleshow/88174555.cms||---

Bipin Rawat, his wife and several others to crash in Coonoor, the Nilgiris hill station in Tamil Nadu, aviation experts said, though official word on the reason for Wednesday’s fatal accident is awaited. They said chances of technical faults are remote because it was a planned flight with VIP passengers. "The helicopter is capable of flying in bad weather, but the terrain was hilly and it appears to have fallen from a low altitude," an expert said. Read AlsoMi-17 With Gen Rawat, his wife, 12 others goes down in Nilgiris; just 1 survivorThe country’s first Chief of Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, his wife Madhulika Rawat, a serving brigadier and 10 more defence personnel died in an IAF helicopter crash in hilly terrain and foggy conditions near Coonoor, in Tamil Nadu’s Nilgiris district, on Wednesday afternoon. Group CaptainVisibility may have dropped considerably because of foggy conditions or low clouds over Coonoor around 11.30am on Wednesday. According to the IMD, Coonoor reported 4mm rainfall till 8.30am on Wednesday and the maximum temperature during the day was 19ºC. “We had forecast light to moderate rainfall in hill stations. Only for the plains we had forecast mist or fog. It is difficult to forecast fog for valleys and hilly terrain because both satellite and radar cannot capture that. Fog conditions can be reported only by seeing it. Even then it is difficult to differentiate between fog and low clouds. Local observatory reports fog upon observation,” said N Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, IMD Chennai.

While the exact cause behind the crash is not known yet, official sources said the accident may have happened due to poor visibilityExperts said fog appears as a cloud near ground level, reducing visibility. Fog usually forms at a relative humidity of about 100% that may occur when there is increased moisture in the air or when the temperature is decreasing. IMD officials said they were not asked for local weather conditions during VIP movement to Wellington and IAF has its own facility to track weather. “They don’t share weather conditions or forecasts from their area either,” an official said. Skymet Weather chief meteorologist Mahesh Palawat said Coonoor had shallow fog and cloudy weather on Wednesday morning (8.30am) and dense fog with nearly no visibility at 5.30pm. “There could be shallow fog or low clouds during the day,” he said. No May Day call before crash, says Coimbatore ATCIn contact with destination control.” That was the last message from the pilot of the Mi-17V5 to Coimbatore ATC before the aircraft changed over to the defence ATC around five minutes from landing at the Wellington base on Wednesday. The changeover happened at around 4,000 ft, before it crashed, reports V Ayappan. Coimbatore ATC sources said there was no May Day call, which is usually transmitted on open VHF frequency for all to hear. Only rarely do they transmit such calls for help on an exclusive emergency frequency, said an official. “The helicopter was supposed to return within 10 minutes of dropping off the passengers,” the official said. The chopper’s movement was not tracked on radar because Coimbatore does not have one that can map low-altitude flights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/poor-visibility-not-technical-fault-likely-crash-cause/articleshow/88174579.cms||U Tejonmayam
---||World||Biden signs order to make US government carbon-neutral by 2050||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order to make the federal government carbon-neutral by 2050, aiming for a 65% reduction in planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and an all-electric fleet of car and trucks five years later.  The White House said the order shows how the government will "leverage its scale and procurement power to lead by example in tackling the climate crisis". The order will reduce emissions across federal operations, as part of a government-wide effort to confront climate change.  "As the single largest land owner, energy consumer and employer in the nation, the federal government can catalyze private-sector investment and expand the economy and American industry by transforming how we build, buy and manage electricity, vehicles, buildings and other operations to be clean and sustainable,'' the order said.  It directs that government buildings use 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030; that the US fleet of cars and trucks become all-electric by 2035; and that federal contracts for goods and services be carbon-free by 2050.  Government buildings should be carbon-free by 2045, including a 50% emissions cut by 2032, Biden said.  The executive action is a part of Biden's commitment to support the growth of clean energy and clean technology industries, while accelerating US progress toward achieving a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035, the White House said in a statement.  Through the executive order, the government will transform its portfolio of 300,000 buildings, fleet of 600,000 cars and trucks and annual purchasing power of $650 billion in goods and services to achieve net-zero emissions over the next three decades, the White House said.  "The United States government will lead by example to provide a strong foundation for American businesses to compete and win globally in the clean energy economy while creating well paying, union jobs at home,'' the statement said.  Environmental groups generally hailed the order as a positive step, although some questioned the 30-year time frame to achieve net-zero emissions.  The order sets "a bold benchmark for electricity procurement" and puts the government's "immense buying power to work advancing critical carbon-free technologies," said Lindsey Baxter Griffith, federal policy director of the Clean Air Task Force, an advocacy group.  "We're pleased to see the US federal government, which is the largest electricity purchaser in the nation, focus on fully decarbonising electricity (and) investing in solutions that will work across our grid every hour of every day,'' Griffith said.  But to Bill Snape, a lawyer at the Center for Biological Diversity, another environmental group, "2050 is an extremely weak goal for the federal government to free itself from climate-heating pollution."  The order "ignores existing technology" and adds decades to a commitment by the General Services Administration, which oversees government purchasing and real estate, to move to 100% renewable energy by 2025, Snape said.  "This is like a teenager promising to clean their room in 30 years. We need action now,'' he said.  The White House said the order should make federal agencies more resilient to the effects of climate change and increase the sustainability of supply chains, lessening future disruptions of and damage to federal operations, assets and programs.  On electricity, the White House said the government will work with utilities, developers, technology companies, financiers and others to purchase electricity produced from sources that generate no carbon emissions, including solar and wind, for all its operations by 2030.  The move to zero-emission vehicles "will accelerate the advancement of America's industrial capacity to supply zero-emission vehicles and electric vehicle batteries and create and sustain good union jobs in manufacturing, engineering and skilled-trades,'' the White House said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-signs-order-to-make-us-government-carbon-neutral-by-2050/articleshow/88174660.cms||---
---||India||Govt claims of India’s economic recovery hollow: Sonia Gandhi||NEW DELHI: Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday accused the government of being in denial on price rise and “impervious to the suffering of the people”, as she said claims of economic recovery were hollow and the mere fact that stock markets have risen or profit to select big companies could not be its indicator. She also demanded a full-fledged discussion on the challenges faced on the borderas she charged the government with evading a debate in Parliament on the issue to avoid uncomfortable questions. Addressing the Congress parliamentary party, Sonia said, “I can’t understand how and why the Modi government is so insensitive and continues to deny the seriousness of the problem (price rise). Prices of edible oils, pulses and vegetables are burning a hole in the monthly budget of every household. The rising prices of cement, steel and other basic industrial commodities also don’t bode well for economic recovery.” She said the Centre’s decision to reduce the price of fuel was inadequate since it had passed on the responsibility for duty cuts to the cash-strapped states, even as it spends massive amounts on “vain glorious projects”, an apparent reference to the Central Vista project. Sonia said Modi government first destroyed the economy with demonetisation and was now selling off precious national assets like banks, insurance companies and railways and airports, and PSUs built over 70 years. She said employment of SCs and STs was a big concern given the fast privatisation of public sector. She said the government’s claims of economic recovery are misleading as millions have lost livelihoods and MSMEs are crippled, because of its policies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-claims-of-indias-economic-recovery-hollow-sonia-gandhi/articleshow/88174664.cms||---

IAF needs to be rapidly modernised, expand its fleet and improve indigenous manufacturing capabilities,” the Air chief said at a seminar conducted by the Centre for Air Power Studies. Chaudhari said it should be made clear to the world that today’s India has the capability and the will to respond at a level that the nation deems appropriate. The Air Chief Marshal said that China’s hegemonic and entrapping policies can provide opportunities for India to leverage in trade and military domains. He also asserted that India has demonstrated its capabilities during a standoff on the northern border while simultaneously handling the national Covid-19 response. “In future, we could be attacked from all fronts, starting from economic strangulation to diplomatic isolation and military stand-offs to information blackouts, in the form of attack by a distributed denial of services.

You all should keep this in mind that no other political outfit, except BJP, could have done this,” said Yogi, adding that he had fulfilled his 2017 promise on the Ayodhya issue. In Hindu pilgrimage centre to inaugurate a slew of welfare projects worth over Rs 200 crore, his remark on Ram mandir was made in the town that is considered to be Krishna’s birthplace even as a controversy is brewing amid demands recently for a ‘Krishna janambhoomi temple’ in Mathura. On December 6, UP cabinet minister Chaudhary Laxmi Narayan Singh asked, rhetorically, that if a Krishna temple won’t be built in Mathura, will it be made in Lahore or Rawalpindi. That had come a day after the BJP MP from Ballia Ravindra Kushwaha had said, “When the Modi government can repeal the farm laws keeping in mind protests by farmers, it can also withdraw Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 to pave way for construction of a temple at Krishna janambhoomi in Mathura.” Yogi also targeted Samajwadi Party and said while there is a government now that “has faith and respects devotees of Lord Ram, on the other there is a party which opened fire on them”, a reference to the police firing on kar sevaks in Ayodhya in 1990 when SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav was CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/keep-in-mind-who-built-ram-mandir-yogi-in-mathura/articleshow/88174827.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The Mi-17V5 hit a huge tree, crashed into a gorge in the jungle, and burst into flames. The villagers of Nanjappa Chathram, closest to the crash site near Kattery, ran towards the spot and found a mangled helicopter with charred bodies inside. Three people with severe burns were lying unconscious outside the aircraft. Helicopter sorties rarely arouse any curiosity in these parts as residents are used to seeing them fly in and out of Wellington, a nearby cantonment that has the Defence Services Staff College. “We did not pay much attention when the helicopter flew over the spot. But when the whirring noise stopped all of a sudden, we realised something was amiss and rushed out of the house,’’ an elderly woman said. For the next four hours, the locality turned into a war zone with a rush of ambulances, fire engines and army vehicles. More than 200 personnel from defence, health, police, and fire services reached the spot for a coordinated rescue. Not everyone was aware that CDS Gen. Bipin Rawat and his wife were on the flight. Power supply was suspended to the locality and the place cordoned off as rescue teams started bringing body after charred body from the gorge about 200m away. There was panic, but residents rose to the occasion and joined the rescue effort. They scurried up and down the stone steps and through the muddy mountain terrain to bring water in pots to douse the fire. The Coonoor government hospital was alerted and health teams told to be ready. The corpses were taken to Wellington military hospital, where shock and grief were written on most defence personnel’s face. More than 20 ambulances from across Nilgiris district were mobilised and sent to the crash spot. Ambulances and health workers were brought from neighbouring Coimbatore district as well. Specialist doctors in Coimbatore were kept on standby. As news of the crash spread, security was tightened across Coonoor to prevent people from dashing to the spot. Private vehicles were denied entry at Mettupalayam from 1 pm. Vehicles moving from Coonoor towards Mettupalayam were diverted through Kotagiri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/copters-noise-stopped-suddenly-we-realised-something-was-amiss/articleshow/88174855.cms||Shantha Thiagarajan

She was produced before the special NIA court on Wednesday, a day after the Supreme Court upheld the Bombay HC’s order granting default bail to her last week. Imposing about 16 conditions, the special NIA judge said she must furnish cash security of Rs 50,000. “She shall reside within the jurisdiction of this court. She shall not leave the jurisdiction of this court at Mumbai on being released on bail, without permission of this court,” special judge DE Kothalikar said. The court also said Bharadwaj has to attend trial regularly and it should not be delayed due to her. Bharadwaj was brought before the court at around 11.35 am. She smiled as she met her lawyer in court. Her daughter too was present. As the procedures at the sessions court were completed only before 6 pm, the jail could not process her release before its deadline. Last week, the HC had directed she be produced before the special NIA court so that it can set her bail amount and conditions. The special NIA court also said that she is to submit a list of at least three blood relatives with their detailed residential and work addresses and documentary proof of showing the correctness of the details produced by her. The court also said she is not to make any statement regarding the proceedings pending before the court, in any form of media. Bharadwaj’s advocate Yug Chaudhary, however, opposed this and said that her fundamental rights should not be stifled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/elgar-case-3-years-on-bharadwaj-likely-to-walk-out-of-jail-today/articleshow/88174875.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The Upper House also passed the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2020 with amendments, aimed at providing a legal framework to curb unethical practices in reproductive services as well as safeguard interest of women. ART Bill, which was passed by Lok Sabha earlier this month, will keep a check on in vitro fertilisation, embryo transfers and sperm banks — another set of infertility related services and industry that is mushrooming rapidly in the country. The bill also prohibits sex selection and sex determination. The Surrogacy Bill now has provisions to allow “willing woman” instead of “close relative” to become a surrogate mother, and proposes that widows and divorced women can also benefit from its provisions, besides infertile Indian couples.The proposed insurance cover for a surrogate mother has been increased to 36 months from 16 months earlier. The bill aims to regulate surrogacy while prohibiting commercial surrogacy. The proposed surrogacy bill was earlier passed by Lok Sabha, but Rajya Sabha had referred it to a select committee. It will now go back to Lok Sabha for approval. Replying to a discussion on both the bills taken up together, health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said most of the recommendations of the select committee have been incorporated in the surrogacy bill. Both the bills seek to curb unethical practices related to issues like sex selection and exploitation of surrogate mothers. The provisions include both monetary penalty as well as jail terms for violations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/assisted-reproductive-tech-bill-gets-parliamentary-nod/articleshow/88174894.cms||---

Ruling out any stringent curbs, Bommai said in some districts Covid-19 cases are on the rise while in others, the situation is under control. "The Centre has also given guidelines. Everything will be taken into consideration while taking a call on new guidelines," he added. The cabinet, sources added, will primarily focus on protocols for management of the pandemic and treatment of people infected with the new variant and not on imposing any kind of curbs for now. "I sought details about the Covid situation in various districts and clusters, primary and secondary contacts of new variant Omicron cases, standard protocol being followed for management and treatment of Omicron cases in various countries. These will be placed before the cabinet and fresh guidelines will be issued," Bommai said. Experts at the meeting chaired by Bommai also suggested that curbs like night curfew, restrictions of mass gatherings or movement of people should not be imposed now as the prevailing situation doesn't warrant such severe steps. The need of the hour is to focus on management that includes ramping up testing, quarantining positive cases, tracking their contacts, experts reportedly advised the government. The meeting also discussed financial needs to tackle the pandemic till March 2022. "The expenditure incurred by BBMP, health and revenue departments for oxygen units, labs and other essentials for Covid management during the second wave and clearance of pending payments were also discussed," the CM added. Earlier, he asked parents not to panic though cases were emerging in schools and hostels. "There is no need to panic, especially parents. Children have to be cautious and schools and colleges have been asked to strictly abide by Covid-19 norms," he added. The government has already allowed entry to malls, cinema halls and commercial complexes only to those who have taken two vaccine doses. It has also been made compulsory for parents of schoolchildren to have taken two doses for their wards to attend offline classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/cases-inch-up-ktaka-set-to-decide-new-guidelines-today/articleshow/88176207.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||AI cameras at KSR Bengaluru City railway station will see through your mask||BENGALURU: Last month, a 41- year-old mentally disturbed woman went missing from east Bengaluru. The Railway Protection Force (RPF)’s control room in Bengaluru division received an alert and photograph of the woman at 11.35pm from a group of citizens. At 11.47pm, RPF personnel managed to trace the woman who was wearing a full-mask at KSR Bengaluru City railway station. The swift tracking happened with the help of AI-enabled face-recognition cameras. “We could trace her in just 12 minutes. In fact, relatives of the woman were also surprised that we could find her in such a short time,” said a RPF official. For the past nine months, a trial run of recognition cameras was on at the station. South Western Railway (SWR) officials said a full-fledged launch of the Rs 2.4- crore project will be held from next month. “We have installed 120 of the 150 AI-enabled cameras. We could identify 43 criminals in the last nine months through this system. We’ll install them at 18 more stations in Bengaluru division,” said a senior SWR official. A TOI report, ‘KSR, Yeshwantpur railway stations to get face-recognition cameras’ (May 6, 2019), had highlighted the plan. While facemasks are mandatory in public places after Covid-19, SWR officials said these cameras will detect people with masks too. Face-recognition cameras will recognise the face of a repeat offender/wanted persons involved in human trafficking, child kidnapping, smuggling, terrorist activities and other cases, then alert in cases of overcrowding stations, unclaimed baggage/objects, keep track of those who frequent ticket counters, including touts. “We never anticipated that all will have to wear face-masks. But we had thought of people entering the station covering their faces, using sunglasses or hats and other scenarios, so it has come handy now,” said an official. Asked about privacy concerns, another official said: “We’re not storing any data. We’re just matching faces in the database to records. In fact, most airports also have face-recognition cameras. Only criminals need to worry about this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ai-cameras-at-ksr-station-will-see-through-your-mask/articleshow/88174896.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

Divya BB, a resident of Hosa Road, told police the duo asked her to hold the baby while the bus was proceeding towards Majestic. Divya said she, along with software engineer-husband Kiran Kumar, were heading to KSR railway station. When the bus was nearing Madiwala around 7.40pm, two women aged between 25 and 30 years, boarded it. One of them asked the seated Divya to hold the baby and a couple of minutes later, she dropped a coin and pretended to search for it. The other woman joined in and Divya helped the duo with her iPhone mobile torch. The duo got down near Forum Mall in Koramangala. Divya later noticed her jewellery box was missing when she tried to keep her phone back in the bag. Siddapura police registered a case of theft and cheating against the two women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/2-women-distract-homemaker-in-bmtc-bus-flee-with-gold/articleshow/88174897.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||With 5% GST, app-based auto rides to get costlier||BENGALURU: With regular autoricks-haws often demanding excess fare or refusing to ply, many commuters prefer relying on app-based auto aggregators like Ola, Uber, Rapido and Quick Ride. This despite many of these aggregators charging convenience fee or access fee up to Rs 50 above the government-fixed fare. However, autorickshaw rides booked through app-based platforms are likely to get costlier from the New Year with the Centre deciding to impose 5% GST on such rides booked online from January 1. In fact, app-based aggregator Uber on Wednesday demanded a reconsideration of the move. In a statement, an Uber spokesperson said: “The Centre has announced it will levy a 5% GST on auto rides booked online from January 1, ending an existing exemption. Auto rides hailed on the streets will continue to be GST-free. While we appreciate the need for the government to collect revenues, we urge it to reconsider this tax, which will end up hurting the earnings of auto drivers as well as the government’s digitisation agenda.” “We urge the government to reinstate the GST exemption for online auto products in the ride-sharing industry to ensure riders, drivers and cities can keep benefiting from the growth,” he added. The Centre’s GST move has evoked mixed reviews. Narayan Balaji, a netizen, wrote on Twitter: “Already the personal public transport is in doldrums with fuel & associated costs rising by the day with escalating cost of essentials for survival. Vikas at whose cost? ” Ravi Gadepalli, an urban mobility expert, said: “More than GST, I think aggregators are worried they will now need to share trip-wise revenue data with the government, the lack of which helps vagueness in their policy and governance.” Aravind Sanka, co-founder, Rapido, in a statement said: “With the new policy being initiated by the government, the impact on the overall ride-hailing business would be rather adverse for both drivers and riders. ...This policy might lower the rate of consumers opting for auto rides, further making commuting less feasible and hassle-free.” The Uber spokesperson said: “...This tax will lead to a rise in platform fares and a corresponding drop in demand...” “As demand shifts to street hail, revenue from GST applied selectively to online bookings is likely to be marginal, at best,” he added. Other operators, including Ola and Quick Ride, weren’t available for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/with-5-gst-app-based-auto-rides-to-get-costlier/articleshow/88174898.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||NIA court grants bail to 6 in int’l trafficking case||Bengaluru: A special court for National Investigation Agency (NIA) here recently granted conditional bail to six accused arrested in an alleged international human-trafficking case.  In October, NIA filed a chargesheet against the six accused from Tamil Nadu — Dhinakaran alias Ayya, 66, Kasi Viswanathan, 39, both from Madurai district, Rasool, 31, Saddam Hussain alias Satham Ushen, 24, and Abdul Moidu, 53, from Ramanathapuram district and Socrates from Thoothukudi. The accused allegedly lured Sri Lankan nationals with the promise of emigration to Canada and confined them in different places in India between February and April 2021. After being tipped off by Tamil Nadu police, Mangaluru city police arrested nearly 38 Sri Lankan nationals in June this year on charges of illegally staying in the country by claiming to be daily-wage workers and fishermen from Tamil Nadu. The case was transferred to the NIA in July.The court, in its order granting them bail, stated: “The 38 Sri Lankan nationals who were initially shown as accused persons were later treated as victims and the allegations of human trafficking by the accused persons are yet to be proved by the prosecution in the trial.” According to the prosecution, the main suspect, Eashan of Sri Lanka, was the key conspirator in the case and was assisted by his associates in Tamil Nadu. Eashan had allegedly paid money to the gang to shift the Sri Lankan nationals from Tamil Nadu to Mangaluru. Initially, Mangaluru police received information about 25 Sri Lankan nationals being illegally kept at a guesthouse without any passport or visa. The accused had brought them to Mangaluru after promising them jobs in Canada. The 38 Sri Lankan nationals revealed they were lured by the agents, who promised to send them to Canada for better prospects. The agents reportedly received 3.5 to 10 lakh Sri Lankan rupees from each of them and collected up to 1.8 crore as advance for documentation and other purposes. However, defence counsel argued that all six had been accused in a similar human-trafficking case registered in Tamil Nadu and were granted bail. Considering investigation in the current case was complete, their detention at this stage wasn’t necessary, they contended.The judge, Kasanappa Naik, granted conditional bail to the accused in two separate petitions disposed of on November 27 and December 6, respectively.As per bail conditions, the accused shouldn’t tamper with prosecution witnesses in any manner and should mark their attendance before the office of NIA, Bengaluru, once a fortnight for a period of six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/nia-court-grants-bail-to-6-in-intl-trafficking-case/articleshow/88174899.cms||Santosh kumar.B

Subhash Pandi was found hanging from the window grill with his belt on November 27. On December 6, the youth’s father, Pandian, filed a police complaint against MRR Rehabilitation Centre at Mangammanapalya. Pandian, an autorickshaw driver, told police personnel that they admitted Subhash to the rehabilitation centre six months ago on the advise of one of his relatives. The management had told him not to visit the centre till Subhash got deaddicted. But on November 27, the staff called Subhash’s aunt and told her to rush to the centre. “We went there and found Pandi hanging. Police untied the knot and handed over the body to us after a postmortem. We learnt that the rehabilitation centre’s owner Raghavendra and his staff Bharath were assaulting and harassing my son. He took the extreme step due to their harassment,” Pandian said. Suddaguntepalya police have registered a case of abetment to suicide under IPC section 306 and probe is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/mans-suicide-parents-file-plaint-against-rehab-centre/articleshow/88174900.cms||---

Police are looking for four of his accomplices, suspected to be in Kerala. MR Anoop lived in a rented house at Sahakarnagar, Hebbal, for over a year and is a native of Kottayam, Kerala. “The house was rented in another person’s name for Rs 15,000 a month. The kingpin, who is from Kottayam, arranged the house for Anoop and paid the rent,” an officer. “Two of Anoop’s associates, who are elusive now, were arrested in December last year on drug-peddling charges. Cops had then seized 214kg of ganja worth around Rs 60 lakh from them. The two were also booked by Udupi and Mangaluru police on similar charges,” sources said. Anoop and his aides would bring hashish oil from Kottayam on bus or train. “They would bring in bulk and pack the oil into small sachets weighing between 1 gram and 10 grams. The sachets were sold at parties,” another officer said. DCP (northeast) CK Baba said they probed for more than a month before zeroing in on the accused. “We caught Anoop red-handed under Hebbal flyover on December 4 evening when he was trying to sell hashish oil. Then we raided his house in Sahakarnagar and recovered 11kg of the oil. A team will leave for Kerala to look for the other accused, including the kingpin,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/peddler-from-kerala-held-11kg-hashish-oil-seized/articleshow/88174901.cms||---

In her complaint, the doctor said: “Two dogs were injured in the attack. The guard chased the third one and hit it with a stone. His act has been captured on CCTV cameras.” She, however, refused to speak to TOI about the complaint. An investigating officer said trouble begun when the doctor started feeding the stray dogs and neighbours took objection to it. “Accustomed to the meals, the dogs would come near her house regularly. Neighbours would shoo them away, fearing they’d bite. This led to an altercation on December 5. The security guard has been identified as Bahadur and we will summon him by tomorrow (Thursday),” the officer said.

---||Bengaluru||KEA seeks Karnataka govt nod for third round of counselling in January||BENGALURU: The Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA), which has already completed the first round of counselling and kickstarted the process for the second round, has now written to the state government seeking its nod to conduct a third round of counselling in January. Usually, the second round of counselling for engineering seats is held after the first round of seat-selection process for medicine. This is done to ensure students get a better chance at engineering seats in the second round, as candidates who prefer medicine get to choose medical seats earlier. However, this time, NEET counselling is yet to begin because a hearing on the upper limit of the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota is under way in the Supreme Court. With the next hearing scheduled for January 6, officials feel that counselling for undergraduate students will happen only after that of postgraduate candidates and is, therefore, likely only by January. “Visvesvaraya Technological University has announced its academic calender. According to it, first-year classes will start by December 13. If we were to delay the second round of counselling further, students will not get sufficient time for first semester before exams begin in April,” said an official from KEA. There was also an order from the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to complete engineering admissions by November 30, which the state couldn’t adhere to. “We usually do one round of NEET counselling before the second round of CET (engineering). With this, those engineering seats which become vacant when a student goes for medicine become available for meritorious students. This has been the practice for many years. Karnataka has a large number of medical seats and it is likely that a lot of seats can go vacant in engineering when students leave for medicine,” she said.  “...We waited for some time to see if we can accommodate NEET this time too. But since the case has gone till January, this couldn’t be done. We have, therefore, written to the government to accommodate the admissions done till December 16 and also have one more casual round in January,” the official explained. Around 11,000 students have reported to colleges they have been allotted in the first round of counselling. This is of the total 61,000 seats that were allotted. Others are waiting for better options before confirming seats, which is in sync with the usual trend, said the KEA. KEA announced the second round of counselling this week and students have been given the option to modify the dates from Tuesday. The results of the second round are expected on December 10. The last date of reporting to colleges is December 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/kea-seeks-govt-nod-for-3rd-round-of-counselling-in-jan/articleshow/88174904.cms||---

Once that is done, we’ll start using the facility,” said Sivan, who had earlier told TOI that the space agency is looking to inaugurate the ad hoc training facility in December. The syllabus for astronaut training will be vast, focusing on areas like crew module, orbital module, redundancies, where various items will be in the module, orbital distance, technical and theoretical systems, humidity and temperature, et al. The faculty panel, on the other hand, has reputed members from institutions like IAM, IISc, IIT, former astronauts like Rakesh Sharma, and some former Isro directors/deputy directors.For practical training that would follow the theory classes, Isro is working on commissioning three types of simulators, including the final one that will be the crew module simulator with internal settings, ECLS (environment control and life support) systems, etc.All these will be installed at the training facility here, which will be hosting at least three types of simulators and other training facilities. “Once the facility is ready, even theory classes may move there,” another source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/astronaut-elects-kickstart-training/articleshow/88174906.cms||---

Once heavily dependent upon NIC, the technology firm which is run by the ministry of information technology, Karnataka found that the central agency was unable to scale up their manpower and provide quick solutions for the state administration. “While the government never expressed its concerns, NIC’s inability to scale up operations had become a concern. As a result of this, CSG was founded as a dedicated technological arm of the state government,” said a senior e-Governance department official. With pending projects and burgeoning requirements of the state government, CSG started to fill the shoes of NIC whenever it was called upon. “We had several pending projects, and required a dedicated source for our own projects. From education to crop insurance repayments and from upgrading the land records system to providing technical assistance for our investigations, we required quick resolutions. CSG has fulfilled these requirements,” said another senior IAS officer, who is presently using the software provided by the state-owned tech company. So much so, that CSG has provided solutions to even Ponzi scheme repayments to investors, including the I-Monetary Advisory (IMA) and the Guru Raghavendra Co-operative Bank scam. With a startup capital of Rs 10 crore, raised from various foundations and grants given by the government of India for specific projects, the company has been registered as a “not-for-profit” entity. “CSG is in fact registered as a society for providing basic infrastructure for governance. Our core mandate was to develop e-Governance solutions for the governments,” said Sunil Panwar, executive director for the organisation and an IFS officer. Today, CSG has transformed itself into a success story with over 30 projects cutting across 18 state government departments being implemented and another 20 more in the pipeline. From traditional requirements like .NET core to Java etc., to providing technological solutions under emerging areas like Blockchain, cloud computing, etc., the company has become the “most preferred” subsidiary for the Karnataka government for “not so expensive” technological resolution. In fact, the Karnataka government has given the company a free reign to even approach other governments in adjoining states for their requirements and increase its own revenue generation. CSG today employs around 230 people, including primarily software developers, computer engineers and senior management and is also planning to expand further with more additions. “We intend to increase our staff strength to about 400 by the end of the fiscal year,” said one employee of the company. The company has now raised capital to lease out an entire 28,000 sq ft area at the Yeshwantpur transport terminal and converted it into a 400-seater office. While salaries have been lower than other startups and software firms in the state, the government firm has now realised the disparity and even increased its cap by 35 per cent and on par with most IT solution firms. “As an organisation we want to ensure that our atmosphere is more employee-centric; we have emphasised on gender diversity as well with flexible working conditions, maternity benefit, etc. This year, of the 15 per cent employees promoted, 70 per cent were women,” claimed Panwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnatakas-tech-arm-scales-up-is-part-of-30-projects-across-18-depts/articleshow/88174907.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

The Bengaluru cueist, who turned 25 two weeks ago, dethroned Amee Kamani 3-1 to annex the senior women’s National billiards crown in Bhopal on Wednesday.Known more for her snooker prowess, Varshaa called the shots from the word go against the defending champion, who looked a trifle out of sorts. That seemed to suit the challenger fine as she made capital of Amee’s errors to take a vice-like grip over the proceedings.Having missed out on the 6-red snooker title last week — losing to citymate Vidya Pillai in the final — Varshaa was keen to make amends. The youngster, who is into film production with her first movie set to hit the screens soon, took the first two games of the best-of-five-game final with ease.Just as it looked as if the Bengalurean would run away with the title, Amee dug deep into her reserves to force a comeback. She produced a game-clinching break of 40 with some great potting to reduce the deficit. However, Amee couldn’t carry that momentum forward as errors soon crept into her game. Varshaa, one of the most improved players on the circuit, made capital of her rival’s easy leaves, and combined with some fine in-offs, took the fourth game and with it the title, her maiden senior billiards crown.Result: Final: Varshaa Sanjeev (Kar) bt Amee Kamani (MP) 3-1 (75-32, 75-19, 25-75, 75-45).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/varshaa-wins-billiards-title/articleshow/88174912.cms||---

The call centre staff sent six ambulances before alerting police and fire services, reports Pushpa Narayan. An ambulance stationed at Aruvankadu, 14 km from the crash site, reached the spot at 12.48pm. A few army staff had already reached the area by then. “They directed the paramedics to two people, alive but with severe burn injuries,” said a senior official at the EMRI service. The paramedics said they could not ascertain the identity of the two, but they had 90% burns. By then, five more ambulances with 10 paramedics reached the spot. “They found eight more victims, but none showed any signs of life. The bodies were charred,” a source said. The eight bodies were taken to the Military Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/army-men-led-paramedics-to-2-passengers-still-alive/articleshow/88174913.cms||---
---||Chennai||‘Poor visibility, not technical fault, likely crash cause’||U Tejonmayam & V AyappanChennai: Foggy conditions and poor visibility could be factors that caused the Mi-17 V5 carrying CDS Gen Bipin Rawat, his wife and several others to crash in Coonoor, aviation experts said, though official word on the reason for Wednesday’s fatal accident is awaited.They said chances of technical faults are remote because it was a planned flight with VIP passengers. “The chopper is capable of flying in bad weather, but the terrain was hilly and it appears to have fallen from a low altitude,” an expert said.Visibility may have dropped considerably because of foggy conditions or low clouds over Coonoor around 11.30am on Wednesday. According to the IMD, Coonoor reported 4mm rainfall till 8.30am on Wednesday and the maximum temperature during the day was 19ºC.“We had forecast light to moderate rainfall in hill stations. Only for the plains we had forecast mist or fog. It is difficult to forecast fog for valleys and hilly terrain because both satellite and radar cannot capture that. Fog conditions can be reported only by seeing it. Even then it is difficult to differentiate between fog and low clouds,” said N Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, IMD Chennai.Experts said fog appears as a cloud near ground level, reducing visibility. Fog usually forms at a relative humidity of about 100% that may occur when there is increased moisture in the air or when the temperature is decreasing.IMD officials said they were not asked for local weather conditions during VIP movement to Wellington and the IAF has its own facility to track it. “They don’t share weather conditions or forecasts from their area either,” an official said.Skymet Weather chief meteorologist Mahesh Palawat said Coonoor had shallow fog and cloudy weather on Wednesday morning (8.30am) and dense fog with nearly no visibility at 5.30pm. “There could be shallow fog or low clouds during the day,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/poor-visibility-not-technical-fault-likely-crash-cause/articleshow/88174914.cms||U Tejonmayam

According to the 2021 edition of the Duolingo Language Report, in India, Korean has moved up two places to grab the number five spot among the most popular languages being learned on the app (dislodging German).Driven by the influence of K-pop, K-drama, K-cosmetics, K-fashion, and K-cuisine, Indians – especially those between the ages of 17 and 25 – are responsible for the rise of Korean learning in India (the release of popular TV series Squid Game two months ago has only helped fuel the surge). The report includes learners who studied languages on the app between October 1, 2020 and September 30, 2021.“In Chennai, we now have a waiting list of 150 people for our online Korean language class,” says Rathi Jaffer, Director at InKo Centre, a non-profit exploring Indian and Korean culture. “We just cannot keep up with the demand and are looking to hire more teachers.” Rathi says that earlier, employment opportunities were behind the drive to learn the language, but now it is clearly entertainment. “The profile of students signing up is getting younger,” she adds. “It’s mostly school and college students.” Rupali AS, a biotech student, decided to sign up for Korean classes this September, after binge-watching more than 20 K-dramas over the course of the pandemic. The first thing she wanted to learn how to say was “I love you” (it’s “Saranghae”, she says emphatically). In just a couple of months, she has learned much more than saranghae and says she is a master of all things K-slang – from Aigo (OMG) to Daebak (cool) and more. “My dream is to learn the language and then visit the country,” says the 21-year-old. The Duolingo survey says more than 56% of the respondents, like Rupali, were influenced by pop culture trendsetters including movies, OTT shows and web series."We have witnessed most traction from the 17 to 25 age group, across languages,” says the app’s country marketing manager Karandeep Singh Kapany. Reasons to study a new language varies from professional growth remain to interest in a different culture, staying connected with the community and pursuing a new hobby.Korean is easy to pick up, says Rathi. “In fact, the alphabet and structure were created and popularised by King Sejong in the 15th century as a language meant to unify people. Korean is influenced by several languages,” says Rathi.“I have noticed it is structured a lot like Tamil,” says Rupali. “If you’ve got your Tamil syntax down to the T, K-grammar is a cakewalk.” Daebak!||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/k-drama-craze-drives-korean-up-language-charts/articleshow/88174915.cms||---

---||Chennai||Chennai: Pallavaram Radial road streetlights still unattended||CHENNAI: Damage caused to streetlights and underground utilities along Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam Radial Road during expansion works has remained unattended for months now. The arterial road connecting the airport with the IT corridor along Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) has now become dark and ill-lit, making rides difficult and risky for motorists. Not a single streetlight on a 2-km stretch that was within the erstwhile Pallavaram Municipality and is now under Tambaram Corporation limits is functioning.  The recent rain has worsened the situation, with several potholes forming on the stretch between Pallavaram Bridge and Keelkatalai. Bad maintenance coupled with poor visibility has converted the road into a death-trap, say residents of the area.  Two bikers have died (in single-vehicle crashes) this monsoon season. One of them, a 40-year-old who skidded near Sunnambu Kolathur, was run over by a van. Several minor accidents have also been reported. “Motorists, particularly two-wheeler riders, have no clue about the potholes, bumps or open drains ahead of them,” said V Santhanam, a resident-activist from Chrompet.  Even basic facilities like traffic signals and safe drains are absent and management is poor as hundreds of truckers illegally park their vehicles on the extreme-left lanes on both sides, hampering the free flow of traffic, he said. The highways department started converting the stretch into a six-lane stretch at 35 crore in 2018-19.  A state highways department official said damage to electric cables was inevitable during road expansion. “We have asked the local body to repair it and that we will pay for the repairs,” the official said, requesting anonymity. The Tambaram Corporation has estimated that it would cost 80 lakh to repair the damaged electric cables. Besides this, the highways department has covered 53 manholes along underground sewer lines. It would cost another 40 lakh. Work can resume only when this proposal is approved and funds are sanctioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pallavaram-radial-road-streetlights-still-unattended/articleshow/88174917.cms||Ram Sundaram

During monsoon, after every spell of rain, the subway gets inundated and turns unfit to use for a few days. “The structure itself is wrong, and a complete remodelling is needed. Every year, every monsoon we raise complaints. But officials fix it for short-term relief,” N Balasubramanian of Chitlapakkam said. The subway was opened in 2006, and with trains running above, cracks slowly developed and patches of concrete started falling off revealing the reinforcement inside. “We started seeing leaks by 2015. The floors are slippery and it is unsafe for senior citizens,” said A Selvaraj of East Tambaram. Mercy Grace, supervisor of Tambaram Sanatorium, said a joint report consulting the construction engineer and electrical engineer has been submitted to the higher officials with photographs. “Since, the subway is the only option for the public to board trains and move across, our electrical staff are draining water day and night. This is what can be done for now. Action will be taken as soon as possible,” she added. A long-pending request of the residents have been addressed finally, a foot over bridge is under construction but the work has been stopped because of the showers. It is expected to resume soon. The pedestrian subway needs to be rebuilt and it is a long and complex process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/leaky-tambaram-sanatorium-subway-cries-for-attention/articleshow/88174920.cms||---

---||Chennai||Shahrukh shines to help TN beat Mum||Chennai: Tamil Nadu registered a 54-run win over defending champions Mumbai in their opening game of the Vijay Hazare Trophy at Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday. M Shahrukh Khan’s (66, 35 balls, 6x4, 5x6) blitz helped Tamil Nadu finish on 290-8 before they dismissed Mumbai for 236 thanks to the efforts of left-arm spinner M Siddharth (3-43) and allrounder Washington Sundar (3-60). Mumbai’s main contribution came from skipper Shams Mulani (75, 6x4, 1x6).A target of 291 needed a sturdy start but Mumbai couldn’t get that. Medium pacers Sandeep Warrier (1-49) and R Silambarasan (1-40) did the initial damage to leave Mumbai on 33-3 in the 10th over. They needed Mulani and Hardik Tamore’s (28, 2x4) 47-run stand for the fourth wicket to arrest the slide. Tamil Nadu bowlers kept picking wickets at regular intervals to halt Mumbai’s progress. If Tamil Nadu’s medium-pacers shone in the first part of Mumbai’s chase, the spinners were spot on in the middle-overs. Siddharth and Washington were ably supported by left-arm spinner R Sai Kishore (2-35).Earlier, Shahrukh — instrumental in Tamil Nadu retaining the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy last month with his finishing skills — came to the side’s rescue once again. He arrived at the crease with his team’s total reading 179-5 in the 38th over. Shahrukh got down to business straightaway with his 88-run partnership for fifth wicket in 66 balls with J Kousik (32, 4x4). That stand gave impetus to Tamil Nadu’s innings and helped them finish with a challenging total. Shahrukh was at his belligerent best as he smashed five sixes and six fours during his 35-ball blitz. “Once I connected a couple of shots, my confidence grew. The plan was to play my natural game and I am happy to contribute,” Shahrukh said.Baba Indrajith (45, 4x4, 1x6) and Washington (34, 3x4) laid a strong foundation for Tamil Nadu with their 75-run third wicket stand. Subsequently, Dinesh Karthik (32, 4x4) kept the scoreboard ticking before Shahrukh took centre-stage.Vijay Shankar misses out: Tamil Nadu skipper Vijay Shankar missed the opening game due to dehydration. “We are monitoring his progress closely and hope to play him in the coming games,” said a team source.Brief scores: Tamil Nadu 290-8 in 50 overs (M Shahrukh Khan 66, B Indrajith 45; Dhawal Kulkarni 3-45). Mumbai 236 in 46.4 overs (Shams Mulani 75; M Siddharth 3-43, Washington 3-60).

---||Chennai||Tanks brimming, farmers ready to reap rich harvest||Chennai: The copious rain since the beginning of November has come as a boon to farmers in Chengalpet, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur, with nearly one lakh acres ready to harvest crops as many as three times in the ensuing months.The rain has filled 913 irrigation tanks in the three districts, with 905 tanks at full capacity. These water bodies, coming under the Lower Palar Basin, have been filled to capacity after several years.The rain this season has not only helped increasing yields, but also assisted in recharging the groundwater table, say farmers. The primary crop in Chengalpet district, a senior PWD official said, was paddy, followed by sugarcane — both water-intensive crops. Now, with plenty of water, farmers who raise paddy can sow and harvest it three times, while those choosing to raise sugarcane can harvest it two times, he added.K Kumar, a farmer from Madurantakam in Chengalpet who always raised paddy on five acres of land, said the lake in the area was brimming after six years, with the excess water still flowing out long after the rain stopped. This season, with the availability of adequate water, he said he was ready to reap to bumper harvest. “In Madurantakam taluk alone paddy is being cultivated on 2,500 acres of land. This year, most of us, can harvest three times provided our (Madurantakam) lake is de-silted by the authorities,” Kumar said.Tiruvallur District Farmers’ Association president Y Venugopal said while paddy and sugarcane are the two main crops, about 15% of land owners possessed mango groves and another 5% have coconut groves. A small number of farmers also raise vegetables on their land. During the ensuing farming season, Venugopal said, the cropping pattern in the district will improve. Besides, more reforms needed to be introduced in the agriculture sector to ensure they will benefit land owners in future, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tanks-brimming-farmers-ready-to-reap-rich-harvest/articleshow/88175031.cms||P Oppili

Police said that the main accused, Balaji, posed as an IRS officer and deceived several people claiming to possess a huge stock of gold seized during department raids which he promised to sell them at discounted rates. Explaining his modus operandi, a police officer told that Balaji would initially receive 10 lakh in return for gold worth 12 lakh. After gaining their confidence with similar smaller transactions, he later told people to invest more in gold and asked for huge sums from them. Believing him, several people gave him lakhs and even crores of rupees. Soon, Balaji allegedly refused to give them the gold or return the money. Based on a complaint by Praveen Alexander of Puducherry, police registered a case and arrested Balaji and his father Thulasidas, a partner in the crime. Police said that Balaji had cheated many people in the similar manner and added that they expect more complaints. Police said that Balaji was leading a flamboyant life with the money he swindled from others. The father and son were remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/father-son-duo-held-for-gold-fraud-in-periamet/articleshow/88175032.cms||---

On the one hand, police have booked cases against offending students and on the other, the transport department has warned bus conductors and drivers, who allowed the menace to go on. Crew have been instructed to halt buses at the roadside and call up the police in case students refuse to listen to their requests. Transport workers' unions have condemned this move. "It is unfair to punish us for the mistake of students and police, who have stopped conducting frequent inspections," said RM Swamy from SVS-AAP union, who insisted the need to increase bus frequencies during peak hours. “Students intentionally do not take Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses, which have automatic doors. Almost 50% of MTC buses, operated as ordinary services, do not have doors. The corporation must either replace these old buses or fix doors soon,” he said. Nine students from Pachaiyappa's College, who travelled on footboard on a government bus in the city's suburbs, were booked for possessing weapons on Tuesday. They were carrying a two-feet machete. These students performed stunts atop of a bus heading towards Meyyur in Thiruvallur district. Their parents were called to the police station and warned about the consequence if their wards continued this behaviour. Later, they were left off. Special teams have been formed by Thiruvallur police to identify students involved in the 'route thala' culture as it led to gang rivalries. They have launched a WhatsApp grievance number (6379904848) through which the public can complaint against such issues along with photos and videos. But such helplines turn dysfunctional once the issue settles down. Last year, the city police launched a helpline (9087552233) for the public to complain about such issues. But it is non-functional now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/govt-cracks-whip-on-footboard-travelling/articleshow/88175033.cms||Ram Sundaram

The suspect Jayesh Sejpal, arrested in the Rajasthan capital last week in a similar case, confessed to stealing from the Royapettah hotel in 2019. On June 8, 2019, Canadian national Mano Pancharathnam, who was staying at the Royapettah hotel with his wife Kavitha Kanagasurya, complained that the money was missing from in their room. A case was registered and a probe began. Inquiries revealed that a man trying to open Pancharatnam’s room sought assistance from the staff, claiming his access card was not functioning. Later, he also unlocked the safe in the room with the help of the help desk. Since then, investigation didn’t make much headway until the Jaipur police told their Royapettah counterparts about Sejpal’s apprehension and his subsequent admission. Police said that Sejpal, a Class X dropout who had managed to burgle nearly 30 luxury hotels in more than 15 cities across the country, was involved in steal jewellery worth 2 crore and 95,000 in cash from a hotel at Jaipur’s Jawahar Circle last week. He was later identified with the help of CCTV camera footage and nabbed from Surat in Gujarat. Narrating his modus operandi, a police officer said, he would check into star hotels posing as a rich guest and sneak into targeted rooms with the help of an alternative key after telling staff he had lost the original. He would then escape with valuables and police would flounder as he always gave false addresses and fake identity cards. The Gujarat native began his career in the canteen of a Mumbai hotel in 2003 and targeted hotels in Chennai, Mumbai, Agra, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Chandigarh, Jalandhar, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Kochi among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/serial-burglary-at-hotels-police-team-goes-to-rajasthan-to-bring-arrested-thief-to-tn/articleshow/88175036.cms||Selvaraj A
---||Business||RBI keeps rates unchanged, to drain another 1.5 lakh crore||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday announced a road map to reduce some of the Rs 9-lakh-crore-plus surplus liquidity which it had infused last year to alleviate the economic impact of the pandemic. The policy, which kept all key rates unchanged, was seen as dovish as the RBI has chosen to tip-toe towards its objective of policy normalisation (reducing liquidity in the system) without disrupting financial markets. The monetary policy committee (MPC) voted unanimously to retain the repo rate, at which the RBI lends to banks, at 4%. The reverse repo rate, at which it borrows from banks, was maintained at 3.35% too. The MPC also voted 5:1 to retain an accommodative policy with external member Jayanth Varma casting a dissenting vote. However, the central bank will be draining Rs 1.5 lakh crore more from the system. It has managed to do this by increasing the variable rate reverse repo auction, which is currently Rs 6 lakh crore, to Rs 6.5 lakh crore by December 17, and Rs 7.5 lakh crore by December 31. "Overall, the recovery that had been interrupted by the second wave of the pandemic is regaining traction, but it is not yet strong enough to be self-sustaining and durable. This underscores the vital importance of continued policy support," RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said, explaining the status quo on rates. In his post-policy conference, Das said the central bank's overarching priority was a revival of growth and it would focus on growth without losing sight of price stability. "Various segments of the economy have crossed their pre-pandemic levels, but in certain key components like private investment and private consumption, which are very critical for the growth of GDP, we are still lagging pre-pandemic levels," said Das. The governor also highlighted the downside risks to the economy from global factors, including the uncertainty from the Omicron variant. While the repo rate hike is not seen to be happening this year, economists expect the surplus liquidity to normalise by January 2022. "Overnight rates start rising towards the upper end of the corridor (between RBI's repo and reverse repo rate) when total amount parked in overnight reverse repo dips below Rs 1 lakh crore, and it is likely to begin from Jan '22 onwards. This will complete the corridor normalisation process. A hike in reverse repo rate beyond this could be the ideal opportunity and better timed assuming no increase in infections post-Omicron," said SBI Group chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-keeps-rates-unchanged-to-drain-another-1-5-lakh-crore/articleshow/88175046.cms||---

---||Patna||SVU raids Motihari excise supritendent, unearths DA of Rs 94L||PATNA: The Special Vigilance Unit (SVU) of Bihar police on Wednesday conducted raids on four locations of Motihari excise superintendent Avinash Prakash for allegedly amassing assets worth more than Rs94.05 lakh disproportionate to his known sources of income by allegedly conniving with liquor smugglers. The SVU sources said the estimated value of his disproportionate assets based on the deeds and documents was Rs94 lakh, but the actual market value of his properties might be above Rs30 crore. The figure will rise further with investigation of documents seized during the raids. This is the first such case against an excise department officer since the enforcement of liquor ban in the state in April, 2016. Prakash had joined the service 14 years back and is said to be well connected with the powers that be, as per the SVU sources. The SVU registered the case on Tuesday against Prakash for allegedly amassing the DA in the name of his close family members and friends and procured search warrants to conduct the raids. The raids were conducted at his two lavish farmhouses at Kurkuri in Phulwarisharif (Patna) and DAV Chowk in Rajendra Nagar, Khagaria, besides his office and house at Chhota Bariyarpur under Chhitauni police station area in Motihari, East Champaran. They said a currency counting machine, an agreement paper for flat purchase in his wife’s name and a heavy JCB were recovered from Kurkuri while another JCB was recovered from Khagaria. The SVU also found ill-gotten cash deposited in the bank accounts of his relatives and friends and then laundered into his own account. Sources said his farmhouse at Kurkuri is built over 22 kattha of land. “It huge and lavish. It must be worth at least Rs10 crore as per the market value,” the SVU source said. He said the farmhouse in Khagaria has been developed over 20 kattha land. “It’s also a lavish one with all modern amenities and exotic interior. It’s value is also in rupees several crores in market,” he said. The officer said the market value of the two properties alone would be worth over Rs17 crore. The SVU also found three plots of land measuring 41 decimals in his wife’s name with deed value of Rs8.25 lakh, 20 plots measuring 800 decimals for Rs48.5 lakh in his father’s name, one multi-utility vehicle, 15 bank accounts and documents showing investments in six life insurance policies. Sources said Prakash owns three heavy earthmovers. However, no cash or jewellery was found at any of the places raided. “It seems he had shifted cash and other movable valuables to some other places,” a senior SVU officer said. SVU sources said Prakash has allegedly amassed immovable properties also in the neighbouring states. “At present, there is information about Prakash’s immovable properties in Deoghar. Further investigations are on to find the details of his othr assets,” the officer said. When contacted, SVU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan said Prakash’s posting details would be gathered from his department. “Thorough investigation would be carried out with the help of the state police’s prohibition wing to know his nexus with liquor smugglers,” Khan said.

According to the MoU, the foundation will get 0.5 acres of land inside Baldeva High School at Danapur for a period of 10 years for developing a centralized kitchen for preparing midday meals. It will not charge any money for cooking meals and distributing them among the children of different schools.

According to sources, the 24X7 Covid vaccination camps are managed by Care India in collaboration with the health department and the district administration at Patliputra Sports Complex in Kankerbagh, Government Polytechnic in Patliputra Colony and Hotel Patliputra Ashok on Beerchand Patel Path. These camps launched by Patna district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh on June 6 were followed by 12-hour vaccination centres. Monsoon Mohanty, a resource person of Care India, told this reporter on Wednesday that the main objective of the 24X7 and 12-hour vaccination camps was to reduce the people’s waiting time. “There are separate counters at these camps for different age groups, genders as well as vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) to ramp up the inoculation process. Besides, the beneficiaries can go to the camps at any time without booking their slots beforehand,” he added. Mohanty continued, “After Patna, the model was adopted by other districts like Gaya, Darbhanga, Bhagalpur and Rohtas in Bihar. It has also been replicated in 12 other states, including Jharkhand, Assam, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur and Himachal Pradesh. The initiative will soon be rolled out in West Bengal and Gujarat as well.” As many as 64 lakh people have been vaccinated against Covid in Patna district so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/12-states-adopt-patnas-covid-vaccination-model/articleshow/88172853.cms||Faryal Rumi

NBFC MFI, SATYA MicroCapital Ltd saw its share of business from new customers improve since the second quarter and continue to grow in October and November.

Experts from outside state will impart training to more than 2100 personnel working at Patna, Darbhanga and Gaya airports in the next one week to become eyes and ears of security personnel, BCAS regional director (Patna) Abhimanyu Singh said on the occasion of International Civil Aviation Day on Tuesday. He said the BCAS is working to address the congestion-related security issues at Patna and Darbhanga airports in order to strengthen their aviation security in the long run. Singh said a security survey has already been conducted for Darbhanga airport and necessary suggestions, including expanding the terminal capacity, have been sent to the authorities concerned. He said the training capsule aims at sensitizing non-security staff working at the airports. “They are being made aware about threats, anomaly and suspicious things to remain alert while performing regular duty in order to alert airport security guards (ASG) or CISF personnel,” he said. Singh said the one-day training course is a must for non-security staff to get an airport entry pass. Singh said Bihar has immense potential for air connectivity. “Darbhanga airport is the biggest testimony to it.

---||Business||RBI keeps rates unchanged, to drain another Rs 1.5L crore||Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday announced a road map to reduce some of the Rs 9-lakh-crore-plus surplus liquidity which it had infused last year to alleviate the economic impact of the pandemic. The policy, which kept all key rates unchanged, was seen as dovish as the RBI has chosen to tip-toe towards its objective of policy normalisation (reducing liquidity in the system) without disrupting financial markets. The monetary policy committee (MPC) voted unanimously to retain the repo rate, at which the RBI lends to banks, at 4%. The reverse repo rate, at which it borrows from banks, was maintained at 3.35% too. The MPC also voted 5:1 to retain an accommodative policy with external member Jayanth Varma casting a dissenting vote. However, the central bank will be draining Rs 1.5 lakh crore more from the system. It has managed to do this by increasing the variable rate reverse repo auction, which is currently Rs 6 lakh crore, to Rs 6.5 lakh crore by December 17, and Rs 7.5 lakh crore by December 31. “Overall, the recovery that had been interrupted by the second wave of the pandemic is regaining traction, but it is not yet strong enough to be self-sustaining and durable. This underscores the vital importance of continued policy support,” RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said, explaining the status quo on rates. In his post-policy conference, Das said that the central bank’s overarching priority was a revival of growth and it would focus on growth without losing sight of price stability. “Various segments of the economy have crossed their pre-pandemic levels, but in certain key components like private investment and private consumption, which are very critical for the growth of GDP, we are still lagging pre-pandemic levels,” said Das. The governor also highlighted the downside risks to the economy from global factors, including the uncertainty from the Omicron variant. While the repo rate hike is not seen to be happening this year, economists expect the surplus liquidity to normalise by January 2022. “Overnight rates start rising towards the upper end of the corridor (between RBI’s repo and reverse repo rate) when total amount parked in overnight reverse repo dips below Rs 1 lakh crore, and it is likely to begin from Jan ’22 onwards. This will complete the corridor normalisation process. A hike in reverse repo rate beyond this could be the ideal opportunity and better timed assuming no increase in infections post-Omicron,” said SBI Group chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh. Another message that came across in the policy was that the central bank did not see demand pressures building up because of consumption. RBI deputy governor Michael Patra said that credit demand was still to pick up because of the lack of private investment and private demand. He said that there was surplus capacity and the output gap in India would take years to close. Das said that the projection for real GDP growth is retained at 9.5% in FY22, consisting of 6.6% in Q3 and 6.0% in Q4 of 2021-22. Real GDP growth is projected at 17.2% for Q1FY23 and at 7.8% for Q2FY23. In its previous policy, the RBI had projected 6.8% in Q3, and 6.1% in Q4 of 2021-22. Similarly, CPI inflation is retained at 5.3% for FY22, comprising 5.1% in Q3, and 5.7% in Q4 of FY22. CPI inflation is then expected to ease to 5% in Q1FY23 and stay at that level in the next quarter. Last quarter, the RBI had projected 4.5% in Q3, 5.8% in Q4 of FY22. Explaining the lower forecast for the next quarter, Patra said that the impact of the cut in fuel prices following the reduction in taxes was yet to be recorded in the macro numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-keeps-rates-unchanged-to-drain-another-rs-1-5l-crore/articleshow/88173513.cms||---

The day’s gains were also helped by the RBI’s status quo on rates, market players said. In two sessions, the index has added 1,903 points and has more than recovered the total loss of 1,714 points, recorded in the previous two sessions. During the day, led by Infosys, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, the sensex gained 1.8% to close at 58,650. And as in the last few sessions, Wednesday’s gains came despite strong selling by foreign funds with the day’s net outflow figure at Rs 579 crore, BSE data showed. The day’s gains also added about Rs 4 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with the BSE’s market capitalisation at over Rs 267 lakh crore, data showed. During the day, the RBI kept interest rates unchanged, continuing with its accommodative stance which in turn is expected to support economic growth. According to Naveen Kulkarni, chief investment officer, Axis Securities, the RBI is supportive of getting the economic growth on track as it continues with a soft interest rate regime and calibrated liquidity conditions in the system. “We believe that RBI prioritising growth with an eye on inflation will keep the hardening of interest rates gradual and the Budget in February to be a key trigger for the markets.” The day’s session saw across-the-board buying with auto, IT and consumer goods stocks leading. Among the 30 sensex stocks, 28 closed higher. In the broader market, however, the advance-decline ratio was less skewed with 2,313 gainers to 980 laggards, BSE data showed. After two consecutive sessions of strong gains, market players now believe Thursday could witness some profit-booking. A less-volatile session on Dalal Street could also be backed by the flat trading session witnessed in the US market in mid-session. The rupee fell to a near two-month low of 75.5 against the dollar on Wednesday as the RBI’s monetary policy decision failed to enthuse forex market participants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-surges-1016-pts-on-rbi-move-us-rally/articleshow/88173536.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to RBI governor Shaktikanta Das, while core inflation is a policy concern, the overarching focus is on growth... What is the metric that could convey to you that the economy is recovering? Various segments of the economy have crossed their pre-pandemic levels. But in certain key components like private investment, private consumption, which are very critical for the growth of GDP, we are still lagging pre-pandemic levels. The economy is facing several headwinds and Omicron is adding to the uncertainty. On credit growth not picking up... Credit growth is currently 7%, which is too low for the Indian economy and needs to go up. But if you look at the flow of resources to the commercial sector, which includes other market instruments, there is a substantial improvement. Last year, large corporates raised a lot of funds from the markets and deleveraged their balance sheets by repaying loans to bank. The growth in demand is not keeping up with our expectations as there was a second wave of the pandemic and corporates are in wait and watch mode. On prioritising growth over inflation... The overarching priority of the RBI at this stage is revival of growth. We had quite a bit of discussion on core inflation and we have recognised core inflation is a concern as it has been elevated for some time. On the status of the central bank digital currency... We are working on a wholesale and retail model for the central bank digital currency. The PMC Bank resolution plan... A draft resolution scheme is in public domain and we have given time until December 10 for feedback from all stakeholders. We will examine all comments and finalise the scheme according to the law after taking into account all the comments. We propose to do it very quickly after December 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/overarching-priority-is-growth-inflation-a-concern-rbi-guv-das/articleshow/88173325.cms||Mayur Shetty

But due to the embargo imposed over the entire Sahara Group by the Supreme Court over the past eight years owing to the Sahara-Sebi dispute, a situation of delay in payments has arisen. This has impacted our earnings in a major way. So much so that our investors are not giving us new business as their old repayments are delayed. This has led to our income dwindling to near negligible. As a result, lakhs of our karyakartas are now on the brink of starvation and unemployment,” a Sahara Group press release said. Over the past 8 years, SEBI has repaid merely Rs125 crore, with interest, despite taking out 4 rounds of advertisements in regional and national newspapers. In a status report submitted at the beginning of this year with the Supreme Court, SEBI has acknowledged it. When SEBI has no pending repayment left for any investor at present, it should submit an affidavit that it has no investors awaiting repayments. Then it may lead to the Supreme Court lifting the embargo placed over all the Sahara companies, and Sahara receiving the Rs24,000 crore (with interest) from the Sahara-SEBI account, the press statement reads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sahara-investors-workers-protest/articleshow/88173303.cms||---

It intends to get ISO 14001:2015 certificates from the pollution control boards of the cities concerned by maintaining better hygiene and cleanliness at these stations. According to ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, the 52 stations include the Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Muzaffarpur Junction and Gaya Junction in Bihar. “The National Green Tribunal has also issued an advisory to the railways to keep a close watch on the environment-related activities being carried out in and around the stations under the ECR. The latter will, therefore, ensure proper water supply, compliance with pollution prevention requirements and solid waste management at these stations. Efforts will also be made to have plastic-free stations,” the CPRO told this reporter, adding that plastic bottle crushing machines and composting plants had already been installed at the Patna, Danapur, Rajendra Nagar, Muzaffarpur, Sonepur, Dhanbad and Gaya stations. Besides, the railways has installed water harvesting and recycling treatment plants at the Danapur, Rajendra Nagar and Barauni stations to keep them neat and clean. It has also carried out electrical energy and water audits at most ECR stations to ensure pure water supply and prevent power wastage. “The railways has already introduced a 24X7 mechanised cleaning system at major stations of the ECR, including the Patna Junction and Rajendra Nagar Terminal. The tracks are cleaned regularly so that the passengers do not experience foul smell at the time of boarding a train or stepping down,” the CPRO said. Meanwhile, the pollution control boards of Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh have lauded the railways for maintaining an environment-friendly atmosphere in and around different stations. At many places it has switched to solar energy system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rlys-to-make-52-stations-under-ecr-eco-smart/articleshow/88173218.cms||Kumod Verma

The process of online admission in the three-year degree course commenced on August 1 and continued till the end of November. However, some seats could not be filled as an appreciable number of candidates did not turn up for the admission. Now, the university has asked all the colleges to treat these vacant seats as ‘casual vacancies’ and expedite college wise admission. PU students’ welfare dean Anil Kumar told this newspaper that the details of date and timing of admission in different colleges would be chalked out at a meeting with the principals of colleges to be held on Thursday under the chairmanship of vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Chaudhary. The number of vacant seats in different colleges are — Magadh Mahila College (175), Patna College (244), B N College (231), Patna Science College (117) and Vanijya Mahavidyalaya (84). Besides, the state government had sanctioned 240 additional seats (180 in Patna College and 60 in Patna Science College) in the current session on the demand of PU authorities. Explaining the reason behind seats remaining vacant the dean said that due to delay in admission, owing to the pandemic, some students whose names figured in the merit list did not take admission. “Some of them had already been selected in technical institutions outside the state by the time they got the call from PU,” Kumar said, adding that the sanctioned seats in some language courses remain vacant every year as very few students want to study these courses. Meanwhile, the online submission of applications for admission to MA, MSc and MCom courses of PU in the current academic session is going on. The last date for submission of forms is December 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/851-seats-remain-vacant-in-patna-varsity-ug-courses/articleshow/88173280.cms||B K Mishra

He said BMC has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with an Israeli firm, IDE, to set up a desalination plant at Manori to convert 1,800 million litres of seawater daily into potable water. “The pre-feasibility study is done and we are in the process of drawing up tenders. The project will be commissioned by 2024. There will be a phase II in the same place to convert an equal amount of seawater (1,800 MLD) into potable water,” he said. Besides this, Chahal said the BMC has taken up the setting-up of sewage treatment plants. “Six sewage treatment plants which will convert 2,400 million litres of sewage into potable water daily are being set up at a cost of Rs 20,000 crore,” he said. The sewage treatment plants will be constructed with BMC’s resources. “The desalination and sewage treatment plants will solve Mumbai’s potable water issue on a permanent basis,” the civic chief said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-for-desalination-plant-bmc-inks-mou-with-israel-firm/articleshow/88173745.cms||Clara Lewis

Given the Covid pandemic, home learning is the norm and picture books have become very popular in households with young kids. The Madhya Pradesh bench of the GST-Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) had to decide whether a home-learning kit box’s books — largely meant for pre-schoolers to develop their linguistic, logical, sensory, cognitive, creativity and other skills — would attract a nil rate of GST. Children’s picture books under tariff heading 4903 are subject to a nil rate of GST. The kit box, called the ‘Class Monitor Home Learning Kit’ and manufactured & marketed by private company Riseom Solutions, consisted of cards, pamphlets and sheets containing images and pictures. After going through the learning kit, the AAR observed that it is not in a book or bound form. Thus, the learning kit would be classified under tariff heading 4901, which covers ‘pamphlets, booklets, brochures, leaflets and similar printed matter’. This would attract a GST rate of 5%. The manufacturing company explained that the contents of the kit box are in the form of separate sheets that are grouped together according to the sub-topic, say animals, vegetables, etc. All the sheets are part of a kit box book, which is suitable for binding. “However, if we bind all the sheets together, it would be heavy for a kid to use it easily,” the company submitted. It added that an activity-based methodology is adopted with instructions on the back of the sheets and various supporting materials like craft-paper, ribbon, Fevicol tube, etc, “to keep a child happily engrossed in the learning process”. However, it all boiled down to the fact that the sheets were unbound and thus the kit box’s books were not eligible for a nil GST rate. It should be noted that GST rulings do not set a judicial precedent. However, they have a persuasive impact during assessment of similar cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/unbound-kids-picture-books-to-face-5-gst/articleshow/88173556.cms||Lubna Kably

The alliance will also explore low-carbon solutions. Mahindra Group and its channel partners’ locations will be evaluated for setting up Jio-BP stations, including EV charging and swapping points. Additionally, business models like Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) and Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS) will be explored wherein Jio-BP could provide charging solutions to EVs made by Mahindra Group. Jio-BP recently launched its first station in Maharashtra, offering multiple fuelling choices, including EV-charging infrastructure. India’s EV market, though nascent, is red hot right now. With companies like Ola, Greaves and most recently Simple Energy setting up large e-two-wheeler plants (Ola and Simple are both million-plus factories), the supply side is ramping up fast. It’s the charging infrastructure though that’s going to be a game changer. According to a Grant Thornton Charat-Ficci report released earlier this year, the estimate was that India would need 400,000 charging stations by 2026 to accommodate 2 million EVs. According to the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles, there were around 1,800 charging stations as of March this year for just over 16,000 electric four-wheelers. Because the demand is so high, the activity is beginning to get frenetic too at the charging end. Tata Power and its leverage with Tata Motors’s EV business has been one of the reasons for the success of the latter’s EV strategy. In the two-wheeler space, Tata Power has also partnered with TVS for charging network. Ashok Leyland has signed an MoU with ABB Power Grids to set up fast-charging infrastructure for electric buses. Traditional oil companies are already ramping up their EV-charging network riding on their petrol/diesel channels. Indian Oil, which currently has 448 charging stations, plans to ramp up to 2,000 in a year and add another 8,000 in a further 2 years. In the two-wheeler space, vehicle manufacturers are setting up their own network, taking a leaf out of the dealer-channel build that ICE OEMs do. Ola, for instance, is investing heavily in its hyper charger network and has announced it will have 100,000 charging points across 400 cities. Rival Hero Electric has announced it will set up 10,000 charging stations by 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mm-jio-bp-tie-up-for-ev-services/articleshow/88173368.cms||---

District health office data revealed that the caseload in the rural areas reduced almost by 45% in a period of one month. The case tally in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits declined by 28% during the period. However, the active cases in areas under the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) areas recorded an increase of 17% from the numbers a month ago and reached up to 773. The count of patients in PMR was around 2,100 on November 1 and continued to hover around 2,000 till the last week of the month. The cases witnessed a gradual drop during the past 10 days. Health officials have been monitoring the cases in both the urban and rural pockets of the district. “The situation in rural areas has improved,” an official said. Data released by the district health officer on Monday (December 7) revealed that the PMC areas had the maximum Covid caseload (773), followed by 557 in the rural and Cantonment localities and 339 in PCMC limits. Sanjeev Wavre, assistant medical chief at the PMC’s health department, said, “The city limits have been reporting around 50-100 cases a day since the past few days. There has been a slight rise in caseload. But no civic ward has reported any significant spurt in cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmr-caseload-down-by-22-month-after-diwali-festivities/articleshow/88173732.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Business||RBI to rejig e-payment fees, likely to level field||Mumbai: The RBI is proposing to review charges on payment transactions. Industry players said that the move would level the playing field in digital payments. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is expected to benefit from any rationalisation charges. The RBI said in its policy on Wednesday that the cost of providing digital payment services is generally recovered from the merchant or the customer or is borne by one or more of the participants. “While there are both advantages and disadvantages of customers bearing these charges, they should be reasonable and should not become a deterrent in the adoption of digital payments,” the RBI said. It added that a discussion paper will review charges for credit cards, debit cards, prepaid payment instruments (cards & e-wallets) and UPI. It will also seek feedback on convenience fee and surcharging to make digital transactions affordable to users and economically remunerative to the providers. Some analysts saw this announcement as a signal that the RBI would like to bring transaction charges down. Speaking to TOI, NPCI MD & CEO Dilip Asbe said that the corporation was not earning any fees on RuPay debit cards or UPI transactions and there was no scope for further revenue loss. According to Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma, India’s success in digital payments scaling to every nook and corner is led by zero-fee payments. “Paytm championed and started this revolution with zero-fee payments for small merchants. Clearly, there is lot more to be done and we shouldn’t stop growth of digital payment in India by adding UPI fees or charges for small merchants,” he said. He added that more the digitisation, more the number of people invited for financial inclusion.In the monetary policy press conference, RBI deputy governor T Rabi Shankar said that ensuring viability of transactions and increasing digital payments were common goals. “The more viable it becomes, the better the digital penetration would be. The RBI’s objective has been to popularise and increase the use of digital payments and charges are an important component of it. So, we have decided to review the charges,” he said. Globally, regulators have a mixed approach to charges. Some markets have started allowing merchants to pass on some of the fee to their customers, some have capped fees on debit cards at a fraction of credit card charges. The RBI has traditionally been more liberal in allowing fees on credit cards compared to debit cards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-to-rejig-e-payment-fees-likely-to-level-field/articleshow/88173525.cms||---

---||Business||RBI’s push for UPI: E-wallet for small transactions, feature phone payments||Mumbai: The RBI’s big push for Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has the potential to take transactions on the platform to 100 crores a day, according to National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) MD & CEO Dilip Asbe. Two of the key measures include enabling small transactions through an ‘on-device’ e-wallet in UPI apps, which locks funds in a separate account, while the other is to enable UPI payments on feature phones. UPI transactions have been topping 400 crores a month, largely driven by transactions in smaller cities where the absence of other electronic payment infrastructure makes it easy to send and receive money. The downside of UPI is that every small transaction, including a Rs-5 payment, is treated as an electronic withdrawal from a bank account. This requires both the sending and receiving bank to send an SMS and it reflects as a debit entry in passbooks and statements. More than this, the real cost is the load it causes on the core banking systems as every payment message has to hit the server of two banks for the transaction to complete. Although details are not yet clear, industry people say that an on-device e-wallet would require the owner to transfer some money from their bank account into the UPI e-wallet in the app. The money thus blocked can be used to make small-value payments without the payment message having to hop from phone to payer bank server and the payee bank server before it is confirmed to the recipient. Bankers compare it to the prepaid card used in transports like the Metro, except that it will work with any UPI provider. An on-device e-wallet will also reduce dependence on telecom networks as, in the future, customers can use NFC to transfer funds from their on-device UPI e-wallet to the recipient’s device. The RBI has also enabled banks to facilitate payment for IPO subscriptions and purchase of government bonds from the central bank for up to Rs 5 lakh — an increase from the current level of Rs 2 lakh. Announcing the facility, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said that IPO applications of Rs 2-5 lakh constitute approximately 10% of subscription applications. The transaction limit in the UPI system was doubled from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh in March 2020. The new limit will enable customers in small cities to make large equity and government bond investments using their mobile phones. While earlier attempts to promote the use of feature phones for payments was not a success, innovations under the aegis of the RBI’s regulatory sandbox have solved the complexity issues that users have faced. The proposal is to now enable users to authorise payments on feature phones by inputting codes or dialling a number and providing the required inputs. The RBI’s moves on UPI come at a time when the government is attempting to take the network global by identifying partners in key markets like the UAE, Singapore and the UK for acceptance and at the same time providing the UPI platform technology to other markets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbis-push-for-upi-e-wallet-for-small-transactions-feature-phone-payments/articleshow/88173545.cms||Mayur Shetty

But the university’s defence joint education programme hit another milestone in July 2018 following varsity officials’ meeting with then Army chief General Bipin Rawat in New Delhi. General Rawat, who later assumed the position of the country’s first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), died in a chopper crash on Wednesday. According to the AU officials, the meeting with General Rawat in Delhi paved the way for several MoUs in the subsequent months. Prof G Nageswara Rao, who served as vice-chancellor of the university between 2016 and 2019, took a trip down his memory lane and explained his meeting with General Rawat in New Delhi on July 27, 2018. “Initially, General Rawat was surprised to know that a delegation from Andhra University was reaching out to the Army and offering academic courses. We then explained to him the credentials of the university and our earlier MoUs with the Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard. “He said courses like yoga, cyber security, big data and artificial intelligence are in huge demand for Army personnel and agreed to send their officers to the varsity. Consequently, we entered into several MoUs with the Army in the following days,” said Prof Rao. He added that they started offering graduation certificates to Army personnel who had completed 15 years of service, at the suggestion of General Rawat. “It was meant to make them more employable in the open market upon their retirement after short service. General Rawat presented me a book on the Indian Army, while we from the university offered him a memento with the university emblem and a shawl,” he recalled. Following the meeting, Andhra University signed five MoUs with the Army in 2018 for offering various academic programmes. Giving lateral entry into engineering and post-graduation courses for ‘medical board-outs’ (recruits released from the services on medical grounds) is one of the components of the MoUs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/general-rawat-facilitated-aus-tie-up-with-indian-army/articleshow/88173108.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

An FIR was lodged on November 17 with the Barhara police station of Bhojpur district against the former MLA by his bodyguard Satyendra Kumar, in which he had alleged that on November 5, when a murder had taken place at Fuha village and people were protesting by blocking the Ara-Chhapra road, Saroj Yadav also visited the protest site. While returning, he used derogatory remarks against the police personnel and officers. When Satyendra objected to the derogatory remarks made by him against the police officers, the MLA used casteist slur against him and after reaching home also assaulted him.  Bhojpur SP Vinay Tiwari while confirming the arrest of the former Barhara MLA Saroj Yadav told newsmen, “An FIR against the former MLA was lodged last month with the Barhara police station by his bodyguard, in which he had alleged that casteist slur had been used against him and he was also assaulted. The MLA has been made accused under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act as well as some other relevant sections of the IPC.” According to the police sources, in the last six months, five police personnel have submitted applications to the Bhojpur SP requesting him not to appoint them as the bodyguard of the former MLA as he often uses abusive language and his behaviour too is vey indecent. The ex-MLA’s advocate Shambhu Saran said, “An anticipatory bail petition was filed but the court had sought the case diary. Therefore, now a regular bail plea will be filed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/former-rjd-mla-from-barhara-arrested/articleshow/88172805.cms||---

Excerpts: What arrangements are being made by the state government in view of the growing threat of Omicron variant of Covid-19?Not a single person in the state has so far been infected with Omicron. But the government is all serious about its possible invasion. The health department is constantly monitoring the situation and all the hospitals and health centres in the state have been alerted against it. People coming from outside are being tested. If anybody is found positive for Covid, his sample is sent for genome sequencing to confirm whether it is the Omicron or not. The Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) at Patna has got the necessary infrastructure for genome sequencing. Otherwise, samples would be sent to the Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar, or the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBMG) at Kalyani (near Kolkata). All the travellers coming from outside either by flights or trains are being tested for the virus quite rigorously. Do you feel the hospitals and health centres are fully equipped to tackle the possible third wave following the advent of Omicron?The infrastructure of all the hospitals up to the block level has been strengthened to meet any eventuality. The government had started improving the health infrastructure right after the second wave as the state had suffered a huge loss of humn lives owing to lack of certain advanced facilities. Now, there would be no shortage of medical oxygen at any health centre. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generating plants have already been installed in 125 hospitals. All the hospitals, right from health sub-centres to medical college hospitals, have been provided with the necessary medical equipment as per their needs. Besides, all the health centres have got equipment like oxygen concentrators, B and C-type oxygen cylinders and BiPAP (bilevel positive air pressure) machines for children. All the essential medicines were being supplied to the health centres. The number of ICU beds are also being increased in all the hospitals. Omicron is supposed to be more dangerous for children. What special arrangements are you making for the treatment of seriously infected children?All the necessary infrastructure is already available at the health centres. Special wards for children with necessary facilities have been created in all the hospitals. Facilities of ICUs and beds with ventilators have been enhanced at all the hospitals and healthcare centres. All the hospitals have been directed to get the infrastructure ready at paediatric intensive care units (PICU), neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and special newborn care units (SNCUs) without any delay. The process of procurement of essential equipment is on. What about the vaccination drive? How would you ensure the vaccination of maximum number of people at the earliest?Vaccination is going on in full swing all over the state. In fact, the rate of vaccination has increased considerably after the news of the Omicron virus. More than 65 lakh doses of vaccines have been administered in the last eight days. There is no dearth of vaccines anywhere in the state and people, even in rural areas, are being motivated to come forward and get them inoculated at the earliest. The state government is likely to achieve its target of vaccinating six crore people shortly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-prepared-to-handle-omicron-threat/articleshow/88172964.cms||B K Mishra

That is how Major General N Srinivasa Rao (Rtd) chose to describe General Bipin Rawat, who died in a helicopter crash in Coonoor on Wednesday morning. As Chief of Defence Staff, General Rawat’s responsibility was to bring about a synergy between all the three forces – the Army, Navy and Air Force. “This is what he had in mind even before he was appointed to the post. In my interaction with him in Baramulla where he was commanding a division, he desired that all higher command officers of all the three services understand the operations along the line of control. He personally wanted to brief them on every aspect of it,” Major General N Srinivasa Rao, who retired as commanding officer of the Telangana and Andhra Sub Area told TOI. Sometime in 2013-14, Major General Srinivasa Rao recalls that when he as the directing staff of Army War College, led a delegation to the border areas, where he met General Bipin Rawat to get first-hand knowledge of the ground operations. “His vision, even then was about jointness in the armed forces. So, when he was made CDS, he was taking his vision forward in the right direction,” Major General Srinivasa Rao said. As chief of army staff, General Rawat had visited Secunderabad on December 13, 2019. “Even if he already had a point of view, he would allow for a discussion. If he was convinced, he would not hesitate to change his mind,” Major General Srinivasa Rao recalled, adding that he had discussed with him Secunderabad cantonment issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/as-cds-he-wanted-to-bringsynergy-among-tri-services/articleshow/88173743.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The matter soon snowballed into a fight and the accused identified as Satish Padhiyar, Kiran Khadkar, Rajan Thakore, Feroze Ghanchi, Vijay Rana, Piyush Rohit, Hiren Makwana and Prakash Dodiya attacked Latesh near Ambika Nagar in Gotri. Padhiyar brutally stabbed Latesh, who was in his 20s, with a knife while the others too assaulted him with sticks. The victim suffered severe injuries and was rushed to a private hospital for treatment by some passers-by. He was declared dead within two hours following which the cops filed a case of murder against the accused at the Gotri police station. The cops soon nabbed all the accused who were involved in the murder. About 42 witnesses deposed before the court from the complainant’s side during the trial along with material evidence. The court observed that though the accused don’t have any crimes registered against them in the past, the offence of murder has life imprisonment as punishment. The court has also announced punishment of six months and Rs 500 fine for unlawful assembly. Also, the accused have been convicted for rioting and sentenced to two years of imprisonment. All the sentences will run parallel and the victim’s father will also get compensation from the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/eight-get-life-term-for-murdering-man-in-2013/articleshow/88172436.cms||---

The staff claimed that the after doctors’ strike, arrangements were made by the BJP-led civic agencies for immediate payment of their salaries, but no attention was paid to the grieving teachers’ demand. Kuldeep Khatri of Shikshak Nyay Manch Nagar Nigam said that the officials have not even issued an order for paying enhanced DA and 7th Pay Commission arrears pending since 2017. Khatri said that the Delhi BJP president didn’t even come forward to hear their issues. “In the afternoon, former North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash and education committee chairman Alok Sharma visited us and assured the release of salaries by Friday. If nothing happens even after Friday, and the salary is not credited in our accounts, then we will hold indefinite mass protests outside Civic Centre,” said Khatri. On being questioned, Jai Prakash informed that one months’ salary will be credited to the teachers’ accounts by the weekend. “I visited the agitating teachers and also spoke to the north corporation commissioner in front of them. There is transfer duty for three months and other amounts pending with the Delhi government, which is why payment of salaries is getting delayed. But we will surely release their salaries by Friday. They have been requested to continue with the work,” said the former mayor. No response could be received regarding the payment of salaries to teachers and other staff from East Delhi Municipal Corporation. Supporting the teachers’ protest, Aam Aadmi Party also demanded immediate release of salaries in a press statement issued on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpn-teachers-protest-outside-delhi-bjp-hq-over-unpaid-salaries-other-dues/articleshow/88173768.cms||Vibha Sharma

Raut said he had a “positive” meeting with Priyanka Gandhi and added: “We are thinking of working together in Uttar Pradesh and Goa.” The two states will go to th polls early next year. A Sena functionary said an alliance wi-th Congress in these two states would help both parties in taking on BJP. “Without Hindutva and hardline nationalism, no party can take on BJP at the national level. We have both with us and can give a tough fight to BJP,” he said, adding that the final decision on the alliance will be taken by the party chief and CM Uddhav Thackeray. In 2017, the Sena had contested UP and Goa assembly elections, but did not win a single seat. —Chaitanya Marpakwar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-may-tie-up-with-cong-for-up-goa-polls-says-raut/articleshow/88173770.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Pune||Covid-19 genome sequencing work in Maharashtra lacks diverse population: Report||PUNE/NAGPUR: The genome sequencing work of Covid positive samples — drawn from the community (infected patients without travel history) — to rule out the presence of Omicron remained largely focused on the state’s big cities despite the general agreement on the need for genomic research in diverse populations, revealed the latest report of the state health department. Besides sequencing infected travellers’ positive samples, research labs are sequencing positive samples from the daily Covid cases to track the variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. Barring Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur, the whole genome sequencing work — reinforced in the wake of the concern over Omicron — is currently representing only a few cities. Experts say genomic research need collaborative work across all the districts to rule out the community spread of extremely contagious variants like Omicron. District officials entrusted with the responsibility of sending adequate positive Covid samples from their jurisdiction for sequencing to the designated research labs, however, underlined the drastic decline in positive cases, resulting in uneven representation in the sequencing work at the state-level. Incidentally, districts like Akola and Amaravati were the first to report the Delta variant in India in December 2020, which eventually led to widespread Covid cases across the country during the second wave. “Every district is supposed to send 100 positive samples fitting the criteria every month to the designated research labs every month. That means a total of 3,600 positive Covid samples should undergo genomic sequencing in Maharashtra every month. However, we have been able to send about 2,400 samples for sequencing in November. Of them, almost 60-70% samples are from big cities like Mumbai and Pune, and only 30% are from the remaining 34 districts,” said a senior health official, requesting anonymity. Adequate machinery and infrastructure is in place in Maharashtra to carry out the genomic sequencing work of the stipulated 3,600 samples every month. “But some districts complain that they do not get enough positive samples as the second wave has almost reached its end in quite a few districts, reporting only sporadic cases now,” said the state surveillance officer, Pradip Awate. Laxity following the decline in Covid cases is also cited as one of the reasons for the uneven representation. “The district administration in quite a few districts in Vidarbha and Marathwada had become lax and they revamped the testing work only after the first case of Omicron in a person without travel history got detected in Karnataka last week, and later confirmed cases of Covid from Omicron got detected in travellers and their close contacts in Maharashtra,” said another health official. Bhandara district collector Sandeep Kadam said they had been sending all-new samples for genome sequencing to Nagpur. The district has reported the lowest cases — only 22 between September 1 to December 5. Kadam ruled out missing daily new positive cases. “Bhandara’s testing is satisfactory as per WHO standards. Districts listed as poor performers on testing didn’t include Bhandara,” he said. Gondia is another district where cases have remained low — just 33 in the last three months. Dr Dilip Gedam, the head of the microbiology department at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Gondia, and the in-charge of Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL), said they were given a target of 100 samples a month by National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi. “In the last two months, we could send only one or two positive samples for genome sequencing owing to extremely low positivity rate,” Gedam said. Gadchiroli district collector Sanjay Meena said they had been regularly sending samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune and NCDC in New Delhi. The Naxalite-hit district has reported 108 cases in the last three months. Yavatmal district collector Amol Yedge said monthly samples were sent to NCDC, Delhi, and fortnightly samples were sent to Pune’s NCCS for genome sequencing, according to the government SOP. The district has recorded 94 cases in three months, which increased the contact tracing ratio. In Nagpur, all the samples are sent for genome sequencing on a daily basis to CSIR-NEERI’s environmental virology cell. District collector R Vimala said, “Samples are sent through the civic body every day. At 615 cases in three months, Nagpur has reported the highest positive samples in Vidarbha. All of these samples have been genome sequenced as well, which had only Delta variant and its sublineages.” Kolhapur district reported 137 Covid cases in November. Anita Saibannavar, a pulmonologist at CPR Hospital in Kolhapur, said, “The positive swabs sent for genome sequencing are less than 100 per month, as mandated by the government, as cases have dropped.” (With inputs from Abhijit Patil from Kolhapur)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sequencing-work-lacks-diverse-population-report/articleshow/88173755.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The notices were issued to the department of science, technology and environment, forest department, Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA), deputy collector North at Mapusa, Secretary village panchayat of Calangute on December 8 and made returnable on December 9. “The state is expected to urgently look into the matter and submit its preliminary response by the returnable date,” stated justices Revati Mohite Dere and M S Jawalkar. Advocate Norma Alvares has been appointed as amicus curiae in the suo motu petition. Meanwhile on Wednesday, residents and activists who gathered at the site where a large swathe of sand-dune vegetation was cleared, demanded an inquiry into the incident terming it as a criminal act. “The present government does not care about Goa or the environment. The police had come here on Tuesday to check, but they should find out the persons involved and register a case against them because clearing sand-dune vegetation amounts to destruction of biodiversity, which is a criminal offence,” activists said. “The intention seems to have been to clear the vegetation and then level the land,” they said. A local NGO, Calangute Constituency Forum, has also lodged a complaint about the illegal clearing of the sand-dune vegetation with GCZMA, Calangute panchayat, state chief secretary, Calangute police and others. The article stated that vegetation is being cleared in broad daylight for the past two days by migrant works hired by owners of a private resort barely 50m from the beach on sand dunes at Khobrawaddo which is in the no-development zone of the CRZ.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-seeks-reply-over-clearing-of-calangute-dune-vegetation/articleshow/88173139.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Incidentally, it is the second instance when EC expressed its ire over model code of conduct (MCC) violations in less than a month. Telangana chief electoral officer Shashank Goel has directed the secretary of panchayat raj department to send a report on issuing orders sanctioning funds when the MCC is in force in respect of the MLC elections under the local authorities constituencies without the consent of ECI. Congress senior vice president S Niranjan had lodged a complaint with the ECI on Tuesday on the proceedings issued by the panchayat raj commissioner sanctioning Rs 250 crore to zilla and mandal praja parishads. He said it was violation of the MCC. Acting on the complaint, the ECI sought a clarification from the panchayat raj commissioner. The municipal administration department had issued an order on November 18 increasing honorarium, including conveyance allowance to mayors, chairpersons, deputy mayors, vice-chairpersons, corporators, ward members and co-option members of the urban local bodies (ULBs), who form the electoral college for elections to the council.

The incident came to light in the early hours of Tuesday when the bungalow owner, who is abroad, was not able to contact his wife and two kids. “He alerted his brother-in-law and the security guard of the society. When the brother-in-law entered the house, he found his sister and niece unconscious, while his nephew was regaining consciousness,” Balkrishna Sawant, a senior inspector with the Hinjewadi police, told TOI. He immediately alerted the police and called an ambulance and took the three persons to a hospital. “The 52-year-old woman, her daughter and son gained consciousness later in the day. They are now out of danger,” Sawant said adding, “We will be able to get more details after the trio recover fully.” Sawant said, “The domestic help could only steal cash and some valuables. The owner had kept most of the valuables at a safe place because of which the suspects couldn’t find them.”  The bungalow owner’s brother-in-law Hitesh Dhingra (46) of Bavdhan has filed a complaint with the Hinjewadi police. The bungalow is at Windmill Village society at Bavdhan. The main entrance to the bungalow is next to gate number 2 of the society. A security guard with the society, on condition of anonymity, told TOI that the domestic help was from Nepal. “The help took up work at the bungalow after Diwali. Their previous help, who was also from Nepal, had introduced him to the owner,” he said. The guard said he had seen the help walking towards the bungalow with a red bag around 7pm on Monday. “I did not see him after that. Around midnight, I received a call from the bungalow owner from Dubai. He had asked me to check on the bungalow, as his wife and children were not answering his calls,” he said. The guard said when he was at the main gate of the bungalow, the owner’s brother-in-law too reached there. “When I knocked on the gate, it opened, as it was not locked from inside. The owner’s relative asked me to wait outside and he went inside. After sometime, the owner’s son opened the door. He was not in his senses and was not able to walk properly,” the guard said. Senior inspector Sawant said when the police reached the site, they couldn’t find the domestic help and his wife at their quarters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bungalow-domestic-help-drugs-owners-wife-kids/articleshow/88173772.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The day's gains were also helped by the RBI's status quo on rates, market players said. In two sessions, the index has added 1,903 points and has more than recovered the total loss of 1,714 points, recorded in the previous two sessions. During the day, led by Infosys, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, the sensex gained 1.8% to close at 58,650. And as in the last few sessions, Wednesday's gains came despite strong selling by foreign funds with the day's net outflow figure at Rs 579 crore, BSE data showed. The day's gains also added about Rs 4 lakh crore to investors' wealth with the BSE's market capitalisation at over Rs 267 lakh crore, data showed. During the day, the RBI kept interest rates unchanged, continuing with its accommodative stance which in turn is expected to support economic growth. According to Naveen Kulkarni, chief investment officer, Axis Securities, the RBI is supportive of getting the economic growth on track as it continues with a soft interest rate regime and calibrated liquidity conditions in the system. "We believe that RBI prioritising growth with an eye on inflation will keep the hardening of interest rates gradual and the Budget in February to be a key trigger for the markets." The day's session saw across-the-board buying with auto, IT and consumer goods stocks leading. Among the 30 sensex stocks, 28 closed higher. In the broader market, however, the advance-decline ratio was less skewed with 2,313 gainers to 980 laggards, BSE data showed. After two consecutive sessions of strong gains, market players now believe Thursday could witness some profit-booking. A less-volatile session on Dalal Street could also be backed by the flat trading session witnessed in the US market in mid-session. The rupee fell to a near two-month low of 75.5 against the dollar on Wednesday as the RBI's monetary policy decision failed to enthuse forex market participants. "The rupee has reacted slightly negative. The RBI has maintained an accommodative stance even after global central banks are gradually withdrawing loose monetary policy," Dilip Parmar of HDFC Securities, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-surges-1016-pts-on-rbi-move-us-rally/articleshow/88175073.cms||---

He said the tendency to hire helps without seeking their police verification is causing trouble in checking crimes done by maids and domestic helps. A bungalow owner from Bavdhan told TOI, “It is very difficult to know the criminal past of a person approaching for maid or help’s job. We have to believe the person who introduces him/her to us.” Another bungalow owner said it was not always feasible to hire the services of private security agencies as their charges are quite exorbitant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/background-check-not-done-before-hiring-say-police/articleshow/88173778.cms||---

The civic administration has dug up six roads in peth areas for carrying out utility work like laying of pipelines for the 24x7 water supply project. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to focus on repair of three roads — Laxmi Road, Kumthekar Road and Kelkar Road — on priority, where utility works are almost complete. The repair of other three roads — Tilak road, Bajirao road and Shivaji road — will start in full swing after the month-end. “We have prepared a master plan for roads in Peth areas. It has been submitted to the road department and works are being carried out. The work orders for six main roads as well as by-lanes have been issued. There is no fund crunch for these works,” said Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee. He said that the PMC has been directed to complete the ongoing work of digging road and laying pipeline by December 30. After that the civic body would complete the repair of all roads. Since the start of the work in the pre-monsoon period, civic activists and group of elected members had raised objection to road digging. They claimed that the work had been causing a lot of problem for the public, which increased during the rainy season due to waterlogging. The roads had become-accident prone due to this. Nearly 115km road had been dug up across the civic areas this year. It was done for laying pipelines for the 24x7 water supply project. The other work related to replacement of old drainage lines in downtown city areas. These works were being carried out as special project even after the expiry of the regular deadline for digging and road repair on May 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/road-work-to-continue-in-peth-areas-till-year-end/articleshow/88173774.cms||---

Many international guests from Europe, as well as the US, who were planning to hold weddings in Pune have now cancelled their bookings, the Poona Hoteliers’ Association (PHA) sources told TOI. Amit Kumar Sharma, general manager, Amanora The Fern Hotel & Club, Pune, as well as vice-president, PHA, said, “Many NRIs planning weddings in Pune have now cancelled or postponed the events after reports of the new variant and stricter rules for international travel. I have received cancellation for three weddings recently, one of which involved the bride and groom, settled in the US, coming to Pune to get married.” “Even domestic weddings are being cancelled. Quite a few room bookings by corporates were also recently cancelled. Though the current cancellation rate is approximately 8-10%, hotels fear that there could be a rise in this percentage.” Biswajit Biswas, general manager, Fort JadhavGADH, a heritage luxury fort hotel, told TOI, “A lot of cancellations are being recorded in the corporate as well as NRI wedding segment for December and January 2022.

---||Hyderabad||Why wasn’t KVP’s statement recorded in OMC illegal mining case: HC to CBI||HYDERABAD: Justice K Lakshman of the Telangana high court on Wednesday sought to know from CBI as to why it did not examine and record the statement of then advisor of AP government and former Rajya Sabha MP KVP Ramachandra Rao in the illegal mining case registered by the CBI against BJP leader and former Karnataka minister Gali Janardhan Reddy and his Obulapuram Mining Company (OMC). The judge made this remark while hearing a petition filed by senior IAS officer and AP’s former industries and mines secretary Y Srilakshmi who was praying the court to quash the CBI case filed against her in the OMC case. Wondering why the statement of KVP was not recorded even after several allegations came to the fore, the judge sought replies from the CBI by Thursday. The query came from the judge when CBI counsel K Surender said that Srilakshmi acted in an illegal manner in granting mining leases to OMC and in ignoring applications from other applicants who were vying for the same mining rights in the Obulapuram area of Anantapur district which has a huge border with neighbouring Karnataka. Citing a statement given by Sashi Kumar, one such rival applicant, the CBI counsel said how Srilakshmi described the mining business as a profitable one and the mining lease cannot be granted to anyone without paying crores of rupees as bribes. “In one of my meetings with her during 2006-2007, she also advised me to meet Ramachandra Rao and negotiate with him about amounts to be paid to the officials in tune with the hierarchy of the department,” Shashi Kumar said in his statement. The CBI counsel read out a portion of this statement that also said that she demanded Rs 8 lakh as her share alone. She also suggested that Shashi Kumar should meet then director of mines VD Rajagopal. “If he sends me a favorable note, then it becomes easy for me to clear the file, Srilaskshmi said. Unless I pay the bribes as was decided by KVP, I will never be able to start a business in mining, this was the ultimatum served by Srilakshmi,” Shashi Kumar said. CBI DSP RM Khan recorded the statement of Shashi Kumar and it was made part of the record in the OMC case that is currently pending before a CBI court in Hyderabad. K Raghavacharyulu, counsel for Srilakshmi, argued that CBI was trying to make out a case when there was none. The hearing will resume on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/why-wasnt-kvps-statement-recordedin-omc-illegal-mining-case-hc-to-cbi/articleshow/88173780.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The samples were sent to the National Centre for Cell Science, Pune. It is likely that the two Russian men (or one of them) who travelled to Goa by air recently and boarded the cargo vessel in Mormugao reportedly infected three others already onboard. Contact tracing was carried out at the hotel where the two Russians were staying before they boarded the vessel. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/one-suspect-at-smrc-taken-off-oxygen/articleshow/88173154.cms||---

The women are largely from the local area in and around Baramati in the Pune district, where Piaggio’s manufacturing facilities are located. Piaggio added that the women had been recruited from various technical training institutes in the area, and were upskilled by the firm in various auto manufacturing and electric vehicle (EV) concepts. Those include battery management system (BMS), e-box, and others. “I want to remark that this is only the starting point and we have a long way to go. We will include more women at the assembly line, plant premises, and offices. This is not just to empower women but also to bring workforce equality in the auto sector which was long due,” said Diego Graffi, chairman and MD of Piaggio India. The assembly-line is rolling out vehicle in the E-City and E-Xtra models, which have varied capacities and sizes, with both having fixed and swappable battery options, Piaggio added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/piaggio-rolls-out-evs-from-assembly-line-staffed-by-women/articleshow/88173789.cms||---

Earlier, zoo authorises had confirmed that that they were thinking of opening the facility in November after all technological upgrades were completed to make the visitors’ experience safer. The facility has been closed sincethe outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. Rajkumar Jadhav, the director of Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Research Center, said, “We are following orders of the PMC, who are in turn are following the state government’s orders regarding reopening the zoo for the public. While we have taken all the precautions and safety measures, it might not seem feasible to reopen with only 25% capacity, and no more than 1,000 people allowed to gather at one place, which is the regulation for open spaces by the state government. The decision to delay reopening is taken considering the Omicron strain.” Meanwhile, the PMC’s IT department has been working on a new website for the zoo and it would be launched shortly. While this indefinite delay in reopening the zoo has disappointed visitors, morning walkers have been inconvenienced with the early timings of gardens across the city. “It is difficult to get up as early during winter mornings and go for a walk. It will be convenient if the timings for gardens are delayed by an hour,” said Sakshi Dubey, a Wanowrie-based resident. Ashok Ghorpade, head of PMC’s garden department, said, “The timings for PMC gardens are 6am to 10am and 4pm to 7pm. There were cases where some walkers were turned away by the staff at a garden in Katraj, but that was because there was a new person on the job who claimed to not be aware of the timings, but they were corrected. In view of the omicron situation, people should understand such regulations are made for their own safety. ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/plan-to-reopen-katraj-zoo-postponed/articleshow/88173788.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Of the 190 low-floor air-conditioned buses, which are with the KSRTC given to the corporation under the JNNURM, 110 buses are ready to resume services while the remaining are in off-road condition, he said. Responding to the reports that JNNURM buses are rusting in the KSRTC depot in Thevara, Ernakulam, the CMD said that because of their larger body and higher turning radius, the buses have not been found useful for city services and were put to use for long-distance services. He said that as many as 32 buses are operating in the Thiruvananthapuram-Kozhikode route and 18 in the Pamba-Nilackal route. After Covid-19 hit, the buses had to stop the service as the public does not prefer air-conditioned buses. Even then, of the 190 buses, 110 are ready to resume service. Of the remaining 80 buses, three buses ended up off-road in 2018, 20 in 2019 and five in 2020. The maintenance and repair of these vehicles need at least Rs 5 crore, which is not possible, given the heavy financial crisis that the KSRTC is going through. Even though the remaining 110 are ready for operations, because of the non-availability of passengers, the services have been put on hold, he said. The CMD said that 55-60% of the income received by KSRTC have to be spent on spare parts and fuel and from the remaining, the loans have to be repaid. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to find the money for repairing these buses. He said that the corporation's priority at present is to ready 680 buses for roads, but only 220 could be readied because of the huge financial liability. The JNNURM buses have only 2.63 kmpl mileage, and since the diesel rates rose to Rs 103 per litre, the expenses of the JNNURM buses is almost Rs 40 per km. With the addition of expenses for spare parts and tyres, the cost would be Rs 50-55 per km for these buses. Despite these, the low floor AC buses under the JNNURM have no market. Under these circumstances, the question before the KSRTC management is whether money should be spent on buses with more mileage and those which people should prefer to travel or the low-floor AC buses, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/80-jnnurm-buses-not-in-running-condition/articleshow/88173790.cms||---

Despite being assured by officials that there is no chance of an earthquake, villagers are not in a mood to believe their words. Several people have already left their houses. However, the officialssaid such incidents are normal in the post-monsoon period after heavy rainfall. They made it clear that repeated tremors felt here in the past fortnight were result of a phenomenon called ‘hydro-seismicity’. According to reports, mild tremors first struck villages including Gurivimakula Palli, S. Gollapalli, Krishnanagar Colony, Palli Kuppam, Gadduru, and Pedda Garikapalli of Ramakuppam mandal in the late hours on November 26. When contacted, an official from the department of mines and geology said micro tremors of this nature normally occur during the post-monsoon period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/frequent-minor-tremors-give-sleepless-nights-to-villagers/articleshow/88173145.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Hyderabad||Stop auction of coal blocks: CM K Chandrasekhar Rao to PM Modi||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to stop auctioning of four coal blocks in Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL). After the coal ministry decided to the auction coal blocks, SCCL unions gave a call to go on strike. The unions will go on strike for three days from Thursday opposing the Centre’s move to auction four coal blocks in Singareni. On Wednesday, KCR wrote a letter to the PM requesting him to stop the proposal by the Union coal ministry. In his letter, the CM stated that the SCCL was producing 65 million tonnes of coal every year and had been playing a key role in catering to the needs of thermal power plants in Telangana, AP, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. He said that after bifurcation of the state, the maximum demand for power was 5,661 MW in 2014 in the state and by March 2021, it went up to 13,688 MW and it is essential to supply coal uninterruptedly for the generation of thermal power. Based on Singareni’s needs, the state government had issued several mining licences, which the Centre was aware of and the coal ministry also gave its green signal. The CM urged the PM to instruct the coal ministry to stop the auction of JBROC-3, Sravanpally opencast, Koyagudem OC-3 and KK-6 undergrond block under Union ministry’s trench 13, as it would adversely impact the needs of Singareni jurisdiction for coal. He also urged the PM to allocate these blocks to Singareni company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stop-auction-of-coalblocks-kcr-to-modi/articleshow/88173796.cms||---
---||Surat||‘Police not at fault for the aborted landing’||SURAT: With the Surat airport authorities blaming the city police for the aborted landing of a nine-seater Ventura Airconnect aircraft at Surat airport on November 22 soon after an anti-hijacking mock drill, the city police chief Ajay Tomar on Wednesday has come out strongly in defence of his personnel. The aviation watchdog Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had ordered a probe after the pilot of the aircraft reported that he had to abort landing at Surat airport as there were five police vehicles moving on the runway. The airport authorities, in their report to DGCA, have blamed the Surat police personnel saying that despite no instructions, the cops went towards the runway in their vehicles after the mock drill was over. This happened after a routine anti-hijacking mock drill organized by the Airport Authority of India, Surat in coordination with local police, fire brigade, and other security agencies last month. “City police are not at fault at any point. We have all the facts on record and will provide it to any agency if asked for,” Tomar told TOI. According to sources at Surat airport, after the mock drill was over, all agencies and vehicles move away from the operational area. But the five police vehicles went towards the runway at full speed. At the same time, a nine-seater aircraft approached for landing. When the pilot saw vehicles he aborted the landing and informed air traffic control (ATC). Meanwhile, a senior official of Ventura AirConnect said, “The ATC alerted our pilot when the aircraft was around 1,000 feet in air. As a precautionary measure, they (ATC) instructed the pilot to take one round and land after a while.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/police-not-at-fault-for-the-aborted-landing/articleshow/88172381.cms||---
---||Mumbai||May take 30 years to clear all criminal cases in Mumbai: Praja||MUMBAI: How long would it take for giving out judgments in all serious IPC offences that are pending before Mumbai courts as of 2020? An analysis by non-profit Praja Foundation says it could take 30 years, assuming no further cases go up for trial. The figure was arrived at after taking into account the average number of judgments passed and withdrawals (2550 cases) in the past five years. Pendency of trials in crimes against women was alarmingly high at 98% towards the end of last year, data with the NGO revealed. "High pendency of trials and low conviction rates for serious crimes could end up creating havoc in society," said Nitai Mehta, Trustee, Praja Foundation. For instance, 85% of accused in serious IPC crimes (called Class II offences) were acquitted by sessions courts as of last year. Massive shortages of personnel in the police department, scientific officers in the forensic department, public prosecutors and judges in the sessions court have been cited as a key cause. "All sanctioned posts of scientific officers are vacant. It borders on the absurd that these positions cant be filled up," added Mehta. Praja data shows that 50% cases sent to the forensic department were pending as of last year. High Court lawyer Aditya Pratap added that on several occasions chargesheets are filed without forensic reports as the laboratories take several months to prepare them. There appears to be a pressing need for overhaul of infrastructure. "Magistrates of lower courts are severely overburdened. Each magistrate hears offences recorded at three to four police stations and sometimes, there are 200 matters listed per day. There is a need to increase magistrate courts so as to have one magistrate per police station," said Pratap. Experts suggested that lower and district level courts digitize themselves on priority. "The prime requirement is to enhance the number of courts and prosecutors. Secondly, a more liberal approach is required to bring a larger category of offences under the ambit of plea bargaining and summary trials through legislation," said former IPS officer SPS Yadav. Research by Praja showed delays in police investigation as well. Chargesheets were submitted in just 21% of serious offences by the police as of last year. RTI Activist Arati Chauhan said that any holes left behind in the evidence by investigators would ultimately benefit the accused. The police department also had a 19% shortfall in manpower as of July 2021. "Every policeman who has completed seven years of service must be given the task of filing chargesheets to overcome the shortage of investigating officers," said former DGP Praveen Dixit. With the increasing urban population of Mumbai, it is not just important to fill the remaining sanctioned posts, but also to revisit the number of sanctioned posts each year to cope up with the increasing number of trials. Police reforms in the form of implementation of the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) is needed at divisional level. PCA can receive complaints and has the power to conduct enquiries, hearings and give final orders in the form of recommendations to the state government regarding serious violation of law or abuse of lawful authority by police authorities. It has been established in Maharashtra but not all divisional PCAs have been set up. State Security Commission (SSC) that lays down broad policy guidelines and evaluate the performance of the police has also not been established.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shortage-of-cops-forensic-officers-a-key-reason-for-pendency-of-cases/articleshow/88173791.cms||Nitasha Natu

One of the CCTV cameras installed on the society premises has captured the thieves. “They were three thieves. Two of them checked the bicycles at the parking lot of all the four buildings. They then cut the locks,” Nehete said. He said the height of the society’s compound wall was low. “The duo kept the cycles near the compound wall and then passed the bicycles to their accomplice, who was waiting outside,” Nehete added. Chandrashekhar Dere, whose new bicycle was stolen, said, “The thieves selected only branded bicycles. I had locked my bicycle with my other bicycle but they stole the new one.” He said, “Our neighbour had put three locks on his bicycle but they cut all the three locks and stole his bicycle.” Senior inspector Balkrishna Sawant of the Hinjewadi police told TOI that a case of theft has been registered. “We have our regular night patrolling in Bavdhan area. But, it is not possible to visit every society. The residents should deploy private security to guard their premises,” Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/5-cycles-worth-rs-1l-stolen-from-bavdhan-society/articleshow/88173798.cms||Mihir Tanksale

Thrissur fast track special court judge Bindu Sudhakaran has also slapped a fine of Rs 50,000 on the accused Chandran alias Velayudhan, son of Parakkulangara Ayyappan, under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. According to the special prosecutor for Pocso cases, advocate K P Ajayakumar, the accused had lured the survivor, who was then a school student, to his shop, and sexually assaulted her. The prosecutor said Chandran used to invite the girl, along with her brother, to the shop. He would then send the boy to a nearby hotel after offering him money to buy parotta. The brother had a weakness for parotta, and Chandran was exploiting this to abuse the girl, the prosecutor said. Ajayakumar said the girl went into depression and her class teacher who noticed it, talked with her and the girl opened up about the ordeal she was going through. It was the teacher who then alerted Childline officials. Chandran was arrested by Pazhayannur police in 2016, after investigations. The accused will have to undergo another six months of rigorous imprisonment if he failed to remit the fine. The prosecution had arranged 15 witnesses, 19 documents and five material objects in the case.

---||Mumbai||Minors are victims in over 50% of Mumbai rape cases||MUMBAI: More than half of 767 cases of rape recorded in Mumbai last year were committed against minors, data released by non-profit Praja Foundation shows. Strangers were culprits in only 2% of instances. A majority of offenders were friends, boyfriends, people introduced over social media or men who made false promises of marriage. "POCSO Act makes it mandatory to report and record sexual offences against children which means that police cannot turn away anyone. Anybody can approach a police station to report a sexual crime against a minor. These special provisions could be one of the reasons why numbers of sexual abuse of minors look so high," said Priti Patkar, co-founder of the non-profit, Prerana. Awareness on the issue of sexual crimes against children and laws to deal with it has also evolved considerably over the years. While special courts set up under POCSO Act are supposed to give out judgments within a year, 68% cases took anywhere between one to five years to be completed as of 2020. There are several reasons for delays. Government comes out with policies and laws, but where is the investment in implementing these laws? Justice gets delivered when there is a victim/ witness protection programme, infrastructure and a trained workforce," said Patkar. As of the end of 2020, trials in 28% of total POCSO cases were not even done in special POCSO courts. "The implementation of special laws such as POCSO needs to be effectively monitored-- ensuring special courts try POCSO cases and dispose them off within a year as prescribed by the Act," said Nitai Mehta, trustee of Praja Foundation. "There is a need for a multi-stakeholder approach to be adopted for creating awareness and sensitising people to prevent sexual abuse of children, by engaging with all the stakeholders i.e. children, families, communities, schools, colleges, civil society organisations and the police," he added. The spokesperson of Mumbai Police refused to comment on the data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-minors-are-victims-in-over-50-of-rape-cases/articleshow/88173813.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Business||RBI's push for UPI: E-wallet for small transactions, feature phone payments||MUMBAI: The RBI's big push for Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has the potential to take transactions on the platform to 100 crores a day, according to National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) MD & CEO Dilip Asbe. Two of the key measures include enabling small transactions through an 'on-device' e-wallet in UPI apps, which locks funds in a separate account, while the other is to enable UPI payments on feature phones. UPI transactions have been topping 400 crores a month, largely driven by transactions in smaller cities where the absence of other electronic payment infrastructure makes it easy to send and receive money. The downside of UPI is that every small transaction, including a Rs-5 payment, is treated as an electronic withdrawal from a bank account. This requires both the sending and receiving bank to send an SMS and it reflects as a debit entry in passbooks and statements. More than this, the real cost is the load it causes on the core banking systems as every payment message has to hit the server of two banks for the transaction to complete. Although details are not yet clear, industry people say that an on-device e-wallet would require the owner to transfer some money from their bank account into the UPI e-wallet in the app. The money thus blocked can be used to make small-value payments without the payment message having to hop from phone to payer bank server and the payee bank server before it is confirmed to the recipient. Bankers compare it to the prepaid card used in transports like the Metro, except that it will work with any UPI provider. An on-device e-wallet will also reduce dependence on telecom networks as, in the future, customers can use NFC to transfer funds from their on-device UPI e-wallet to the recipient's device. The RBI has also enabled banks to facilitate payment for IPO subscriptions and purchase of government bonds from the central bank for up to Rs 5 lakh - an increase from the current level of Rs 2 lakh. Announcing the facility, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said that IPO applications of Rs 2-5 lakh constitute approximately 10% of subscription applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbis-push-for-upi-e-wallet-for-small-transactions-feature-phone-payments/articleshow/88175089.cms||Mayur Shetty

In a letter on December 8, the ministry of health and family welfare has reminded states to have their district surveillance teams monitor all international travellers who have arrived in the community and test them on the eight day if they have come from at risk countries, in view of the Omicron variant. State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar on Wednesday said lists of air travellers from at risk countries who have all tested negative till date, have been shared with health centres for testing on the 8th day. “The health centres will trace them and take steps to ensure they are tested. This is taxing and health centres will require the support of staff from the collectorates and panchayats,” he told TOI. The directorate of health services has asked all health centres to increase testing via the gold standard RT-PCR. The ministry on Wednesday asked states to undertake enhanced surveillance of international travellers, continued monitoring of hotspots of new Covid positives within the state, conduct contact tracing along with follow up for 14 days and sending all positive samples for genome sequencing without any delay. States have also been asked to undertake enhanced surveillance to detect unusual events such as new clusters of Covid positive cases, vaccination breakthrough cases, reinfection cases, etc, besides prompt investigation of such events by their rapid response teams. The state’s statistics till date don’t indicate any rise in hospital admissions. “People must continue to take all precautions,” Dr Betodkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/health-dept-to-begin-re-testing-of-air-travellers-from-at-risk-nations/articleshow/88173173.cms||---

The Pune district is only the second in the state to achieve 100% first dose vaccination. The feat was achieved in nearly 11 months after the vaccination started in January. The district’s target population is 83.42 lakh. The first dose vaccination of 83.65 lakh citizens, including floating population, was recorded till 6pm on Wednesday. The CoWin data showed that around 65% of the district’s target population had taken both the jabs. State immunisation officer Sachin Desai told TOI, “Now that we have achieved the first necessary milestone with 100% first dose coverage, we shall make sure that the second dose coverage too picks up the pace.” Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, public health services, congratulated the healthcare workers from the government and private vaccination sites. He said the district would have achieved the 100% first dose vaccination feat much earlier if there were no Diwali holidays. “There has been selfless participation by not only the government staff members but also those from the private vaccination sites. Around 80% vaccination has been covered across government sites, while the private centres contributed with much important 20% coverage across the district,” he said. Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) had achieved over 90% first dose coverage, but many residents of the civic limits took their jabs in other areas. “Our focus will remain on those who are yet to get their second dose. There are over 1.99 lakh citizens who need to get their second dose at the earliest,” he said. The experts said the residents must continue to observe Covid-appropriate behaviour to avoid another outbreak of the contagion. Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Pune chapter, said the 100% coverage for the first dose was no doubt a big achievement, but it should not encourage any kind of lethargy among the citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-district-second-in-state-to-achieve-100-first-dose-vaccination-against-covid-19/articleshow/88173818.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The CM said, "Before deciding about your present and future, think of who constructed the temple for Lord Ram in Ayodhya. You all should keep this in mind -- that no other political outfit, except the BJP, could have done this." He added that he had fulfilled his 2017 promise on the Ayodhya issue. In the Hindu pilgrimage centre to inaugurate a slew of welfare projects worth over Rs 200 crore, Yogi's statement on the Ram mandir was made in the town that is considered to be Krishna's birthplace even as a controversy is brewing amid fresh demands recently for a 'Krishna Janambhoomi temple' in Mathura. Senior leaders of the BJP have of late upped the ante on the issue of a Krishna temple in Mathura. On December 6, UP cabinet minister Chaudhary Laxmi Narayan Singh asked, rhetorically, that if a Krishna temple won't be built in Mathura, will it be made in Lahore or Rawalpindi. That had come a day after the BJP MP from Ballia Ravindra Kushwaha had said, "When the (Narendra) Modi government can repeal the farm laws keeping in mind protests by farmers, it can also withdraw the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 to pave way for construction of a grand temple at Krishna Janambhoomi in Mathura." Yogi's deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had set the cat among the pigeons when he tweeted before any of these leaders that "construction of grand temples in Ayodhya and Kashi is underway and preparations are on for Mathura". Hindu right-wing group Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha has also been threatening to install Krishna's idol at the Shahi Idgah and do aarti at the mosque, permission for which hasn't been given by the administration that has imposed Section 144 in the city. Yogi targeted the Samajwadi Party and said while there is a government now that "has faith and respects devotees of Lord Ram, on the other there is a party which opened fire on them", a reference to the police firing on kar sevaks in Ayodhya in 1990 when SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav was the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/yogi-in-mathura-remember-who-built-ram-mandir-in-ayodhya/articleshow/88172412.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Goa||Goa: ‘In a year, CM’s, ministers’, govt cars will be EVs’||PANAJI: Power minister Nilesh Cabral said on Wednesday that the state aims at installing rooftop solar plants on all government and non-government buildings. He also said the government is focusing on making more charging stations available and is looking at replacing all government vehicles, including those used by the chief minister, with electric vehicles. “We are changing government vehicles used by our bureaucracy, including ministers, CM, administration over the next one year, into 100% electrical vehicles,” Cabral said. Speaking at a conference on renewable energy, Cabral said that the state plans to generate another 35 megawatts of solar energy by the end of 2022, by setting up rooftop solar plants on individual buildings. The government college in Borda and the ITI in Curchorem have already set up rooftop solar power plants which have been commissioned. “The ITI used to have a bill of Rs 57,000 per month. There is now zero billing for them. We intend to target all rooftops in the entire state of Goa and use them to produce renewable energy,” Cabral said. Cabral said that the state is aiming to be 100% dependent on renewable energy, Cabral said. “Goa being a very small state, we will look at a 100% renewable energy model in years to come,” he said. The state government is launching an app to indicate where charging stations can be found. Four commercial charging stations have already been set up, and others are being set up. The cost to use the charging stations is the least in the country, at Rs 8 per unit. The state is focusing on fast-charging stations and low-charging stations for two wheelers. Goa consumes 650 megawatts of power, which touches 695 megawatts on some days, he said, adding that the state has initiated a 110 megawatt solar diversified grid at various places where land parcels are available. This is expected to be done by 2022. The government is also floating tenders for solar plants on dams at Selaulim and others. Meanwhile, member secretary of Goa energy development agency, Sanjeev Joglekar, said that stakeholder meetings were held to chalk out a plan to implement 100% renewable energy in Goa. Discussions were held with the departments of transport, power, waste management, municipality, TCP, agriculture, fisheries as well as stakeholders from hotels and industries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-a-year-cms-mins-govt-cars-will-be-evs/articleshow/88173819.cms||---
---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots: Charges framed against man who pointed a gun at cop||NEW DELHI: A city court has framed charges against Shahrukh Pathan, who had pointed a gun at head constable Deepak Dahiya during the northeast Delhi riots, saying it was not an ordinary case of individuals or groups committing an unlawful act. “These riots are of such a nature as have not been witnessed since the anti-Sikh riots of 1984,” Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat said in the order. The charges were framed against Pathan, Shamim, Abdul Shehzad and Ishtiyaq Malik for the offences under IPC sections 147 and 148 (rioting), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of duty) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), in addition to sections 353 (assault) and 307 (attempt to murder) read with 149 (unlawful assembly). Pathan was also charged under the Arms Act. Kaleem Ahmed was charged for committing an offence under IPC Section 216 (harbouring offender who has escaped from custody or whose apprehension has been ordered). It was observed that Dahiya, in the face of such an attack, resolutely stood his ground and even showed his danda in front of a gun-wielding accused. He showed his devotion to duty, which might have played into the mind of the accused. “In any event, this incident occurred in a flash. To diminish the valour of a brave policeman by arguing it as an act of magnanimity of the accused in not killing the policeman is neither palatable nor legally sound,” the court said. The court noted that from Dahiya’s statement, it was quite apparent that Pathan led a group of rioters, who formed an unlawful assembly on February 24, 2020, fully armed with deadly weapons. It further observed that there was not only the specific statement of Dahiya implicating the accused, but also additional electronic evidence in the form of video footage to nail Pathan’s alleged conduct. “It has been specifically stated that Pathan aimed at the head of Dahiya and fired at him, but he escaped. This statement is enough for attracting Section 307 IPC at the stage of framing of charge,” said the court. Senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy, appearing for Pathan, argued that a careful perusal of the video footage would show that there was no intention on the part of the accused to kill Dahiya. She had further claimed that Pathan was only trying to threaten or intimidate the police officer by firing in the air and his hands, being raised upwards, showed only an intention to scare and not to kill. Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for police, argued that Pathan was visible in the video footage allegedly firing at Dahiya, who was taller than the accused, and missing the target.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/charges-framed-against-man-who-pointed-a-gun-at-cop/articleshow/88173838.cms||Usha Das

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After push from residents, Santacruz gets mini fire station||MUMBAI: After a series of follow ups by local residents, the Mumbai Fire Brigade finally set up a mini fire station at Santacruz on Wednesday. In October this year, TOI had reported how Santacruz residents had raised concerns about lack of a fire station in the area, especially following the blaze at the 60-storied One Avighna Park and another at a 15-storied Kandivli highrise. Three persons were killed in both these incidents. On Tuesday evening, the fire brigade informed Santacruz local corporator Hetal Gala that they plan to start a mini fire station from Wednesday. Gala, a first-time BMC corporator who had followed up with authorities for over three years, said she was surprised as well as happy that things had moved in the right direction. “Although construction of the mini fire station was completed earlier this year, it was not activated. The new mini fire station will be attached to the main fire station at Bandra, and firemen would work in shifts. After TOI report in October, we followed up with BMC commissioner I S Chahal and the additional civic chief after which the matter was pushed further and the station has now been activated,” said Gala. Local BJP MLA Ashish Shelar also took to Twitter where he said, “After rigorous follow up with #BMC Mini Fire Station at JuhuTara Road, S’cruz W is now equipped for seva!.” Chief fire officer Hemant Parab said the plan to start the fire station was pending owing to staff shortage. “As soon as the issue was sorted, it was decided to start the mini station to ensure our response time to any fire incident in any part of the locality does not impact our efforts in dousing the flames. This will be the 19th mini fire station of the fire brigade and we plan to have 10 more of such units,” said Parab. Activist Zoru Bhathena said he had filed an RTI in this regard, seeking details on staff required to man the mini fire station, fire engines planned to be stationed and approximate time in evening traffic taken from existing fire station to reach the plot. “I have not received a reply yet, but I’m happy they have started the fire station. There is a need for everyone to push for such causes meant for larger public good,” said Bhathena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-push-from-residents-scruz-gets-mini-fire-stn/articleshow/88173834.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad civil court gives tea company green nod for saffron||AHMEDABAD: A city civil court has refused to stay a tea packaging firm, Savaliya Tea Packagers Pvt Ltd, from using its label after Gujarat Tea Depot, which sells the Wagh Bakri brand, alleged copyright violation. Wagh Bakri said that Savaliya had adopted a colour scheme and a get-up similar to the ones it has always used. Wagh Bakri had no issue with Savaliya’s brand name, Panchratna. But Wagh Bakri objected to the use of the saffron colour, the colour scheme, and the images in Savaliya’s label. These elements, Wagh Bakri claimed, are similar to the components used on Gujarat Tea Depot label. It claimed that Savaliya’s label is identical and deceptively similar. Besides claiming that deceptive similarity in labels can cause confusion in the mind of a consumer, Gujarat Tea Depot contended that the items featured on the label are the same. It also submitted that upon objection, Savaliya had agreed not to use the label last year, but began using it after introducing a picture of a kettle. In response, Savaliya’s advocate Zahid Shaikh argued that orange or saffron colour cannot be claimed as exclusive or proprietary right by anybody because it is a natural colour and not a created one. This colour can be used in many food items and is the identity of food articles as well, Shaikh said. Even the cup and the saucer printed on the label are not unique, he said. Shaikh also submitted that the plaintiff company had the choice to specify which element should be registered under the Trade Marks Act, and it had chosen a device and not the colour for registration. It was argued that no company can claim monopoly over orange or saffron colour without registering its colour scheme under the trademark laws. The court said after looking at both the labels, it can be stated that there are very few similarities. Orange/saffron colour is all over backgrounds and letters are in white and in upper-case but in different fonts and sizes, the court said. The cup and the saucer are present in both the labels, but the angles are different, the court said. “Saffron/Orange colour is not the distinctive proprietary of the plaintiff,” the court said while rejecting the application to stop Savaliya from using its label. The court also considered that the application was filed without proper delegation of authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-court-gives-tea-company-green-nod-for-saffron/articleshow/88173201.cms||---

---||Agra||Licence of nine fertiliser centres cancelled over DAP irregularities||Agra: The agriculture department of Kasganj district has decided to cancel the licence of nine fertiliser centres run by cooperative societies due to alleged irregularities in the availability of the essential di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) in the region. The step was taken after complaints by farmers of rampant black-marketing. The agriculture department officials following inspection found that DAP was sold directly and the point of sale machine was not used. The sale register at these centres was also incomplete. Farmers had earlier claimed that a bag of DAP weighing 50 kg having MRP Rs 1,210 was being sold at higher rates. Kasganj district agriculture officer Sumit Kumar Chauhan said, “Licences of nine supply centres have been cancelled following irregularities found in sale of DAP. Point of sale machine was not found at three centres, while six centres had sold DAP directly without use of the device. Moreover, no sale register was found. Notices have been issued to secretaries of nine centres seeking their response. It will now be investigated in detail. Fertiliser centres have been directed to ensure sale of DAP is recorded on a POS machine." The short supply of the country’s second-most consumed fertiliser has delayed sowing of potato, wheat, mustard and pulses. It is more worrying for potato farmers, the largest rabi (winter-sown) crop. The DAP requirement, per acre, for it is 100kg. For the past one week, farmers in large numbers have been gathering at the purchase centres. Due to unavailability of the essential fertiliser, they are staging protests and blocking roads in the Agra region. On Wednesday, Gajendra Singh Parihar, Agra region president of Bharatiya Kisan Union, said, “Being a basic nutrient for Rabi crops, the DAP fertiliser has to be sprinkled during the sowing of crops like potato, wheat, mustard and pulses. Potatoes are a major rabi crop in Agra region. Sowing without DAP will reduce the crop yield by 60%. Despite repeated requests, local authorities have been unable to ensure its adequate supply. There is also rampant blackmarketing of DAP."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/licence-of-nine-fertiliser-centres-cancelled-over-dap-irregularities/articleshow/88172450.cms||Deepak Lavania

While the cost of the regular RT-PCR test was reduced from Rs 950 till Sunday to Rs 700 on Monday, it was further reduced by Rs 100 to Rs 600 from Wednesday. Similarly, the cost of Rapid PCR, which provides the result within an hour and saves international flyers the trauma of having to sit at the airport for six-seven hours for the test result before being allowed to travel to the destination, was reduced from Rs 4,000 till Sunday to Rs 3,600 from Monday. On Tuesday, Kolkata airport announced a further reduction of Rs 700 to Rs 2,900 from Wednesday. “The cost of Rapid PCR has been reduced by nearly 27% while that of RT-PCR has been slashed by 33% since Sunday to provide relief to passengers who are facing hardship during the pandemic,” Kolkata airport director C Pattabhi said. Also, the Rapid PCR test is now available for children above 5 years. Till now, testing was available only for travellers above12 years. While all passengers arriving from countries categorized as at-risk are required to mandatorily undergo Covid test, 2% of randomly selected passengers arriving in other international flights are also required to take the Covid test as per the directive from the Union ministry of health and family welfare. India has flights arriving from the UAE, Qatar, Thailand and Bangladesh among the countries that aren’t at-risk yet. Passengers departing for the UAE also need to undertake an RT-PCR test within six hours prior to departure in addition to the regular RT-PCR test within 48 hours prior to departure. Also, with several other countries like the UK and the US announcing RT-PCR tests within a short time window, many passengers are expected to get themselves tested at the airport before flying out and then taking a transit flight from Delhi, Mumbai, Dubai or Doha. While the UK now requires testing within 48 hours prior to departure, US-bound passengers have to get tested the day before the flight. The rate reduction at Kolkata airport was possible following a decision by operator the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to forgo the share of revenue from Covid tests and pass on the benefit to flyers. In Kolkata, AAI is evaluating proposals from other testing laboratories to provide the service at even more competitive rates. Pattabhi also announced the installation of 25 more machines for Rapid PCR testing to take the count to 45. Each machine is capable of testing four samples in an hour. This will enhance Kolkata airports Rapid PCR testing capacity from 80 to 180 per hour. Last week, the number of kiosks for swab collection for RT-PCR tests had been increased from three to six. While Singapore Airlines has been operating a daily flight since November 29, there is a direct Air India flight between London and Kolkata every Sunday. Also, there are multiple flights from Dhaka daily by Emirates, FlyDubai and IndiGo from Dubai. Qatar Airways is operating two flights a week. From Wednesday, Air India will fly to Bangkok two times a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rt-pcr-rapid-pcr-test-charges-at-airport-slashed-twice-in-2-days/articleshow/88152217.cms||Subhro Niyogi

A German-based optical mechanical and digital planetarium projector manufacturer, Carl Zeiss, is likely to get the work order for the installation of state-of-the-art digital 2D/3D RGB (red, green, blue) laser-based projection system along with the chained suspended dome screen. According to sources, the work order would be handed over to the selected firm within a week. Three foreign firms – one each from the UK, France and Germany – had entered the technical and financial bids for the modernisation of the planetarium. The new projection system is expected to be ready within the next one-and-a-half year with an estimated expenditure of Rs 36 crore. The state government has already released funds to the department of science and technology for the upgradation of the planetarium. The new system with digital aids would enhance the viewing experience manifold. A planetarium official said the technological switch from celluloid films to digital 3D stereo projection would produce a unique depiction of the celestial objects with a never-seen-before visual experience. “It will be fully digitalised with 3D as well as 2D shows. It would be equipped with optical hybrid system,” the official added. State science and technology minister Sumit Kumar Singh had earlier said the RGB laser projector would allow exceptional brightness and image intensity and make the viewing experience more vibrant for the people. “The latest projection system would be suitable for the dome-shaped planetarium, which has the base diameter of 16m. Besides, the aluminium screen will also be changed to suspended dome-shaped screen,” he had said. As per the plan, the seating arrangement in the dome-shaped gallery will be redesigned as per the new screen and projection system so that the viewers could get the right angle to watch the shows. “The seating capacity will be reduced to 225 from the existing 261 as more comfortable chairs will be placed, giving spacious space to the viewers for 3D and 2D shows,” the planetarium official said. A high-capacity optical telescope will also come up at the planetarium. The telescope will be procured through the National Council of Science Museums at Rs 10 lakh. The telescope will enable students, researchers and civilians to view astronomical events, including eclipses (lunar and solar), planetary movement and meteor showers. For this, a separate screen will be set up for sky gazers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/german-firm-to-install-laser-based-projection-system-at-planetarium/articleshow/88151357.cms||Faryal Rumi

He told TOI, “We are not thinking about any lockdown in the state as of now. The state task force has given no such directions. We shall closely keep a tab on the situation and take a call on any curbs following the guidance of the Centre, state task force and the chief minister.” The minister said the state task force observed that the Omicron cases were sporadic and travel-related. “Till date, Maharashtra has registered only 10 cases of the Omicron variant and all the infected people have only mild symptoms. We are keeping a close watch. According to the preliminary reports from the world and the country, the cases are mild. Its higher transmissibility has been noticed, but its severity has not yet been established,” he said. The state has sent 65 samples for genomic sequencing. With the Omicron variant detected in 54 countries, the Maharashtra government is stressing on the country’s strategy of screening all incoming overseas passengers and then following it up by tracing high-risk and low-risk contacts. Tope said the local authorities would have to ensure that the norms issued by the state government were followed properly, especially because there had been several gatherings. “The rules are in place and we expect the citizens to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said. The minister said the state would focus on increasing vaccination against Covid-19, So far, a total of 84% population in the state have received the first dose and 46% have been fully vaccinated. “Today’s (on Wednesday) cabinet meeting, too, stressed on the second dose and track those who have been left out,” he said. The local administrations would be following up on the 10% healthcare and frontline workers, who had not yet taken the second dose. On some corporations’ inability to trace the international travellers arriving last month, he said the authorities had the details and all efforts were being made to trace them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-no-lockdown-as-of-now-only-enhanced-testing/articleshow/88173859.cms||Nisha Nambiar

First, they were among the first in the country to take the shot and several studies suggest that the immunity generated by the vaccines reduces with time. Secondly, they are on the forefront in managing Covid-19 cases caused by the new variant and needed extra protection if it were to spread widely. “It’s been over 10 months since we took the vaccine. So, I feel that booster doses should be allowed for healthcare workers at the earliest,” said S Christine, a nursing officer at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital. Dr Dinesh Gora, senior resident at AIIMS Trauma Centre, said studies show that with time, antibody levels decrease and only T-memory cells last. “Booster doses will definitely reduce positivity and complication rates,” he added. Many countries have allowed booster doses for both healthcare workers and immuno-compromised patients, Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, pulmonary medicine and critical care, Apollo Hospital, said, adding that India should allow it too without any further delay. Sources said many healthcare workers were secretly taking additional doses of vaccine against Covid-19 to protect themselves. “The vials have 11 doses. I know doctors who have taken the leftover doses,” a source said. He added that the government should allow it legally, at least for healthcare workers, because they are leading from the front and need extra protection. A booster dose is essentially an additional dose of the vaccine you have already received. Vaccine manufacturers claim it may be needed for two reasons: first, to provide prolonged immunity and second, to fight off the mutant variants. Recently, the scientific advisory group appointed by the central government on Covid immunisation held a meeting to decide whether an additional dose should be allowed to those at high risk of infection or severe illness caused by the coronavirus. But the decision was deferred due to a lack of consensus. “A decision on additional dose for those at high risk of infection and immuno-compromised patients must be taken soon. Also, we need to expedite a decision on vaccinating children. Reports from South Africa, where the Omicron variant is spreading fast, shows many children are also affected,” said Dr R K Tuli, a private practitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/allow-us-to-take-booster-doses-say-health-workers/articleshow/88173868.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

However, he had a bitter experience during his journey back to Bihar due to inordinate delay in the flight. Lande, on his social media page, alleged that he and other passengers were forced to wait inside the aircraft for more than an hour without any intimation. “How can you keep so many Bihari passengers captive inside a box without any announcement,” he wrote. Describing the airline operator’s service as unfortunate and disappointing, he wrote that his flight departure time was 2.55pm and all passengers were made to board it by 2.10pm. “Then the flight remained static at its position till 3.20pm,” he wrote. Lande said all of a sudden, he received an SMS alert that the flight will take off at 4.30pm. “When some of we Biharis raised our voice, the flight finally took off for Patna,” he wrote.

Sharma, on the other hand, has refuted the charges against him, saying these are unsubstantial and that he is ready to face any inquiry. Gurukul Kangri University has recently been in news for its internal rift among the VC and staff members.

The Indian Super League (ISL) club has a three-year agreement with the Salvador do Mundo panchayat, but with a new sarpanch in charge, that MoU was set aside. Instead, Goa – who spent almost Rs 1 crore to develop two grounds, including one exclusively for the locals – were asked to pay a monthly fee of Rs 2 lakh for ground usage, which they refused. Since December 1, Goa were training at the Sesa FA ground in Sirsaim, but returned to their original training base on Thursday. “The club had temporarily moved its first team activities away from the ground for the past week fearing a possible breach in bio-bubble protocols,” the club said in a statement early this week. FC Goa said they were open to discussions with residents of Salvador do Mundo with regards to the project at the football ground. “The last gram sabha meeting where the partnership between FC Goa and the panchayat was discussed did not see a representative of the club present at the venue. The club believes that a fair representation of the matter was not put forth to the residents. “The club is ready to furnish all facts and information in relation to the partnership for the residents of the panchayat, the parents and participants of our programs for them to evaluate the matter in all fairness and transparency,” said FC Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-return-to-salvador-do-mundo-ground-for-training-as-police-provide-security-cover/articleshow/88194463.cms||---

The victim filed a case on December 7 with the Saki Naka police after the accused fraudulently made her part with the one-time password (OTP) to reverse the transactions that he carried out from her two credit cards. The fraud occurred on December 2 when the victim came across a fake number 18004120308 tagged with Living Liquidz shop. The money was siphoned after the victim called the fraudster to check for a delay in the delivery of the liquor. “Many people have fallen victim so far while trying to order wine online. We have sought details from the bank to track the money trails to locate the accused. Also, we are tracking the call records to locate the fraudster,” said a Saki Naka police officer. In the complaint, the victim said, “The fraudster gave a mobile number to communicate further. After placing the order, the fraudster identified as Pankaj Sharma asked me for an advanced payment. When I asked that they never ask for money in advance, the fraudster said that their online payment machine is not working and made me part with my credit card details.” After making the payment hours passed by and the delivery was not made. “I then called on the same mobile number and checked the delay. The fraudster said there was an error and he did not receive the money. I was speaking with the fraudster when Rs 62,000 got debited from the card. When I questioned him, he said it got debited by mistake and said he will reverse the transaction. He generated another OTP and another Rs 61,000 got debited. When I confronted him, he said he will reverse the sum and made me share another OTP and Rs 20,200 got debited. It was then I realized I was duped,” her complaint mentioned. The cyber police had compiled a list of 73-plus telephone numbers that the scamsters had used for defrauding the customers willing to purchase liquor online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sebi-official-duped-of-nearly-rs-1-6-lakh-in-online-liquor-fraud/articleshow/88174755.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

The website on which the complainant saw what he thought was live trading, was found to be not functional. In his FIR with the cyber cell of CID (crime), Subhashchandra Patel, 64, who retired as additional assistant engineer from the state irrigation department in 2015, said the con began on October 27, 2020, when he received a message from an unknown source about an investment proposal. Subhashchandra clicked on a hyperlink in the message and was taken to a foreign exchange website with the contact number of the accused, Sanjay Patel. Subhashchandra contacted Sanjay, who sent him a certificate purportedly issued by on International Finance Service Commission to the forex trading company ‘Galaxy FX Trade’, along with purported profits earned by a few clients. Convinced about the company’s authenticity and lured by the profits, Subhashchadra decided to invest in the firm. On Sanjay’s advice, Subhashchandra invested Rs 2.23 lakh the first time and got a user identity and credential for a trading account on October 28, 2020. Sanjay later showed him the balance sheet of the company and some screenshots showing how Subhashchnadra was earning profits. Sanjay and his aide, Ashish Jain, convinced Subhashchandra to invest more and get another account in some woman’s name. Following Sanjay’s instructions, Subhashchandra invested more money and ended paying them Rs 81 lakh for his and his wife’s trading accounts. The company’s website continued to show that Subhashchandra had almost doubled his investment. When Subhashchandra began asked for his returns in cash, and chose to close his account, both Sanjay and Jain began avoiding him. In January, they stopped taking his calls and Subhashchandra on January 3, found that the company’s website was also closed. He finally approached the cyber cell of CID (crime) and filed a complaint for cheating and breach of trust along with charges under the Information Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/retd-govt-officer-loses-rs-81l-in-forex-trading-con/articleshow/88173228.cms||---

Ambani, whose company has cruised past older companies Airtel and Vodafone Idea to become the country's biggest operator, suggested that all players should work together and collaborate in areas like telecom fibre as the country migrates to newer technologies such as 5G, as well as immersive experiences in enterprise and consumer. "If all the players in the industry work together, we can rapidly achieve a nationwide footprint of fibre, just as we reached mobile telephony to every corner of the country in the last decade," Ambani said in the inaugural address of the 2021 India Mobile Congress. Mittal too spoke about "duplication in the industry", be it in the area of mobile towers or fibre. "We need to start to talk to each other, do co-builds like the world is doing, share more tower infrastructure and ensure that while we fiercely compete, we also collaborate and lower cost structures for serving most affordable tariffs anywhere in the world," he said, seeking more cooperation in the field of 5G. Birla echoed similar sentiments. "As we accelerate this digital shift, we need to collectively address the need for continued investments to enable the journey to 5G, Industry 4.0 and beyond. A robust industry is necessary to invest and accelerate achievement of the Digital India vision."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ambani-mittal-birla-talk-tele-collaboration/articleshow/88175180.cms||Pankaj Doval

The number of active cases is 404, of which 160 are in home isolation and 179 patients are admitted in hospitals, the officials said. “Next few weeks are going to be very crucial.

---||Kochi||Kerala: ED raids residences of PFI leaders in four locations||KOCHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday carried out simultaneous raids at the residences of the local leaders of the Popular Front of India (PFI) in Muvattupuzha, Idukki, Malappuram, and Kannur. The raids, according to sources, were part of a money laundering investigation against the organization and were carried out by a team of ED officials from New Delhi in coordination with sleuths from its regional offices in Kochi and Kozhikode. PFI activists staged protests outside the houses of the leaders against the action by the central agency. They gathered along with Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) activists outside the houses of Tamar Ashraf in Muvattupuzha and Pazhayath Shafeeque at Kannur when the raids were progressing and raised slogans. According to sources, the sleuths reached Ashraf's house at around 7am. Police personnel were also deployed at the locations where the raids took place considering the protests. “There were over 100 PFI sympathizers at the house of Tamar Ashraf and there were six ED officials who had come for the raid. More police officers were deployed. At around 11 am, the officials left with some seized documents,” said a police officer. Ashraf was an accused in the case relating to the chopping of the palm of prof T J Joseph but National Investigation Agency (NIA) had discharged him after taking over the probe. Both Shafeeque and Ashraf are learnt to have had businesses in the UAE. According to ED sources, the raids were linked to the investigation into the source of the fundings received by PFI and that the searches were called off at all locations by Wednesday evening. “ED has registered a case relating to the Hathras incident and CAA protest funding. Earlier, journalist Siddique Kappan was arrested in connection with the Hathras case. Documents have been seized as part of the searches,” said an official source. The central agency had held similar raids in the residences and offices of people connected to the PFI in the recent past as well.  Earlier, ED had filed a preliminary chargesheet against Siddique Kappan and four others before a court in Lucknow. The central agency had claimed that PFI received several crores from abroad for CAA protests. Meanwhile, PFI issued a statement condemning the raids and said that they will fight the move legally and democratically. “Popular Front has always cooperated with all investigations of the ED. The agency has not been able to find any black money dealings or any other illegal dealings. This is an example of the BJP’s government's use of central agencies against political rivals and those who oppose the government,” said A Abdul Sathar, stage general secretary of PFI in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ed-raids-residences-of-pfi-leaders-in-four-locations/articleshow/88172503.cms||---

As per protocol, the national flag will fly half-mast at government buildings and no official event will be held for entertainment purpose during the state mourning from December 9 to 11. Besides, the two-day winter session of the Uttarakhand assembly – scheduled to start from December 9 – has now been extended by a day. On the first day of the session i.e on December 10, members of the Uttarakhand assembly will adopt a condolence motion, expressing profound grief over the demise of Gen Bipin Rawat, who was from the Pauri district of the Himalayan state. The business advisory committee of the state assembly has given its consent to pay tribute to Gen Rawat on the first day of the session. “After paying condolences, the House would be adjourned for the first day,” said Speaker Prem Chand Aggarwal. This is said to be the last assembly session before the upcoming polls. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, a two-minute silence was observed in Gen Rawat’s memory during the BJP legislative party meeting at the CM residence. Expressing grief, CM Dhami said, “It is a huge loss for the country and Uttarakhand. The entire state has lost a family member. Gen Rawat devoted his life to the nation. It is a personal loss for me. He was a simple person who guided me.” In the wake of Gen Rawat's death, the Uttarakhand unit of Congress canceled a press conference and all other party activities on Wednesday. Paying tribute to Army General, former CM Harish Rawat said, “A pall of gloom has descended upon the entire state and country. His achievements brought laurels to the state and we all are extremely proud of him. He has left behind a big vacuum.” Former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat, who is also a Pauri resident, said, “I am speechless. Gen Rawat’s departure has sent the entire Uttarakhand in a state of shock.” Notably, Trivendra Singh Rawat held several interactions with Gen Rawat in his four-year tenure as the state CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cm-announces-three-day-state-mourning-on-gen-bipin-rawats-death-assembly-session-extended-by-a-day/articleshow/88172490.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation citizen’s charter: Deadlines for civic services set, not met||AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s ambitious citizen’s charter which was never implemented in spirit has added to the woes of Amdavadis. The charter, which listed services provided by the civic body and the deadlines to address the issues, remains only on paper or rather, on its website along with a defunct helpline number. As per the state government’s 2016 notification, the charter, The Gujarat (Right of Citizens to Public Services) Act, 2013, was intended to bring accountability in delivery of civic services. The Act required every public authority to publish the names and addresses of the individuals responsible for rendering the notified services within two months of the notification. Five years later, the AMC is yet to provide a detailed note on the commitment of delivery of its services. The results is that civic officials have no accountability which in turn leads to inordinate delay in getting work done, argue locals. In the absence of transparency, one finds a large number of civic complaints that are either re-opened or remain open beyond the prescribed limits. This has led to complaints piling up at many zonal offices. For instance, of the 3.09 lakh complaints that were lodged till October 31 this year, 22,400 complaints in the central zone went beyond the prescribed limit. The posh north-west zone had 11,000 such complaints, the west zone had 19,000 such complaints, while south-west zone had 4,800 complaints. Overall, there were 490 complaints that were opened beyond the prescribed period, while 550 complaints were not attended to at all. As many as 560 complaints were put on hold. The issue came to light in an RTI application filed by Kalupur resident Pankaj Bhatt. “Each of the government departments had to come out with a list of time-bound services within two months of the notification in 2016. But this has not been done as per an RTI reply given to me,” says Bhatt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/citizens-charter-deadlines-for-civic-services-set-not-met/articleshow/88174491.cms||---

Flipkart, Indeed, Infurnia, JP Morgan, Meesho, Microsoft NTT AT, Newzera, Silicon Labs, Suzuki Motor Corp, TSMC and Zomato were among the prominent recruiters at IIT-H in phase 1. “Various initiatives taken in the last two years such as semester-long internship for BTech, interdisciplinary MTech, industry lectures, industry-defined MTech projects and so on have started yielding results and we will continuously improvise on it,” said professor BS Murty, director, IIT-H. The number of students opting for semester-long internships more than doubled to 33 in 2021-22 as compared to 12 in 2020-21. “We revamped the placement office at IIT-H to offer career services two years back with the sole objective of taking care of overall career development of students including counselling to decide the appropriate career. A targeted goal is conducive to achieving, as evident from this year’s placements,” said professor C Krishna Mohan, dean, public and corporate relations.

Once security forces on both sides of the border complete the necessary paperwork, his family members are likely to see him on Thursday. The entire episode was no less than a movie plot for the family of Kartik Biswas (60). The man, who used to run a decorator’s business at Najirpur, developed a mental illness some years back. In November last year Biswas left his house and never returned. His family members knocked on all possible doors to trace him, but to no avail. A few months back, an exporter at Balurghat, a friend of Biswas' son-in-law Jagat Singha, got a call from someone in Bangladesh. The person said a man had met with an accident and authorities in the neighbouring country figured out that he a resident of Najirpur. “He sent us a few photographs and we identified him instantly. He was admitted at Hilli Hospital in Bangladesh where doctors had to operate on him,” Singha said. The repatriation process started and Singha sought the help of a Kolkata-based social worker, Sadekul Islam. “I immediately contacted the state government and the Union Home Minister’s office. I spoke to Vikam K Doraiswami, the High Commissioner of India in Bangladesh. He assured us of all help to get him back to India,” Islam recounted. “A few days back we were informed that the paperwork for his return is almost complete and he will be brought back in a few days. The officials in Bangladesh helped a lot to get him treated. We are yet to know about his health condition,” Islam said. The Biswas family, which had lost all hope of his return, could not believe their ears when they received the good news. Biswas’ wife, who has been suffering from geriatric issues, could not hold back her tearss. “We were hoping against hope all these months. He is diabetic and nobody would have known that unless he told doctors about that. My mother-in-law’s health deteriorated a lot since he went missing. We are happy to bring him back again,” said Singha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mentally-ill-man-from-dakshin-dinajpur-lost-in-bangladesh-to-reunite-with-family/articleshow/88173250.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Delhi||On cam at Asola: Animals most active from 2am-5am||NEW DELHI: The ongoing study of camera traps at Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary to know the behaviour and movement pattern of urban wildlife has revealed a rich diversity of animals, including leopards, palm civets, black-naped hare, grey mongoose, rudy mongoose, striped hyena, porcupine and hog deer. Officials said the initial findings showed that the urban wildlife became most active between 2am and 5am when disturbance was minimised. The study aims to identify the habitat preference of mammals, their migration pattern and estimate their population. Sohail Madan of Bombay Natural History Society said, “The analysis of camera traps shows there was human disturbance for many years. The urban wildlife has adjusted to it as animals are most active between 2am and 5am. Their movement and feeding pattern mostly occurs at night when disturbance is at a minimum.” “The rich diversity of animals detected in camera traps is a result of efforts taken over the years to improve the habitat, create water points and ban entry of trespassers,” added Madan. The study showed that leopards and dogs coexisted in the forest. “The initial study has shown that a leopard hunts a prey and consumes the carcass for 20-40 minutes. It then goes away and dogs consume it for sometime. It appears that the leopards share the same carcass with dogs,” said Madan. According to officials, monkeys and feral cattle are the preferred prey base of leopards living in the sanctuary. Though the estimate of animals living in Asola would be compiled later, forest officials said the study suggested that species diversity was on the rise. Chief wildlife warden Nisheet Saxena said, “This is the first time when the species are being recorded in a systematic manner at the sanctuary through the camera trap study. The species were earlier recorded through sporadic sightings in the past, but the ongoing study can help in future for further verification of records.” The officials are marking the movement and habitat preference of animals. Amit Anand, deputy conservator of forests (south), said, “Through this study, we are looking at a holistic approach to sustain biodiversity. As an increase in biodiversity may end in a man-animal conflict in the future, we are currently taking steps to minimise such incidents by scaling our efforts on protection of wildlife, minimising threats to animals and improving their habitat.” “So far, the forest department has installed 30 camera traps. We are in the process of purchasing more traps. Our target is to install around 150 camera traps by June next year,” added Anand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/on-cam-at-asola-animals-most-active-from-2am-5am/articleshow/88173889.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Ludhiana||After a month, unknown persons booked for tracking taxmen’s vehicles||Ludhiana: In the case of snooping on the state taxation department officials by installing GPS devices in their vehicles, the Dugri police on Tuesday booked unknown persons under sections 420 and 120-B of the IPC. On November 11, Ludhiana mobile wing of the state taxation department had filed a complaint with the police, alleging their vehicles had been bugged with GPS devices. These devices were most probably fixed by some transporters and members of a gang engaged in tax evasion by facilitating movement of goods without proper papers.ASI Balbir Singh, the investigating officer in the case, said, “Acting upon the complaint received from the department, we have registered the FIR. Nine GPS trackers were found in four vehicles. It is being probed in whose names the SIM cards used in these devices were issued and from where the GPS devices were accessed.” The complaint of Randhir Singh, state tax officer, on which the FIR was registered, said, “Our office has been entrusted with the task of acting against tax evaders and we have five vehicles at our disposal. A few days back, I got a secret information that some tax evaders had installed electronic devices in our vehicles. Because of these devices, the tax evaders know beforehand about our movement and they hide their loaded vehicles. When we checked, we found nine GPS trackers in four vehicles: four were found in vehicle number PB-46M-2440, three in vehicle number PB-11AL-3930 and one each in PB-10DM-5793 and PB-91M-0381.” In the complaint, the officer asked the police to take appropriate action as per law against unknown persons who had tracked their movement and fleeced the exchequer of a huge amount of GST.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/after-a-month-unknown-persons-booked-for-tracking-taxmens-vehicles/articleshow/88172515.cms||Mohit Behl

Medical tests were conducted on the girl on Wednesday. The girl had left home to attend coaching classes in the evening but didn’t return. Her brother and father then went to the coaching centre to look for her. However, they were told that she had left an hour back. Her friends told her father that they had seen her speaking to an older boy near a medical store. The father panicked and rushed to the store, and found that the shutter was closed from inside but the lights were on. Finding it strange, he knocked and the boy opened the shutter. When he looked inside, he found his daughter lying unconscious and her clothes messy. He immediately informed the police. In the meantime, the accused's older brother rushed to the spot and started arguing with the girl's brother. Police then took the accused to the police station, and booked him based on a complaint filed by the girl's father. Superintendent of police (city), Ravindra Kumar, told TOI, “A minor girl was found inside a medical store in an objectionable condition with a 17-year-old boy.

At present the state has the production capacity of around 354.43MTs (metric tonnes) of oxygen while the demand is calculated to be only about 65MTs in the hospitals now. “Hence, the state has decided to store adequate oxygen to meet any kind of emergency. We are self-sufficient in oxygen production,’’ said the health minister. Anticipating a third wave of the pandemic the health department has increased the oxygen storage capacity in major hospitals as part of precautionary measures. All the major medical college hospitals have increased oxygen storage capacity. If there were only four oxygen generator units available in the state, now their numbers have been ramped up to 38, she said, adding that, in addition, works are going on for setting up 18 more such units in different hospitals. Once these units are commissioned the state will have the capacity to produce an additional 29.63MTs of oxygen in a day, she added. In addition, the storage capacity of liquid oxygen has also been increased. In both the government and private sectors, at present, the state has a storage capacity of 180.72MTs of liquid oxygen. Steps are on to increase the storage capacity by another 174.72MTs. The minister said the hospitals are also well equipped to meet any emergency and in all major hospitals special wards have been set up to isolate people who have tested positive for the virus. In government hospitals there are 3,107 ICU beds and 2,293 ventilators, out of which 267 ICU beds and 77 ventilators are occupied. As many as 983 ICU beds and 219 ventilators are occupied by non-Covid patients. Apart from this 7,468 ICU beds and 2,432 ventilators are available in private hospitals. The private hospitals have given their consent to support the government by providing these ventilators and beds if there is an emergency, said the health minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hosps-have-enough-oxygen-stock-min/articleshow/88180383.cms||---

Speaking in the Parliament, he said: “The Union government does not buy paddy or rice directly from the state. The Telangana government procures paddy and gets it milled and supplies it in the form of rice. We have given them several extensions to send the stocks. Whenever Telangana supplies rice, FCI will take it.” Meanwhile, Congress MP and former Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N Uttam Kumar Reddy said the government has not ordered farmers to stop cultivating paddy.

Two other rotaries are being made near zone D office of MC in Sarabha Nagar and at the entry point of BRS Nagar from Sarabha Nagar. Earlier, traffic lights were installed at Dugri Chowk, but these failed to solve the problem and rotaries were thought to provide the busy intersections a breathing space.At Dugri Chowk, traffic from four major sides merges, creating a huge congestion. Executive engineer of bridges and road department Raman Kaushal said, “We are going to develop a rotary at this busy junction to keep the traffic moving all the time. With lights, the traffic mess did not end. Traffic coming from the bus stand, Dugri, Model Town Extension and Dana Mandi converges here. We are hopeful that it will help the commuters and area residents. Two other places are also getting rotaries where the same problem is witnessed.” However, a city-based architect and one of the directors of Ludhiana Smart City Limited Sanjay Goel said, “In Chandigarh, the administration is preferring traffic lights and removing the rotaries, but here Ludhiana MC is switching to roundabouts. The rotaries can help solve the traffic problem if they are big in size, but at this junction the space is less, so I do not think it will help.” A businessman and resident of Sarabha Nagar, Rahul Verma, said, “The rotary will definitely help in reducing the traffic chaos. A railway overbridge is proposed at Dhuri crossing, so it will be required to increase the pace of vehicles at this junction. Also near MC zone D office and BRS Nagar, this solution is expected to give relief.” However, commuter Harish Sharma said, “If the officials are planning something for the chowks, they should take suggestions from daily commuters, who face difficulties when caught in traffic jams.”  ‘It will not help solve problem’“In Chandigarh, the administration is preferring traffic lights and removing the rotaries, but here Ludhiana MC is switching to roundabouts.

---||Ahmedabad||Effluent discharge: Ahmedabad high court shows pipe reality to industrial units||AHMEDABAD: After the AMC severed drainage connections of 250 industrial units including Ankur Textiles in Raipur, Arvind Ltd in Naroda, and Ashima Ltd in Khokhra, the high court has suggested that the units use the mega pipeline. The AMC had snapped the drainage connections to stop the units from discharging their trade effluents into sewage lines. The HC on Monday recommended that the units discharge their effluents into the mega pipeline which empties its load into Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs). These textile units, which are some of the largest industrial entities in the city, have moved the HC against the disconnection of their drainage connections. The units say that they were adhering to the rules. The HC refused to order any restoration but offered an idea until the industries find a permanent solution. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati opined that these industries can dispose of their treated effluents at the nearest discharge point of the mega pipeline. The bench said the industries can deploy medium or large truck-mounted tankers to carry out the task. The court said the CETPs may benefit since these industries claim that their ETPs treat effluents to a level that makes the discharge almost potable. The court said if the effluents are treated so effectively, the units can recycle the discharge for their own industrial purpose as well, which exemplifies the Zero Liquid Discharge concept. The court said industries may identify the route for laying pipelines connecting to the mega pipeline or the nearest CETP. They may act individually or in a consortium. The AMC can provide Right of Way permission to lay the pipelines, the court said. The textile industries have submitted that laying down a 1km pipeline can cost Rs 50 lakh and they are ready to bear the cost if the authorities grant them the requisite permissions. When the industrial units contended that laying down pipelines would be a difficult task in dense population centres, the HC suggested that the modern technology of micro-tunnelling be considered in densely populated areas. The HC asked the industrial units to discuss these suggestions with the government, the AMC, the GPCB (Gujarat Pollution Control Board), and the joint task force. Court’s environmental concerns Ahmedabad: The high court said that the Sabarmati riverfront has become a pool of polluted stagnant water. It said the river downstream of the riverfront has been reduced to a channel carrying effluents of industries from Naroda, Odhav, Vatva, Narol, and the sewage of Ahmedabad city. “The pathetic and dismal condition of the Sabarmati is a cause of grave concern for the health of the people of Ahmedabad city,” the HC noted in its order. The court also mentioned the villages downstream of the riverfront which rely on the river water for daily use and livelihood. The order said: “Some of the major direct and indirect effects of the high levels of pollution on the people and the environment include the contamination of the groundwater, food contamination, and associated health hazards.” The court also mentioned the loss of the natural river habitat, the depletion of groundwater due to the lack of water recharge, and the loss of flora and fauna. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/effluent-discharge-high-court-shows-pipe-reality-to-industrial-units/articleshow/88174446.cms||---

The petition said that Swan Mills had three units at Kurla, Sewri and Jubilee process (Sewri). Alongwith 17 ot-her mills for the lottery, Swan was given a single code number 57. The workers applied for the lottery. Mhada’s June 20, 2012, circular split 57 into 57 and 57A and divided the applications into two lots for Sewri and Kurla units. The results were declared on June 28, 2012. Of the 4,718 applications in respect of Swan Mills, 695 were allotted tenements. The winners learnt about the split in code number only when they received their allotment letters in September 2012. They were allotted houses at Sewri although employed at Kurla and vice versa. Employees of Sewri unit were asked to furnish proof that they worked at Kurla unit and those of Kurla were asked to prove they worked at Sewri. Many could not and were disqualified. They did not succeed in appeal. Mhada’s advocate P G Lad sought time saying the gover-nment will take necessary st-eps as suggested by the court. Petitioners’ advocates, Arsh-ad Shaikh and Aditya Udeshi, insisted a decision be taken at the earliest considering the plight of the allottees. Adjourning the matter, the judges noted, “We are unable to appreciate how a condition could be subsequently imposed that rendered some of the allottees ineligible on the basis of some requirement. Prima facie it is not sustainable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-frowns-at-mhada-lottery-clause-for-swan-mills-workers/articleshow/88174779.cms||Rosy Sequeira

In the first operation, five people who offered lift to people and robbed them later have been arrested from Kashmere Gate police station. According to DCP (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi, the gang was busted by a team led by inspector Dharmender on a sole clue that one of the rear lights of the vehicle was not working. On December 3, the cops had received a PCR call from a hospital about a person who sustained injuries during a robbery bid. Police reached the hospital and recorded the statement of the victim, who said that he had come to ISBT Kashmere Gate from Agra after attending a wedding function. Around 8pm, a white car with a commercial numberplate stopped near him. The driver asked the victim about his destination and got ready to drop him for Rs 50. After a drive of about 1-2km near Geeta Colony flyover, the occupants of the car, some of whom had joined later, overpowered the victim and started physically assaulting him. One of the accused choked the victim and one put a knife on his chest. They robbed his gold ring, mobile phone, bag, Rs 3,000 cash, and then thrashed him. In the second operation, two robbers were arrested from Sarai Rohilla police station for robbing a cash collection agent of over Rs 17 lakh by staging an accident.

District tourism officer, Rahul Choubey, told TOI, “Facilities like a café, a yoga centre, and a meditation centre, among others, will be built in the village, located at an altitude of 2,116 metres.” He added that at least 15 homestays are currently being built in the village. “All these homestays will be run by village locals,” said Choubey. Further, a market will be set up in the village for locally-made products. This, according to district officials, will encourage self-employment in the region. At present, devotees of the Sun god trek for three kilometres to reach the Katarmal temple, locally known as Bara Aditya Mandir. In order to attract more tourists, the village will be also marketed as a trekking destination. Located 17 kilometres from Almora, the Katarmal temple is also famous for its unique architecture. Apart from beautifully carved pillars and doors, the temple also has intricate stone and metallic sculptures. The temple, built by Katyuri king Katarmalla in the nine century AD, is surrounded by 45 smaller shrines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/katarmal-housing-sun-temple-to-become-the-first-spiritual-village-of-kumaon/articleshow/88172530.cms||---

The mahila police station (west) lodged an FIR against Ronak Gohel and Chauhan on a complaint filed by a 31-year-old woman, who claimed sexual exploitation and was pressurised for abortion. She alleged that Gohel had raped her on various occasions by giving her a false promise of marriage and giving her a position in a political party. Chauhan was accused of abetment in the offence by accompanying the woman to a clinic for medical termination of preganancy in July 2019. The duo was booked under section 376, 506(2), 312 and 114 of IPC. While Gohel is absconding, Chauhan approached the court for legal protection against possible arrest. He claimed innocence, but the prosecution submitted that Chauhan had accompanied the woman to the clinic and signed consent form as her brother and changed his name from Mahavir Chauhan to Mahavir Shah. The prosecutor also opposed the application submitting that the investigation is in a nascent stage and the accused might tamper with evidence. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-denies-pre-arrest-bail/articleshow/88173279.cms||---

While the family members were allowed to go home, the corporators and other voters were taken to a luxury resort in Pench Tiger Reserve. They will be brought straight to the polling booth on Friday at 8 am, according to party’s senior office bearers.“The Nagpur Municipal Corporation corporators and, Zilla Parishad members and municipal councillors can go home after casting their votes,” the office-bearers told TOI.About 334 elected representatives from the saffron party were whisked away with the families last week to various tourist places in other states where the party is in the government. It included Goa, Karnataka, Gujarat and others. Some were even sent to Orissa. They stayed in five-star hotels at the party’s expense.Though most of them were sent by flights, a majority returned by buses to avoid going through RT-PCR tests at airports. Those who landed by plane were received by top BJP functionaries at the airport. However, BJP members said that many of them were made to undergo RT-PCR test at their place of stay on Monday. If found Covid-19 positive, necessary arrangements had been made to ensure that they could vote between 3pm and 4 pm, as directed by the returning officer.According to members, the voters were whisked away to various destinations to prevent Congress and other opposition parties from poaching them, just like they did with Ravindra Bhoyar, who switched over from BJP and is now the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) candidate.Since all three MVA constituents did not have requisite numbers, there was no other alternative for them than to woo BJP’s voters on the promise of financial prospects. “If the MVA partners are trying to contact our elected representatives, we are also in touch with their several corporators and Zilla Parishad members. Though our victory is guaranteed, the margin of opposition’s defeat would be much bigger than expected. With the BSP and MIM deciding to abstain from voting, Congress’ margin would reduce further,” said BJP members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-voters-return-from-picnic-ushered-to-resorts/articleshow/88172549.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala CM writes to PM, requests clearance for SilverLine plan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to give clearance to the proposed semi-high speed rail project in state called SilverLine. The chief minister approached the prime minister after Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw expressed concerns over sanctioning the project citing the present financial position of Indian Railways. In his letter, the chief minister said that the semi-high speed rail project has been included in the mega infrastructure projects under National Rail Plan (NRP) in the previous Union budget. He said that the construction of a pan-India future ready railway system will catalyse massive economic growth and improve ease of living and would not only benefit the state, but also the nation, contributing both to the economy and also the environment. He added that based on discussions with the Centre, the state has already agreed to meet the entire land acquisition cost of Rs 13,700 crore and has agreed, in-principle, to meet the liability arising from any default on external debt obligation undertaken by Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd (K-Rail) for the project. “Without the land acquisition cost, project’s equity internal rate of return is 13.55% and hence viable as per the agreement between the ministry of railways and the government of Kerala,” he said. The chief minister also enclosed a report of the K-Rail titled ‘Impact of SilverLine (semi high-speed rail) from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod on the Indian Railway System and the measures for augmenting the revenue of Indian Railway’ along with his letter to the prime minister. The report highlighted the project’s anticipated contributions to the railway system. He requested the prime minister to intervene in this matter and accord sanction for the project, citing that it would be a milestone in the progress of Kerala. When the chief minister had met the Union railway minister on October 22, he had said that more discussions and clarity are required on the funding for the project, in which the equity participation of the railways is Rs 2,150 crore, apart from railway land which is worth Rs 975 crore. The chief minister had met the Union minister for clearance from the railway board and also the Union cabinet. The DPR for the project is currently with the ministry of railways for approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-writes-to-pm-requests-clearance-for-silverline-plan/articleshow/88172564.cms||---

As the strike by resident doctors entered the second day on Wednesday, OPD (out-patient department) services were hit with more than 3,000 doctors abstaining from duty. The medicos of BJ Medical College sat on a dharna on Tuesday night after a senior faculty member threatened them with dire action if they did not call off their strike. The Junior Doctors’ Association (JDA) at BJ Medical College alleged that the head of the department for medicine, Dr Kamlesh Upadhyay, asked students to give in writing that they are ending their strike. “He threatened to have us fail the exams if we did not listen to his advice,” according to a JDA member. “As a result, we sat on a dharna before him on Tuesday night and complained to the authorities.” The doctors say that the delay in counselling for NEET-PG has led to a shortage of doctors at civil hospitals and has increased their workload. Apart from students of the six government-run medical colleges in Gujarat, several resident doctors of trust- and society-run medical colleges have joined the strike and away from the OPD duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/doctors-strike-dharna-after-threat-from-faculty-member/articleshow/88174480.cms||---

Even as fear of the Omicron variant looms large, the university has decided to get back to the pre-pandemic times by calling all the students for physical classes. To begin with, 10 days of induction programme will be held from December 9 and classes shall commence from December 20. “All the second to fourth year students had made a comeback to the colleges for physical classes a few months back. Since we did not get any specific guidelines from the higher education department on Omicron, we decided to call even the first-year students for physical classes,” said Manzoor Hussain, JNTUH registrar. According to the academic calendar for first-year first semester BTech and BPharmacy students, the first spell of classes will be held from December 20 to February 12 after which first midterm exams will be held from February 14 to February 19.

The syndicate cited concern over the new virus variant Omicron as the reason behind not holding exams offline. The syndicate meeting, held in offline mode after a long gap on Wednesday afternoon, had the UG and PG examinations in January and February as the main agenda. Third and fifth semester examinations of UG courses will start from middle of January along with third semester examinations of postgraduate courses. First semester examinations in both UG and PG courses will be held in February. After nearly 20 months shutdown, offline classes resumed at CU from November 16. Most departments are following a hybrid mode for conducting regular classes in both online and offline modes. Few departments are holding classes on alternate days to maintain Covid protocols. Around 160 affiliated colleges are following their own methods to conduct classes. The syndicate felt conducting offline exams with full strength of students in each department will make social distancing difficult. Vice-chancellor Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee said, “The syndicate unanimously decided to conduct the UG and PG exams in online mode because of concerns about the new variant. After all, health is the first priority.” The decision will be communicated to all affiliated colleges. According to sources, the university has received huge number of applications from students asking for exams in online mode. For the past two years, evaluation has been carried out through open book exams. Calcutta University Teachers’ Association general secretary Sankhayan Choudhury felt the academic issues should have been discussed with teachers before taking such an important a decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/concern-over-omicron-cu-to-conduct-ug-pg-exams-online/articleshow/88173277.cms||---

The four companies — Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Limited (PGVCL),Uttar Gujarat Vij Company Limited (UGVCL), Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Limited(MGVCL) and Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company Limited (DGVCL) — have filed petitions with the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) to determine tariffs for 2022-23. The companies refrained from revising tariffs for the next fiscal on the grounds that the consolidated revenue shortfall for all four discoms is estimated to be Rs 568 crore, which can be met through efficient improvement measures. As a result, they have not proposed any changes in the tariff structure for 2022-23. “For the fifth consecutive year, GUVNL-affiliated discoms have not demanded any increase in tariff. However, the tariff is indirectly increased every year via increase in FPPPA (Fuel Price and Power Purchase Adjustment) charges,” said K K Bajaj, a city-based energy and regulatory expert. “On paper, the lowest slab of tariffs for residential consumer is Rs 3.20 per unit but a consumer pays nearly Rs 7.00 per unit on including FPPPA (fuel surcharge) charges and government duty,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-power-tariff-hike-proposed-for-fiscal-2023/articleshow/88174482.cms||---
---||Delhi||EDMC to let private nurseries use its big parks for maintenance||NEW DELHI: East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has finalised a plan to invite private nurseries registered with Indian Nurserymen Association for using 20% area of a park measuring above one acre for their operations in lieu of maintaining the public facility. The project, to be taken up on the public-private partnership (PPP) basis, has been approved by the commissioner and will be presented in the next standing committee meeting. The nursery owners will have to pay a licensing fee to the civic body and give plants and shrubs for beautification. EDMC has around 2,200 parks spread over 900 acres, with Delhi Development Authority transferring some of them recently. Due to shortage of staff and funds, the horticulture department is facing difficulty in maintaining them. “Since we are going through a financial crisis, various schemes are being made to give better facilities to the residents. They will have a nursery facility near home from where they can easily buy plants. Maintenance of the parks will also be assured,” said EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand. Eight parks, including those in Mayur Vihar, Preet Vihar and Geeta Colony, will be part of the pilot project, he said. The project will be implemented through open tenders to be awarded for five years, said the commissioner. “The applicants should have at least five years’ experience. The selected nursery owners will pay Rs 37.94 per square metre annually as licence fees to EDMC. They will also give 500 trees, 500 shrubs and 500 indoor plants to the corporation every year, which will be used for beautification of EDMC parks and areas,” Anand pointed out. The corporation will be responsible for supply of water and electricity, said an official. The horticulture department even plans to hand over its five permanent nurseries to private concessionaires later. In October, EDMC revived a scheme to invite residents welfare associations (RWAs)/NGOs for handling maintenance of parks. It has agreed to pay quarterly maintenance amount in advance to these private bodies and started receiving applications for transferring 15% of the total area of a park. “We will soon scrutinise the applications,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/east-corpn-to-let-private-nurseries-use-its-big-parks-for-maintenance/articleshow/88173916.cms||Vibha Sharma

Gen Rawat studied in the Doon-based residential school up to class 10 (from 1969 to 1972) and is one of the most notable alumni of the institution. Speaking to TOI, Cambrian Hall’s principal Sudesh Biala recalled the founder’s day celebrations in 2017 in which Rawat, who was the chief guest, came in school uniform. When he was asked why he had shown up in school uniform, the latter replied that he was “scared that the principal would not let him in if he showed up wearing some other outfit.” “He was extremely good-natured, very disciplined and hard-working," Biala said. “Despite reaching such heights in his career, he held his teachers in great regard. His English teacher, Shanti Swaroop was present in that 2017 function and as a mark of respect, he touched his feet in front of everyone, which showed how rooted he was,” the principal added. Hemant Kochhar, president of the Cambrian Hall Alumni Association, said that “the tragic news of Gen Rawat’s death has shaken all of us.” “I remember meeting him once and found him to be quite humble.

While Haj is performed annually, Umrah or minor pilgrimage can be performed throughout the year. Though Saudi permitted visits of Umrah pilgrims to Haram Sharief in Mecca with some restrictions weeks ago, the 15-day quarantine requirement in a third country — UAE, Russia and Kazakhstan among others — or the five-day quarantine in Saudi Arabia discouraged them. The Saudi Haj ministry issued the revised quarantine norm in a tweet recently. “It is a relief to both the tour operators and pilgrims. We would get a number of enquiries daily about Umrah visas, but were helpless because of the quarantine rule. Now, the number of Indian pilgrims going for Umrah will rise,” said Yusuf Ahmed Khereda of Al Khalid Tours and Travels, one of the first Indian tour operators to have got an Umrah visa issued post-pandemic. “I am so excited that I have got a Umrah visa and will soon travel to Saudi Arabia to pray at the holy mosques in Mecca and Medina and be at the mausoleum of the holy Prophet,” said Imtiyaz Vilatra, country head of corporate house Posterscope OOH. Though Umrah is performed at Mecca, almost all pilgrims also visit Medina to pay tribute to Prophet Muhammad at his mausoleum there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-umrah-pilgrims-tour-operators-rejoice-as-saudi-lifts-quarantine-rule-for-indians/articleshow/88174783.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

This was stated by NBCC chairman Pawan Kumar Gupta. However, the interest rate is yet to be decided by the company’s board of directors. The housing society has 786 flats in 12 14-storey towers that were partially completed in May 2017 and delivered to buyers. However, within two years of completion, the buildings, including their pillars and beams, started developing cracks. IIT-Delhi, which was appointed to conduct a structural audit by Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, in its final report on November 18 said the buildings were unsafe and required major retrofitting. It found substandard material in construction and faulty drawings of the structures. Following this, the company asked the residents to vacate their flats. The residents’ association has asked for additional compensation for mental torture and physical hardship endured by them in the last two years by staying in the shoddily constructed project. Besides, the residents said prices in the locality had doubled since 2011, when they had booked their flats. The association has asked for adequate compensation for them to buy another house. G Mohanty, president, Association of Apartment Owners, said most residents were retired from the central government and had bought the flats thinking as they were being constructed by a Navratna company, they would be safe. “We thought we would live a peaceful post-retirement life, but that has been belied due to omissions and commissions by NBCC and we have been subjected to untold misery,” said Mohanty, who retired as director general, Directorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity, and was also a former CBI spokesperson. Gupta said the board of directors would soon take a final view on the compensation, including interest. Meanwhile, as an interim arrangement, NBCC is ready to pay house rentals for residents to shift out immediately. A survey is also being conducted to ascertain the additional expenditure incurred by the residents in doing the interiors of their flats before shifting there. The company would refund even this cost. The residents were given the first vacation notice on October 3. A second notice was sent on October 13 to vacate the homes by November 10. However, many residents didn’t vacate the flats as they couldn’t find suitable accommodation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/nbcc-to-refund-money-with-interest-to-buyers-in-gurgaon-housing-society/articleshow/88173921.cms||Prabhakar Sinha

For almost nine months, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has tried all to convince these 6,000 individuals to get vaccinated — reaching out through community leaders, school teachers, NGOs and even banners and advertisements. Now, officials will themselves visit these individuals to know why they are not taking the vaccine. Each zonal in-charge and health officials will be provided lists of those in their areas of responsibility. “There is high reluctance owing to a wide variety of disinformation on vaccines that has been spreading on social media,” said a senior AMC official. He adds, “Disinformation like the vaccination drive was a conspiracy by pharma companies to weaken the immune systems so that citizens get used to their drugs, or they cause loss of potency, or that by taking vaccines you disrespect a local goddess. Most of these tropes have been spread on social media and have remained with them since the beginning of the year.” A total of 15,292 individuals were vaccinated on Wednesday at 222 sites in the city. So far, 32.09 lakh individuals have been fully vaccinated and 48.02 lakh have taken their first dose. About the AMC health centre with the highest vaccinations administered, the official said the Chandlodia UHC has vaccinated 1.03 lakh individuals while the Tagore Hall vaccination centre had administered 1.29 lakh vaccines till Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/officials-to-reach-out-to-people-resisting-vaccination/articleshow/88174484.cms||---

Several school principals have requested teachers to avoid tours in the wake of the rising Omicron scare. Schools said that teachers have to stay safe because they will have to help board candidates of ICSE/ISC and CBSE X/XII with their lab practicals and completion of the syllabus for the upcoming board semester two exams in March-April. In fact most schools have cut short winter vacations so that offline classes can start for IX-XII students, with special focus on board year candidates. Most schools are about to break for winter vacations after the ongoing first half of the board exams are over. The CISCE conducted exams will end on December 20, while CBSE conducted exams will get over on December 28. New routines have been fleshed out for offline board year students. “At a time like this no one can afford to be casual. Offline classes in my school will re-start from January 5 and I have requested teachers not to leave state. Most are staying back and even if some leave, we will ask them to come in with Covid negative reports,” said Father Bikash Mondal, principal of Don Bosco Park Circus. A meeting was held on Tuesday at South City International School where senior school teachers were requested formally by principal John Bagul not to leave the state. “It is risky and we need to be up and about for our board year children. I am happy that they agreed. All teachers will come in with negative Covid reports too,” Bagul added. Richard Gasper, principal of St Augustine’s Day School has asked all his senior teachers to reveal holiday plans. “Those will go out of the state will have to come back with an negative report. We cannot infect each other and the children,” he said. Rammohun Mission School has also asked teachers not to leave the state during the break, said principal Sujoy Biswas. “We cannot take any risk now. The schools have finally managed to re-open and the physical board exams are happening this year, which are both steps towards normalisation. We cannot spoil that,” Biswas said. Lakshmipat Singhania Academy is not formally asking teachers not to go out, but director Meena Kak has asked teachers to come back with an RT-PCR negative report if they choose to leave the state. The principal of St Xavier’s Collegiate School, Father Thamacin Arulappan believes in leading by example and said that he would not go out anywhere during the vacation. “Our teachers are aware of the implications and will be doing everything to stay safe. I don’t want to infringe on their rights, but by not going out myself, I am trying to lead by example,” he said. Teachers for board year students at Asian International School have voluntarily given up plans to go out during the break.”We have panned out our work for the term two exams and teachers know that not a single day is to be wasted.

---||Dehradun||Autumn Term-21 Passing Out: Proud moment for gentlemen cadets||Dehradun: Fourteen medals and 7 trophies were bestowed on outstanding gentlemen cadets (GCs) at the award ceremony of Autumn Term-21 Passing Out Course in Khetarpal Auditorium of the Indian Military Academy (IMA), Dehradun. While 7 Book prizes and 15 Rolling trophies were also given out. The year also marks the 50th anniversary of the victory of Indian Armed Forces in the 1971 war and the year is being observed as Swarnim Vijay Varsh in Honour of the Indian soldiers who laid down their lives in the line of duty. To commemorate the occasion, Indian Military Academy has instituted Bangladesh Victory Trophy, which will be awarded to the overall best performing foreign gentleman cadet of the passing out course. Lt Gen Harinder Singh, Commandant, Indian Military Academy, in his address said the battlefield today has extended beyond the frontline, the operational spectrum has become complex, and the adversary does not follow rules. Conflicts today are multi-dimensional with fusion of contact and non-contact warfare, networks, information, and cyber warfare waged by state as well as non-state actors. Addressing the young cadets, Lt Gen Harinder Singh said, “The future would require soldiers to not only have a deep understanding of nature of modern warfare but also be adept and trained to operate in a climate of complex battlefield environment.” The Commandant commended all for having achieved such high standards despite the constraints and challenges due to the spread of Covid-19. As per the IMA authorities, the Commandant’s prize distribution and award ceremony is an important event which recognises and encourages the gentlemen cadets to achieve excellence at individual level and contribute constructively in team effort to infuse a sense of camaraderie amongst them. Accordingly, medals and rolling trophies have been instituted at the IMA, which symbolises the highest standards achieved at individual and group level. Meanwhile with the sudden demise of the CDS Bipin Rawat, various ceremonies lined-up before the Passing Out Parade on 11th December which was also to be attended by the CDS too, may see minor changes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/autumn-term-21-passing-out-proud-moment-for-gentlemen-cadets/articleshow/88172571.cms||Shivani Azad

And his membership stands cancelled under Section 16(A) of Waqf Act, which clearly lays down that only a Shia Muslim is eligible to contest and remain a board member,” Board chairman Ali Zaidi told TOI. Rizvi, who successfully contested and won membership of the Shia waqf board on the mutawalli quota in April this year, is accused of corruption and facing inquiry from various probe agencies, including Central Bureau of Investigation. Talking to TOI, Maulana Syed Raza Hussain Rizvi, member of Shia Waqf Board, said, “The Waqf Act is very clear. You have to be a Muslim to retain membership of the board. The same condition applies to mutawallis of waqf properties.” Rizvi is currently the mutawalli of two prime waqf properties in Old Lucknow — Waqf Miyan Daraab Ali Khan and Waqf Malka Jahan Karbala. Sources told TOI, the Shia Board will also invoke the Waqf Act to disqualify Rizvi’s mutawalli status. Talking to TOI, Board chairman Ali Zaidi, said, “We will give a representation to the state government to immediately annul Rizvi’s waqf board membership.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/wasim-rizvi-no-longer-muslim-to-be-sacked-from-shia-board-soon/articleshow/88173929.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

He has been identified as Dharamveer, who lives in city control room quarters in Civil Lines.A video of the incident had gone viral, showing residents nabbing the cop after he self-injected drugs. It showed the cop being roughed up and questioned by the local shopkeepers. Harish Chabbra, an area resident who caught the cop, said, “For the past four days, we had been keeping a watch on two cops, who in morning, afternoon and evening would go to a vacant plot near a pulley in New Kundanpuri. On Tuesday evening, when the cops came again, we caught hold of them and made their video with syringes and drugs.” “Initially, I was alone, so the two took hold of me and said, ‘You don’t know police, we will throw you in nullah’. My brother who was at a distance came from behind and caught one of them. But the other managed to flee,” Harish added. On being informed, Kailash police post personnel reached the spot and took him away. The police statement said, “ASI Avtar Singh-led police party was at Lisha Market in New Kundanpuri for patrolling when an informer gave a tip-off that at Kundunpuri pulley behind a temple, Dharamveer and an unidentified person were in an intoxicated state and taking drugs.” Police said they reached the spot and arrested the cop while the other person escaped. “A silver sheet was recovered from the site,” they added.Division eight police have booked him under the NDPS Act.ACP (South) Harish Behal said, “Dharamveer has been arrested and placed under suspension.

Of these, 1,015 patients were from other districts and states. The health department data shows this count too is the highest in the past four years.As per the health department data, 2,833 dengue cases were reported in Ludhiana till December 7 evening. Of these, 744 cases were from other districts of Punjab and 271 were from other states.The health department officials said the Punjab districts from which cases were reported in Ludhiana hospitals included Muktsar, Hoshiarpur, Moga, Jalandhar, SBS Nagar, Mansa, Faridkot, Kapurthala, Amritsar, Pathankot, Bathinda and Patiala, among others. And most of the cases here from other states were from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, J&K and Delhi.The total case count and the tally of patients from outside Ludhiana is 56.4% and 55.1%, respectively, more than the previous year.The data shows the number of Ludhiana patients has also been the highest at 1,818 since 2018 when 489 district cases were reported. In 2020, the number of Ludhiana cases was 1,355, which is 34.2% less as compared with cases in 2021.The health department officials said a large number of people from other districts and states come to Ludhiana for diagnosis and treatment, as they believe that the services are better here and it is centrally located. “Besides, a number of people from other districts and states work here, so they get diagnosed and treated here,” they added.Experts said the cases are under reported.“The cases must be more in Ludhiana as a number of patients, especially the poor, don’t get tested and take treatment from quacks. These are likely to be more due to under-construction projects and roads as water gets accumulated there. The health department should depute doctors who go and check the areas where water gets accumulated. The department can then take this up with the officials concerned to ensure that there is no accumulation of water in such areas,” said Dr Narotam Dewan, former president of Ludhiana IMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/sting-in-tail-dist-logs-max-dengue-cases-in-4-years/articleshow/88172594.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Centre writes to SC to seek early hearing in NEET-PG matter||Mumbai: The Union ministry of health and family welfare has written to the Supreme Court seeking an early hearing for the other backward class (OBC) and economically weaker section (EWS) reservations matter in the NEET post-graduate (PG) case for medical students. SC has scheduled the hearing on January 6. The letter mentioned that any further delay in the NEET-UG and PG counselling process could lead to a zero year for this year’s aspirants. Furthermore, the current students are worried that not having an entire batch of resident doctors (first-year PG students) when there is an imminent threat of a third wave in the country could prove detrimental. This came close on the heels of the nationwide protest launched by senior resident doctors over admission delays. The letter specified that the academic session which usually starts in August for MD and MS (PG) and September for MBBS (UG) has been exceptionally delayed this year. “Due to the stay on the counselling process, the future of lakhs of students is at stake... Also, considering the current pandemic situation there are no first-year PG students in the hospitals and their requirement is essential and inevitable to reduce the burden on the second and third year doctors as well as to treat patients,” said the letter. It added that temporary junior residents have been appointed for the time being. The ministry also informed the court about the ongoing protest by resident doctors as they are overburdened. The validity of the Central government notification issued on July 28 applying the OBC and EWS reservations in all-India medical seats in UG and PG courses was challenged in a batch of pleas. In the last hearing, the Central government sought four weeks to submit a report on annual income ceiling for EWS, following which SC scheduled the next date on January 6. The Centre assured that the counselling process will not proceed till the income criteria for EWS eligibility is decided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-centre-writes-to-sc-to-seek-early-hearing-in-neet-pg-matter/articleshow/88174804.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Dehradun||U’khand HC scraps two petitions filed with ‘political malice’, penalises petitioners||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court scrapped two “politically-driven” petitions on Wednesday and imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on the petitioners. Both the petitions were heard by the division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice NS Dhanik. The first petition, filed by Dehradun-resident Umesh Kumar, alleged that Khanpur (Haridwar) MLA Kunwar Pranav Singh ‘Champion’ used hooter and red beacon on his cars while passing through Manglaur (Roorkee), creating an atmosphere of fear and panic among the residents. Kumar urged the court to prevent Champion from using the hooter and the red beacon, saying it disturbs schools and hospitals in the area. Meanwhile, the second petition, filed by Roorkee-resident Sanjeev Kumar, alleged that mayor Gaurav Goyal is allowing substandard material to be used in construction works. He also accused mayor Goyal of carrying out financial irregularities and urged the court to investigate all his decisions and seize his financial authority. After hearing arguments in both these cases, the HC bench observed that the petitions were filed with “political malice” and imposed a fine on the petitioners. The bench pointed out that if the petitioners don’t deposit this fine in the High Court Bar Association within two weeks, the amount can be recovered by seizing their property (of the same value) as per the law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-scraps-two-petitions-filed-with-political-malice-penalises-petitioners/articleshow/88172589.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: District administration to track flyers in home quarantine||KOLKATA: The state health department has asked district administrations along with health officials to keep track of international flyers on home quarantine. This is one of the measures the state government is taking to prevent the spread of Omicron. As a protocol to contain Omicron, all international flyers arriving in Kolkata from high-risk nations as well as those with travel history to these nations need to undergo RT-PCR test upon arrival. While those testing positive will be sent to the designated hospitals, the ones testing negative are to be sent home. But the negative flyers have to be on strict home quarantine for seven days and undergo RT-PCR test on the eighth day. A circular sent on Wednesday from National Health Mission director Saumitra Mohan to all district magistrates and chief medical officers health, has asked them to make arrangements to trace and monitor such travellers and remind them of the RT-PCR test on the eighth day. The health department will be providing the list and details of such flyers on home quarantine. The district officials have also been told to update about the contact made with such travellers with the health officials. “Symptoms may need 2-3 days to appear after getting infected from a fellow passengers. So one may get infected but RT-PCR becomes negative in that case. Therefore we need to be vigilant to restrict the movement of international passengers who are even asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic to check the spread. The strategy of Test-Track-Treat should be implemented strictly in the beginning so that we can decrease the rate of infection,” said Anirban Dalui public health specialist. For those testing positive upon arrival, the government has identified ID Hospital Beliaghata for isolation and treatment, while their swab samples are sent for genome analysis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dist-admins-to-track-flyers-in-home-quarantine/articleshow/88173304.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Ahmedabad||Rising price of greens spice up cost of undhiyu in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Planning for an undhiyu and ponk party with bonfire this winter? Be prepared to shell out extra as the winter green vegetables have become costlier. Thanks to the recent spell of unseasonal rainfall and cloudy weather, the price of seasonal green vegetables including green flat beans, green brinjals, green garlic, spring onions in addition to root vegetables such as sweet potato and purple yam – all key ingredients in your favourite seasonal undhiyu, have become costlier. Retail price of each of these vegetables currently hovers between Rs 100 and Rs 120 a kilogram. Agriculture experts attribute the price rise to the hampering of supply of green vegetables due to unseasonal rainfall. Sagar Rabari, past president, Khedut Ekta Manch, said, “Thanks to the persistently cloudy weather for about a week preceded by unseasonal rainfall in November-end, a good amount of harvest of the winter vegetables has been infested with pests causing a lot of crop damage. With limited supply and high demand during the season, the winter greens have become extremely costly. The prices are expected to remain high for at least another ten days.” Rabari also attributed the increased retail prices to increased transportation costs for vegetables due to fuel price rise. At present, the green vegetables are being procured from other states because of low supply. Deepak Patel, secretary, Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), said, “Due to unseasonal rainfall, there was a lot of crop failure. At the same time, the demand has gone up significantly due to winters and marriage season. Consequently, wholesale prices have gone up by at least 15% for most green vegetables.” Retail prices in most cases are nearly double than that of wholesale prices of green vegetables. “There is no change in demand for either green or other vegetables. People are sure complaining about costlier vegetables but there is no impact on demand. The overall costs of transportation as well as wholesale price of vegetables have gone up drastically,” said Jignesh Shah, a Vejalpur-based vegetable dealer. I-T search on city-based firm Ahmedabad: Rise in tomato prices have toppled the monthly household budgets across the city. Since at least a month, tomatoes are priced at Rs 80 a kg in the retail market and in certain parts of the city, the prices have gone up as high as Rs 100 a kilo! “Due to the unseasonal rainfall and reduced supply from within Gujarat, we are compelled to procure tomatoes from Karnataka and Maharashtra. These states too were battered by heavy rainfall recently due to the cyclonic conditions as a result of which there was crop failure. So, the tomato prices in these regions too have gone up dramatically. With more demand and less supply, the overall prices have gone up,” said Deepak Patel, secretary, APMC – Ahmedabad. Restaurateurs from across Ahmedabad are reeling under the heavy impact of the increased prices of tomatoes as it is a key ingredient in curries, gravies, soups, salads, and a host of other preparations in both Indian and international cuisines. In Gujarat, Kadi, Mehsana and Kalol, Gandhinagar are hubs for tomato production, where unseasonal rainfall has led to crop damage. “Prices are expected to stabilize after two weeks when fresh harvest begins to arrive in the market,” Patel added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rising-price-of-greens-spice-up-cost-of-undhiyu-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/88173307.cms||Niyati Parikh

While Lucknow has plenty to offer on the Christmas platter, but if you love to bake your cakes only in the traditional bakeries then don’t delay placing your order. Reason: With no Covid restrictions this year, bakers expect huge rush. The oldest bakery in the city is located in Sadar. Shahnawaz Hussain, the owner, says the bakery was started in 1890s by his grandfather with two furnaces. Now, he has five furnaces. “Over 400 Christian families have been our regular customers since the time of my grandfather. We have installed machines for mixing of cakes but people still prefer the traditional way of mixing by hand. We will start baking from December 10 and work 24X7 till Christmas,” said Hussain. Established in 1910, the La Martiniere bakery is located on the premises of La Martiniere College. It is open to public only during Christmas. Principal Carlyle A. MC Farland said, “The school was established in 1845 and the bakery in 1910. It is among the oldest bakeries in town. We still use an old wooden furnace as it was in practice in early 1900.” Durham Bakery, set up in 1916 on Station Road, is another bakery which stirs emotions along with goodies. Its owner Mohammad Sheikh Yahya, the fourth generation baker, said that his great-grandfather Sheikh Abdul Rasheed started the bakery and British were the main customers then. “Many bakers in town now use ovens, but we prefer to bake in the wooden furnace set up in 1916.” Richard Garth Innis, a customer said, his family have been regular customers of this bakery because the taste of the cake baked in the traditional way is unique. Orange Bakery in Kaiserbagh was started in the 1930s. “My grandfather Shahid Hussain started this bakery. Mixing the cake materials is the main part and is the key to the taste,” said the owner Khalid Hussain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-bakeries-warm-up-to-usher-in-yuletide-cheer/articleshow/88173942.cms||---
---||Delhi||Nothing to show Gambhir’s help was sought for Covid-19 drugs, Delhi HC told||NEW DELHI: The drug control department has told Delhi High Court that BJP parliamentarian Gautam Gambhir and his foundation should not have illegally bought, stocked and distributed Covid-19 drugs without licence during the second wave of the pandemic. In a report seeking vacation of the stay on prosecution of the cricketer-turned-politician and his foundation, the department has said there is nothing to suggest that any person approached Gambhir for any assistance. It has also claimed that there is nothing to suggest that the state authorities failed to address any shortage of Covid-19 drugs, questioning the intervention by Gambhir. The report asserts that Favipiravir tablets and medical oxygen are drugs that cannot be bought for the purpose of stocking or sale or distribution by any person/firm without holding the requisite licence and it was unfortunate that the MP was abusing the process of the court to raise political slogans. “The petitioners have purchased the said drugs from various licensed dealers, stocked and distributed the same in a manner that is unauthorised and not permitted under law. The petitioners should have obtained a drugs licence for procuring, stocking/distribution of drugs to individual patients on forms 20/21 under Drugs and Cosmetics Rules,” the affidavit filed by the drugs inspector of the drugs control department stated. It was filed in response to a petition by Gambhir and others against the criminal proceedings under Drugs and Cosmetics Act. The court had stayed the proceedings in September and sought the stand of the department, which had filed the complaint on the court’s directions against the MP; Gautam Gambhir Foundation and its CEO, Aprajita Singh; and his mother and wife, Seema and Natasha Gambhir, both trustees in the foundation; under various provisions of Drugs and Cosmetics Act. In the affidavit, the department has also said 2,349 strips of Favipiravir (Fabiflu/Feravir) were admittedly distributed in a medical camp during the relevant period, and “despite acute shortage of drugs in Delhi, the foundation was found to be in possession of 285 strips of Favipiravir”, which were subsequently handed over to the government authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nothing-to-show-gambhirs-help-was-sought-for-covid-19-drugs-hc-told/articleshow/88173981.cms||---

Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) teams cracked down on the area in wake of the incident in which the man suffered fits for some time, but recovered. Relatives of the man said that the incident went unnoticed as he did not have grievous injuries. His mother said that her son was lucky to have survived with minor injuries. “After about an hour he was normal,” she told TOI. According to case details, the man who normally stays indoors went out for a walk on his own on Monday morning. A group of cows was present in the Golwad area where he was walking. One of the cows attacked him suddenly and threw him on the ground. An eyewitness said that he and others rushed to help the man and also informed his relatives. “There are many cows in the area which belong to a few persons staying in nearby localities. There have been incidents of accidents due to cows earlier, but nobody objects as people do not want bitterness or animosity,” he said. Another resident of the locality, Usha Parmar pointed out that though regular drives were not being held in the area, VMC impounded four cows after the incident. “Since then we have not seen cows in the area,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cow-knocks-down-another-man-civic-body-up-and-about/articleshow/88172475.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Many in Kolhapur seek Covaxin||Kolhapur: The eligible beneficiaries in the age group of 18 to 44 years, who are yet to be vaccinated, are seeking Covaxin amid stricter restrictions in place in the district. For Covaxin, the gap between two doses is 28 days while for Covishield, it is 84 days. The administration has made it mandatory for people above 18 years to have a full vaccination certificate and 14 days should pass since the second jab was taken.  In the last few days, the number of non-vaccinated beneficiaries from the younger age group taking the Covaxin are increasing. On Tuesday, over 1,800 people from 18 to 44 years took the Covaxin jab. The activists said though the demand for Covaxin is increasing, not all vaccination centres in the district have Covaxin. All centres have Covishield in ample amount. Most of those seeking Covaxin are mainly people who need to travel every day on public transport, cross interstate borders etc. Sanjay Ghatage, an activist said, “I am getting several calls every day from people asking where they can get Covaxin. They have to search each vaccination centre for the availability of Covaxin. The authorities must allocate dedicated centres for Covaxin and the details of the centres should be made public to avoid inconvenience. The demand for vaccination certificates at most places has forced the non-vaccinated population to get vaccinated at the earliest.”  For the last one week, the turnout of beneficiaries has increased manifold in the district. Now a little more than 50% of its population is fully vaccinated.  Among the younger populations vaccinated with the first dose, around 90,000 have received Covaxin. Of them, 20,000 have taken the jab in the last one week.  Amol Mane, vaccination nodal officer of KMC said, “We have made Covaxin available at most of the vaccination centres. Currently, we have adequate stock of both vaccines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/many-in-kolhapur-seek-covaxin/articleshow/88171840.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The situation turned tense and senior deputy mayor Shyam Sunder Malhotra had to reach the spot and pacify the shopkeepers. This campaign was launched to remove temporary structures from the roadsides for smoother traffic.The shopkeepers started to protest when the tehbazari teams reached Ghas Mandi Chowk in Chaura Bazaar after clearing all encroachment from Kesarganj Mandi and Sabun Bazaar. As ordered, the corporation employees were lifting material kept outside the shops when some of the traders became aggressive and started addressing them in an offensive tone and foul language.The tehbazari staff moved ahead towards the Gaushala Road, where traffic bottleneck is a big problem. But even there the staff faced resistance against the campaign, as the traders accused the MC employees of lifting even the material that was kept inside the shops. One of the shopkeepers in the raided market claimed that: "The main cause of the traffic jams is haphazard parking of vehicles and not our material kept outside the shops. The visitors leave their cars on the road when they go shopping, and those vehicles block the Circular Road."The shopkeepers said the MC should direct its action against illegal parking instead of them. Alerted about protest, senior deputy mayor Shyam Sunder Malhotra came over and tried to control the situation. He first asked the officials to convince the shopkeepers against encroaching upon roads and roadsides. He then requested the shopkeepers not to keep their material outside. The two sides saw reason in ending their confrontation and the situation normalised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/traders-resist-mc-drive-say-shoppers-block-roads/articleshow/88172609.cms||---

In a letter to the college dean, the resident doctors said that they made the decision after extensive discussion with various resident doctors’ bodies like Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA), Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) and the Joint Doctors Association (JDA). The NHL resident doctors first withdrew from Out-Patient Department (OPD) services on Wednesday morning and stopped attending emergency services by evening, said a medico participating in the strike. The doctors claim that the delay in counselling for NEET PG has led to an acute shortage of doctors at civil hospitals and has increased their workload. NEET-PG exams for MD/MS admissions are usually held in January, but due to Covid they were held in September. While counselling was to commence on October 25, petitions challenging a central government notification stalled the process. Senior resident doctors (final year students from the 2018 batch) were relieved a few months ago. As a result, hospitals are managing with only two batches, instead of three.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/resident-doctors-at-nhl-join-strike/articleshow/88174498.cms||---
---||Delhi||Amid song & dance, farmers hope to reap benefits of toil||NEW DELHI: Around 377 days ago, Kashmira Singh set up a tent at Singhu border intending to sit in protest demanding the repeal of three central agricultural laws. On Wednesday, the 67-year-old was all smiles as the farm leaders announced satisfaction at the government’s proposals on resolving the issues raised by the agitating farmers. Kashmira wants to return home to Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab, but he isn’t in a big hurry and will wait as the protest leaders come to a final decision. “We will soon pull up our tents and drive our tractors back, but people will remember that we protested for them,” said Kashmira. “This protest site will be vacated, but it will remain a landmark for a peaceful protest. We remained unprovoked even when there was mischief afoot and derogatory references to us.” The farmer pointed out the local residents were “all scared when we arrived in big numbers, but months later they came out to celebrate Diwali with us”. On Wednesday, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha leaders declared the draft proposal given by the Centre was ‘satisfactory’, but they decided to take final call on ending the protest only on Thursday. Sweets were distributed, some typically danced in Punjabi style and farmers exchanged triumphant badhaiyans. Gurnam Singh Chaduni, one of the five in the SKM negotiating committee, said, “The government’s earlier draft was unacceptable. But the Centre moved two steps forward and offered us fresh proposals. We are now mostly in agreement with the government regarding our demands.” He cautiously added that the “agitation isn’t yet suspended” though. Most of the farmers were happy at having achieved what they came seeking to Singhu. “This shows nothing is impossible if we unite for a just cause," said Jaswant Singh of Fatehgarh Sahib. The protesters felt that a national debate has been triggered on agriculture, farmers and purchase of grains by the government at a designated price. Some, however, remained sceptical of how things would proceed now. “The protest has almost ended, yet our old problems are yet to be resolved,” said Karnal Singh Jethana, 65, another farmer from Fatehgarh Sahib. “Many of our brothers gave their lives, but the main issue of a guarantee minimum support price for crops other than wheat and rice remains undecided.” Most of the campaigners are, however, happy to take home the victory against a tough government and they felt the Centre needed some time to resolve the MSP problem. “It’s the matter of trust,” conceded Harpreet Singh of Jalandhar. “We understand that guaranteeing the MSP cannot be notified overnight. The government will take some time. The only question is whether the Centre does it with some degree of swiftness. We hope the process is time-bound and that they don’t break our trust. But then what option do we have apart from trusting them?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/amid-song-dance-farmers-hope-to-reap-benefits-of-toil/articleshow/88173971.cms||Kushagra Dixit

During a reality check of recently repaired roads, commuters told TOI that shoddy work is posing a risk to drivers, especially during the night. The affected areas include Ashiyana, Alambagh, Mahanagar, Gomtinagar, Jankipuram, Indiranagar, Aliganj, Daliganj, Nishatganj, New Hyderabad and Telibagh, among others. In New Hyderabad, a road was repaired recently but soon gravels started coming out of the patches making it risky for people to drive on the stretch. Terming the pothole repair work a “complete joke”, Kailash Vishwakarma of New Hyderabad said the repair work done by the LMC in his area was “horrible”. TimesViewSenior LMC officers must take cognizance and investigate the matter because taxpayers’ money is being used in road repair, but people are not getting desired results. Officials should conduct surprise inspections of sites where the work is underway and ensure that repair work is done as per required standards.Similar situation was found in Gomtinagar. Mukul Saini of Vishal Khand said, “This stretch was repaired a few weeks ago but due to substandard material used by contractors, potholes have started to show up again. It is very frustrating for us to drive on these roads riddled with potholes.” In Niralanagar, roads were repaired but some part of that stretch was left unrepaired. It is tough to drive here at night as there is no streetlight in the area. Vishesh Khurana of Niralanagar said, “This stretch was full of potholes till last week. However, the entire stretch was nor repaired and a large crater in the middle of the road was not repaired. It is very risky for motorists to drive as any mistake can be dangerous.” In Alambagh, roads were repaired but the stretch was allowed to be used soon after. The repaired patches were not allowed to dry due to which gravel started coming out again. Manoj Jaiswal of Alambagh said, “As soon as the road got repaired, workers left the place and due to vehicular movement the situation was soon back to square one.” Similarly, patch work in Mahanagar was completed around one week ago but cracks have already started showing up. Anmol Gupta, a commuter, said, “It seems as if the road has not been repaired at all. I have started using public transport for this stretch to save the suspension of my vehicle.” LMC chief engineer Mahesh Verma said, “Several private contractors have not conducted proper road repair work. Fine has been slapped on them and they have been asked repair the stretches again.” (Inputs by Vertika Sonakia and Ayushi Mishra)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/patchy-road-repair-giving-bumpy-ride-to-commuters/articleshow/88173968.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

"He dreamed of living in a house in Pauri after retirement. He had even selected a patch of land in Saina (Birmoli) to construct what he called his 'old age home' and had told me that he'll visit his ancestral village soon. We were eagerly looking forward to that," Bharat Singh said. Saina village is approximately 80 km from Kotdwar, the district headquarters of Pauri district. Though Rawat's father had a house in Noida, he wanted to stay true to his roots and live in Uttarakhand, his uncle told TOI on Wednesday. "He was a very loving and strong human being," Bharat Singh said. "I had called him just a few days ago about the unavailability of roads in the village. Thereafter, he ensured that some work got done.” Rawat's family in Saina owns over 200 bighas of land in the village. "He always talked about seeing the area developed," the uncle said. Rawat had last visited the village in 2018. "He was here to offer prayers to our deity. He had big plans for 2023, which was probably when he would have come home…now, all is gone.” Villagers recalled his 2018 visit, talking about Rawat's affection for Pauri and his plans for it to overcome Uttarakhan's perennial problems of migration, education and health. “During that trip he discussed the subject of migration from the hills at length with the villagers. He was also very concerned about the poor education facilities and infrastructure here. He promised to establish a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Dwarikhal block,” said Ravindra Singh Bisht, the pradhanpati of Birmoli gram sabha. Bharat Singh said he wished he could go to attend Rawat's last rites, but won't be able to as dignitaries have told him they would be coming to the village on Thursday. "Chief minister Pushkar Dhami will be visiting our house. There are other senior officials who will also be coming. I wanted to attend my nephew's last rites but it seems impossible now,” he said. Rawat was expected to be at the Indian Military Academy’s (IMA) passing out parade on December 11. The former Army chief and CDS had earned the prestigious 'Sword of Honour' during his training days at the IMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/my-nephew-was-building-a-retirement-house-here-gen-rawats-uncle/articleshow/88172633.cms||Shivani Azad

A day after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi put out a list of farmers who had purportedly died during the year-long agitation, MoS Nityanand Rao, in written reply to a question in the Upper House, chose to maintain silence on the number of such casualties.

---||Lucknow||Rare birds make Lucknow home||LUCKNOW: Music, culture and food aside, the city of nawabs also has a gharana of birds. Naturalists and bird watchers have spotted and listed at least 360 kinds of birds in UP’s capital. With winter arriving, these sightings are set to increase as several rarely seen migratory birds also make Lucknow home for the season. While the sunbird is found all over Lucknow, bird watchers say that Indian pitta (also called Navarang for nine colours in its plumage), migratory duck coming from trans-Himalayan region ruddy shelduck (surkhaab), black hooded oriole (beautiful endemic bird) and migratory bird from northern Siberia northern pintail (seekpar) are some of the rare birds to be spotted. Acknowledging the richness of Lucknow in terms of birds, former director of Bombay Natural History Society and bird watcher Asad R Rehmani said: “Lucknow has many hamlets preferred by birds which are the most important indicators of the health of an ecosystem. They play an important role in stabilising nature’s health. They are known as the bio indicator of the environmental system.” Naturalist and IAS officer Sanjay Kumar, who has written seven books on birds of different cities, added that diversity and density of birds, especially in urban landscape, decide how much a place is environmentally intact. Kumar, along with Neeraj Srivastava, has authored a book called ‘Birds of Lucknow’, which is a visual document of over 250 kinds of birds found in the city. “Birds are an integral part of life. They give us a chance to respect nature which reciprocates the love and care in several folds,” said Srivastava. Various bird watchers from Lucknow—a community of over 200 people from different walks of life—shared that Kukrail forest is among the most preferred destinations to sight birds. IIM-Lucknow campus, SGPGI campus, National Botanical Research Institute, Remote Sensing Applications Centre, Residency complex, Cantonment and wetland around Lucknow are other homes to birds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rare-birds-make-lucknow-home/articleshow/88173996.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat wildlife board to discuss cyclone damage, proposals||AHMEDABAD: After a gap of 15 months, the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) will soon meet to discuss key matters pertaining to the impact of cyclone Tauktae and upcoming projects. The board members, who last met on September 28 last year, will come together on December 16. This will be their first meeting to be held under the chairmanship of Bhupendra Patel who recently took over as the chief minister. The board members will focus on wildlife management and conservation action necessitated by Cyclone Tauktae. Proposals in the eco-sensitive zone will also be discussed, according to details released by Shyamal Tikadar, chief wildlife warden, Gujarat, and member secretary of the board. “A large number of trees in Gir sanctuary were uprooted by Tauktae,” said a member of the board. “A roadmap needs to be worked out to clear lakhs of fallen trees that pose a problem for wildlife, including Asiatic lions.” The member said the exercise is expected to be much bigger than what followed the 1982 cyclone in the Asiatic lion landscape. During that calamity, an estimated 28.1 lakh trees had been uprooted. The forest department is currently carrying out a survey to ascertain the estimated number of trees felled by Tauktae. The board will also deliberate on the proposal of a resort near the Gir sanctuary. In the September 2020 meeting, the board members had rejected the proposal for Wildwood Resort and Realities Pvt Ltd on the grounds that it fell within the 1km radius of the sanctuary where no commercial activity is permitted. The promoters of the resort approached Gujarat high court and stated that the resort was outside the eco-sensitive zone limits. The promoters also contended that the board had miscalculated the distance between the resort and the sanctuary. In an order dated November 26, the court directed the board to take up the issue in its December meeting. “Discuss the same after hearing all the parties concerned. Take appropriate decision and guide the state government accordingly,” the court had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-wildlife-board-to-discuss-cyclone-damage-proposals/articleshow/88173343.cms||---
---||Delhi||Most DU colleges fail to fill quota seats even after 3rd special drive||NEW DELHI: While Delhi University colleges face the problem of over-admissions in certain courses, vacant seats in the reserved categories also remain a worrying point in many of them. At least 34 BCom (H) seats reserved for the other backward classes (OBC) category at Dyal Singh College and 11 for economics (H) at Ramanujan College were available till December 3, while four psychology seats for economically weaker section (EWS) candidates weren’t taken at Aryabhatta College. Overall, for 61 colleges, as on December 3, approximately 1,800 seats for OBC, 300 for scheduled caste (SC), 2,500 for scheduled tribe (ST) and 1,000 for EWS categories were vacant. DU announced the third special drive to fill reserved category seats after that and Wednesday was the last date for completing admissions under it. Many principals said they could not get the required numbers and teachers are concerned that the seats will be wasted again. For instance, the BCom (H) merit list at Dyal Singh College could include just three candidates for its 34 seats. Similarly, at Ramanujan, only five candidates were listed for economics’ 11 OBC seats. S P Agarwal, its principal, said, “We try to draw more candidates so that if one doesn’t take admission, the other one can. But reserved category seats remain vacant.” The DU panel’s interim report on the admissions had also highlighted how under-admission in the ST category is a concern. However, as per the recent data, vacancy is a problem in the OBC category too. For instance, at Kirori Mal College, 68 OBC seats were vacant, just a little less than 70 for Kashmiri migrants. For the SC category, 33 seats were vacant and 37 for STs. As against the total vacancy of 275, the merit list could include just 72 candidates. Even in a college like Lady Shri Ram College for Women, 107 reserved seats were empty. At Hansraj, the count was 172. LSR’s merit list had just eight candidates, including one EWS candidate for three psychology (H) seats. Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College also had 338 reserved-category seats, which also cover people with disabilities. “We must appreciate that the colleges are sharing the data on the public domain, but efforts should be made to reduce cutoffs substantially on the reserved seats in the first few cutoff lists,” pointed out Naveen Gaur, a physics teacher at Dyal Singh College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/most-du-colleges-fail-to-fill-quota-seats-even-after-3rd-special-drive/articleshow/88174000.cms||Shradha Chettri

An employee who tried to intercept them was shot at, said police. The incident took place at around 12.30 pm when the owner of the shop Nikhil Agarwal and his employee Shravan Sharma were at the shop handling customers. Of the four miscreants, two stood guard on the bike outside the shop while the other two entered the shop and pointed pistols at Nikhil. They looted about 900 gm of gold jewellery and cash available at the counter. Shravan SHarma was shot at by miscreants when he tried to intercept. He was rushed to KGMU trauma centre where he is undergoing treatment. “Shravan sustained two bullet injuries, one in the stomach and the other in the chest,” said Dr Sandeep Tiwari, chief medical superintendent. ACP Aliganj, Syed Ali Abbas, said, "The miscreants seemed to have done the recce of the shop before carrying out the loot." In the FIR, Agarwal said that around 12.30pm, Shravan Sharma was showing ornaments to some customers when two armed miscreants entered the shop and after taking him at gunpoint entered straight into the strong room. When Shravan tried to stop them, he was shot at. Within minutes, the miscreants fled from the spot. Senior police officers, including ADCP North Prachi Singh and assistant commissioner of police, Aliganj, Syed Ali Abbas, including sleuths of surveillance and crime branch reached the place. Lucknow police commissioner, DK Thakur, said that an FIR under the charges of loot and attempt to murder has been registered and four teams have been made to nab the attackers. The crime branch team is investigating the case and looking into the CCTV footage retrieved from nearby houses and coaching centres to search for clues. Polygon policing proves ineffectiveWhen the police commissionerate system was started in Lucknow, ‘polygon units’ were deployed on infamous points of loot and dacoities. Wednesday’s incident took place barely 500 metres from the Kapurthala Crossing. There are two banks near the jewellery shop. As per the system, cops on bikes are deployed on troubled spots and are trained to catch persons committing loot. Intense patrolling on such spots is another rule. A police officer said polygon policing is in effect but during the loot on Wednesday, duty of the polygon unit of the area was at a different spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/jewellery-shop-looted-in-aliganj-1-shot-at/articleshow/88174018.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||CCTV footage proof in Porsche case: CP||HYDERABAD: An MLA from the city reportedly reached the Banjara Hills police station in the early hours of December 6 to enquire about fatal road accident case involving a businessman, driving a Porsche in an inebriated state. During the press conference held by Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar on Wednesday about the death of two migrant workers in a fatal hit and run case on Road Number 2, Banjara Hills, media personnel asked the police chief if it was true that some political leaders tried to influence the investigation. CP evaded a direct answer and directed it at joint CP AR Srinivas. Answering the question, joint CP Srinivas said, “The MLA, who came to the police station early on December 6, is a close friend of a family member of one of the accused. The MLA only came to verify what exactly had happened. He found out the details and left.” The said MLA is apparently a classmate of the father of an accused. The joint CP said that like any other accused, B Rohit Goud and V Sai Soman, were also given food and water at the police station and there was no special treatment was provided. When the top cop was asked whether the CCTV footage of the accident was available, Anjani Kumar said, “The accused are currently in Chanchalguda prison and we have footage linked to the accident from 11 cameras located at various places. The footage will be used as evidence against the accused during trial.” The Hyderabad top cop said that the accused had consumed liquor at three bars before the Porsche, driven by Rohit, allegedly mowed down two migrant workers on Road Number 2, Banjara Hills. The CP appreciated the efforts of Jubilee Hills police personnel — home guard T Jitender, constable Satish and sub-inspector SI Harishwar Reddy, who caught the accused. While explaining about the incident, joint CP AR Srinivas said that after the fatal accident, the accused had parked the damaged car in the cellar of an apartment where their friend lived and left the place. “They returned to the place with a friend in another car to take the damaged vehicle, but the patrolling team, which had already noticed where the car was parked, reached there and caught them,” the joint CP said. Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar spoke about the collective responsibility of crime prevention while talking about educated rich youngsters like Rohit and Sai driving in an inebrated state and causing a fatal accident. “Crime detection is the responsibility of police, but crime prevention is a collective responsibility,” the CP said. Commissioner emphasized on the need to educate people about need to abide by the law while continuing the best enforcement practices like drunken driving checks to bring down the accident rate in the new year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cctv-footage-proof-in-porsche-case-cp/articleshow/88173334.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC clears decks for release of Antilia bomb scare case accused||MUMBAI: Paving the way for the release of an accused, Naresh Gaur, in the Antilia bomb scare case, the Bombay high court on Wednesday quashed and set aside the special NIA court’s order that has stayed for 25 days its own order granting him bail. “In so far as power of the learned sessions judge to stay his own order of grant of bail is concerned, in my view, the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) does not empower the sessions judge to stay the operation of his order of grant of bail,” said Justice Sandeep Shinde, allowing Gaur’s petition. A cricket bookie, Gaur was the first among 10 accused to be granted bail by the NIA court on November 20, which observed that prima facie he did not seem to be aware of the conspiracy. On the prosecution’s plea to file an appeal, the NIA judge stayed the order for 25 days. Gaur was arrested in March for allegedly procuring SIM cards used by the accused. Senior advocate Shirish Gupte, for Gaur, argued that the judge was wrong in staying the bail order. Also, that till date, the NIA has not preferred an appeal and the stay has interfered with Gaur’s right to liberty. Justice Shinde rejected the argument of additional solicitor general Anil Singh, for NIA, that a writ petition was not maintainable and instead Gaur should have filed an appeal. He noted that the high court can stay the operation of bail order where it finds it necessary to do so, to prevent the abuse of the process of the court or to meet the ends of justice. The NIA judge could not assume jurisdiction to stay its own order granting bail. “There being error in jurisdiction, the petition was perfectly maintainable,” said Justice Shinde, adding that the NIA judge “has not justified the order by recording the reasons in suspending his own order.” He rejected NIA’s request to stay the order. Assistant police inspector (now dismissed) Sachin Waze is in jail for planting explosives in a Scorpio near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25 and the subsequent murder of vehicle owner Mansukh Hiran. After the controversy broke out, the then Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh had sent a letter to the CM alleging then home minister Anil Deshmukh had set an extortion ‘target’ for Waze.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-clears-decks-for-release-of-bomb-scare-case-accused/articleshow/88174816.cms||Rosy Sequeira

After hearing the application, HC fixed the next hearing of the case on January 14, 2021. Meanwhile, Sudarshan Goel, senior advocate, Supreme Court, said, “This order by the single judge of the Uttarakhand high court is in clear violation of orders of Supreme Court, which had stayed all further proceedings in the case.” During 2018-19, the Centre had decided to make lateral recruitment to 10 posts of joint secretaries.

The move comes after the ATS registered an FIR when it found drugs in a parcel that was sent to Ghatkopar from Jaipur in Rajasthan via post. The ATS seized the drugs found inside the parcel. Vineet Agarwal, additional director general and ATS chief, confirmed that the Anti-Terrorism Squad has written to the postal officials to be vigilant about the use of postal services for trafficking of drugs. The ATS has asked the postal authorities to use a one-time password while handing over a parcel or courier to the addressee. It also suggested that parcels with the wrong addresses should not be handed over without proper identity verification and that the police and the ATS should be informed about such parcels. The ATS, which is the nodal agency for drug-related crime cases in the state, had in September got a tip-off from an informer about a parcel with the wrong address and contact number. “When nobody came forward to claim the parcel, we opened it in the presence of panchas (witnesses),” said an ATS source. The police officials found two boxes in the parcel which contained 500 strips of a drug. The ATS registered an FIR, and its Vikhroli unit is probing the case. The investigators are now trying to locate and identify the person who sent this parcel In September, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) during an operation at the foreign post office, Ballard Estate, in south Mumbai seized 60 gms of multi-strain buds. The drug, concealed in a chocolate box, had originated from Canada and was to be delivered in Lower Parel, but the address was incomplete. The NCB suspected that the contraband was ordered online with a cryptocurrency as a mode of payment. A case was registered. The cost of these multi-strain buds is Rs 5,000 to 8,000 per gm in the illicit drug market. The ATS has also suggested to the postal department to train its employees in examining parcels and installing parcel scanner machines. The ATS asked the postal department to inform the police every week about suspected parcels. The issue has also been discussed in a high-level meeting recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ats-asks-postal-dept-to-keep-eye-on-report-suspicious-parcels-for-drugs/articleshow/88174825.cms||---

The VMC impounds cattle and releases them after collecting fines and other charges. VMC also began door-to-door tagging of bovines since October to ensure all cattle in the city have RFID tags. Sources said that despite the drive, there were many cattle owners who had not got their animals tagged. Others have even sold off their tagged cattle and bought new animals to escape being identified. The VMC registers offences against cattle owners when the cattle is identified with these tags. In the absence of tags, owners may not come to free their cattle and never get identified. The VMC administration has put up a proposal before the standing committee seeking a nod for the new system of not releasing cattle if it was untagged. The proposal states that cattle owners will have to get bovine tagged whenever they are born or bought. Similarly, they will have to inform VMC whenever a tagged animal dies. A VMC official said that around 32,000 animals were tagged by the civic body since 2014. However, many of them have died or were sold off. New animals were added due to birth or new purchases. “It is difficult to come to arrive at any statistics in the absence of this data,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/no-release-of-cattle-without-rfid-tag-proposes-vmc/articleshow/88172498.cms||---

Ironically, the case remains unsolved till date with police failing to nab any of the miscreants. Police officers, who reached the spot to probe Wednesday’s loot, were apprised about the loot which had taken place four years ago. “I have instructed Aliganj police to also investigate the 2017 case and ensure that it is also solved,” Lucknow police commissioner DK Thakur told TOI. “Like this time, the two masked miscreants holding pistols had entered the shop, while two had stayed outside when the loot was carried out in 2017,” said a crime branch official who was with Lucknow police when the loot took place last time. He also said that the only difference was that nobody was shot at in that heist. “Our teams worked hard but reached a dead end. Even Shravan was picked up for questioning,” he said. Owner Nikhil Agarwal told TOI that last time around 400 gram of gold was looted. “This time, around 900 gram of gold worth around Rs 45 lakh has been looted,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/similar-loot-took-place-at-same-shop/articleshow/88174027.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Officials of Malegaon city police said a patient was admitted to the ICU of the hospital when the patient’s relatives came to meet him around 10 pm. As the security guard told them that he cannot allow them to meet the patient inside the ICU, the relatives started manhandling him. One of the nurses who tried to intervene was also verbally abused and threatened with dire consequences.  A police constable, who also intervened, was heckled and slapped by the accused. The relatives then broke the chairs in the hospital and smashed plant pots. Soon, an additional police force was called to the hospital and the accused were taken to the Malegaon city police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/2-held-for-assaulting-cop-guard-of-malegaon-general-hospital/articleshow/88171925.cms||Santosh Sonawane

After a botanical survey, 170 plant species were identified on the campus and around 1,000 trees have also been labelled appropriately. The QR codes provide information such as which country or place a tree is a native of, whether it is a medicinal, avenue or ornamental tree and what its economic importance is. The common nomenclature of the species is available, such as velvet apple for Diospyros sp, as well as their names in Hindi and Urdu. Dr M Irfan Qureshi, one of the spearheads of the project, said, “This important exercise identifies the plants across the Jamia campus. Never before had this task been undertaken at this scale. Close to one lakh trees, shrubs and medicinal herbs were surveyed and catalogued.” Qureshi added, “The database we created after a three-day survey has been linked to the Herbal Kew Garden, a global platform. Students or anyone interested can get details about the campus trees by scanning the QR code.” Stating that the vast green coverage of the university acted as the lungs for the locality, a Jamia official said that the university also planned to undertake another survey on the campus — that of the fauna present. “During the lockdown months, we noticed an increase in the variety of birds on the campus, from hornbills and peacocks to barn owls. So, we are planning to carry out a survey on birds and animals too and present it in the form of a documentary film,” the official said.  Vice-chancellor Najma Akhtar said, “Our campus harbours a great diversity of plants but they had never been surveyed and catalogued. It’s amazing to know that a number of our plants are of medicinal importance and others serve as a source of food for birds. We will study the data and understand how bird diversity can be improved, including by attracting rare and migratory birds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/scan-qr-code-know-more-about-trees-at-jamia/articleshow/88174030.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

---||Delhi||Delhi, celebrate poor air quality... till it lasts||NEW DELHI: The air quality continued to remain in the “poor” category aided by moderate winds, a better mixing layer height and less moisture with an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 237 on Wednesday, marginally better than a day earlier.  Track the pollution level in your cityNo significant change is predicted for the next five days as air quality is likely to stay in the “poor” category. On Monday, the AQI was 322 in the “very poor” category and it improved to 255 in the “poor” category on Tuesday. VK Soni, head, environment and research centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD), said, “The wind speed picked up to 10-15 kmph during the day, leading to dispersion of pollutants. As the sun came out, the mixing layer height was good. A mixing layer height of 1-1.25 kmph was recorded during the daytime as against below 500 metres when AQI touched the severe category. Besides, visibility was better and less moisture allowed the dispersal of pollutants.” The minimum temperature was recorded at 10.1 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. The maximum temperature was 24 degrees Celsius. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under Union ministry of earth sciences, said, “The air quality improved significantly. For the next four days (December 8 to 11), winds are likely to be moderate, increasing ventilation of pollutants. Minimum temperatures are likely to drop gradually leading to a more stable boundary layer during night time, which helps in accumulation of pollutants.” “With mostly clear sky conditions during daytime, the peak mixing layer height is likely to be around 1.5km, causing moderate vertical mixing of air mass. The net effect is that air quality for the next four days is likely to improve gradually, but stay within the moderate or lower end of the poor category,” added SAFAR. Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the air quality was likely to stay in the “poor” category till December 13 and may deteriorate marginally on December 14 and 15. Meanwhile, Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining areas (CAQM) conducted a review meeting on augmentation of public transport. An official who attended the meeting said the states submitted plans on steps being taken to strengthen public transport. Delhi informed that it was in the process of acquiring more buses. The Met department has predicted that minimum temperature would likely dip from Thursday. The IMD forecast said night temperature was likely to hover around 9 degrees Celsius from December 9 to 11 and may touch 7 degrees Celsius by December 12. The maximum temperature is likely to remain at 24-23 degrees Celsius over the next six days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-celebrate-poor-air-quality-till-it-lasts/articleshow/88173382.cms||---

The plan is to help them with government schemes,” commissioner of police (CoP), Trichy city, told ToI. Trichy city police took action against 375 rowdies by arrests, executing security bonds with several habitual offenders and slapping Goondas Act on criminals indulged in serious crimes. In October and November, police detained 31 criminals including 18 rowdies who disrupted public peace, eight thieves and robbers, three people involved in illegal sale of banned lottery, an accused in a child sex abuse case and a man for selling banned Gutka under the Goondas Act. The back to back revenge murders in Gandhi market and Golden Rock area in the city in September have forced city police to initiate the crackdown on anti-social elements. The state police also launched an ‘operation disarm’ across the state to curb criminal activities by controlling the supply of lethal weapons. Police also sought the cooperation of autorickshaw drivers to nab criminals. Use of ganja and gutka is increasing among youths in Trichy city. The city police are working closely with the school and college administrations to create awareness among the students about the health hazard of consuming ganja and gutka, , the CoP said. Stating that more than 90% of the criminals are habitual offenders, the CoP said that the consistent crackdown on the offenders helped in bringing down crime rate in the city in the last two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/after-crackdown-trichy-city-police-planning-to-rehabilitate-offenders/articleshow/88173372.cms||Gokul Rajendran

The civic elections are slated to be held by February end or early March. The civic administration has already prepared the restructuring of wards and sent its draft plans to the state election department. Political activities have also started gaining momentum in Nashik city as corporators have started mounting pressures on officials from various departments of the NMC to pass their works and complete the tender process at the earliest so that they could project their works during the upcoming civic elections. According to NMC officials, various development works worth Rs 200 crore are already in the tender process, while corporators have submitted their proposals for various works like road work, drainage, garden development and other works totally worth over Rs 150 crore. When contacted, mayor Saitsh Kulkarni said the developmental works could not take place due to Covid pandemic and also because of the negative approach by the then municipal commissioner two-and-a-half years ago. “There is a need to carry out such works at the earliest.

Prof Ram Shankar Upadhayaya, an Agra-born expert on communicable diseases who is based in Sweden, said: “Preliminary data suggests that the new strain is dangerous but whether it is deadly is still not known. Patients with comorbidity may be at greater risk as was the case with the previous strain.” He said vaccination was still the best protection from the new strain despite initial reports that the virus was capable of escaping the immune system with at least 30 mutations on spike protein. Prof Upadhayaya said on the basis of the data available from South Africa, it could be said that the spread of the new strain was mainly among unvaccinated people. “However, the transmissible rate is five times more than the Delta strain,” he added. “As per initial data, it is worrisome that around 10% of new patients are toddlers less than two years of age. Hence, vaccination in case of Omicron is one factor. The more the vaccination, more people will be safe,” Prof Upadhayaya added. He said one should understand that vaccination could prevent severity and mortality but not infection. “Those who have been vaccinated should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and try to stay away from unvaccinated people,” he added. Speaking about Omicron’s impact in India, the expert said there was no doubt that India was better prepared to face the new strain than any other country. “We have achieved better medical understanding and immunity level. India-made vaccines like Covaxin have been prepared not on a part of the virus but on the whole virus. Hence, it will be more effective,” Prof Upadhayaya added. He said updation of the vaccine was the need of the hour and the government should think about third booster dose. “Those who have taken their second dose nine months ago or before that should be allowed to take third booster dose,” he said. Claiming that the efficacy of all the vaccines had come down with new strains, he advocated the use of mixed vaccines for different doses. “If one has taken Sputnik as first dose, one could go for either Covaxin or Covishield as second dose. This will stop the immunity from getting confused against the virus. The Indian government should issue an advisory in this regard and recommend updation of the present vaccine,” he added. Prof Upadhayaya also advocated for updation in RTPCR test as the present test can detect Covid-19 but not the new strain as the kit is based on three genes – N, E and RdRp – while Omicron is S-gene mutated. “The new kit should be an S-gene dropout test,” he said. “In the new strain, people are complaining of muscle pain, cough and fever for five days. It is a matter of relief that there has been no reports of lung infection or shortage of oxygen in the body as of now. Since this strain has spread from HIV/AIDS-infected coughing person, the virus has all the symptoms of common cold,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vaccine-updation-booster-shot-may-help-tackle-omicron-threat/articleshow/88174046.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

On November 22, fans of British actor Rowan Atkinson (66)—best known for playing the eccentric television character Mr Bean—panicked when a Twitter handle in the guise of US telecaster Fox News spread the hoax that has been resurfacing every few years since 2012. Among the various international and national media that debunked the news was TOI. “Actor Rowan Atkinson (Mr Bean) passed away on 22nd November, 2021” was among the more than 2,000 fo-rwarded messages ranging from “A 201-year-old Tibetan monk found alive in the mou-ntains of Nepal” to “State levies higher tax on LPG at 55% than Central governme-nt at just 5%” that TOI busted as fake through its ‘Times Verified’ campaign. Launched in West and South India on November 21, the initiative—which was born in Mumbai on April 17 this year—aims to break the chain of viral misinformation and disinformation that has been infecting social media groups as rampantly as the virus is mutating in the real world. Under the campaign, readers send unverified or suspicious messages doing the rounds on social media on the WhatsApp number 9819888887 and our expert panel—comprising reporters, editors and representatives from the BMC and the government—tap into their sources to verify its credibility. Since the campaign beg-an, TOI has received more than 6,000 messages, of whi-ch 40% have been verified. “This message is fake,” cried the bold red stamp sent by our panel in response to fake forwards, including one about the Omicron variant being “deadlier with high death rates, no symptoms & RT-PCR cannot detect the strain”. US-based physician Dr Seema Yasmin—whose recent book speaks about how misinformation spreads faster than microbes in times of crisis—recently told TOI: “In the last year we’ve seen people write Facebook posts from their hospital beds saying they didn’t believe the pandemic was real because of what they’d read on social media and now they were infected.” In this scenario, the job of our “chain-breakers”—readers who have been regularly forwarding dubious messages to help TOI identify red flags —becomes significant. Among these vigilant chain-breakers are Gujarat’s Riya Shah, Andhra Pradesh’s Alif Panjwani, and Maharashtra’s Sharad Kulkarni, Percy Gazdar and Jayant Shetty. To join the “chain-breaking brigade”, all you have to do is send dubious, anxiety-causing news circulated on social media to our expert panel and let the green tick in the Times Verified logo counter the tyranny of the grey curved arrow of forwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-join-times-verifieds-chain-breaking-brigade-to-fight-against-epidemic-of-viral-fake-news/articleshow/88174832.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Gorakhpur fertlizer plant a symbol of self-reliant India||Agriculture experts agree on the role of fertilizer in maintaining food production, thereby meeting the global food demand. As per various estimates, about 30-40% of total global agriculture production is attributed to appropriate and timely use of fertilizer. Shortage of fertilizer is a global phenomenon due to various reasons, including scarcity and rising prices of raw material and supply chain logistics. India had been mainly dependent on China and UAE for raw material supply but China’s fertilizer companies have suspended export for their own reasons, which affected fertilizer availability in India. The commissioning of fertilizer plant in Gorakhpur, which was lying closed for nearly 30 years, has come a major boost to urea production in India which will go a long way in ensuring food security in the country. The plant, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 7, is a shining example of the success of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), as its reopening has been done completely on indigenous inputs. Joint Venture The project, in its new avatar as Hindustan Urvarak and Rasayan Ltd (HURL), is a joint venture of five major public sector companies – National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Coal India Ltd, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, Fertilizer Corporation of India and Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Limited. When it closed down in 1990, it had an installed capacity of producing 900 metric tonnes (MT) per day (TPD) of urea, but now, it will produce about 3800 TPD of urea, more than four times of its former capacity. It will now produce 12.7 lakh metric tonnes of indigenous neem-coated urea every year. The foundation stone of the unit was laid by the PM on July 22, 2016. The unit has been built at a cost of around Rs 8,600 crore and is a milestone in the industrial transformation of eastern UP. Its distinct prilling tower, with a height of 149.5 metres is said to be the highest in the world and more than double the height of Qutub Minar (73 metres), is a landmark for the people of the region. It will also produce about 2200 MT of liquid ammonia. The plant has India’s first air operated rubber dam and blast proof control room as enhanced safety measure. The plant will be powered by natural gas instead of naphtha, which was expensive and caused pollution. The production cost of fertiliser will come down by about one-third of that incurred in the past. Dream Fulfilled The unit’s revival was a long-standing demand in the region. Owing to sustained efforts of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and with logistic support by PM Modi, the dream of reviving the unit could be realised. The factory will now supply urea to farmers of Purvanchal region and from neighbouring states as well. It will play a part in ensuring price stability in domestic fertiliser market and help in saving foreign exchange reserves to facilitate India’s march towards self-reliance in urea sector. Food security is crucial for a country like India and increasing food grain production is the key. Sufficient and timely availability of fertilizer helps farmers maintain productivity of their fields. The plant has the potential of changing the socio-economic landscape of the region. As urea production starts here, hectic activity has already started in terms of movement of people and material. It will give direct employment to about 20,000 people and generate about 1.5 lakh indirect jobs. It will also open up opportunities in the field of packaging, transport, logistics and support services. The plant will help in changing the perception about east UP and put it on to the industrial map of the country.

Officials of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) said despite their best efforts, these 50 overseas travellers could not be contacted. “Their cellphones are unreachable and there are no proper addresses. We have ben continuously attempting to trace these international passengers. We will seek police help in case our teams fail to locate them,” said the civic officials. The NMC’s health department received a list of 93 more international travellers in the past two days. Moreover, 38 more international travelers have been tested negative during the same period. The total number of international travellers who have arrived in Nashik city has now touched 293. The NMC squads had collected swab samples from 130 of the travelers. The samples were sent to the lab for testing. So far, the NMC has received reports of 85 international travellers — they have all tested negative for Covid. The Nashik Municipal Corporation has been getting lists of international travellers coming into the Nashik city from the state government over the past few days. As per protocol, the swab samples collected from such individuals are sent for testing to the RT-PCR lab at the new Bytco hospital. The international travellers have to be isolated at home for seven days even if they test negative. Moreover, another round of RT-PCR tests is conducted after seven days. NMC officials said the Omicron variant is highly infectious, but has low hospitalisation and mortality rates. Therefore, following Covid-appropriate behaviour — like wearing masks and maintaining social distance — is the way to prevent this variant’s spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-may-seek-police-help-to-find-missing-foreign-returnees/articleshow/88171942.cms||Tushar Pawar

He said this while presiding over a meeting of district and taluka-level office bearers of the party on Wednesday. Thakor said the Congress will announce the names of its candidates first on the all seats where it is considered relatively weak, so candidates and leaders can get more time to reach out to the public. Even as the BJP has claimed that it will win all 182 seats in next year’s election, Thakor said he has set a realistic target for the Congress to win 125 seats. Thakor also said that all the party’s organizational issues will be sorted out in the next fortnight. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jagdish-thakor-sets-cong-target-of-125-seats/articleshow/88173383.cms||---

The commissioner and his family were ardent fans of the actor and admired his simplicity. “When the male calf was born and we were discussing the name, my mother suggested we call him Appu. We have been ardent fans of the star. Despite belonging to the Raj Kumar family, he has always been down to earth and the manner the family conducts themselves with humility has been my inspiration. I had met Puneeth on a couple of occasions and was amazed by the kind of respect he extends to every person --- be it an officer or an ordinary fan. He has taught us to remain humble and he did films that a family can watch together,” Shashi Kumar said. Currently, the officer also rears a Jersey breed --- a cow and a calf -- and a Malnad gidda cow and calf. “To take care of the cattle, we have appointed a local person. But whenever we find time, we look after the cattle ourselves. My family -- mother and sister -- also clean and take care of the animals. We were deeply pained with the sudden death of Appu. It was like losing a family member. In case we had a newborn in our family, we would have probably named him Puneeth. But since we have a calf (of the Malnad Gidda) who will remain with us, we decided to name him Appu,” he said. Soon after the actor’s demise on October 29, the commissioner had demanded the Padma Shri for Puneeth Rajkumar on Twitter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mluru-city-cop-chief-names-newborn-calf-appu/articleshow/88173064.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Masks key to stop & break infection chain: Virologists||HYDERABAD: With the threat of the highly mutated Omicron variant of Covid-19 looming, virologists say that wearing a mask when around others, even at home, will be the main preventive weapon. This will be especially required for people having family members in the ‘vulnerable’ category — immunocompromised patients having kidney or lung disease, cancer, have undergone an organ transplantation, uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension among others. As the pandemic is unlikely to disappear immediately, wearing masks around people is recommended up to April-May next year. “As Omicron has undergone a high number of mutations, it means that every time the virus mutates it has an adverse environment condition for it prevailing. With large number of people being vaccinated, it has become less damaging to be able to survive. But it appears to be highly infectious, something that it has retained from the mother strain. Therefore, everybody has to wear masks and follow all Covid protocols even if they are double vaccinated as there is every chance of breakthrough infections,” said Dr P Sangram, former director, Institute of Preventive Medicine and state public health laboratory. The expert also suggested that immune-compromised people, elderly and people with poor nutritional status should go for booster doses whenever available. State health authorities, meanwhile, have been advocating the use of masks at home for a while now. “While people have started masking up again since the threat of the new variant, many still do not understand the virus can spread within a family in minutes if a mask is not worn. A mask is the best protection and easiest way to cut out chain of infection,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health, Telangana. But wearing a mask right holds the key. “Wearing the mask properly is more important, which should cover nose and mouth fully. Not just the chin or neck as most people do,” said Dr Ehsan Ahmad Khan, superintendent, Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/masks-key-to-stop-break-infection-chain-virologists/articleshow/88173477.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Telangana close to meeting 4 crore vax milestone||HYDERABAD: The state is close to administering four crore doses of the Covid-19 vaccine over the next 24 hours with 3,99,21,813 doses given till Wednesday. Telangana had administered one crore doses within 165 days after the state-wide vaccination drive began on January 16 this year. Since then, the state has seen an increase in vaccine stock availability and greater efforts by authorities to administer doses to the eligible population. As a result, the state reached the milestone of two crore doses within 78 days of reaching the one-crore-mark. The next one crore doses were administered within 27 days as Telangana reached the three-crore-mark on October 23. However, after reaching the three-crore-mark, the pace of vaccine administration has slowed down slightly. Some experts believe that the pace has slackened as many have become relaxed over the urgency to get vaccinated following the end of the second wave. As a result, the gap between reaching three crore doses and four crore days will be around 45 days. With concerns over the Omicron variant of Covid-19 looming, the number of daily doses administered has crossed the 2-lakh mark over the last few days with 10 lakh doses being given in the last four days. “We are making every effort to ensure that by the end of this month all eligible persons in the state have taken their first dose and that no one is late for a second dose. The health teams are working overtime,” said Telangana director of public health, Dr G Srininvasa Rao. Currently, 18 lakh eligible persons in the state are yet to receive their first dose. So far, 94 per cent have been administered the first dose while around 50 per cent have taken their second dose of the vaccine. “It is now proven that vaccines have nearly no detrimental effect on those who take them, and the observations now indicate that existing vaccines cannot be totally avoided by the Omicron variant,” said Dr Kiran Madala, an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-certified researcher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-close-to-meeting-4-crore-vax-milestone/articleshow/88173474.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The death and recovery rates are similar for people vaccinated with either Covishield or Covaxin as both offer equal and similar protection in cases of breakthrough infection. “We found no difference in occurrence of severe disease at admission, need for mechanical ventilation or in-hospital mortality between patients with breakthrough Covid-19 who received either of the two vaccines,” said researchers from All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, who conducted the first-of-its-kind study on real-world efficiency of the two vaccines. Both Covaxin and Covishield are administered under the government’s free immunisation programme in Telangana. Stating that previously reported data from AIIMS, New Delhi, cohort study demonstrated that mortality rates were significantly lower among fully vaccinated (5.7%) compared with partially vaccinated (19.5%) or unvaccinated (22.8%) individuals, researchers said the latest results are reassuring regarding the real-world efficiency of both vaccines in a setting with circulation of the Delta variant (B.1.617.2). The result of the research was published in pre-print server MedRxiv on December 7. The team comprised Tejas M Suri, Tamoghna Ghosh, Arunachalam M, Rohit Vadala, Saurabh Vig, Sushma Bhatnagar and Anant Mohan. The study covered 353 patients between April and June 2021. Of them 181 (51.3%) received Covaxin (156 partially vaccinated and 25 fully vaccinated) and 172 (48.7%) received Covishield (155 partially vaccinated and 17 fully vaccinated). The study was conducted during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. “The in-hospital mortality did not differ between the recipients of Covishield or Covaxin in either the fully vaccinated (2 deaths (11.8%) vs 0 deaths (0%) respectively, or the partially vaccinated cohorts (31 deaths (20%) vs 28 deaths (17.9%), respectively,” the study revealed. The researchers said theirs was the first head-to-head comparison study of different vaccines. They said the vaccines offered protection at a lower magnitude against the Delta variant, which was the predominant strain during the second wave. “The efficacy of Covishield against the Delta variant was found to be 67.0%, while that of Covaxin was 65.2%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/low-mortality-in-breakthrough-infections-irrespective-of-vaccine-finds-aiims-study/articleshow/88173480.cms||Syed Akbar

Many provide excuses ranging from being unable to abstain from alcohol on the day of vaccination to insisting on safety promises for their life in order to receive the vaccine. Some people have sharp questions for officials. “A person has requested that we provide him with an LIC certificate in order for him to receive the first dosage of vaccine. He thinks the vaccine is dangerous and we could not convince him,” a Khammam district official said In another instance, a resident in Tatipalli village in Jagtial’s Malyal mandal refused to pay heed to officials that the vaccine would provide protection from Covid-19. Despite the efforts of a team of senior officials, he refused to take the vaccine on the grounds that the jab would be a threat to his life. The team returned without giving him the vaccine shot. Officials believe that while some people have absolute vaccine resistance, some others have acquired anxiety after experiencing fever and other symptoms after receiving their first shot. “There are some people who are worried they will develop body pains and refuse to take the second dose. We are telling them that in order to have full protection against the virus, they must take two doses,” an official said. In the wake of Omicron fears, officials are warning the public about the need for vaccine certification. On Wednesday, municipal authorities in Dubbak asked shopkeepers not to encourage anyone who did not have an immunisation certificate to access the premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/officials-in-a-bind-over-excuses-to-skip-jab/articleshow/88173517.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Vaccination requires participation of everyone, including representatives, for it to be 100% effective,” said Rao at the inauguration of a 100-bed floor at Kondapur District Hospital. Appreciating the role of corporates in improving the bed strength as part of their CSR work, the minister said, “During the peak of the pandemic, an additional 1,300 beds were set up in government hospitals in Hyderabad as part of CSR. Raheja Corp came forward at a time when the demand for beds in government hospitals was high during the pandemic.” The additional floor at the Kondapur District Hospital has been built by the Mindspace Business Parks REIT as part of CSR. The health minister said that paediatric wards with a total of 6,000 beds was available in 33 districts of the state and the government was ready with an action plan to tackle any third wave. “More than 900 ICU beds will be available soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/corporators-must-visit-each-home-ensure-all-take-jab/articleshow/88173493.cms||---

They said that authorities were forcing both teachers and students to attend physical classes. “We have seen instances of district officials denying permission to school principals to temporarily shut school even when five or more Covid-19 cases are reported from a school. Officials should strictly follow guidelines issued by the state and ICMR. They should not force students and teachers to attend physical cases when there is an outbreak,” said Chava Ravi, general secretary, Telangana State United Teachers Federation. Doctors reiterated that whenever there is an outbreak, the place should ideally be closed for two weeks, which is the prescribed quarantine period. The attendance in schools where Covid-19 cases are reported is declining drastically as many parents are now concerned. At the Zilla Parishad High School, Mamidipally, while 120 students attended physical classes on Monday, the number dropped to just 15 on Wednesday. “It is better to be cautious and precautious rather than assuming that nothing would happen,” said Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, National Secretary for the Indian Medical Association’s Academy of Medical Specialities (AMS). He said that students, teachers, and other staff should be asked to be in quarantine for 14 days and the entire premises should be shut and reopened after two weeks after disinfecting. An official from the school education department said that the state is more inclined towards sanitising and running the school rather than temporarily shutting down when Covid-19 cases are reported to prevent further loss of learning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shut-covid-hit-schools-temporarily-teachers-body/articleshow/88173537.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Hyderabad||Telangana govt schools fail sanitisation test||HYDERABAD: Government schools across the state continue to score low on sanitising their premises as they neither have the budget nor the staff to do it. To add to their woes, the already over-burdened municipal and panchayat staff given the additional task of sanitisation have mostly avoided the job.. “In the last three to four days, attendance in our school has fallen from 80 per cent to 65 per cent as many students are down with fever, cold and other Covid-related symptoms. But even then the school has not been sanitised,” informed M Ravinder, a maths teacher in a government school in the city and vice-president of the Telangana Progressive Teachers Federation. Ravinder said that the municipal staff too cannot be blamed completely as they have to take care of sanitising schools along with their regular duties. “How many schools can they visit in a day? Why can’t the state sanction a budget to hire a person for sanitising schools?” he asked. Across Telangana, there are over 26,000 government schools with more than 20 lakh students in them. Every year, Rs 63 crore is sanctioned from Samagra Shiksha as budget for sanitisation in government schools in the state. During the pandemic, no budget was sanctioned. Instead, the state government had directed the municipal/gram panchayat workers to take care of sanitisation of premises. Health experts said that it was important to disinfect the entire premise every day to prevent Covid-19 spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-schools-fail-sanitisation-test/articleshow/88173530.cms||---

SSST has also stressed on the need for devotees to use double masks, hand sanitisers and maintain physical distance during darshan. In a statement, SSST CEO Bhagyashree Banayat, said that the devotees must take all necessary precautions. “We would appeal to devotees to book darshan passes online by logging onto online.sai.org.in for comfortable and hassle-free darshan of Saibaba. The offline passes are limited in number and are being distributed on a first come first serve basis,” she said. The SSST officials said that booking online passes would also ensure that there is no overcrowding at the offline pass centres, especially on Thursdays, weekends and government holidays. The Sai temple had reopened from October 7 and the Ahmednagar district administration has allowed the SSST management to allow a maximum of 25,000 devotees a day to ensure that there is no overcrowding at the temple. The bulk of the daily darshan passes are available online. Recently,the district administration had allowed SSST to restart its prasadalaya where devotees are given food free of cost. The temple authorities are undertaking thermal screening of the devotees and providing them with hand sanitisers. The staff is also ensuring that devotees maintain physical distancing while waiting in the queue. Banayat said that both the temple staff and the devotees should wear double masks, sanitise their hands frequently and maintain physical distance. “Devotees should remember flowers and other religious items are not allowed inside the temple,” added Banayat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/sai-temple-trust-asks-devotees-to-book-darshan-passes-online/articleshow/88171952.cms||---

Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri also issued notice to Chadha and DJB on BJP functionary Ramvir Singh Bidhuri’s challenge to the summons issued to him on the complaint. Bidhuri contended in his petition that the defamation complaint and proceedings against him were an abuse of process of law. The complaint, filed by DJB and its vice-chairperson Chadha, claimed that Bidhuri and other BJP functionaries indulged in a malicious campaign to tarnish their reputation. It alleged that on January 21, a press conference was held by the accused persons who levelled allegations of corruption against DJB and Chadha. According to the complaint, the accused deliberately made defamatory statements in spite of knowing that such allegations were false and would tarnish the image of complainants. In his petition challenging the summons, Bidhuri claimed that he has been at the forefront of exposing irregularities in the working of the city government, which is the job of any opposition party in a democracy, and therefore, cannot be accused of defamation for highlighting the “total mismanagement of accounts” of DJB. “The petitioner being a responsible leader of the opposition is entitled to his democratic right to protest,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/proceedings-in-defamation-case-against-bjp-members-stayed/articleshow/88174074.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The department has fixed responsibility of 75 officers, each to visit one district and monitor the quality of mid-day meals in at least five primary or upper primary schools and two Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas. The department has divided the inspection team in two groups. While 37 districts will be covered by 37 officials on December 9 and 10, the remaining 38 will visit the schools in districts allotted to them on December 13 and 14. Director general, school education, Anamika Singh has further instructed officials to submit their inspection report online. In addition, the team will also track the progress of direct-benefit transfer (DBT) scheme. Aimed at enhancing the nutritional levels of school children, the mid-day meal is served to students from classes 1 to 8 — around 1.8 crore children enrolled in 1.34 lakh government and government-aided schools. However, incidents of sub-standard food being served to students have surfaced in schools from time to time. The most recent case is of a primary school in Sarsi village in Ghatampur (Kanpur) where over 45 students were rushed to a community health centre following complaints of vomiting, dizziness and pain in stomach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/drive-to-check-quality-of-mid-day-meal-from-today/articleshow/88174081.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The health officials said that the training will continue even on Thursday. In Jalgaon district too, training was given to over 40 vaccinators for two hours. “This is the different kind of vaccine given using a needle-free device.

The officials said that over five lakh beneficiaries are expected to be given this needle-free vaccine altogether in Nashik and Jalgaon districts. “The training in both the districts will be over by Thursday. We are expecting that needle-free vaccination will begin in both the districts after December 15. The state government wants to complete vaccination of all the beneficiaries at the earliest,” said health officials. “It was an interesting training session.

She stated that by violating their premature release conditions, the duo were involved in criminal cases including the murder of her husband during November 2020 for which a case was registered by the Andipatti police in Theni district.Since her representation seeking to rescind (cancel) the premature release of the duo were not considered by the authorities, the petitioner filed the present petition before the HC Madurai bench in 2020.During the previous hearing, the additional public prosecutor submitted that the director general of prisons had sent communications to the home secretary for rescinding the premature release granted to the two people. However, the communications were not considered so far.The court had expressed its discontent over the inaction on part of the home secretary in not acting upon the communication of the director general of prisons, despite the lapse of over six months.

In the affidavit, the state has urged the court to direct Tamil Nadu and the supervisory committee to avoid endangering the lives of people and damages to properties by releasing huge quantities of water in the wee hours and at night. The Tamil Nadu government has to be issued a directive to release the water in a controlled manner instead of releasing a huge quantity of water all of a sudden without sufficient warning, said the affidavit. It also suggested the setting up of a joint technical on-site committee for spillway release to decide on the quantity and time of surplus discharge from the dam. “The main demand of the state is that the shutters must not be opened during night time and that the state must be informed at least 24 hours before the opening of the dam,” said water resources minister Roshy Augustine. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu continued to open the dam shutters without issuing proper warnings again on Wednesday. After the water level reduced, TN closed all the shutters on Tuesday night except the third one, but in the wake of increased inflow all the shutters were again opened between 5am to 7am on Wednesday, releasing 7,105.59 cusecs of water to the Periyar. The huge amount of water released in the early morning led to flooding and water gushed into many houses in downstream areas. Shaji Kurisummood, a resident in Vallakkadvu, said the dam operates like a ‘night shop’. “TN has been closing the shutters during the daytime and opening them at night. On Wednesday, they opened all the shutters early in the morning. It causes so many difficulties,” he said. Sivan, a resident in Churakkulam Aatoram said for the last one week they have been spending the night in a house, far from the riverbank. “When TN releases such a large amount of water, my house gets flooded. Within two weeks my home got flooded over five times,” he said. By Wednesday evening, TN closed all the spillway shutters except one with the water level declining to 142.75ft at 4pm. For the past one week Tamil Nadu has been opening the shutters at night with short notice. A few times, it has been alleged that the irrigation officials were informed only after the shutters were opened. Meanwhile, shutter number 3 of the Idukki reservoir remained open on Wednesday. A dam safety official said that a decision on closing the shutter will be taken after taking into account the inflow from Mullaperiyar dam. “We don’t know how much water will be released from Mullaperiyar,” he said. The water level in Idukki dam declined 2,401.38ft by 7pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tn-must-inform-24-hrs-in-advance/articleshow/88173416.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Pursuant to the said conspiracy, they intercepted Pachaiperumal on July 12, 2007 and inflicted injuries on him indiscriminately which caused his death.The Eral police registered a case against the 12 and filed the final report before the court. In 2009, the additional sessions court acquitted all the 12 people. Challenging the order of the trial court, Patchaiperumal’s wife P Thilagavathi had filed the present criminal appeal before the HC Madurai bench.A division bench of justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran said that the projection of the prosecution is that the deceased sustained seven cut injuries and four lacerated injuries over his head, neck, shoulders and limbs. In spite of adequate evidence to convict the accused, the trial court has disbelieved the prosecution case in entirety for slender reasons due to his fanciful reasoning and doubts.The judges observed that the court cannot lose sight of the fact that it is a case involving multiple accused and multiple injuries, naturally the witnesses are subjected to cross examination by multiple advocates. Failure to attribute definite roles ascribing to the accused or minor variations in ascribing the roles to the accused, alone cannot be a reasonable ground for acquittal.The judges said that in so far as the accused - Murugesan alias Shanmugasundram, Pachaiperumal alias Patchikutti, Palavesaraj alias Palavesamuthu, Kulasekarapandian and Blade Ganesan alias Selvaganesan, their overt act and intention is well established through reliable witnesses. The available evidence is sufficiently adequate to hold that them guilty for their respective role played sharing common intention to murder Pachaiperumal.Hence, the judges set aside the acquittal order of the trial court in respect of the five men, convicted and sentenced them to undergo life imprisonment. The acquittal of the remaining seven by the trial court was confirmed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-sets-aside-acquittal-order-imposes-life-sentence-on-five/articleshow/88173412.cms||Kaushik Kannan

One of the oldest in Tamil Nadu, the bridge has stood the test of time, especially during floods.M Rajan, coordinator of Vaigai Nathi Makkal Iyakkam, says the British who administered Madurai and neighbouring places had their office on the southern side of Vaigai river where the officers also lived. In 1857, they decided to shift the administrative office to the northern side of the river. At that time, people commonly used the river bed to go to both sides and there was no bridge.It was in 1884 that the then district collector, Albert Victor, decided to construct the bridge across the river spanning 300 metres and balanced on 14 pillars of black granite stones. It took two-and-a-half years to complete and was opened for public use on December 8, 1886. Apart from Rajan, RTI activist K Hakkim, social activists L Amudhan, Valikaati Manikandan, M P Sankarapandian, Abubucker, Ashok, Arivuselvam, Parthasarathy and Karthik among others celebrated the birthday of the bridge by cutting a cake. They said that the government should give immediate attention to pillars seven and eight which were damaged underneath. The concrete hand railings also have iron rods jutting out. These should be attended to immediately and the bridge declared a heritage structure, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/av-bridge-turns-136-sparks-celebration/articleshow/88173415.cms||---

Announcing this at a press conference on Wednesday, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said, the dedication of KV Dham will be attended by senior politicians, including chief ministers of various states and seers and dharmacharyas.

Singh said, the party has kicked off a Swachhta Abhiyan around all temples across the state, which will be carried out till December 12. At the same time, BJP will distribute literature — Divya Kashi Bhavya Kashi — to seers and felicitate them. The campaign has already begun in Varanasi from December 5 and is being carried out in every ward of the city.

The committee also aims to reduce the 1% education cess charged on annual/rateable value of property. SDMC standing committee chairman Col (retd) BK Oberoi said that they would propose to charge the education cess on the final property tax amount calculated after giving all rebates and concessions such as 15% rebate for timely payment and additional rebate for 30% to the senior citizens, women, disabled people. “Though the Delhi Municipal Act allows the civic agency to levy three kinds of tax, including education and professional tax, there is no clarity for deduction of amount from the annual/rateable value of property or taxable amount. This is the cause of confusion, which is why we aim to bring a proposal,” said Oberoi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-may-give-breather-on-property-tax/articleshow/88174101.cms||Vibha Sharma

Addressing a public rally, Maurya said, "The way Kanshi Ram, Jyotiba Phule and Karpoori Thakur are our beloved forefathers, in the same way Lord Ram is our ancestor. That is why the BSP, Congress, SP and RLD, who used to oppose construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, are now bowing before Lord Ram and taking a dip during the Kumbh." Raking the 2013 Muzaffarnagar violence, Maurya said, "It was the SP government and its minister Azam Khan who got the criminals released after the riots, but now things have changed.

The southern railway is expected to announce the date for operating the train soon.Earlier, there was a passenger train from Palakkad to Tiruchendur on the Pollachi-Palani-Madurai route. Now that the railway has taken a policy decision not to operate long-distance passenger trains, it has come up with a passenger train from Palakkad to Pollachi and an express train between Pollachi and Tiruchendur.Pollachi Lok Sabha member K Shanmuga Sundaram has, meanwhile, sought the extension of the train till Coimbatore. He shot off a letter to southern railway general manager John Thomas on Wednesday, stating there was no direct train to Coimbatore from the southern districts on Palani-Pollachi route. “The extension of service will help devotees from the southern districts to visit Marudamalai, which is considered one of the six abodes of lord Murugan.”K Jayaraj, member, Salem Divisional Railway Users’ Consultative Committee, said the train service, if operated up to Mettupalayam, could help multiply the revenue as it would ensure greater occupancy rate on the underutilized Podanur-Pollachi-Palani-Dindigul section. “It will be easy for the people from the southern districts to travel to the pilgrim centres such as Pollachi Masaniamman temple, Perur Pateeswarar temple, Maruthamalai Murugan temple, Mettupalayam Vana Bhardrakaliamman temple and the hill station of Nilgiris.

---||Madurai||Vaigai water-laden, cattle owners in a spot over absence of grazing land||Madurai: Cattle owners living near the banks of Vaigai river in Madurai city have sought an alternative area with shelters for keeping and grazing their cattle which they can use regularly. With the river still filled with water, cattle can no more graze in the river bed, and letting them into the roads will attract fines.Cattle rearing has been the livelihood of many people for decades. “Cattle owners usually graze their cattle in the river beds of Vaigai from Arapalayam till Kurivikaran Salai. However, the floods and intensified action against stray cattle on roads have made things tougher for us. Those who had the means built shelters for the cattle," said M Sundaram, a resident of Mathichiyam, who has been rearing cattle for over 40 years.Cattle owners say that with the wall being built on the river bank, they have little space to maintain the animals. S Sundari, who has been a cattle owner of 14 years residing on Vaigai North Banks Road, said that rearing cows has been enough to keep her family afloat but there is no profit as such. "We can get milk for our family and earn around Rs 50-100 a day additionally. We get barely enough to ensure cattle are kept well and healthy. We also have to be careful of fines levied by corporation if the cattle stray," she added. In the Vaigai North Bank Road, there are around 200-300 heads of cattle.Despite Vaigai river being filled with water amid release of dam water and the rains in the district, some cattle are being led close to the river bed for grazing. "Cattle owners were able to freely survive near the banks of Vaigai before but now we are cornered. With many of us being evicted from our houses on the banks, we have to stay in rented houses. Some cattle, especially goats, get stolen now. It would be helpful if there is some alternative arrangement for us,” said N Adhamma, a cattle owner for 25 years.Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan said letting cattle stray on roads is an offence and they are also not permitted on river beds. “We are ready to consider and work out the possibility of an alternative arrangement if we get a formal petition. As of now, cattle owners have not come forward with any complaints,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vaigai-water-laden-cattle-owners-in-a-spot-over-absence-of-grazing-land/articleshow/88173420.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

According to an official from the SMC, Kitchipalayam, Narayana Nagar, Fort, and Gugai were among the areas declared as containment zones in the city. The district reported at least 40 to 50 cases every day and of them 20 were from the SMC limits. As many as 95 Covid-19 patients are being treated in government and private hospitals in the city. The corporation made arrangements to provide essential commodities such as vegetables, milk, and drinking water to people living in the containment zones. The civic body also often fumigated the areas to avoid further spread. Doctors and nurses from the health department have set up camps at the containment zones to collect swab samples from the residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/9-areas-declared-as-containment-zones-in-salem/articleshow/88173427.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Doctors, activists red flag crowds at marriage and political functions||NAGPUR: Even as the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) struggles to check Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB) at places of large gatherings, activists and doctors have called for innovative and stricter measures to curb crowding and norms violations. The NMC zonal health teams are in a dilemma over the civic chief’s decision to randomly test guests attending marriage ceremonies at different venues. As these functions are generally taking place in the evenings, officials say collection of swab samples would not be a better option as government labs are not functional at night hours. Doubts have also been raised on the extent to which the step deters people from violating Covid norms. Members of NGOs, who had helped citizens find beds, oxygen and medicines during the peak of the Covid waves, said marriages can turn out to be super-spreader events and the NMC needs to control crowding without imposing restrictions. Senior pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat said the cost of booster doses would be much less than the losses from another lockdown or curbs on commercial establishments. “Booster doses of Covid vaccines, mask and distancing are the best options. Yet, organizers can be asked to post recordings of the event to ensure people are following protocols. We have to live with Covid, so no point in fearing. How long can we be confined indoors? We have to fight it out with all safety measures,” he said. Activist Joseph George, who helped many people get hospital beds in the hour of crisis, said NMC must put curbs on attendance at public places. “Political gatherings and marriage functions are the real nuisance. There will be lot of pressure, but the administration has to take a call,” he said. Anasuya Kale Chhabrani, secretary of TogetherWeCan which too had helped citizens in Covid distress, said police and civic officials need to hold joint meetings to plan effective Covid management. “Garbage vans can play alerts on new Covid threat instead of usual jingles. Restrictions on timings of shops can be introduced after taking traders’ body into confidence. We need to be proactive and not always blame the administration,” she said. Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said public functions are mix and match of people with different travel histories. “Everyone travels without giving up the thought about the threat of the virus. But the moment they step inside the venue, all measures are shunned. People should look back at the second wave and decide accordingly what they want in the coming days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doctors-activists-red-flag-crowds-at-marriage-and-political-functions/articleshow/88173426.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corporation turns adversity into opportunity, gets Rs 9cr tax in Nov||Thiruvananthapuram: Ward wise publication of tax arrears has boosted the property tax collection in the city corporation. November recorded a collection of Rs 9.75 crores which is more than double the amount the corporation had collected in the same month in 2020. The huge inflow of tax was recorded in a month when there was no field level collection since all the officials were occupied with tax data updation. “It is a classic case of turning adversity into opportunity. When we kicked off the data cleansing process, our timeline was 30 days. Not many thought that we would be able to bring out the arrear list in each ward. Many wards were able to finish the task within 30 days and as for other wards, we could publish the list within 50 days,” said Binu Francis, corporation secretary. He said that the strenuous efforts are now bearing fruit as it has significantly increased the corporation’s tax receipts. The corporation officials said that with actual dues being clearly reflected on the official website of the city corporation for each ward, many people made optimum use of online payment. “A good percentage of tax payments in November happened via online. Earlier people would log in and then back out seeing that arrears from previous years were still showing on the dues list. They would have paid the sum but system would not reflect the payment and many people would not pay it online and due to Covid situation, they were reluctant to turn up directly in offices for payment. The situation changed once we could publish the actual dues,” said a corporation official. It is estimated that 70% of tax payments in November were via online. The spurt in collection has come as a major surprise for the officials. With expenses skyrocketing above Rs 100 crore till August, the revenue wing was directed to spruce up tax collection drives through localized collection camps across all the wards in the city. About 72 bill collectors were assigned individual targets to mop up tax dues and pending collection for the present fiscal. While the corporation expected to gross Rs 20 crore from these tax collection drives, the actual collection fell way short of the target. Kadakampally, Attipra wards have been the major contributors in November and tax amount to the tune of Rs 3.5 crores from Lulu group accounted for major source of tax inflow in November. Even without Lulu’s payment, the corporation collected an additional Rs 2 crore in November when compared to previous year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corporation-turns-adversity-into-opportunity-gets-rs-9cr-tax-in-nov/articleshow/88151675.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Lucknow||UP to fast-track SFIDS to double farm income||Lucknow: Galloping into a pro-farmer mode, the Yogi Adityanath government in UP has come up with a formal plan to double farmers’ income — a key poll promise that BJP seeks to roll out ahead of elections early next year. As per the plan, the state government will fast-track the ‘Atma Nirbhar Krishak Samanvit Vikas Yojana’ or Self-dependent Farmer Integrated Development Scheme (SFIDS), while pitching the farming sector as a “focal point of development” with forward and backward linkages to corollary sectors like horticulture, food processing, cane development, dairy and animal husbandry. The plan also entails division of state into nine climatic zones — crops with higher yield in respective zones will be identified and promoted. These crops would also receive support of new agricultural techniques investment. At the same time, value addition will be done for maximizing cost benefit. The plan also envisages development of markets to boost sale of agricultural products. The move marks BJP’s attempt to escalate its farmer outreach while neutralizing an aggressive opposition, which has been seeking to corner the ruling dispensation on farmers’ issues. This also comes days after the Centre repealed the three contentious farm laws, which were at the epicentre of a raging farmer protest. In a detailed order issued by additional chief secretary (agriculture), Devesh Chaturvedi, said, special focus needs to be put in place on solving problems faced by farmers during agricultural operations. The SFIDS, in fact, seeks to work on two scales. First, accelerating the constitution of the Farmer Producer Organisation (FPOs) and promoting them in trade pursuits. And second, timely and strategic spending of Centre’s agricultural infrastructure funds. Two days ago, the state cabinet green-flagged SFIDS which lays special focus on setting up of 1,475 Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) in development blocks across the state over three years. The concept of FPO entails farmers to form groups and register themselves with the government for buying and selling of farm products. The Centre had come up with a formal policy for setting up 10,000 FPOs with help of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDS), National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED) and Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC). As per the Centre policy, the state government will be setting up at least 2,000 FPOs every year, beginning 2021-22. Of this, UP will set up 200 FPOs every year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-to-fast-track-sfids-to-double-farm-income/articleshow/88174104.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Jaipur||SC grants interim protection from arrest to man accused of raping woman on pretext of marriage||New Delhi/Jaipur: The Supreme Court has granted interim protection from arrest to a man accused of raping a woman on the pretext of marriage. A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Bela M Trivedi issued notice to the Rajasthan government and others on the appeal filed by the man against the high court order. “Issue notice, returnable within three weeks. Subject to the petitioner joining investigation and cooperating with the authorities, the petitioner would not be arrested until the next date of hearing,” the bench said in its order. The apex court, however, granted liberty to the police to move an application for vacation of this interim order. Advocate Namit Saxena, appearing for the petitioner, submitted that the allegation of rape against his client was baseless. Saxena stated that frivolous allegations have been levelled against the accused as he refused to marry the woman. The top court was hearing an appeal filed by Mukesh Kumar Singh, working on the post of Technician Grade 1 at Jaipur, against the order passed by Rajasthan high court which dismissed his anticipatory bail plea. According to the appeal, Singh met the woman for the first time about 10 years ago when they came in contact with each other on account of work. In due course, Singh and the complainant remained in touch through messages and calls and also used to meet regularly, the appeal said. On August 6, 2021, Singh's marriage was fixed by his parents. When the complainant came to know about this, she allegedly started blackmailing, asking him to marry her and warned that she would lodge a rape case against him, the appeal said. Later, the complainant lodged a case against Singh in October at Jaipur, it said.(with agencies)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sc-grants-interim-protection-from-arrest-to-man-accused-of-raping-woman-on-pretext-of-marriage/articleshow/88174105.cms||---

The truck was also trapped on the caved-in road. A city corporation officer said the truck, which came from Bengaluru, had skipped the main road to evade police and taken to streets to reach a hardware shop at RS Puram. K Srihari, 23, a resident of Devangapettai, said, “As soon as it entered Devangapettai Street at Poo Market at 11am, the road caved in, damaging the underground drainage pipeline beneath it. The truck tilted to its left side and got stuck on the caved-in road.” He said the truck driver had abandoned the truck and escaped from the area when they alerted police. The truck owner, however, arrived on the spot in the afternoon after police warned to confiscate the vehicle. “Another vehicle was brought to load the bricks and remove the truck from the street,” he said. The city corporation official said the soil beneath the road had loosened because of the incessant rain over the past few days. “As such, the road could not withstand the weight of the overloaded truck. We are planning to impose a fine on the truck owner for damaging the underground drainage pipeline.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/overloaded-truck-causes-road-to-cave-in-at-flower-market/articleshow/88173435.cms||---

Sources said the 14-year-old girl from Mangudi had got married to a 26-year-old man at a ceremony in the morning with the consent of her father and the boy’s mother. After the marriage, she had gone to school wearing the ‘thali’ chain. The social welfare department and police were alerted through a call from the school on Childline. The girl was subsequently rescued and produced before Madurai district child welfare committee (CWC). Committee members L Shanmugam and M R Shanthi submitted a report to the police on Wednesday. The girl was sent home with her mother who had been against the marriage. Othakadai police have meanwhile booked the groom, his mother and the girl’s father. Sources said that the girl did not have any sexual contact with the groom and hence the case against the accused was registered only under Prohibition of Child Marriage Act. “Child marriage greatly affects the future of a girl child especially at the age when one is still going to school. Early pregnancy and motherhood at such a young age will result in the child being unable to properly take care of herself and her child or family,” said Shanmugam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/class-ix-girl-comes-to-school-after-marriage-rescued/articleshow/88173438.cms||---

Though there have been no recent Covid-19 cases reported in colleges, the institutions are finding it tough to strictly enforce Covid-appropriate norms.Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) began holding offline classes this month along with its affiliated colleges on the instructions of the government. “We are having offline classes for all students now. Three students had tested Covid-19 positive in November and the university had to be shut for three days. We are ensuring safety norms on campus including in hostels. Only those who received at least one dose are permitted and with acceptance from parents,” said Dr V S Vasantha, MKU registrar (in charge). Since the university had to allow all students back on campus the student strength has increased significantly.“We are happy to be allowed on to campus for offline classes especially as we are just entering college. However, it is not possible to maintain all Covid-19 safety measures, which is a concern. Not everyone wears masks properly and there is crowding too sometimes. While older students are vaccinated at least, first year students like us are unvaccinated too,” said K Srivarshini, a first year BSc Physics student of an arts and sciences college. Another second year BSc Computer Science student, S Harish Kumar, said that a longterm solution is needed to keep students safe.Dr Christianna Singh, principal and secretary of Lady Doak College, said they started offline classes in a full-fledged manner making attendance a must. Nearly 700 hostel students are also residing in the college. The college was among the few which were continuing with mainly online classes in November due to high strength of students. “With such huge number of students, it is difficult to ensure Covid-19 safety measures at all times. We are trying our best but as we still have to hold offline classes, we have no choice,” said a faculty member. Dr D Pandiaraja, principal, Thiagarajar College of Arts and Science, said almost all classes are offline and they have 100% attendance. “There are no major issues of overcrowding and so far we have had no Covid-19 cases among students. We are also insisting on vaccination,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/colleges-adapting-to-offline-classes-with-covid-protocols/articleshow/88173442.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The daily turnout for vaccination also remains dull. At present, on regular week days without the mega vaccination drive, around 10,000 beneficiaries are being vaccinated in a day.According to health officials, only around 73% of eligible adult population has taken the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, while only 37% has taken the second dose in Madurai district, which is less than the state average. A health official said that many who are due for their second dose are yet to come forward to take it. “We urge the public to come forward to take the Covid-19 vaccine. There is no shortage in stock of vaccines anywhere and we are trying to make the vaccines as much accessible as possible for all. Door-to-door vaccination is also being continued. We should use the opportunity to get vaccinated and be more protected especially when cases are low in the district,” said Dr S Senthil Kumar, deputy director of health services, Madurai.“Hesitancy to come forward to take the vaccine due to various myths like the vaccinated cannot consume alcohol, is still prevalent. On week days, many are going out for work during the day and are not keen to take the jab even during door-to-door vaccination. Some are also delaying it due to fear of getting a fever or body ache,” said a health official.Though the mega vaccination drive organized on Saturday saw good response with 85,003 beneficiaries being vaccinated, on regular days, only around 10,000 are getting vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/poor-turnout-at-daily-jab-centres-despite-new-norm/articleshow/88173440.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Congress releases ‘pink manifesto’ to woo women voters in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: Asserting that rival parties are scared that Congress’ proposal for increasing representation of women in the political arena would upset their matrix of caste and religion-based politics, Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra launched the ‘Pink Manifesto’ here on Wednesday in the run up to 2022 assembly elections. “The ‘real’ development of India will remain a dream till women get good representation in politics. As on date, less than 14% representatives in Lok Sabha and state assemblies are women,” Priyanka said, adding that the dedicated women’s manifesto of Congress is the first of its kind and she hopes it inspires other parties also. Earlier, Congress had announced to give 40% of tickets for upcoming UP elections to women candidates. The party then promised that if it comes to power, it will give electric scooters and smartphones to Class XII pass girls and will increase the honorarium of ASHAs to Rs 10,000. Both the promises are mentioned in the Pink Manifesto besides others. Asked if she was trying to change the rules of the game in UP politics where caste and religion are considered crucial to win seats, Priyanka said: “Congress has always worked for the betterment of women, and we are taking this further by giving them 40% of tickets. Others are questioning us as they are scared that our pitch for women would upset their traditional matrix of caste and religionbased politics.” Nudging aside a question on whether her party would implement the same formula in Congress-ruled states also, Priyanka said: “I am incharge of Uttar Pradesh and can speak only about here.” Claiming that a lot of efforts had gone into the making of the women’s manifesto over the past 10 months, Priyanka claimed that Congress’ bet on women will change the course of India’s politics forever and for the better. “The manifesto is divided into six areas, namely, selfrespect, dignity, self-reliance, education, safety and health. Instead of making seasonal poll promises, our manifesto is a roadmap that aspires to bring real empowerment of women,” she said, listing it was Congress which gave India its first President, Prime Minister and UP its first chief minister. Don’t need cert on my religion: PGVAsserting that her religion was personal matter, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said she doesn’t need certificate from CM Yogi Adityanath about her religion. Responding to the CM’s statement that “opportunistic opposition leaders are visiting Ayodhya for kar seva in election season, she said: “How does Yogiji know which temple I go. Will he give me a certificate on my religion and faith? I do not need any certificates from him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cong-releases-pink-manifesto-to-woo-women-voters-in-state/articleshow/88174127.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The incident took place on December 2, but came to fore on Wednesday night. The deceased has been identified as Farzana (21, a resident of Gittikhadan), while the accused boy friend Mujahid Ansari (22, a resident of Mominpura) has been arrested by city police. According to police, Farzana and Mujahid had a love affair. The two were also supposed to get married. But a few days ago, Farzana had an affair with another youth and had started to avoid him. On December 2, he contacted Farzana and asked her to reach Empress Mall. On the same day, around 2pm, Farzana reached the spot and Mujahid took her to the fourth floor of the Empress Mall. He then allegedly strangled her and went home. After Farzana went missing, her relatives searched for her. As they failed to locate her, they filed a missing complaint at Gittikhadan police. Gittikhadan police launched an investigation and checked her mobile call details. Police received information that Farzana was having an affair with Mujahid. On Wednesday, police called Mujahid for interrogation, during which he spilled the beans and confessed to having strangled her in a fit of rage. Police immediately took him to Empress Mall, where her body was found in a half decomposed state. The police sent the body to the hospital for post mortem.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||I am being victimised, says nurse under suspension||Thiruvananthapuram: “I would never be careless in my profession. I had waited for 14 years to get this job. My mother wanted me to be a nurse,” says the junior public health nurse who was placed under suspension after two children were given Covid vaccine by mistake at Aryanad community health center. The 37-year-old nurse who is the mother of two children feels she has been victimised but she does not want to blame anyone. “I don’t want anyone to go through this. I was the one who flagged the matter initially. When a girl walked to me for vaccination, I asked her whether she had registered. It was then that her OP ticket was checked and we found that her age was 15. The girl told us that her friends had already been vaccinated,” recollects the nurse. “What hurt me the most was being charged as careless and that I gave the wrong vaccine. I never gave the wrong vaccine. I have been in service for two and a half years and every single day I have worked with utmost caution and care,” she says. On that day the Covid vaccination was scheduled in the room originally allotted for children’s immunization. Till that day a hall was used for registration and vaccination. There was a fairly good crowd in the morning for vaccination and the nurse says she had no reason to suspect anything because whoever was sent to the vaccination site ought to have been registered, verified and checked by designated officials. The people would also be screened at the door before the vaccination. “There was no way I could have blocked anyone from getting vaccinated. Later when the crowd became thin, there was no one at the entrance of the vaccination site and a girl walked up to me directly and I did a screening and asked for her registration details. She told me that her friends were vaccinated. I talked to the other children over phone and alerted my senior staff at the hospital, whether it was promptly communicated to the higher officials, I am unaware,” she says. The manner in which the health department limited action to suspension of the nurse who gave the jab and let go of other staff responsible for screening, verification, registration, medical check-up and documentation has triggered strong dissent among the other junior public health nurses. Sources in the health department said that the report by the District Medical officer has clearly mentioned the step wise lapses at Aryanad, however disciplinary action has so far been limited to the nurse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/i-am-being-victimised-says-nurse-under-suspension/articleshow/88151778.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Addressing the media at Chelari in Malappuram ahead of Samastha’s meeting on Wednesday, he said that the chief minister himself had assured Samastha’s delegation on Tuesday that it will not take further action on the decision to entrust Waqf board appointments to PSC until a decision is taken after detailed discussions. When asked if Samastha cadres will be participating in the proposed rally announced by IUML on Thursday, he said that it is a political rally and it was up to IUML to decide who all should attend the meet. He said that Samastha had not taken a decision to take out a protest and added that the only decision taken by the organization was to pass a resolution against the government’s decision on the issue. “Where is the need to attack a person when he has assured that the issue will be given a sympathetic consideration,” he asked the media, when he was asked if Samastha will move ahead with protests. Thangal added that Samastha did not have any rift with any political party. Meanwhile, IUML leader MK Muneer said the party does not want to get into conflict with Samastha or any other organization. However, he said that Samastha leaders, including Bahavudheen Nadvi, were present at the meeting organized by Muslim Coordination Committee which had taken a decision to carry out awareness campaigns and protest against the decision of the state government. “Also members of the Panakkad family like Sadikali Shihab Thangal and Rasheed Ali Shihab Thangal are part of Samastha. At the MCC meeting, the decision was taken jointly. Samastha could have taken their decision on the basis of their talks with the CM. But, as a political party we are entitled to take a decision on our own,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/samastha-not-to-be-part-of-protests/articleshow/88173470.cms||---

Track the pollution level in your cityWhile the average PM2.5 levels for low-income households were 23 times the WHO-recommended safe limit of 10mg per cubic metre, it was 29 times in the case of high-income households. The survey covered about 3,000 households in the city between 2018 and 2020. The findings were released on Wednesday. The research also found that on an average, the indoor PM2.5 levels were substantially higher than the corresponding value reported by the nearest government monitor. The study suggested that high-income households were 13 times more likely to own air purifiers than low-income households. However, the indoor air pollution levels in those homes were only 10% lower than those living in disadvantaged settings. “In Delhi, the bottom line is — whether someone is rich or poor, no one gets to breathe clean air,” said Dr Kenneth Lee, the lead author of the study. “It’s a complex vicious cycle. When you do not know about the pollution levels inside your homes, you do not worry about it and are less likely to take corrective action. Only with increased awareness can the demand for clean air gain momentum.” Dr Lee said it was critical to address the information gaps related to indoor air pollution urgently. “High-frequency accurate PM2.5 information communicated through government monitors or indoor monitors is the first step, but only when it is complemented with an increase in literacy around health consequences of pollution and the benefits of adopting various defensive actions can we expect favourable outcomes,” he added. The study said indoor PM2.5 levels tend to spike in the mornings and evenings, the usual time for cooking in households. It also found that in homes with access to real-time pollution data, an 8.6% decline in indoor PM2.5 concentrations was recorded. The research said households were offered a free, month-long trial for an indoor air quality monitor during peak pollution period, but only 15% agreed. It indicated that demand for air pollution information and defensive technologies may be low among residents in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/citys-indoor-pollution-levels-way-above-who-limit-study/articleshow/88173503.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

On Tuesday, the forest officials concerned turned up and pruned the tusks, a task they were delaying for the past two years. Anjaneyan and Chandrasekharan were the tuskers, who got their tusks pruned on Tuesday. It was in the year 2014, Anjaneyan's tusks were pruned for the last time. Chandrasekharan got his tusks pruned last in 2017. Two years ago, the veterinarian under the Devaswom department filed a report stating that it was time to prune their tusks again. The Devaswom officials approached the forest department based on this report. But, the procedure of trimming tusks just kept getting delayed . Sub Judge K Vidhyadharan said that he intervened in the matter of tuskers after coming across the news in this regard in a vernacular newspaper. The Sub Judge even visited the elephants over a week ago and directed the district forest officer and Attingal forest range officer to take necessary steps in a war footing manner.

Even though the state unit of Kerala Medical Post Graduates Association (KMPGA) had called off the strike after discussions with health minister Veena George on Tuesday, the Thiruvananthapuram unit of the association went ahead with the strike. “Four months ago the health minister had talks with the association and had given such promises to our demands. The decision of this meeting was recorded even in the minutes. But it still remains on paper. Hence, we need concrete orders from the government on this. Till then, we will continue the strike,” said Dr Ajithra, president of KMPGA’s Thiruvananthapuram unit. If the government is not ready to come out with the orders in a day or two, then we will be forced to boycott the emergency services too, she added. However, the state committee of the association has made it clear that they will resume the strike, boycotting all emergency services, if the government order is not issued in two days. “After the discussion, the government agreed to our prime demand of appointment of non-academic junior residents and assured that all the groundwork will be finished in a day, including a detailed government order. Hence, we came to a mutual understanding of withdrawing the strike,” said Dr R Naveen, state secretary of KMPGA. If the government order is not published by Thursday (with the number of appointments of non-academic junior residents to be recruited and the remuneration), it will be considered as treason by the health ministry, and we will be going forward with the protest, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pg-medicos-of-tvm-boycott-non-emergency-services/articleshow/88173478.cms||---

Gehlot also reviewed the status of new variant Omicron in the state. He asked officials to maintain vigilance to ensure that this variant did not spread in the state. More and more RTPCR tests should be done for passengers coming from other countries at the airport.

The list of such defaulters will be published and they will be given notices for payment as per relevant provisions of the Kerala Municipality Act. The revenue staff has been directed to cross check the dues list prepared for defaulters with an amount above Rs 1 lakh. Separate list is also being prepared for residents who have filed cases against assessment of property tax. Appeals pending with corporation will also be sorted. As regarding central government and state government institutions which owe tax dues and service dues worth crores, the corporation will send notices to the heads of departments. Preliminary discussions with some of the heads have revealed that the government departments either do not have separate budgetary allocation for payment of property tax or the allocation is meager. “We will have to take up the matter at the government level to ensure sufficient budgetary allocation for payment of property tax. In the case of central government buildings, many heads are unaware about the need to pay service cess,” an official said. As per the ward wise list published by corporation, government and central government buildings account for tax dues running to crores. Tax dues of two airport buildings since 2016-17 come around Rs 1.3 crores, according to dues list published for Chackai ward. Tax dues of around 131 units of KSRTC bus terminal complex at Thampanoor go above Rs 1 crore. The main building of Secretariat owes the corporation Rs 56 lakhs between 2016-17 and 2021-22. Ten other units under the Secretariat also record dues around Rs 20 lakhs in past five fiscals. Cash strapped Thiruvananthapuram Development Authority seems to top the tax defaulter list. TRIDA’s dues to the corporation for a single building in Palayam is Rs 1.58 crores. Around 295 units under TRIDA owe the corporation tax dues between Rs 10,000 - Rs 3 lakhs. Nearly 100 buildings owned by Thiruvananthapuram development authority owe corporation tax dues well over Rs 10 lakhs as TRIDA is the top defaulter of tax dues as per the list made available for Medical college. In 2019, the city corporation prepared the list of tax defaulters among government buildings following re-assessment of all the state government buildings in the city as part of issuing fresh demand notices under new tax regime. The process had posed challenges for the revenue wing as they came across government buildings which had not received building numbers for decades. Under the next tax regime, office buildings are assessed at a rate of Rs 80 per sq.m Over 700 buildings and around 1,000 building numbers were identified by the revenue wing in 49 wards in 2019. The arrears of government buildings in terms of property tax had swelled to Rs 50 crore as per corporation estimates. Four wards in the city have over 30 government buildings. TRIDA, KWA, SAP were found to own the highest number of buildings in various wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/city-residents-with-tax-dues-above-rs-1-lakh-to-receive-notices/articleshow/88172854.cms||Aswin J Kumar

They said that the other education boards had started conducting offline examinations in the semester pattern, but the state board had neither issued the timetable usually announced in November, nor has it declared the mode of exam. Sai Bramhe, a Std X student, said, “There is a lot that goes into preparation for the board exam and we have to keep the paper pattern in mind when we get ready to appear. However, the timetable could be announced anytime now and the exam will be in the next 45 days if it is on schedule. But there is a lack of clear communication and it is hampering our preparation.” Azmed Shaikh, an HSC student, said, “Our prelims are set to start next week and we are giving the traditional pen and paper exam but what if the board decides on the online MCQ format? We will have to retune ourselves and start preparing all over again. The board must give us some clarity at the earliest.” Other students said that the schools had scheduled the prelims and some had two prelims as practice for the main board exams. The state board could at least announce the timetable of the final examination so that there is a clear picture. Sukrut Khude A, another HSC student, said that the entire year has gone by in online learning. “Since October, permission for conducting offline classes was given, but that is not enough for such a critical year and hence we have requested the state education department to conduct the exams online. We have written to the education minister and we hope that our demand is accepted,” he added. Dinkar Patil, chairman of the state board, refused any comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ssc-hsc-students-fret-about-exam-dates-mode/articleshow/88173515.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

---||Delhi||Delhi: 3 municipal corporations list 543 road dust hotspots for urgent action||NEW DELHI: The three municipal corporations in the city identified 543 road dust hotspots in November and mostly used mechanised road sweepers and water sprinklers to bring the problem under control. As per the winter action plan report of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, prepared from daily inputs submitted by its staff, around 137 locations were identified as road dust hotspots. “We mainly used mechanised road sweepers along with water sprinklers at these hotspots to reduce the dust in the air. We had to use mechanised road sweepers for longer periods. We could manage most of these hotspots with these two machineries,” said an official. The north corporation, divided into six zones, has deployed 18 mechanised road sweepers, 100 water sprinklers and two anti-smog guns to settle the dust. The civic body has been working on a few projects to relay these roads, the official said. Similarly, South Delhi Municipal Corporation, divided into four zones, identified 403 such hotspots and deployed 24 mechanised road sweepers, 74 water sprinklers and one anti-smog gun. In East Delhi Municipal Corporation, which is divided into two zones, only three similar hotspots were identified and 10 mechanised road sweepers, three anti-smog guns and 40 water sprinklers with added dust suppressant have been deployed. “Sometimes, we have to use the mechanised sweepers twice. As we have Delhi-UP border areas, the dust is generated because of vehicles and unpaved roads in unauthorised colonies,” said a senior official. Haphazard development in the area has led to many unauthorised constructions over the years, leaving the corporation with a mess to manage. The action plan report prepared by every municipal corporation has data on all the measures taken by each of them to mitigate the causes of air pollution in the city in a particular month. The reports are sent to the green war room set up by the Delhi government to coordinate among all the agencies concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-corpns-list-543-road-dust-hotspots-for-urgent-action/articleshow/88173531.cms||---
---||Jaipur||No high court relief to forest department for work inside Rajasthan's Todgarh sanctuary||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan high court on Wednesday rejected the application of forest department for vacating stay on construction activities inside Todgarh-Raoli Wildlife Sanctuary, which is part of the proposed Kumbhalgarh Tiger Reserve. In August, the stay was ordered when forest department was constructing a road between Vanpath Gomthada and Goram Mandir in the sanctuary using funds provided by the District Mineral Foundation Trust (DMFT). The order dated December 8 reads, “We are not inclined to vacate the stay of the following proposed work including guest room, Gomthara, waiting room, forest path from Gomthada to Goramghat, forest path from Gomthada to Goram temple and Sulabh complex at Jogmandi. After the construction work was proposed, a PIL was filed by wildlife conservationist and lawyer Rituraj Singh. The petitioner had alleged that the project was being undertaken by the forest department due to the political clout of the sitting MLA who had promised such a path to the temple to the voters of his constituency. “Pathways leading to religious sites inside the forest are a real cause of concern. In one such incident, which happened at Ranthambore Tiger Reserve, a leopard was hit by devotees on a bike going to Trinetra Ganesh Temple situated inside the reserve.” At present, there is no motorable connectivity and thousands of devotees flock to the temple at specific intervals. To reach the temple, devotees have to take a metre gauge rail from Marwar Junction, which passes through the jungle, and get down at Goram Ghat station. “From that point, devotees have to walk all the way to the temple on foot. The project will make the path leading to the temple motorable and, thereby, let more devotees enter the forest and go to the temple in vehicles,” Singh said. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has already conducted a survey of Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary to declare it as a tiger reserve. According to the draft, the name of the area is proposed to be Kumbhalgarh Tiger Reserve which will constitute Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, Todgarh-Raoli Wildlife Sanctuary and adjoining forest areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-hc-relief-to-forest-dept-on-work-in-todgarh-sanctuary/articleshow/88173527.cms||---

Police are looking for four of his accomplices, suspected to be in Kerala. MR Anoop, the accused, lived in a rented house at Sahakarnagar, Hebbal for over a year and is a native of Kottayam, Kerala. “The house was rented in another person’s name for Rs 15,000 a month. The kingpin of the racket, who is from Kottayam, arranged the house for Anoop and paid the rent. We will trace the kingpin soon,” an investigating officer. “Two of Anoop’s associates, who are elusive now, were arrested in December last year on drug-peddling charges. Cops had then seized 214kg of ganja worth around Rs 60 lakh from them. The two were also booked by Udupi and Mangaluru police on similar charges,” sources said. Anoop and his aides would bring hashish oil from Kottayam on bus or train. “They would bring in bulk and pack the oil into small sachets weighing between 1 gram and 10 grams. The sachets were sold at parties,” another investigating officer said. DCP (northeast) CK Baba said they probed for more than a month before zeroing in on the accused. “We caught Anoop red-handed under Hebbal flyover on December 4 evening when he was trying to sell hashish oil. Then we raided his house in Sahakarnagar and recovered 11kg of the oil. A police team will leave for Kerala to look for the other accused, including the kingpin,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/drug-peddler-from-state-held-in-bluru/articleshow/88173529.cms||---

The Maharashtra State Board of Technical Education (MSBTE) has released the schedule of timetable for students for the exam, including practical sessions. The practical exam for the technical course will be held between January 3 and 15, whereas the written exam has been announced for January 18 to February 9. The schedule was announced by the secretary of MSBTE, Mahendra Chitlange. He said that before the MCQ exam is conducted the board will conduct practical exams for both engineering and pharmacy courses. “The winter exam will have to be conducted online in MCQ format. Students will be able to attempt this exam from any place and location and the duration of the exam will be two hours and students will have to solve a minimum 35 out of 40 questions,” he added. The decision to conduct online examination was taken in a meeting conducted on December 3 by MSBTE with its affiliated institutes. Vishal Nagargoje, a diploma student, said, “We had written an application to the board to conduct an online examination as the teaching mode was also online. We were waiting for the board to announce the schedule and we are happy that the mode of exam is in our favour.” Another student of pharmacy, Sheetal Pawar, said, “We are expecting that the offline classes will begin after the winter examination so the next semester exam can be conducted in offline mode. We will be prepared for the same.” Chitlange said that the institutes have been told to conduct the oral examination of all the students by using various platforms for video conferencing and if the video is not possible the teachers should use telephonic mode and conduct the orals. The MSBTE has also stated that the exam will be conducted in a proctored manner where every student will be under watch and any exam malpractice would be punished under various charges as stated by the board on its website. Proctored exams are the result of online learning. Many systems can verify the identification of a candidate with AI-assisted facial recognition system. They can also alert when a candidate may be violating the rules outlined in a test. In a proctored exam, the student attempts the questions by logging in via a device. Most use laptops, smartphones and tablets. A monitoring system captures all their movements.  If a student cheats or is caught doing suspicious things, they are warned. Sometimes, the warnings are given thrice. Most colleges act against the erring student after sufficient warning and a student can be disqualified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/online-exams-for-pharmacy-engineering-diploma-pupils/articleshow/88173532.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

As of now, a total of 8.7 lakh EVs are registered across states and the combined number of EVs in UP and Delhi are about 44% of the total registered EVs in the country. According to the road transport and highways ministry, the total number of the registered EVs did not include the data from Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Lakshadweep since their numbers were not captured in the centralised Vahan-4 database. Delhi government was one of the first movers to extend subsidy to encourage people to go for EVs. While it had put a cap to provide this subsidy to first 1,000 electric cars, there was no such cap for other EVs such as e-rickshaws and two-wheelers. In a written reply to a Parliament question, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari said the heavy industries ministry had formulated Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) scheme in 2015 to promote adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles (xEVs) to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. Meanwhile, to push EV penetration, a parliamentary panel has urged the central government to have a live database of active charging stations installed all over the country so that EV users can easily locate the nearest charging station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-second-only-to-up-in-number-of-evs-registered/articleshow/88173552.cms||Dipak K Dash

From December 10, the distribution will be stalled,” said Mahaveer Sharma, state president, Rajasthan Gram Vikas Adhikari Sangh. The demands include removal of discrepancies in salary structure and ensure grade pay 3,600, restoration of 671 posts which were reduced, execution of inter-district transfer policy and provide one-time relaxation in transfers, filling of 1,500 vacant posts of village development officers, payment of pension amount to 250 retired employees which is due. “We submitted a memoranda in all the districts today (Wednesday). We also had a meeting with the officials of the CMO and panchayati raj department principal secretary and secretary today. They promised us that our demands will be fulfilled soon,” said Sharma. “Earlier, we had a meeting with the officials of the chief minister’s office (CMO) on October 1 and there was an agreement on all the eight demands. On November 10, we staged a protest as our demands were not fulfilled. We met the officials again and were assured that the demands will be fulfilled in a week’s time. But, nothing has been done in the past two months and the officials have misplaced one of the files,” he added. “The boycott of work will not take place in the districts where panchayat elections are due,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/village-developments-officers-to-boycott-prashashan-campaign-from-dec-10/articleshow/88173559.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, the victim was scared after being threatened by the kidnappers to remain quiet and didn’t approach the police even after his release. Victim Hasmukh Virani finally lodged a complaint with Rajkot taluka police station two weeks after the incident when his family and friends came to know about it, said cops. According the police, Virani had bought a house for Rs 31 lakh from one Samuben Madariya and the registration process of which got completed on October 26. The grandson-in-law of Samuben, Krupalsinh Gohil, was the middleman in this deal, Virani told cops. After the deal got over, Gohil approached Virani again one month later and convinced him to check out another property, luring him of getting a good deal on it. As appointed, they met near Balaji hall on November 23 afternoon and the duo went to see the property in Gohil’s car. Gohil showed Virani a property from outside on Morbi road before taking him to a flat on the 12th floor where a man called Jaydeep was already present. Gohil and Jaydeep started talking privately in another room, when Gohil insisted that he too should be part of the discussion. They trio again went back to Gohil’s car, but this time Jaydeep put a pistol-like weapon on Virani’s forehead and the duo forcibly held him captive him in a farmhouse. They took away Rs 12,000 from Virani’s pocket and forced him to transfer another Rs 15,000 through UPI. They demanded more money and Virani called his relative, Manubhai, asking him to lend Rs 7.5 lakh on the plea that he is in need of money after purchasing a house. Gohil sent his man to collect the money from Manubhai. Virani was again forced to call another friend and his brother for Rs 1.8 lakh in total. After receiving around Rs 9.5 lakh, the duo released Virani near Balaji hall after threatened him to remain silent about it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/trader-kidnapped-rs-9l-extorted-from-him/articleshow/88172206.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Health minister Tope rules out lockdown over Omicron||Pune/Mumbai: Public health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday ruled out any kind of lockdown in the state following the Omicron variant’s emergence and stressed on implementing the “3T” formula of testing, tracking and treatment, besides adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour. His statement came on a day when the state did not report any new cases of Omicron. The count of the new variant remains 10, so far of which one from Kalyan-Dombivli has been discharged. “We are not thinking about any lockdown in the state as of now. The state task force has given no such directions. We shall closely keep a tab on the situation and take a call on any curbs following the guidance of the Centre, state task force and the chief minister,” he said. With the Omicron variant detected in 54 countries, screening of incoming overseas passengers at Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur airports is ongoing. Till now, 7,930 from at-risk countries have been subjected to RT-PCR test. Nine have tested positive for Covid and their samples have been sent for sequencing. The state has also screened 38,660 from non-risk countries, of which 995 have been tested for RT-PCR. From this cohort, two were found positive for Covid. The state is also tracing people who have arrived in the state on or after November 1. It has sent 65 samples for genomic sequencing of which results of 52 are awaited. In Mumbai, samples of foreign returnees have been subjected to genome sequencing. Nine of their contacts are also under the scanner. Genome sequencing results are expected in a day or two. Tope said the state task force has observed that Omicron cases were sporadic and travel-related. “Till date, all the infected people have only mild symptoms. According to preliminary reports from the world and the country, the cases are mild. Its higher transmissibility has been noticed, but its severity has not yet been established,” he said. A state official added that a threshold for active cases has already been arrived at based on existing infrastructure. “The moment state’s oxygen requirement crosses 700MT, the authorities would consider a lockdown. However, our current requirement is 50MT,” the official said. Public health experts have emphasised the need for decisions based on scientific evidence. Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, a medical epidemiologist said India has “high seroprevalence in most parts and significant first dose coverage. When the susceptible population is low, we needn’t think of the worst outcomes. We have to have a dynamic response.” He added that states must emphasise on first and second dose coverage, rather than worry about a booster shot that has little evidence to show additional protection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-health-minister-tope-rules-out-lockdown-over-omicron/articleshow/88173584.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Until then, over 800 farmers were killed because of the government. But PM Modi apologised and closed the issue. Home minister Amit Shah also apologised and tried to cover up the Nagaland issue. The rulers are addicted to apologising,” said the Sena in an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamna. “Commit crimes, kill people and apologise when things go out of control. Then why shouldn’t others get the privilege of getting rid of things with such apologies? Investigative agencies like the ED, CBI and the NCB are finishing the lives of many by filing false cases. The Nagaland killings is not an issue that can be buried with a four line apology,” the Sena said taking a dig at Shah. ““It is often said that there is no excuse for wrongdoing, but this only seems to be true in the case of the common man,” said the Sena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbainagaland-killings-cant-be-buried-with-apology/articleshow/88174623.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

He further said that the government would provide free registration of the houses transferring all rights to the beneficiaries. The chief minister made this announcement with the officials during his review meeting on housing programme at his Tadepalli camp office on Wednesday. He wanted the officials to create awareness on the benefits of the OTS scheme for house loans among people. He further said that OTS scheme is totally voluntary and houses will be registered with clear title. Jagan said a few vested interests were spreading false information on OTS scheme. He said the previous government did not consider proposals to waive interest of housing loans. He said over 43,000 people have paid interest along with the principal amount during the previous government. Though houses were given to them over the years by the successive governments, they have only B form pattas, which deprive them of even availing loans for their domestic needs. He said the state government was giving complete legal rights of the property to the beneficiaries through OTS scheme and they have the right to mortgage or sell the property. He said the state government will also register the houses and give absolute rights to 43,000 people who paid the loan amount in previous government. He added that registration process will be continued in village secretariats in future. The officials informed the CM that the registration process is being done in village/ ward Secretariats. They further said that registration document, field sketch and loan clearance certificates are being issued to the beneficiaries of OTS scheme.

The data further stated that the state’s weekly positivity rate till Monday was lowest at 0.8% over the past three months—down from 1.02% for the week ended November 24. Although 13 districts have a higher weekly positivity rate (WPR) than the state’s average, public health experts said it was an encouraging sign that the overall WPR was below 2%. Among the districts with WPR higher than the state’s average, though, were Pune (1.64%), Palghar (1.27%) and Aurangabad (1.24%). “This is the first time after many months that all the districts have registered a WPR below 2%. Besides, 22 districts have a WPR below the state’s average,” a state health official said. The state government has directed all districts to double the number of tests following the emergence of the Omicron variant of the Sars Cov-2 virus. A public health expert told TOI that it was important to keep a strict watch on the situation even if the current Omicron cases were mild in nature. The official said the emphasis should be on ramping up vaccination and testing. A task force member said it was essential to follow all Covid-appropriate behaviour and ensure that there was enough testing, tracking, tracing and vaccination.  As many as 26 districts in the state have registered less than 100 cases in the week ended December 7. Among the revenue divisions, Konkan had maximum active cases. Konkan was followed by the Pune and Nashik divisions. Meanwhile, the Pune district on Wednesday managed to vaccinate 100% of its eligible population with the first dose, with the addition of 63,000 new beneficiaries. Pune district is only the second in the state to achieve 100% first dose vaccination. The feat was achieved nearly 11 months after vaccination started in January. The district’s target population is 83.4 lakh. CoWin data showed around 65% of the district’s target population has taken both jabs.

District Judge Ramesh Kumar said that being the husband, he cannot escape from his moral duty of providing maintenance to his wife. “The Domestic Violence Act, 2005 is aimed at strengthening the economic independence of a woman,” the court said in the order. It further said the magistrate court rightly observed that the aspect of financial deprivation of women is included in the category of economic abuse. “It is pertinent to mention that an aggrieved woman needs economic support in view of the domestic violence perpetrated upon her by a person, who is in domestic relation with her.” A magistrate court had earlier directed the man to pay an interim maintenance of Rs 6,500 per month to his wife. The man had challenged the order before the sessions court.

Relatives of Pradeep Arakkal from Ponnurkkara near Puthur in Thrissur district said his family members, including brother and father-in-law have already left for the military hospital at Solur where the mortal remains of the victims are kept. Arakkal was a flight engineer and was posted as junior warrant officer (JWO) at the Air Force Station, Solur, his cousin Sivaprasad said. “Pradeep had come home two weeks back to see his father who was undergoing treatment and had gone back only last Wednesday,’’ Sivaprasad said. Pradeep leaves behind his wife Sreelakshmi, son Dakshindev (7) and daughter Devaprayaga (2). Pradeep, son of Arakkal Radhakrishnan and Kumari, had joined the Air Force in 2002. Subsequently, he had worked as an air crew across the country. He has also participated in several missions, including the anti-Maoist operations in Chhattisgarh as well as the rescue operations during the flood in Kerala in 2018. In fact, he had volunteered to join the flood relief operations on his own, family sources said, and had made commendable contributions during those operations. The mission team’s dedication and efficiency in those operations had won praises from various authorities, including the President of India and Kerala government. Pradeep had joined the Air Force station at Solur only two and half years back. It was his competence, which must have persuaded the authorities to pick him up for the job of accompanying the CDS, General Bipin Rawat, the top official of the Indian military, said retired colonel H Padmanabhan. Pradeep has come up in life through hard work. Though he was not from a rich family, he achieved good academic records, which in turn helped him get selected to the Air Force. Pradeep was popular and used to mix with people freely while coming home on leave. Whenever there was a celebration in the families of relatives or in the neighbourhoods, he used to be seen helping to serve food in the feasts. Several people from the nearby areas were flocking to his house at Ponnoorkkara even by Wednesday night, Sivaprasad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chopper-crash-iaf-man-from-thrissur-among-victims/articleshow/88173622.cms||T Ramavarman

The temple body has also requested APSRTC to run 230 special buses from various parts of the state to facilitate the movement of devotees. A coordination committee comprising of police, revenue, municipal and health wing authorities will monitor the proceedings and ensure that Covid protocols are strictly implemented and no inconvenience is caused to devotees. “We are giving top priority to safety of devotees. Queue lines will be designed in such a way that there will be no congestion. We have urged devotees to get themselves vaccinated before coming to the temple. We noticed scarcity of ‘laddu prasadampadu’ during the Dussehra fest which resulted in congestion of devotees at prasadam counters. This time we will arrange around 15 laddu counters and stock 15 lakh laddus,” temple executive officer D Bramarambha said. Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh reported 181 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the cumulative caseload to 20,74,217. The toll increased to 14,457 as two more patients succumbed to the pandemic.

The court has asked the assistant solicitor general of India to take up the matter with the ministry of external affairs and do the needful with regard to the laws and protocols in this regard listing the matter for progress on December 15. Justice Dinesh Mehta gave these directions while hearing a petition by Asha Devi and her wards, who has been awaiting to receive the mortal remains of her husband Hitendra Garasia from Russia. She has been running from pillar to post to get her husband’s remains back but in vain. A social activist, Charmesh Sharma, who has taken up the matter to help the bereaved family, said Hitendra from village Godwa in Kherwara tehsil in Udaipur had gone to Russia on a year’s work visa in April 2021 but was reportedly found dead in a park in Moscow. Moscow police closed the case as an accidental death and information was received by the family through local police on August 28, 2021. Since then, the family has been running from pillar to post to get the mortal remains of Hitendra so that the last rites could be carried out. Sharma, who took up the matter on various appropriate platforms, said on pursuance of the matter, the Russian government informed that the mortal remains could not be sent back to India and added that the burial of the deceased would be carried out by the Russian authorities, if the family members failed to come to Russia for the same. However, in a separate communication, Russian government stated that whatever has to be done in the matter, has to be done by the Indian Embassy in Russia for paving the way for the transport of deceased to India. “So with no relief in the matter to the family, we decided to move the high court with a prayer to give necessary directions to the concerned leading to bringing back the remains of Hitendra and save him from getting buried in an alien country”, said Sharma. Petitioner’s counsel Suniel Purohit said considering the seriousness of the matter, the court asked the ASG to do the needful in the matter including sensitising all concerned so that the petitioners are able to carry out the last rites of the deceased Hitendra as per their customs in their soil. “ASG has assured to extend all possible assistance to the family by the government of India in compliance with the bilateral treaties and applicable laws”, said Purohit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-asks-centre-to-take-steps-to-bring-back-joodpur-mans-mortal-remains-from-russia/articleshow/88173625.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Now order lunch in steel boxes like in old days||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: When Shalin John, an ice cream shop owner at Thycaud came to know that some of her regular student customers were skipping lunch, she thought of recreating the nostalgic mix of rice, pickle, omelette, chutney and a vegetarian dish neatly packed in a steel lunch box. She named the package aptly ‘Ente Chottupathram’; a meal package which will be affordable to everyone. The idea was spurred by her school days when she would take lunch in scalding hot steel boxes. An engineer by profession, she has diversified her ice cream shop to sell meals packed in steel lunch boxes. The lunch box includes four dishes, including an omelette, pickle, chutney and a vegetable dish. The price per meal is Rs 35. The vegetables are directly sourced from the farmers of Nedumangad and Kattakada. The customers can take the lunch boxes to their workplaces and return it in the evening. She chose steel boxes to avoid the use of plastic. The steel boxes are also easy to clean and it can be sterilized by boiling. “While listening to the issues of the college students, I decided to start a venture which will be useful to all the people who cannot afford food at a high price. Not everyone can spend Rs 70-100 to buy lunch every day. I intended it for college students, but I have received orders from office employees and also from older people.I was able to sell 47 boxes even if it was my first day,” says Shalin. “I am extremely glad to share that I have got very good feedback from my customers. I aim at providing good healthy food,” she ädds. Her customers are reliving their school and college days when they would have lunch in steel boxes. “I was really impressed with the quality and quantity of the lunch box. Vegetarians have a different menu which includes an extra vegetable dish instead of omelette,” says Krishnaveni S, a customer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/now-order-lunch-in-steel-boxes-like-in-old-days/articleshow/88172991.cms||---

A video of the man making the allegations went viral on social media, where Aslam could be heard telling the cops, “Sir, I do not want to live as a jihadi.” After listening to his words, the police were stunned, while some people also made a video of the man. Though the police officers termed him as “mentally ill,” the man maintained that he wanted to adopt Hinduism. He also accused the people of his religion of assault, on which the police have started an investigation. “On Tuesday, a man profusely bleeding from his head, reached the Colonelganj police station with saffron scarf on his shoulder and claimed that as he wanted to convert from Islam to Hinduism, but people of his religion were angry over this and had beaten him,” police said. He told cops that his name is Aslam. When asked why he wanted to become a Hindu, he replied that he did not want to live as a ‘jihadi’. He also threatened that if he was stopped from converting, he will leave the locality and go somewhere else.

---||Delhi||Vendors Act: Delhi HC calls meet to fix ‘big disconnect’||NEW DELHI: Observing that there is a “big disconnect” among authorities on implementing Street Vendors Act, Delhi High Court on Wednesday said it would meet all the stakeholders to find a solution. “We have been hearing these matters for some time. It appears to us that to sort out issues in relation to implementation of the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood & Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014, in the manner in which the Act envisages the process of implementation, it would be appropriate to call a meeting with the chairpersons of all the three municipal corporations, New Delhi Municipal Council, Delhi Cantonment Board and the concerned director of DDA,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh directed. The bench fixed December 11 for the meeting with officers and their lawyers along with representatives for the street vendors. “We are mindful that this is a second Saturday. Yet looking at the urgency of the matter, we are proceeding to fix the said meeting and we are hopeful that all the concerned parties would remain present. The meeting shall be held in the larger conference room, second floor, extension block of the Delhi high court,” it added. The court observed that instead of implementing the Act by preparing a plan, surveying and demarcating the vending area as well as regulating the same, the authorities were not taking steps. “On one hand we are asking you to prepare a plan, you are not taking steps... What is your objective? You have an Act. What are you trying to do? Why do you want to create chaos?” the court questioned as it reviewed the issuance of the certificate of vending to hawkers. “Where is the application of mind? Take Connaught Place as a test case and do it, apply the plan there. At present, it is impossible to walk in Chandni Chowk, where you claim credit for redoing it but look what it has been reduced to?” the court added. It cautioned that if hawking and vending are not regulated in Chandni Chowk, it “will again go back to what it was” before its redevelopment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vendors-act-hc-calls-meet-to-fix-big-disconnect/articleshow/88173630.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Pune||Pune: B.Plan seats given on hotel management CET marks; cell halts admissions||PUNE: The state CET cell on Tuesday put off the admission process for the Bachelor of Planning (B.Planning) course offered by College of Engineering, Pune (CoEP), for the 2021-22 academic year after a host of complaints related to the entrance exam. The college’s website said the notification for admission to the first year of the course will be updated soon. Seats for the B.Planning course were offered on the basis of marks scored in the common entrance test for hotel management this year. Parents, students and educators said neither course has a common thread. The exam was conducted in August and a merit list was put out thereafter. Ravindra Jagtap, commissioner of MHT-CET cell, told TOI on Wednesday, “We have not received any directions as yet from the Directorate of Technical Education about the ongoing process of B.Planning admission after we received a letter from Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe. Once we get the orders, we will start implementing them.” Vinay Sahasrabuddhe told TOI, “Many students and parents expressed serious concerns about this unacceptable practice and I expressed my objection to all the competent authorities, both at the Centre and in the state. We have noticed that a lot of seats go vacant in the CoEP’s B.Planning course due to such ignorant practices. We have demanded that at least spot admissions be offered on the basis of JEE-Planning or MHT-CET to fill the vacant seats. Such an intervention will benefit CoEP and the town planning course aspirants,” the MP added. Anil Sahasrabuddhe said, “We have just come across this issue and are looking into it. The state authorities are in charge of these examinations. We are now working on issuing some guidelines.” Wagh said the CET commissioner was the competent authority for any such decision. A student who has opted for the B.Planning course said, “I was not aware of the admission being made through hotel management CET as there was no proper public awareness exercise.” “Spot admissions can be opened to JEE-Planning & MHT-CET engineering students. Preference may be given to students with non-zero score in JEE-Planning for this year,” she said. CoEP offers the B.Planning course with 60 seats and conducting the admission based on the CET score obtained in the hotel management exam has befuddled the aspirants. The practice that has been in place for the last two years was recently questioned by Sahasrabuddhe, who recently wrote to Jagtap, state director of technical education Abhay Wagh and chairman of the All India Committee for Technical Education Anil Sahasrabuddhe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/b-plan-seats-given-on-hotel-mgmt-cet-marks-cell-halts-admissions/articleshow/88173645.cms||Rucha Limaye
---||Mumbai||Despite new variant, Covid testing in many Maharashtra districts still way below WHO rules||MUMBAI: Even in the face of the threat from a new variant, testing remains a problem in several districts. The state’s public health department pointed out on Wednesday that several districts are carrying out less than 100 tests per million population. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends a minimum of 140 tests per day per million population.  Testing overall has remained less than desired in the state, experts have pointed out. For most of November, daily testing in Maharashtra remained in the range of 1 lakh to 1.2 lakh tests. Of that, Mumbai has been carrying out almost 35% to 40% of the tests. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force, said the state needs to double its daily testing average. “We have to test double the numbers we are doing at present. A lot of people have upper respiratory tract infections and Covid-19 needs to be ruled out in them,” he said. In the absence of an adequate number of tests, districts may also struggle to find enough samples to send for genome sequencing, he said. Districts are supposed to send 100 samples every month for sequencing.  State numbers show testing numbers drop significantly, sometimes below a lakh, even during weekends. On November 22, testing had dropped to as low as 66,811. On November 29, it was 61,532. Even on December 6 and December 7, testing was as low as 75,283 and 97,814, respectively.  Recently, districts such as Amravati, Buldhana and Yavatmal have been pulled up for testing less than 100 people per million population. Amravati has been carrying out 82 tests/ million, Buldhana (99) and Yavatmal (114). A district official said since there are fewer positive cases, there are limited contacts to trace and test.  Some public health experts say the onus of getting tested is also on people. Medical epidemiologist Dr Chandrakant Lahariya said testing is akin to vaccination. “The job of the government is to create infrastructure for testing. Once that is done, people must come and get tested if they have developed symptoms,” he said. A state official said a higher positivity rate is a mark of inadequate testing. “The state’s positivity rate has been under 1% consistently,” the official said, meaning it’s proportionate to the level of transmission.  In Mumbai, civic authorities said they are still trying to keep daily testing numbers to above 40,000. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said 70% of the tests are RT-PCR and the rest antigen. On Wednesday, the city had carried out over 46,000 tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-despite-new-variant-testing-in-many-districts-still-way-below-who-rules/articleshow/88173643.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force, said the state needs to double its daily testing average. “We have to test double the numbers we are doing at present. A lot of people have upper respiratory tract infections and Covid-19 needs to be ruled out in them,” he said. In the absence of an adequate number of tests, districts may also struggle to find enough samples to send for genome sequencing, he said. Districts are supposed to send 100 samples every month for sequencing.  State numbers show testing numbers drop significantly, sometimes below a lakh, even during weekends. On November 22, testing had dropped to as low as 66,811. On November 29, it was 61,532. Even on December 6 and December 7, testing was as low as 75,283 and 97,814, respectively.  Recently, districts such as Amravati, Buldhana and Yavatmal have been pulled up for testing less than 100 people per million population. Amravati has been carrying out 82 tests/ million, Buldhana (99) and Yavatmal (114). A district official said since there are fewer positive cases, there are limited contacts to trace and test.  Some public health experts say the onus of getting tested is also on people. Medical epidemiologist Dr Chandrakant Lahariya said testing is akin to vaccination. “The job of the government is to create infrastructure for testing. Once that is done, people must come and get tested if they have developed symptoms,” he said. A state official said a higher positivity rate is a mark of inadequate testing. “The state’s positivity rate has been under 1% consistently,” the official said, meaning it’s proportionate to the level of transmission.  In Mumbai, civic authorities said they are still trying to keep daily testing numbers to above 40,000. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said 70% of the tests are RT-PCR and the rest antigen. On Wednesday, the city had carried out over 46,000 tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-despite-new-variant-testing-in-many-districts-still-way-below-who-rules/articleshow/88176550.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Going by the CCTV footage installed at Atal Ghat, it has been confirmed that Dr Sushil did reach the Atal Ghat after the murders. CCTV footage shows him entering the Atal Ghat at 3.10pm. He went straight down the stairs and returned after some time. After this, at 4.27pm, he was seen walking in the lawn built at Atal Ghat. He was last seen at 5.16pm in the CCTV cameras of Atal Ghat, in which he was again seen going down the stairs and then he turned to the right. "Dr Sushil has been seen in the CCTV footage installed at Atal Ghat. Although he is seen going down the stairs and coming up, whether he committed suicide or not is still not clear," said DCP West BBGTS Murti. At the same time, Pradeep Kumar, brother of the accused doctor's wife Chandraprabha, said that in the murder there was nothing like a psychiatric disorder. "The accused did extreme things in a well-planned manner," he said. Pradeep said that now he is praying for his brother-in-law to be alive so that when they come face to face he could ask him the reason behind the killings. On Tuesday, a team of police had questioned the doctors of the psychiatry department at Rama Medical College about Dr Sushil. However, they could not tell anything to prove that he was suffering from a psychiatric disorder. Additional DCP Brijesh Kumar Srivastava said that no evidence was found showing that Dr Sushil was a psychopath. "None of the doctors at the medical college provided him any psychiatric medicine. However, the investigation in this regard is still on," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/triple-murder-cctv-footage-shows-accused-doc-at-atal-ghat/articleshow/88173646.cms||---

While salaries for November were paid on Tuesday evening, staffers who participated in the ongoing over a month-long strike have not received their monthly dues. MSRTC spokesperson said the revised salary structure reflects rise in Dearness Allowance from earlier 12% to 28% along with upward revision of House Rent Allowance (HRA) in the scale of 8-16-24% as per work experience. “The consolidated salary of staffers has now increased substantially. While a section of MSRTC employees has already resumed work, we appeal to all staffers to return to the work,” the spokesperson said. The MSRTC has reiterated that employees returning to work will receive police protection if they feel unsafe at the workplace. Meanwhile, different workers’ unions said majority of staffers have not received their November salaries for not reporting to duties during the ongoing strike. “Only around 20,000 employees, mostly placed at officer-level, have received their salaries. Several workers are still in no mood to return to work till their demand of merger of MSRTC into the state government,” a union leader said, requesting anonymity. He, however, added that there was gradual rise over a period of past few days in employees returning to the work. As per official data, a total of 135 depots were operating across Maharashtra on Wednesday, whereas 115 were still closed till Wednesday evening. Also, a total of 20,130 employees have returned to work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/msrtc-employees-to-get-pay-hikes-of-up-to-rs-10600/articleshow/88171512.cms||---

The court was recently taking stock of progress in streamlining the running of the temple. It issued directions earlier on removal of encroachments and unauthorised constructions, the process of collection of donations and offerings and on redevelopment of the mandir, and the provision of civic amenities for the devotees. “This court is of the opinion that insofar as the shopkeepers who have made their residences and are in unauthorised occupation of shops are concerned, all the residents of the shops and within the mandir premises, including the Dharamshala, have to be vacated,” justice Prathiba Singh noted, fixing December 10 as the day for the court-appointed administrator to start work. “The spiritual sanctity of the mandir is completely eroded by all the stakeholders, unauthorised occupants, encroachments by shopkeepers, lack of cleanliness and hygiene, lack of basic amenities to devotees,” the court further noted, explaining why it had to appoint an administrator to look after the administration of Kalkaji Mandir. The court had earlier directed that all unauthorised occupants/encroachers, who do not enjoy valid tehbazari licences, be removed, until and unless there is a court order protecting the occupant. The bench had said it is essential for a temple, where thousands of devotees visit for conducting puja every day, irrespective of its public or private status, to be devoid of unauthorised encroachments, which results in extreme inconvenience and safety and security concerns for the devotees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/remove-all-illegal-encroachments-from-kalkaji-temple-orders-hc/articleshow/88173647.cms||Abhinav Garg

They said that the other education boards had started conducting offline examinations in the semester pattern, but the state board had neither issued the timetable usually announced in November, nor has it declared the mode of exam. Sai Bramhe, a std X student, said, “There is a lot that goes into preparation for the board exam, and we have to keep the paper pattern in mind when we get ready to appear. However, the timetable could be announced anytime now and the exam will be in the next 45 days if it is on schedule. But there is a lack of clear communication and it is hampering our preparation.” Azmed Shaikh, an HSC student, said, “Our prelims are set to start next week and we are giving the traditional pen and paper exam but what if the board decides on the online MCQ format? We will have to retune ourselves and start preparing all over again. The board must give us some clarity at the earliest.” Other students said that the schools had scheduled the prelims and some had two prelims as practice for the main board exams. The state board could at least announce the timetable of the final examination so that there is a clear picture. Sukrut Khude A, another HSC student, said that the entire year has gone by in online learning. “Since October, permission for conducting offline classes was given, but that is not enough for such a critical year, and hence we have requested the state education department to conduct the exams online. We have written to the education minister and we hope that our demand is accepted,” he added. Dinkar Patil, chairman of the state board, refused any comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-students-anxious-as-dates-mode-of-ssc-hsc-exams-remain-unclear/articleshow/88173651.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Jodhpur||Rajasthan high court summons MD of insurance firm for denying interest to farmers||JODHPUR: Rajasthan high court has summoned the managing director of the Agriculture Insurance Company of India in a case pertaining to the failure of the firm in paying interest to farmers despite the government already having deposited the subsidy towards the premiums. Division bench of justice Sandeep Mahta and justice Sameer Jain directed the MD to remain present in the court on next hearing on December 15 after the affidavit was submitted by the AAG in the court furnishing the details of deposition of the amount by the government to the company. Petitioner Bhallaram Patel had moved the high court with a petition stating that subsidy was not given to 1,151 farmers from Satlana, Karniyali, Kheda Satlana, Madhopura and Goliya villages in Jodhpur despite deposition of premium by them under crop insurance to the Agriculture Insurance Company of India. The petition stated that an amount of Rs 1.80 crore as subsidy for the year 2016 had been paid by the company after the intervention of the court. But the subsidy for the years 2017 and 2018 was still due. Petitioner’s counsel argued that there was a provision of paying interest at the rate of 12% on the delayed amount of subsidy and the company has been dilly dallying on payment of interest, which amounted to around Rs 75 lakh. “The company, however, stated that since the subsidy amount had not been paid by the government, it was unable to pass on the same to the farmers”, said the counsel. But in an affidavit submitted by the AAG in the court, it was made clear that the government had already paid the subsidy to the insurance company, which belied the claim of the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/hc-summons-agri-insurance-firm-md-for-not-giving-interest-to-farmers/articleshow/88173648.cms||---

Speaking in the Rajya Sabha during zero hour, Vijayasai welcomed the Centre’s decision to repeal the three contentious laws on agriculture. However, he wanted the Centre to protect the MSP to the farmers. He asked the government to bring a new legislation to give constitutional guarantee to the farmers in providing MSP. He said the AP government under the leadership of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has rolled out several initiatives to help the farmers. He said while the Central government has announced MSP for 23 agriculture produces, the state government has extended the same for another 24 commodities. He said in all, 47 crops are covered under MSP in Andhra Pradesh, adding that AP is the first state to provide MSP cover to all major crops. Vijayasai asserted that there is a need to guarantee MSP for all crops on a national level. He favoured wider consultations with the farmers, farm leaders and organisations to get the clear picture of the ground level challenges related to the MSP. He also wanted the Centre to bring in new legislation to guarantee MSP to all major crops at the national level. He also emphasised the need to create a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to study the issues concerning the farmers and the farm sector on one hand and the marketing and price mechanism of agriculture produce on the other.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vijayasai-bats-for-msp-guarantee-through-law/articleshow/88173024.cms||Gopi Dara

Police claimed to be rummaging through the CCTV footages of nearby areas to get information about the accused and the vehicle used to commit the crime, but nothing concrete has come to fore so far. Superintendent of police Yogesh Yadav told TOI that senior officials are monitoring the investigation as police personnel from the station and district special team are following the premature leads. We are also gathering a list of the miscreants of the region who were involved in such loots in the past, he added. Police said, from the crime spot, it appeared that the miscreants had full knowledge of the area as well the whereabouts at the office. They had managed to commit the crime less than in three minutes and disappeared, the police said. The CCTV camera installed inside the office had recorded the miscreants entering, beating the employees present and leaving after taking the cash collected in two days. Yadav said that police have gathered important leads in the matter and are minutely working on cracking the case at the earliest. We are taking assistance from all available resources, besides rummaging the physical and technical proof collected from the crime spot, he said. On December 5, before calling it a day, the staff was busy arranging the deliveries due for the coming day and counting the cash they collected which was left in the office due to bank holidays. Around 8 PM, 6 masked robbers entered the office and started beating the staff. One of the accused collected the cash from the drawer and signalled others to leave. Meanwhile the others kept beating and threatening the employees and fled away within three minutes. Despite strict orders from the SP, the local police were not present anywhere on evening patrolling and the SHO was also absent from the police station. The police personals had failed to pay heed to repeated directions of senior police officers to patrol in the area in the busy hours or at least be present in the station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/three-days-on-police-still-clueless-about-7-95-lakh-loot/articleshow/88173658.cms||---

Parking at the Hanuman Mandir has been free for all and devotees flock and pray there without any hassle. However, BJP’s blind greed to fill its pockets with as much money as possible, by hook or by crook, has led them to levy parking charges at this prestigious temple,” Atishi alleged. This is the first time since the formation of the corporations that parking charges have been imposed at Hanuman Mandir. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta has asked the north corporation to immediately roll back the decision. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-slams-bjp-for-plan-to-charge-parking-fee-at-hanuman-temple/articleshow/88173663.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

State BJP leadership has also put its focus on as many as 78 assembly seats across the state including two of Prayagraj district - Handia and Karchana - which they had lost in the 2017 state assembly election, and are organising public rallies to win the trust of the masses. Following this, BJP state chief Swatantra Dev Singh had recently addressed a public rally in a village of the Karchana assembly seat to connect with voters. Moreover, BJP leaders have engaged the party's sector conveners and sector in-charges along with booth presidents and their teams to connect with voters in all 403 assembly seats and take Prime Minister Narendra Modi led Union and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath led state government's achievements to every house-hold.

In addition, to reduce the moisture level in the temple, the meghdambari and the door of inner sanctum sanctorum will be made oil paint free and will be made with silver. The marble flooring in the Mahalaxmi temple is against the rules applicable on heritage monuments. Secretary of PMDS Shivraj Naikawde and head of heritage committee in Kolhapur Amarja Nimbalkar, showed the original flooring — which is still in good condition — to Rahul Rekhawar, the district collector and current administrator of the temple. Only after getting an approval from the collector and the archaeology department, the tender was put out on Tuesday. Naikawde said, “All the places where marble flooring had been done in the temple will be targetted. The original flooring below the marble is in good condition and the work will have to be done carefully with the use of hammer and chisel only. The last day to fill the tender is December 14. The contract will be given to an experienced contractor. Focus will be on completing the work before the next Kirnotsav in January end.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mahalaxmi-temples-marble-flooring-to-be-removed-to-reveal-original-base-bids-called/articleshow/88171535.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

At Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, two brothers had come all the way from Moradabad to get their father, 76-year-old Abul Kalam, treated for a cyst in the liver. They claimed they had gone first to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital but claimed he was refused admission, after which they brought him to GTB. As Kalam lay on a stretcher, the medical staff gave him an injection and asked him to go to another centre. “My father has a cyst in his liver and a urine pipe attached to him. We brought him in an ambulance but did not know there was a strike,” said Anisul Alam, Kalam’s son. The family said they do not have enough finances to go to a private hospital and will most likely take Kalam to a government hospital in Bareilly. Another patient who had come from Ghaziabad kept waiting for medical attention. Amit Kumar, whose elder sister Sapna was having breathing issues, sat outside the emergency ward in the hope of getting her admitted. “We live in Rajnagar Extension and have been at the hospital for nearly two hours now. My sister has asthma and breathlessness. She is spitting blood while coughing. Her blood pressure is also fluctuating. If there is a strike, they should at least look at the patients and treat them,” said Kumar. Similar scenes were witnessed outside RML and Sucheta Kriplani Hospital as well, where many patients could be seen sitting outside the emergency wards with no one to attend to them. At Sucheta Kriplani Hospital, Sri Krishan, who took a bus from Etah, said he reached Delhi late Tuesday night, along with his wife and their daughter Bhumika (20), who suffers from a stomach problem. “We spent Rs 1,500 on the trip and cannot keep coming again. We got our blankets in our sacks and spent the night at the hospital and in the morning, they told us they will not admit my daughter. We are hoping they will see her on Thursday,” said Krishan. Several families were seen squatting outside the RML emergency area too. One of the youths, Vishal, was pulling his uncle Umesh (62) on a stretcher. “My uncle has a clot in his brain, which leads to paralysis. He was admitted to a hospital in Dwarka, where the bill was Rs 32,000 for just one day. They referred us to RML but when we arrived, we were told there is a strike and they would not take any admissions. I don’t know why they referred us to this facility in the first place,” said Vishal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/day-3-patients-fend-for-themselves/articleshow/88173800.cms||---

Not only the PDA would have a separate office on the new premise, but the city's first five-star hotel will also come up there. Being constructed at a cost of Rs 250-crore, the sprawling campus of 14,500 square meters would have two buildings. The PDA has begun the process of selecting an agency for the construction of the office building, the hotel on a 'build, own, operate and transfer (BOOT) basis'. "We have invited an 'expression of interest' (EOI) from reputed agencies for the ambitious project, which would be constructed on a piece of land located at Lala Lajpat Rai Road adjacent to Stanley Road. Following this, not only the PDA would have its own office, but the city would also have its first five-star hotel," said PDA vice-chairman Arvind Kumar Chauhan. "The construction of the office building and the hotel would be operated on the basis of BOOT. The layout will be prepared by Smart Buildings and Green Architecture at an estimated cost of Rs 250-crore," mentions the EOI issued by the PDA. The site is strategically located on the 80m-wide Lala Lajpat Rai Marg connecting Stanley Road. There is a school within 2kms, railway station within 5kms, airport 15kms and a hospital and petrol pump within 1km. The detailed design, detailed project report, etc., are readily available with the PDA, which has engaged international architects, transaction advisory and project management consultants for the project. The project is of critical importance to the state and developing Prayagraj as a centre of heritage tourism and logistics hub. The addition of a 5-star hotel complex, the first of its kind in the city based on international design, will be the landmark of this heritage city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/new-pda-bldg-citys-first-5-star-hotel-to-come-up-at-mumfordganj/articleshow/88173686.cms||Rajeev Mani

Searches conducted on M/s Krishna Sai Constructions Private Limited and M/s Dew Drops Granite Private Limited revealed that fake GST credit worth more than Rs 18 crore was transacted by creating fictitious invoices without actual supply of goods or services. Three persons including the Madan Mohan Reddy were arrested and produced before the economic offences court in the city on Wednesday. The magistrate ordered judicial custody for 14 days and sent them to remand. Later, they were taken to central prison. Further investigations into the case are on and the officials are focussing on several AP and Telangana-based fake firms involved in the network. “The quantum of fraudulent tax amount is likely to go up,” additional commissioner, GST, Ravi Kiran Edara said. Officers say paper companies are floated without any real businesses or supplies and fake GST invoices created. Fraudulent tax credit is passed on and being utilised by other entities leading to huge revenue loss to the government. They added that the department is using data analysis to detect fake networks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/3-arrested-as-fake-invoice-racket-busted/articleshow/88173065.cms||Siva G
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: Maratha activists want empirical data on community for OBC quota||KOLHAPUR: The Maratha activists from Kolhapur are demanding that the state government collect empirical data on Marathas, alongside the Other Backward Category (OBC), to ultimately put the Marathas under the quota. Recently, the Supreme Court stayed the ordinance issued by the state government to grant the OBC reservation for local body elections. The SC has stated that the decision was taken without setting up the backward classes commission and collecting empirical data on the OBCs. The Maratha activists claim that it is time to hit the refresh button by reviewing the OBC reservation, and inclusion of Marathas into the OBC to ensure Marathas get legally valid reservation. Earlier, Marathas were given separate reservation by forming different category. The SC has quashed that reservation stating that it causes the reservation limit to cross 50% as ruled in Indira Swahney case. Pravin Indulkar, advocate as well as Maratha activist, said, “We have written to the state government to review the OBC reservation policy. When OBC reservation came into effect in 1992 after successfully testing legal grounds, more castes were added to it through government resolution and not through the three stages mandated by the SC- formation of commission, collecting empirical data and recommending reservation quota ensuring total reservation does not extend 50% limit.” Indulkar added that many castes are demanding legally valid reservation which can be done by including them into OBCs only as of now. “Therefore, we have asked government to carry out the empirical study of the Marathas and include them in the OBCs.” The demand by Maratha activists is likely to cause ripples of discontent among OBCs as they do not want Marathas to be included in OBC list, which has already over 340 castes. The OBC leaders have time and again claimed that the Marathas will form single largest entity in the OBCs if they are included and students and job-seekers from other castes will be marginalised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/maratha-activists-want-empirical-data-on-community-for-obc-quota/articleshow/88171558.cms||---

Cops arrested Haresh Dervadiya (19) and Mahesh Orakhiya (22) for killing Umesh Garambhadiya with sharp-edged weapon on Tuesday morning. According to the police, the attack on Garambhadiya was a result of him harassing Haresh’s cousin sister. When the father of the victim, Haka, went in the morning to wake him up, he found Umesh stabbed in the neck and chest in his sleep. The family was sleeping in their farmhouse in Gangajaliya village of Sayla taluka where they were all engaged in contract-based farming. During investigation, cops found out that the accused duo had been searching for Umesh on Monday night as despite being warned to stay away from his sister, Umesh continued harassing her. Angered by this, Haresh decided to teach Umesh a lesson and attacked him after knowing that he was sleeping in the farmhouse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-murdered-for-harassing-girl/articleshow/88172295.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 3 years after her arrest, Sudha Bharadwaj to walk out of Byculla jail today||MUMBAI: Arrested over three years ago in the Elgar Parishad case, lawyer-activist Sudha Bharadwaj (59) is likely to walk out from Byculla jail on Thursday morning. Bharadwaj was produced before the special NIA court on Wednesday, a day after the Supreme Court upheld the Bombay high court’s order granting default bail to her last week. Imposing about 16 conditions, the special NIA judge said that she must furnish cash security of Rs 50,000. “She shall reside within the jurisdiction of this court. She shall not leave the jurisdiction of this court at Mumbai on being released on bail, without permission of this court,” special judge DE Kothalikar said. The court also said that Bharadwaj has to attend trial regularly and it should not be delayed due to her. Dressed in a green kurta, her face covered with a blue cloth mask, Bharadwaj was brought before the court at around 11.35 am. She smiled as she met her lawyer in court. Her daughter too was present. As the procedures at the sessions court were completed only before 6 pm, the jail could not process her release before its deadline. Last week, the HC had directed she be produced before the special NIA court so that it can set her bail amount and conditions. The special NIA court also said that Sudha Bharadwaj is to submit a list of at least three blood relatives with their detailed residential and work addresses and documentary proof of showing the correctness of the details produced by her. At this point, Bharadwaj told the court,“I only have a daughter.” The court also said that she is not to make any statement regarding the proceedings pending before the court, in any form of media. Bharadwaj’s advocate Yug Chaudhary, however, opposed this and said that her fundamental rights should not be stifled. “She should be allowed to write articles,” he submitted. Earlier, he also sought for a low bail amount to be set. Chaudhary also told the court that she’s a practising lawyer in Chhattisgarh and has to work for a living. He urged the court to allow her to travel between Maharashtra and other states, including Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Delhi. “She has to make a living…pay her lawyers,” the lawyer said. To facilitate her release on Wednesday, the lawyer also requested for cash bail. Special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty urged the court to fix the bail amount of Rs one lakh. He also said that there are chances of Bharadwaj tampering with evidence and that she should mark her presence at the NIA office at least once a month. The court, however, said she should report to the nearest police station through WhatsApp video call fortnightly. The court added, “There shall not be any gathering of visitors, other than near relatives, where the accused shall reside, within the jurisdiction of this court.” The court said that Bharadwaj should not indulge in any similar activities of which she is accused. “She shall not try to establish communication with co-accused or any other person involved directly or indirectly in similar activities or make any international call to a person indulging in similar activities as alleged against her, through any mode of communication,” the court said. “The accused shall not misuse the liberty,” the court said. Among the 15 accused, Bharadwaj is the second to get bail. Poet and activist Varavara Rao is out on interim bail on health grounds. The 16th accused, Fr Stan Swamy (84), who was lodged at Taloja jail, died in July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-yrs-after-her-arrest-bharadwaj-to-walk-out-of-byculla-jail-today/articleshow/88173705.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Around 17,500 defaulters availed the scheme getting a rebate of Rs 56.33 lakh in penalty amount during the period. The NMC recovers 2% fine per month on tax dues from the last day of paying taxes. Moreover, it also recovers expenses towards issuing notices and warrants to the tax defaulters. As per the amnesty scheme, 70% rebate was given on the penalty amount to the defaulters who cleared their dues during this period. The NMC has set a target of collecting Rs 160 crore towards property tax for the current financial year, but it could collect only Rs 100 crore so far and it has to collect Rs 40 crore more during next three months. The amnesty scheme is being implemented for the property tax defaulters in three phases. In the first phase between August 16 and October 15, the rebate on the penalty amount was 90%. During this period, the NMC collected property tax amounting to Rs 23.84 crore from 47,000 defaulters and rebate of Rs 3.98 crore was given. In the second phase between October 16 and November 30, the response was poor as compared to the previous one. A 50% rebate on penalty will be given if the defaulter clear their dues between December 1 and 31, 2021. There are 4.50 lakh properties across six divisions of the municipal corporation. NMC officials said their objective is to increase the property tax collection by implementing amnesty scheme for the tax defaulters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/poor-response-to-nmcs-amnesty-scheme-for-property-tax-defaulters/articleshow/88171573.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad Municipal Corporation to waive off Rs 257 crore penalty||AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has decided to waive off Rs 257.25 crore under the amnesty scheme towards recovery of the property tax. Coinciding with its anniversary, the AMC on Wednesday announced 75% waiver on delayed payment charges for one-time settlement of the property tax by the defaulters. The amnesty scheme, which is applicable to dues towards property tax till end of March this year, is valid till the end of February 2022. Aparna Thete, in-charge of the AMC’s tax collection department, said defaulters owe Rs 343 crore towards delayed payment charges of property tax, out of which around Rs 257 crore would be waived off under the amnesty scheme. “The already slow tax recovery process lost momentum due to the pandemic situation. It was a collective decision to introduce the amnesty scheme and encourage citizens to pay their dues,” she said. The local civic body is targeting a recovery of Rs 468 crore towards property tax by the end of the current fiscal. It had recovered over Rs 107 crore by the end of November. Thete said all property holders have already received their property tax bills. “Unlike in past, we have ensured almost every citizen gets the bill. Citizens now have a fair idea about the dues and should pay the tax at the earliest,” she said. Notably, the AMC earlier in 2018 and 2019 had announced the amnesty scheme for property tax defaulters which helped the civic body in improving the recovery to certain extent. The civic administration, which has already started sealing properties of major defaulters, has warned of stern action if dues are not paid before the end of the amnesty scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/amc-to-waive-off-rs-257cr-penalty/articleshow/88171568.cms||---

Apart from this girl, three other students had also alleged sexual assault by the accused and the local child welfare committee have also started the process of counselling the children. Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR) chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal has written a letter to the superintendent of police, Bhiwadi and directed to send a complete report of the case after conducting a quick investigation in the matter. Along with this, the Child Welfare Committee has also been directed to investigate the matter on the spot and take action and provide security and cooperation to the family of the victim. Beniwal said that the incidents of rape and molestation have a deep impact on the mental sphere of the victim. The personality and dignity of the victim are also hurt by such an incident. The commission’s chairperson added that teachers or any other person who has done abominable acts in the temple of education will not be spared. The child panel will recommend the harshest punishment to those who sabotage the education and safety of the girl child. Beniwal is continuously monitoring the matter. Last month, an 8-year-old girl studying in Class V of a government school was raped allegedly by her 50-year-old para teacher at Sikar. The matter came to light on when the girl was unwilling to go to school after a three-day leave and informed her parents about the incident. The father of the girl lodged a case of rape against the teacher at Sadar police station of Sikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/child-panel-takes-note-of-student-gangrape-case/articleshow/88173718.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: State cabinet gives nod to reforms aimed at boosting APMCs||Mumbai: The Maharashtra cabinet has approved the reforms of the agricultural produce marketing legislation in order to strengthen its Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC). The APMCs have now been allowed to recover user charges from those selling fruits, vegetables and spices that have been removed from the purview of APMCs in 2016. Until now, APMCs could not charge traders and farmers fees for selling the deregulated produce. However, a majority of them continued to sell their fruits and vegetables in APMCs despite the deregulation, thereby using its infrastructure. The state cabinet has now decided to allow the APMCs to recover user charges from such traders and farmers. The state cabinet also amended the voting rights for the head of the APMC board. Earlier, besides primary agricultural societies, multi-purpose societies were also allowed to vote. However, officials found that many of the multipurpose societies were not involved in agriculture. After the reform, only those involved in agricultural activities, like crop loan distribution, will be permitted to vote. The reforms have also limited the number of administrators appointed to the APMC board to seven. Besides, the service fee has been raised from 5 paise per Rs 100 transaction to 10 paise per Rs 100 transaction. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-cabinet-gives-nod-to-reforms-aimed-at-boosting-apmcs/articleshow/88174692.cms||---

Last month, the state government granted another 6-month extension to MSRDC managing director R Moppalwar who has been overseeing execution of the project. Shinde was speaking at the Lokmat Infra Conclave held in the city on Wednesday. “The government is creating a network of roadways in the state to improve connectivity and increase business activity. As environment is a very crucial issue these days, we’ve taken care to create a green zone along this route, including underpass for wildlife,” he said, adding that the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link would be commissioned by September-October 2023 while the coastal road would be thrown open by December 2023. He said the plan is to connect all state districts for which 5,500km of roadways has been proposed. Once the expressway is commissioned, we will start work on extending it to Gondia, Bhandara, right up to Gadchiroli,” he said. “Like Mumbai-Pune expressway linked regions to Mumbai and helped growth, this too will allow the distance to be covered in 6-7 hours and give growth an impetus in Vidarbha, Marathwada,” he said. Moppalwar said MSRDC has also planned to improve connectivity within the state and also interstate connectivity. The Solapur-Chennai expressway via Nandurbar and Mumbai-Pune-Nanded-Hyderabad expressway were two such proposals of interstate connectivity, he said. Mumbai’s municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal said that the BMC would spend Rs 12,700 crore on the coastal road from its own resources without availing of any loan either from the central government or the state government. So far, the city’s civic body has already spent over Rs 6,000 crore on the project and work was carried out uninterrupted all through the pandemic. Industries minister Subhash Desai said Mumbai-Pune expressway was the single most reason for industrial development of Pune and nearby areas. He said the industry’s goal of Rs 2 lakh crore investment, through its Magnetic Maharashtra programme, will be achieved by month-end, and by next year the state will receive another Rs 5 lakh crore investments of which Rs 3 lakh crore is expected in one sector alone. State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said that the state government is keen on having only electric vehicles for all public transport across Maharashtra.

The meeting will be attended by officials in the rank of SP and above. In the recent past, the police have been coming under severe criticism, including from the high court, for various lapses and misbehaviour with the public. The agenda for the meeting includes a review of state intelligence status, effective disposal of the pending petitions, effective and timely investigation in Pocso cases and effective investigation in cases relating to atrocities against women and SC/ST categories. The meeting will also formulate strategies to deal with family disputes and effective police response. The police inaction in the case of Anupama Chandran in the capital initially, citing it as a family dispute, had cost the force heavily. Another major area that will come under discussion will be the behaviour of the members of the force while dealing with the public. The latest instances of severe criticisms from the high court against the Pink police and the suicide of a law student in Aluva after visiting the police station, have come as a huge embarrassment to the force as a whole, despite repeated instructions for behaving politely with the public has been given to the police officials from time to time. The meeting will also review the expenditure of the Plan funds and the funds for the modernization of the police force, and would take stock of the various ongoing constructions and projects. The need to ensure patrolling at nights, presence of police officers on roads in the mornings and evenings and the progress in community policing initiatives, including Janamythri, student police cadets and the Kadalora Jagratha Samithis, will also figure in the discussions during the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/police-brass-to-review-cases-where-they-faced-criticisms/articleshow/88173724.cms||---

Habituated to combating the body’s natural rest period, she works silently and untiringly when the entire city is sleeping. Atchiyamma is one of the some 400 unsung heroes who toil during the nights to make the city ready for the next day to come.  Working in small groups, the presence of these sanitation warriors is felt in every important junction of the city for the public, those who step out of their homes even during the middle of the nights. Interestingly, the majority of the night sanitary workers are women. A Yellayamma, another night shift worker who delivers her duty near King George Hospital, is happy to contribute to the city’s cleanliness apart from becoming a breadwinner for her family. Their work, which largely goes behind the scenes, is one that drove the city towards bagging the 9th rank in the Swachh Survekshan-2021.  In a bid to encourage their work and address the gaps, the GVMC officials conducted a surprise inspection at several parts of the city for about two hours on Tuesday midnight. ToI accompanied the officials to get a glimpse of what this small stratum of society is doing for Vizag city.  A few sanitary workers complained of their meagre wages and delay in the promised hikes, while some pointed to the limited supplies of brooms and other sanitation material. Otherwise, they are content with their work and their contribution to the city.  The GVMC recently felicitated the sanitary workers after Vizag was announced as the 9th best city in the county in terms of cleanliness in Swachh Survekshan-2021. In a gesture of respect, the city mayor bowed to the feet of a sanitary worker during the felicitation ceremony.  Speaking to ToI, GVMC mayor G Hari Venkata Kumari said that these workers played a crucial role in the city getting the 9th rank in SS-2021. “During the interaction with them, they have raised some issues regarding their wages and sanitation supplies. We will address all these problems,” said Venkata Kumari.  GVMC commissioner G Lakshmisha said the visit gave a peek into the night-time sanitation activities. “The visit is to encourage the efforts of the night-time workers,” said Lakshmisha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/they-suffer-in-silence-yet-deliver-a-clean-city-every-midnight-for-us/articleshow/88173081.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

However, some crimes are not being reported due to various reasons. Recently, three people of two families, including a father-son duo, were murdered and two others sustained injuries when the families clashed over witchcraft and old rivalry in the tribal hamlet Bagmaravalasa in Tokuru panchyat under Ananthagiri police station limits in Vizag Agency.  Gollori Dombu was branded as witchcraft (black magic) practitioner by Killo Komati. Infuriated, Dombu’s son Subba Rao murdered Komati and caused severe injuries to Komati’s two sons. In retaliation, the relatives of Killo Komati and a few others murdered Dombu and Subba Rao. Inspector of police, Araku Vally, GD Baby said witchcraft charges led to the triple murder in the tiny village. “We have taken precautionary measures to prevent further clashes between the two groups in the village,” he added. A senior police officer, on condition of anonymity, said some people in parts of the state, including in urban areas, still believe in witchcraft and sorcery at a time when science and technology have made rapid strides. National Crime Records Bureau-2020 data revealed that witchcraft was the motive for four murders in Andhra Pradesh. The state topped in witchcraft related murders in south India. On average, 10 to 15 people are killed by locals on suspicion of practising witchcraft in the state. However, some of these murders are attributed to old-rivalry and others. During Covid-19, some people were attacked in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts after being charged with witchcraft and sorcery. “In the name of witchcraft, people are taking the law into their hands. There is a need to conduct more drives and initiatives to spread awareness among the people on the importance of science in the daily life and to educate them that witchcraft is unscientific and a blind belief,” said G Srinivas, a social activist.  “In rural pockets and also in some urban areas, if anyone contracts any disease or something bad happens to a family member, they believe some supernatural power has attacked them. The family would then blame some persons in the area for the misfortune,” said members of some organisations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/witchcraft-related-crimes-continue-unabated/articleshow/88173091.cms||Nalla.Babu

The data also stated that the state’s weekly positivity rate (till Monday) was lowest at 0.8% in the past three months. This was down from 1.02% for the week ending November 24. Though 13 districts have a higher weekly positivity rate (WPR) than the state’s average, public health experts felt that it was an encouraging sign that the overall WPR was below 2%. Among the districts with WPR higher than the state’s average were Pune (1.64%), Palghar (1.27%) and Aurangabad (1.24%). “This is the first time after many months that all the districts have registered a WPR below 2%. Besides, 22 districts have WPRs below the state’s average,” a state health official said. The state has told all districts to double the number of tests following the emergence of the Omicron variant of the Sars Cov-2 virus. A public health expert told TOI that it was important to keep a strict watch on the situation even if the current Omicron cases were mild in nature. The official said the emphasis should be on ramping up vaccination and testing. A task force member said it was essential to follow all the Covid appropriate behaviour and ensure that there was enough testing, tracking, tracing and vaccination. The cabinet note revealed that the tests were less than the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) norms in three districts — Amravati (72 per day per million), Buldhana (99 per day per million) and Yavatmal (114 per day per million). The Centre had earlier pulled up the state as nine districts were registering tests below the WHO norms (140 tests per day per million population). As many as 26 districts in the state have registered less than 100 cases in the week ending December 7. Among the revenue division, Konkan had the maximum active Covid cases. Konkan was followed by the Pune and Nashik divisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wpr-below-2-for-all-dists-maha-average-lower-at-0-8/articleshow/88173721.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Maharashtra for slashing of RT-PCR rates at airports||PUNE: Maharashtra additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas has written to the Union ministry of health to reduce the rates of rapid RT-PCR tests at Mumbai International Airport as the state has issued orders to test all passengers arriving on international flights. The current rate for the rapid RT-PCR test at the airport is Rs4,500 and the operator had agreed to bring it down to Rs3,900. However, the state health authorities felt it should be reduced further and uniform rates should be made applicable at all international airports in the wake of the Omicron variant and testing being made mandatory for passengers. Early this week, the state had slashed rates of RT-PCR tests to as low as Rs350 to enhance testing. Public health department sources told TOI that the operator conducting the test has to share some per cent of revenue with the airport operator. “It seems necessary that these rates are brought down immediately and windfall profits at the cost of passengers are curtailed,” stated the letter. State health officials said that reducing the cost to around Rs2500 was being discussed. The final decision would be announced soon. Apparently, the rates are less in other international airports, such as Bengaluru, Kochi and Chennai. Besides the cost of the kit, the letter also called for use of appropriate kits. “The CBNAAT tests targets N2 plus E gene, TruNat targets RNaseP plus RdRp genes, but we understand that in rapid RTPCR test only N gene (Thermofisher) and RdRp (Abbott) is tested. It may kindly be examined if it is possible to direct to use even for rapid RT-PCR tests the kits with 2 or 3 genes to increase the sensitivity in view of enhanced threat of covid infection from international passengers at airport,” the letter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-for-slashing-of-rt-pcr-rates-at-airports/articleshow/88173729.cms||Nisha Nambiar

All the six candidates were arrested following a complaint registered at the Bedi Marine police station based on the application submitted by Manoj Bist, lieutenant commandant, recruitment, INS Valsura. The cops, smelling a big racket, have initiated a probe on these lines. “It looks like an organised group had committed the forgery. A detailed investigation is going on and the accused have been identified,” said Deepan Bhadran, superintendent of police, Jamnagar. The recruitment process for the posts of senior secondary recruit, artificer apprentice and metric recruit started on December 6. While the registration process was done online, the candidates were called in person for document verification on Tuesday. The recruitment team got suspicious about six candidates — Gaurav Chahar, Shrikant Singh, Chandrakant Kushvah, Santosh Sepat, Kamlesh Saran and Kirit Pal — during the document verification process. Their Aadhar cards showed that they were residents of Gandhinagar in Gujarat. Also, the domicile certificates submitted by them were issued by the mamlatdar office in Gandhinagar. But their marksheets of their board examinations were of different states. Also, none of them was able to speak in Gujarati language. During the interrogation, the six candidates told Naval officials that they were students of the Balaji Defence Academy in Alwar, Rajasthan. They all were residents of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Rajendrasinh Yadav, an administrator of the academy, had submitted the six candidates’ applications online. Yadav also created fake Aadhar cards and domicile certificates for the six candidates. Yadav’s brother Vimal had handed over the fake documents and the call letters for the recruitment drive to the six candidates at Jamnagar. Yadav, his brother Vimal and the six candidates were booked under IPC sections 465 (punishment for forgery), 466 (forgery of records), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged documents as genuine). Further inquiry in the matter is on. Police said they have initiated the process to nab Yadav and his brother based on the statements of the six candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/8-booked-for-forging-papers-for-naval-recruitment-drive/articleshow/88172313.cms||---

The employee, Laxman Kinkar, passed away at a private hospital at 2 am on Wednesday in Sangamner while undergoing treatment. On Sunday, a male leopard had strayed into a locality in Srirampur town of Ahmednagar. Due to the chaos and people bursting firecrackers, the leopard hid in a bathroom outside a house. As soon as the information reached the forest department, two teams — one from Sangamner and another from Rahuri — reached Srirampur to rescue the wild animal. Kinkar was arranging a net just outside the bathroom when the leopard attacked and bit him on his thigh,” Suvarna Mane, divisional conservator of forest (DCF) of Ahmednagar, said. “After attacking Kinkar, the leopard leaped back into the bathroom. By the time, the leopard was trapped in the net, it had left seven personnel of the forest department injured and most of them had suffered minor injuries,” he added. Kinkar and other personnel who were injured in the attack were given anti-rabies injection. Later, Kinkar had gone home. However, on the next day, at 4 pm he started feeling unwell and his blood pressure also dropped. Subsequently, he got admitted to a private hospital. “He died during the course of treatment in the wee hours of Wednesday. Internal injuries are the main cause of the death,” Mane said. Kinkar is survived by his wife and two children. “Three more forest department employees are admitted to the hospitals and their condition is stable. Chief conservator of forest of Nashik Nitin Gudage said the relatives of the deceased forest employee would be provided with the eligible compensation and aid from the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/forest-dept-employee-dies-of-leopard-attack-injury/articleshow/88171588.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Sources said a dozen persons, including eight policemen, sustained minor injuries in the clash in the village under Chanho police station. Till the time of filing of this report late in the evening, the villagers had blocked traffic on the Ranchi-Daltonganj National Highway 75 to press for shifting of the school to another place. A large section of villagers is opposing the school at the aforesaid site saying it is linked to martyred freedom fighter Budhu Bhagat, the leader of Kol uprising in the 19th century. Union minister for tribal affairs Arjun Munda had laid the foundation stone of the school on August 24 this year amid heavy protests from the villagers. On November 22, hundreds of villagers had stormed the area and demolished the boundary wall of the school and set a machine on fire. The police stood as mute spectators as they were outnumbered. But on Tuesday, a large contingent of police personnel were deployed in Silgai for the gram sabha. All the entry points of the village were barricaded to stop residents of neighbouring localities from disturbing the meet. However, a large group of villagers started throwing stones on the police even as the latter tried to prevent them from reaching the site of the meeting. The police resorted to a mild lathi charge to stop the protestors. But the villagers from outside eventually managed to reach the site of gram sabha and disrupt it. Ranchi deputy commissioner Chavvi Ranjan said, “The gram sabha was called to ascertain the view of people on the school. However, the proceedings could not take place.” It may be stated here that the Eklvaya Vidyalayas are built in blocks which have 50% Adivasi population. The schools are developed as centres of excellence on the lines of Navodaya Vidyalayas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/police-villagers-clash-mars-gram-sabha-on-school-project/articleshow/88152113.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The event, Apki Adhikar, Sarkar Apke Dwar, is a part of a series of public outreach programmes organised by the state government in the run up to its second anniversary in office. Hailing the programme, Soren said his government was fulfilling the aspirations of the state’s people by rolling out social welfare schemes. Rural development minister Alamgir Alam, agriculture minister Badal Patralekh and labour minister Satyanand Bhokta also attended it. “Majority of the people from rural areas cannot travel to block and district headquarters to get their work done. Hence our government has decided to hand over the benefits to people right at their doorsteps,” Soren said. He further said that the state government was aware of all the promises made to the people and that they would all be fulfilled. With a view to ensure that aged people can lead a dignified life, Soren said his government had universalised the old-age pension scheme through which applicants above the age of 60 and irrespective of the BPL category would be given the benefits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/aware-of-promises-will-fulfill-them-hemant/articleshow/88172777.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Admin bans diesel-run autos in Jamshedpur from Jan 1||Jamshedpur: Diesel-run autorickshaws in Jamshedpur will have to pull out of the streets from January 1 next year and auto drivers will only be allowed to operate if they use CNG-powered vehicles, the office of the East Singhbhum district transport office (DTO) said. Earlier, several auto unions in the city had sought an extension to the December 31 deadline which was issued by the district transport department. However, the officials have ignored their pleas. The order for phasing out diesel-powered autos was issued in July this year. East Singhbhum’s district transport officer Dinesh Kumar Ranjan said, “The deadline will not be extended (beyond December 31). We will hold meetings with the autorickshaw owners and their unions to ensure that the target is achieved within the specified timeframe.” Ranjan’s stand will mean that auto owners have 20 days left to convert their autos to CNG or purchase new CNG-powered vehicles. Auto associations claimed there are close to 13,500 autos plying on the streets of Jamshedpur at the moment and of them, nearly 10,000 are diesel-powered. As per the DTO’s office, there are 500 CNG autos at the moment. Jamshedpur Tempo Chalak Union president Pawan Pandey said they have written to state transport secretary praying for an extension of the deadline. “Auto owners are not financially well-off to purchase new vehicles in such short notice,” Pandey said. Old vehicles will need draw investments worth Rs 30,000 for new CNG kit. Shyam Kinkar Jha, the president of another auto union named Sikshit Berojgar Tempo Chalak Sangh, said operators are reeling from the financial losses they suffered during the lockdowns and are struggling to stay afloat due to the rise in fuel prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/admin-bans-diesel-run-autos-in-jamshedpur-from-jan-1/articleshow/88173039.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||Records reveal non-BJP lawmakers from Jharkhand hardly attend house sessions||Ranchi: Non-BJP parliamentarians from Jharkhand have recorded poor attendance than their BJP counterparts. While most of the BJP MPs, both in the lower and upper house, have maintained average attendance of 80%, non-BJP MPs barely touch the 60% mark. JMM patriarch Shibu Soren has poorest record of 48% attendance in the upper house. The figures assume significance when Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reportedly expressed concern on the attendance of MPs during sessions while addressing BJP’s parliamentary committee meet in New Delhi on Tuesday. Out of 20 parliamentarians — 14 in Lok Sabha and six in Rajya Sabha — from Jharkhand, three — Arjun Munda, Annapurna Devi and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi — are ministers in the government and are thus exempted from marking their attendance. Of the remaining 17 lawmakers, 12 are from the BJP and Nishikant Dubey of Godda tops the list with 93% attendance during sessions. Sourced from Lok Sabha website and records of PRS legislative research, the national average attendance of parliamentarians in Lok sabha is 81%. The worst performer among BJP lawmakers is PN Singh of Dhanbad with 78% attendance, with all others remaining within this range. In the upper house also, the BJP’s Mahesh Poddar with 92% attendance tops the list and way above the national average attendance of 79%. Of all the 17 parliamentarians from Jharkhand, Guruji has attended less than 50% of the sessions in the upper house. Apart from him, the four non-BJP lawmakers — three in lower house and one in the upper house — have not been serious in attending sessions. Geeta Koda of the Congress and Vijay Hansdak of JMM have marked 60% attendance in Lok Sabha while Dheeraj Prasad Sahu has attended 69% of the sessions. Ajsu Party’s lone MP, Chandra Prakash Choudhary, with 75% attendance in the lower house is also below national average of 81%. Both JMM and Congress have justified the poor attendance and defended their parliamentarians. Congress state president Rajesh Thakur said their MPs don’t believe in posturing. “Geetaji and Dheerajji spend more time in their constituencies because they understand that nothing constructive is done sitting in house,” he said. Thakur questioned the BJP lawmakers from Jharkhand about the relevance of their good attendance. “What is the point sitting in Parliament if they cannot get the issue of separate Sarna code included in the census register or compel the government to tackle price hike?” he asked. Expressing similar views, JMM’s central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya accused the BJP government at the Centre of subverting the democratic process in Parliament. “What is the point of attending sessions when the government passes and repeals bills without any discussion? ” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/records-reveal-non-bjp-lawmakers-from-jharkhand-hardly-attend-house-sessions/articleshow/88172829.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

---||Ranchi||Omicron: Travellers from countries not ‘at risk’ to be exempted from Covid test||Ranchi: The state government has exempted foreign travellers from mandatory Covid testing upon arrival in Jharkhand if they do not have travel history to countries which have been labeled as “at risk” by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the new Omicron variant and are carrying a negative RT-PCR report. Late on Tuesday evening, state health secretary Arun Kumar Singh wrote to all deputy commissioners and said, “Post arrival testing based on self-declaration at Ranchi airport can be exempted if a passenger is travelling from a ‘not at risk’ country. However, if he/she has travelled to any at-risk country in the past 14 days, he or she will be asked for post arrival testing and additional restrictions.” As per norms, all incoming passengers at Ranchi airport will have to produce a RT-PCR negative report mandatorily prior to 72 hours of the commencement of their journey. Those not carrying negative reports are being put through Covid tests upon arrival. As per WHO, 14 nations, including countries from Africa and Europe, have been designated as ‘at risk’ after they reported strains of the virulent Omicron variant of Sars-Cov-2 virus last month. While Jharkhand is yet to report cases of Omicron strain, all international travellers will have to be tracked and tested by district health teams. All those who came in contact with a Covid positive person will have to be tested within two days, the order read. Singh also asked the districts to identify clusters or hotspots which have reported a spurt in infections recently and conduct testing and contact-tracing in those areas. The secretary’s directive also mandated the districts to positively send the samples of all Covid patients, who tested positive after November 24 (including foreign travellers), for genome sequencing to the Institute of Life Sciences (ILS) in Bhubaneswar. “No sample should be sent to private labs for genome sequencing,” the order read. The state has so far sent 30 samples to ILS for genome sequencing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/omicron-travellers-from-countries-not-at-risk-to-be-exempted-from-covid-test/articleshow/88172999.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Pashudhan scheme’s rules may change||Ranchi: The state government has decided to revise the guidelines for distribution of cattle under Mukhyamantri Pashudhan Yojana launched in 2020. On Wednesday, a proposal was sent to the minister of agriculture, animal husbandry and cooperation department, Badal Patralekh, to constitute a committee to revise the guidelines of the scheme after milk producers claimed that they have not benefitted at all from the scheme due to bottlenecks in the policy. According to the data available with the dairy development department, a total of 6,324 milk producers received the subsidy for purchasing cattle under the scheme in the financial year 2020-21. The milk producers from the state, while attending a function on National Milk Day, had pointed out the shortcomings of the scheme “Less than 10% of the cows are sold under this scheme, as farmers find it expensive to purchase cattle from the listed vendors,” said Nilesh, a milk producing farmer from Palajori block of Deoghar district. Representing the milk producing farmers community, he had urged the government to constitute a committee which would also include farmers. Under the Mukhyamantri Pashudhan Yojna, 50% subsidy on cost of cattle is provided by the state government, while the farmers have to pay the rest. The farmers claimed that since the number of vendors from whom cattle can be purchased is limited, they are unable to buy high-yeilding cattle or find competitive prices. “The farmers are of the opinion that the scheme is more for the vendors’ benefit than them,” admitted one of the officials of Jharkhand Milk Federation, unwilling to be quoted. The secretary of agriculture department, Aboobacker Siddique, said, “The scheme says the directorate will empanel the suppliers and farmers are free to buy from any of them. Empanelment is a must otherwise farmers may be exploited by the sellers.” Director of Dairy Development Board, Shashi Prakash Jha, said, “There are two main reasons for fewer distribution of cattle under this scheme. First, in sight of the pandemic, the ‘Pashu Mela’ was prohibited. Second, the same scheme earlier was run under a different name where the farmers were given 90% subsidy. But under the present scheme, it is a 50-50 share.” To resolve the issues, the secretary has decided to set up a committee consisting two farmers — a milk producer and another engaged in animal husbandry — to ensure transparency and redressal of grievances. Talking to TOI, Siddique explained the procedure for selecting a farmer. He said, “The farmer is selected through the gram sabha, who recommends to the BDO. Through the BDO, it will come to the district committee. Now the committee headed by the deputy commissioner will make the final selection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pashudhan-schemes-rules-may-change/articleshow/88172989.cms||---

He said that former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’ statements were meant to confuse people ahead of the elections. Rane, in a video released on Wednesday, said that the speculation that he is going to join BJP is a “figment of imagination”. “I am not leaving my party. I belong to Congress...for over 45 years. And I don’t think of leaving the party at this juncture,” said Rane. On Tuesday, BJP’s Goa poll-in-charge Devendra Fadnavis suggested that the veteran Congressman might join BJP. “The Congress in Goa was a nano party with four MLAs. Soon, with Pratapsingh Rane’s blessings, Congress will be reduced to a bicycle party, with only two persons remaining,” Fadnavis said at an event in which former Congress MLA Ravi Naik joined BJP. “This is a figment of imagination. People are trying to spread canards,” said Rane. State Congress president Girish Chodankar said that Maharashtra BJP MLA’s remarks indicate the frustration within the BJP ranks. Chodankar also condemned the remarks and urged the former Maharashtra chief minister to stop making irresponsible remarks. “BJP can’t seem to campaign without lying. Despite having so many MLAs, they can’t seem to win as per every survey. Now out of desperation they are trying to buy more and more MLAs,” Chodankar said. Chodankar also said that BJP has done Congress a favour by inducting Naik. “We had already kept him aside. We wanted a fresh face, but we could not give a fresh face. If they didn’t take him it would have been very difficult for us. There would have been many fights,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rane-sr-terms-rumours-of-him-joining-bjp-canards/articleshow/88173915.cms||---

Since BA.2 does not have the S gene dropout unlike the main sub-lineage BA.1, it escapes identification through RT-PCR tests, scientists said. The RT-PCR test will still give a positive result for Covid even if the sample contains BA.2. To know the presence of BA.2, one needs to go for genome sequencing. Dr Emma Hodcroft, co-developer of Nextstrain, an open-source project to harness scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data, said there is need to design new PCRs to identify this sub-lineage. "A new set of sequences closely related to Omicron have been detected. We absolutely can detect cases with PCR. What we can't tell as easily is that they are Omicron or Omicron-like," she said. The lineage may also cause immune evasion and vaccine breakthrough infection. Variant can cause immune evasion, says IGIB scientist  Commenting on a research finding on Omicron, Dr Vinod Scaria, senior scientist at Delhi's Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), tweeted that the variant can indeed cause immune (antibody) evasion. "(The research study) corroborates with additional clinical/epidemiological evidence on re-infections and breakthrough infections as well as what was suggestive of mutational profile and computational analyses," he posted. He said the Pfizer vaccine has better efficacy in hybrid immunity (vaccine plus previous infection). The Omicron lineage first identified on November 8 has now split into two sub-lineages - BA.1 and BA.2. The new sub-lineages were officially announced on December 7 by Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages (PANGOLIN), which has been assigning nomenclature to the novel coronavirus variants under PANGO lineage system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rt-pcr-unlikely-to-identify-omicron-variant-ba-2-experts/articleshow/88175592.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Goa||Ready to resign as minister for any interested politician, says Michael Lobo||PANAJI: Ports minister Michael Lobo on Wednesday said that he is ready to resign as minister for any politician who is either not sure about winning the upcoming assembly election or who is interested in becoming a cabinet minister. He said that, to become cabinet minister, these politicians should contact chief minister Pramod Sawant and later him. His statement comes in the wake of speculation in political circles that there might be a cabinet reshuffle before the election code of conduct comes into force. When asked if there will be any cabinet reshuffle, Lobo said that he has heard that the code of conduct for the upcoming assembly election will come into force from December 20. The PM will arrive in Goa on December 19 and the code of conduct will come into force any time after that, he said. “If a new person is inducted in the cabinet what will he do,” he said, adding, “If someone wants to become a minister, he should contact me. I am ready to resign as minister. Anyone who wants to become minister in this term or feels that he will not get elected in the upcoming election should contact me and CM and CM should agree.” On the Omicron situation, Lobo said that tourists are coming to Goa and “we have to take precautions” and that the state cannot stop economic activities. “We cannot scare the tourists coming to Goa. Tourism is part of the state’s economic activities, which went through a bad time, but then life also is important and we have to balance both,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-ready-to-resign-as-min-for-any-interested-politician/articleshow/88174049.cms||---
---||Goa||Will sack minister if survivor files plaint in alleged sex scandal: CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday said he would sack the minister in the alleged sex scandal if the survivor filed a police complaint. His statement follows Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar’s claims last week that a minister in BJP-led state government has been involved in a sex scandal. “If somebody has any proof regarding the sex scandal, or if the survivor files a complaint, I will take action 100 per cent. To date, nobody has filed a complaint against anyone,” Sawant, who is also the home minister, said. “Women in Goa have rights, and if there is harassment to a woman, she should file a complaint. I will order a thorough inquiry and once it is proved, I will go to the extent of even sacking the minister concerned. As home minister, I am firm on this.” Sawant further speculated that the allegations could also be a political strategy in view of the fast-approaching state assembly elections. “During election year, a thousand allegations are made,” Sawant said. On December 1, a meeting of the core committee of the state BJP, which had been called to discuss Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Goa, turned stormy as some senior party functionaries raised the issue of allegations of sexual assault made by Congress against a cabinet minister. The next day, state BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade set December 6 as the deadline for Chodankar to name the minister involved in the scandal. He had also urged the survivor to file a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-sack-minister-if-survivor-files-plaint-cm/articleshow/88174053.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra minister Anil Parab's resort illegal, records forged, says revenue department||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra revenue department informed the state's anti-corruption ombudsman on Tuesday that a piece of land in Dapoli, Ratnagiri, on which transport minister Anil Parab had built a resort had been wrongfully tagged as 'non-agricultural (NA)', thus proving the construction to be illegal and in violation of Coastal Regulation Zone rules. The 7/12 records showing the status of the property as 'NA' have been found to be forged and a police complaint is pending at Dapoli. After an enquiry following a complaint by BJP leader Kirit Somaiya, the NA status of the land was scrapped on December 3. Principal secretary (revenue and forests) Nitin Kareer was present for the online hearing conducted by the Lokayukta where the forgery and violation were discussed and the state disclosed the findings. Retired justice V N Kanade is the Lokayukta. The land in Dapoli on which Anil Parab’s resort stands has been wrongly tagged ‘non-agricultural’The land admeasuring 4,200 sq metres was bought by Parab, a Shiv Sena leader, in 2017 from one Vibhas Sathe. The sale deed was registered on June 19, 2019, but the mutation in the 7/12 extract showing sale of land to Parab was not done. In December 2020, after the controversy broke over the illegal construction of a resort on the property, Parab sold it to one Sadanand Kadam. The land records reflect the names of Sathe and Kadam, said Sanjay Shinde, additional collector, Ratnagiri. He has served a notice on current owner Kadam for carrying out construction without permission. Kadam approached a local sessions court in July 2021 and got a status quo order. The next hearing is on December 13, says a report of the revenue wing to the Lokayukta. The enquiry was done by the additional collector following a complaint by Somaiya to governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who forwarded it to the Lokayukta. The Lokayukta, in turn, directed the government to probe and submit a report. Somaiya had accused Parab of constructing a resort (Sai Resort) in violation of CRZ norms and without clearances from Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority. This was confirmed by the environment department. "The fact that non-agricultural permission was not accorded shows it is a case of forgery. I had filed a complaint with Dapoli police station, but they have still not registered an FIR," said Somaiya. Home department officials too said they had found nothing amiss. But with the revenue inquiry revealing that it had not tagged the land as NA, it is evident that documents had been tampered with. Somaiya has now been directed by the Lokayukta to file his statement. Thereafter, the three departments will be required to respond. Parab, in the past, had been accused of constructing an illegal office on an open space owned by Mhada in Bandra East. Here, too, Parab had informed that he was not the owner of the land and the structure did not belong to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-anil-parabs-resort-illegal-records-forged-says-revenue-department/articleshow/88175604.cms||Clara Lewis

Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar said that reservations for ST candidates are being implemented across the nation except in Goa. “We received the ST status in 2003 and it was supposed to be implemented from the 2007 assembly polls, but was deferred stating that it would be implemented after next Census, in 2012. However, the reservation was not implemented in the 2012 polls and not even till the 2017 general elections,” Gaonkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tribals-demand-st-seats-in-4-constituencies/articleshow/88174072.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Goa: Congress releases audio, claims BJP MLA Dayanand Sopte sought Rs 44 lakh bribe||PANAJI: Congress on Wednesday released an audio clip in which Mandrem BJP MLA Dayanand Sopte is purportedly heard asking two unidentified businessmen for a ‘donation’ of Rs 44 lakh. State party president Girish Chodankar claimed that the audio recording is a conversation between Sopte and representatives of a hotelier and that Sopte demanded a bribe to ‘manage’ government officials. Chodankar released the audio at a press conference to prove his earlier allegation that the BJP MLA was collecting ‘Sopte tax’ from businessmen in his constituency. The audio recording, which is in Hindi, has the businessman telling Sopte that it is difficult to fork out the huge sum as construction of their 22 wooden cottages is still on and no revenue has been generated. “Sopte is claiming to manage everyone. He wants Rs 3 lakh upfront and says that the Sopte tax has to be given to someone named Ozzie,” said Chodankar. In the recording, Sopte is purportedly heard explaining that ahead of the elections, there are a lot of expenses. Sopte then tells the two businessmen to speak to their political contacts and parents and decide quickly. The businessmen asked for a week’s time to decide and arrange for the funds. He then asks the duo not to worry about calls from officials. Sopte filed a complaint against Chodankar for defaming him. “I am confident that I will get justice,” he said. Sopte and his supporters also burnt an effigy of Chodankar in front of Congress house. Sopte handed over his complaint to the DGP. “It is not my voice on the audio clip,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-releases-audio-claims-sopte-sought-rs-44-lakh-bribe/articleshow/88174108.cms||---

State Congress president Girish Chodankar said that candidates are frustrated with the bribes being demanded by BJP MLAs, including the chief minister’s office. He also said that the government is harassing candidates by asking them to appear for three different exams on the same day at the same time. “The government has bypassed the Goa Staff Selection Commission, which was created by former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar for transparency in selection.There was scope for merit then. However, chief minister Pramod Sawant has bypassed it to garner money for the election,” Chodankar said. The state Congress chief said that jobs in the home department and PWD are being sold. “The corrupt BJP government is pushing the youth of Goa into frustration as deserving candidates are not getting jobs.” He further said the final list is being prepared by Government Polytechnic Panaji by manipulating results. Exams were conducted for 85 jobs and 14 other posts and the list of the selected candidates for these posts will come out either on Thursday or Friday. These jobs have been sold too, and the youth who have applied have said that the rate is around Rs 25 lakh to Rs 30 lakh,” Chodankar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/jobs-sold-no-place-for-merit-holders-cong/articleshow/88174111.cms||---
