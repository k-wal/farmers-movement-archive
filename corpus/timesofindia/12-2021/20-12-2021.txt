Ferrando’s decision to trigger the release clause in his contract and join ATK Mohun Bagan took the club by surprise on Sunday morning. But there was some calm later in the day as Goa knew who they wanted to take the team forward. According to sources, the club’s technical director Derrick Pereira and Spanish coach Angel Viadero have been shortlisted to take over as the new coach. Clifford Miranda will be the interim coach and will take charge for the next clash against Odisha FC on Christmas eve. “We are @FCGoaOfficial. We have a championship squad and there is already a full strength of coaches and staff to fill in the gaps in the short term,” club president Akshay Tandon said in a tweet on Sunday. When the club parted ways with Sergio Lobera in 2020 and there were still three league games to be played, besides the playoffs, Derrick was asked to take charge, along with Clifford. The former India defender has been with the club for a long time and knows what is expected. Since Derrick is already in Goa, it will be easier for him to join the team’s bio-secure bubble, undergo quarantine and take charge. Should the club look for a foreign option, Viadero is the top choice. The Spanish coach was interviewed last season and impressed the club with his know-how. He has been following the Indian Super League (ISL) and is comfortable with the possession-based style of football that has been the hallmark of Goa since 2017. Viadero, 52, started his coaching career in 2002 and spent the first eight years at Real Racing. Since then, he has managed several clubs including Racing Santander and Eibar in the Spanish Segunda B division. In 2019-20, he coached Moroccan outfit Moghreb Tetouan, the same club where Lobera tasted success before he made his move to Goa. “Right now, what the club needs is an experienced head on board. Derrick and Angel both have enough years of coaching under their belt and will be perfect for the club,” said one source. Goa are placed eighth with seven points from six matches. They lost the first three games but won the next two and drew against Hyderabad FC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/derrick-viadero-on-fc-goas-two-man-shortlist-to-replace-coach-ferrando/articleshow/88378930.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The government is not averse to the idea of letting a parliamentary committee scrutinise the Bill. The winter session is scheduled to end on December 23. Sources said the government would not want to rush through with the passage of a crucial legislation that will have far-reaching implications, and which is being opposed by a section of commentators, activists and some political parties. Though the Cabinet had approved raising the marriageable age, there is a view that the government may cede space for a deeper scrutiny of the Bill by a standing committee if such a demand arises from the opposition parties.

The age of marriage for women was increased from 15 to 18 in 1978, by amending the erstwhile Sharda Act of 1929. Samajwadi party members, CPM and AIMIM chief Assadudin Owaisi, have opposed the move. As the debate hots up, Union minister for minority affairs and deputy leader in Rajya Sabha, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, at a programme to mark ‘Minorities Day’ on Saturday hit out at opponents, saying the “Talibani mentality” on women’s liberty, dignity, empowerment and constitutional equality will not be tolerated.

The move is also being cited by the government as a step that will allow women to attain psychological maturity before marriage, exercise their reproductive rights better and have a bigger say in decisions on family planning and use of contraceptives.

Maharashtra tops the chart in the state-wise tally with 54 cases, followed by Delhi, which has 22 cases. Among the new cases in Maharashtra, four were detected in Mumbai and one each in Pimpri Chinchwad and Pune (rural). The four cases detected in Mumbai were overseas travelers -- two from UK and others from Tanzania -- who tested positive for Covid-19 when screened at the airport. All of them are fully vaccinated. The Pune case is a five-year-old boy who is a close contact of a traveller from Dubai. The Pimpri Chinchwad case is a 46-year-old returnee from a middle eastern country. Maharashtra health authorities said that of the 54 cases, 28 have already been discharged, while the rest remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Four persons who had tested positive for Covid-19 upon their arrival in Gujarat earlier were found to be infected with the Omicron variant after their genome sequencing report came on Sunday.

He said the production of a new influenza vaccine every year demonstrates it is possible to adapt existing vaccines to keep up with viral mutations.

The country logged less than 50,000 fresh cases in the week ending Sunday, the first time in 19 months that the weekly count had dropped below that mark.The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, director said that immunologists are concerned about the possibility of accruing further mutations, which could render the vaccines less effective. However, such vaccines could be "tweaked" to overcome this problem. He said that apart from manufacturing billions of doses, the real challenge is the equitable distribution of vaccines to rich and poor countries. Guleria was speaking at the 22nd Dr VS Prayag Memorial Oration 2021 organised jointly by the Association of Physicians of India and Dr Shirish Prayag family at the Yashwantrao Chavan Academy of Development Administration. According to Guleria, the 21st century is witnessing more outbreaks. "We had outbreaks of bird flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), H1N1 pandemic, Ebola, Zika, and Nipah viruses. If observed closely, most of the infections are zoonotic in nature." A zoonosis is an infectious disease that has jumped from a non-human animal to humans. According to him, the reasons behind increase in new infectious diseases are growing travel, trade, and connectivity, increasing urbanization, and encroachment into new environments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/can-tweak-existing-covid-vaccines-to-fight-new-strains-guleria/articleshow/88379743.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The move comes at a time when the government is also finalising a “trusted sources” list for procuring telecom gear as the country moves towards 5G and other sophisticated telecom and immersive technologies, but with negligible procurement from China and other countries inimical to India’s security interests. “The PMO has been informed about the efforts to explore the possibility of setting up a sub department for Telecom Cyber Security under a unified national level cyber security task force instead of setting up a separate task force under the telecom ministry,” a source said, adding that the task force is expected to be in place by March next year. The telecom department will develop an internal task force with the relevant skill sets and capabilities required specifically for the telecom sector. “This sub task force will work in conjunction with the unified national-level cyber security task force that has been envisaged,” the source said, adding that 20 officers have already been identified for getting embedded into the project. “There are also plans to add more officers, with specialised skills sets, to this team as we move forward,” the source said. The current cyber threats are handled by the specialised Indian Computer Emergency Response Team or CERT-In, which operates under the Ministry of Electronics and IT. It is the nodal agency to deal with cyber security threats like hacking and phishing, and strengthens security-related defence of the Indian internet domain. However, with the cyberattacks getting more sophisticated, the government has increasingly felt the need to have a specialised unified task force that acts on inputs not only from security and cyber forces from within the country, but also from inputs from ‘like-minded friendly countries’ from across the world. Speaking at the Sydney Dialogue recently, PM Narendra Modi had also called for democracies to work together in cyberspace to prevent conflict, as he warned that technology and data are the “new weapons” in the current times. India has increasingly seen an alarming rise in cyberattacks, both at the citizen level, and that of critical installations and important personalities. While the government has never confirmed, many security experts have blamed cyber and malware attack from China for the massive power outage in Mumbai in October last year. Recently, there have been some major hacks, including that of Prime Minister Modi’s personal Twitter account which was compromised earlier this month. “Cyber-attacks, including phishing, many a times find route through compromised versions of apps which are distributed through parallel stores or side loaded through many ways. These potentially carry malwares and other Trojans, which infringe piracy of the users installing them and app developer ecosystem does not notice such issues several times. Hence a strong control framework is need of the hour for both internal and external monitoring for protecting consumer privacy,” says Amit Relan, co-founder and director, mFilterIt, a global Fraud Detection & Prevention Company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/unified-cyber-security-task-force-by-march-source/articleshow/88379846.cms||Pankaj Doval

He said the delay in liberation meant several freedom fighters lost their lives. "At least 31 satyagrahis lost their lives in 1955, including youngsters like Karnail Singh Banipal of Punjab. These freedom fighters were restless because a part of India was still under foreign rule. I want to say had Sardar Patel lived a bit longer, Goa would not have to wait for so long for its liberation." Modi takes dig at Nehru on Goa's 60th Liberation Day Taking a dig at the then government under Jawaharlal Nehru, Modi also said that a freedom fighter like Mohan Ranade continued to languish in Portuguese prison, even after Goa was liberated. The issue had to be finally raised by Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Parliament back then, said the PM in his address to Goa on the state's 60th Liberation Day celebrations held at Shyama Prasad Mukherjee stadium on the outskirts of Panaji. Recalling the sacrifice of the Pune-based freedom fighter for Goa's freedom, Modi said, "We must remember Mohan Ranade who was sent to jail for fighting for Goa's freedom. He was kept in prison (in Portugal) and had to live through unspeakable difficulties. Even after Goa's liberation, he remained in prison. At the time, it was Atal Bihari Vajpayee who raised the issue in Parliament," he said. The PM said Goa has struggled the longest as compared to any other region in India for its freedom. "The rest of the country was free before Goa. Most of the people in the country finally had the freedom to live out their dreams. But they gave up all of it and chose to sacrifice for Goa's freedom. Goa's freedom fighters, too, never stopped fighting. In Indian history, Goans have kept the flame burning for freedom for the longest period," Modi said. He said Goa never lost its connection with India despite several turbulent centuries of Portuguese rule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/goa-would-have-been-liberated-earlier-had-patel-lived-longer-pm/articleshow/88379918.cms||---
---||India||Govt calls meet of 5 parties on RS row, oppn say it’s a stunt||NEW DELHI: Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi on Sunday reached out to leaders of five opposition parties whose 12 MPs were suspended from Rajya Sabha on opening day of the winter session, calling for a meeting at 10am on Monday. The leaders of the parties — Congress, Trinamool Congress, CPI, CPM and Shiv Sena — may rebuff the government’s bid to confer with a limited set of leaders to end the ongoing stalemate, rather than the entire opposition group. While the government has maintained that nothing less than an apology will suffice to end the suspension, Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu last week appealed to both treasury benches and opposition to hold a dialogue to end the impasse in the interest of letting the House run smoothly. Rajya Sabha’s productivity in winter session’s third week hit a low of 37% owing to disruptions by opposition MPs demanding that the suspension be revoked. Opposition MPs, however, appeared on Sunday to be unwilling to concede to the government’s “half-hearted” reaching out, and have convened an emergency meeting of all opposition leaders at 9.45am at leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge’s office. With only four days of the winter session remaining, the leaders are expected to decide whether or not to consider the government’s compromise bid. “Monday morning STUNT from a Govt. who do not want #Parliament to function. Govt calls leaders of the 5 Oppn parties whose 12 RS MPs have been arbitrarily suspended. Govt leaves other 10 Oppn parties out. Failed stunt. ALL OPPN clear : first revoke arbitrary suspension,” Trinamool MP and floor leader Derek O’brien said on Twitter. Suspended CPI MP Binoy Viswam also said his party does not subscribe to the idea of government dividing the opposition. “Opposition united is fighting the suspension of 12 MPs. Calling 5 parties for discussion at the fag end of the session is to divide the opposition unity. CPI will not subscribe to it. Final decision will be taken tomorrow in the joint opposition meeting,” Viswam said on Twitter. Congress also held a truncated parliamentary party meeting on Sunday where it is understood to have agreed that in the face of government remaining “adamant” about not revoking the suspension of the 12 MPs, and not agreeing in Lok Sabha to dismiss MoS Home Ajay Mishra Teni for his son’s alleged involvement in the Lakhimpur Kheri killing of farmers, the Congress will continue to press for a discussion on these and other issues including price rise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-calls-meet-of-5-parties-on-rs-row-oppn-say-its-a-stunt/articleshow/88379919.cms||Swati Mathur

The valuation is a testimony to underserved businesses latching onto newer payment solutions to reduce friction in B2B payments.This is one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian unicorn. Razorpay was valued at $1 billion in October last year, and at $3 billion in April. The financial technology venture has raised $741.5 million to date. The latest funding was co-led by Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital and TCV. Existing investors Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, GIC and Y Combinator also participated.Harshil Mathur, CEO and co-founder of Razorpay, said the funds would be deployed to create a full-stack financial ecosystem for businesses. It will further scale up its business banking suite, RazorpayX, which equips businesses to handle compliance requirements and operations.RazorpayX recently added a tax payment suite, a platform for tax payments needs of small businesses, be it TDS, GST, TCS or advance tax. The RazorpayX dashboard provides businesses a single, transparent view of all disbursals for seamless collaboration between finance teams, external accountants, and business owners. “We want to get to a point where if you want to start a business tomorrow and you come to Razorpay, we want to take care of everything related to managing financials seamlessly–banking, payments, paying salaries, tax payments, credit. And as businesses scale up, we will offer them a larger credit line. We want businesses to spend less time managing compliance and operations and invest more time in creating new products, building on new ideas and thinking scale We also plan to launch payment solutions for import/export services and that’s the roadmap for early next year,” Mathur said.The plan is also to expand into geographies like South East Asia, acquire B2B SaaS companies, and hire 600 people next year, including in data science, AI and cloud roles.Mathur had recently told TOI that the company had clocked total payment volume (TPV) of $60 billion in 2021, an over 300% year-on-year growth for the second year in a row. Buoyed by this performance, the company is targeting $90 billion in TPV for 2022. Razorpay powers more than 5% of IMPS transactions on the disbursement side. It powers payments for over 8 million businesses in India including Facebook, Ola, Zomato, Swiggy, Cred, Muthoot Finance, and Indian Oil, and is on track to reach 10 million businesses by 2022. A new solution, Magic Checkout, automatically prefills information at all stores within the Magic Checkout network for all current and future purchases. This, Mathur said, has reduced the dropout at the payment stage by 40%-50%, and shoppers are able to checkout 50% faster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/razorpay-raises-375mn-at-7-5bn-valuation/articleshow/88379952.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

Four of them — Indian Institute of Science’s (IISc) Sandeep Eswarappa (department of biochemistry), Srimonta Gayen and Ramray Bhat (department of molecular reproduction, development and genetics), and Hiyaa Ghosh from National Centre for Biological Sciences — are from Bengaluru. They will be members of EMBO global investigator network for four years and will have access to funding for many networking and training activities. The other four researchers are Brandon Morinaka from National University of Singapore, Wee-Wei Tee from the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore, Hsu-Wen Chao from Taipei Medical University and Ming-Jung Lin from Academia Sinica, Taipei. While Eswarappa’s research focuses on “translation, the process of making proteins from messenger RNAs by deciphering the genetic code,” Bhat’s project focuses on “understanding the mechanisms by which cancers of the breast and ovary undergo metastasis”. Gayen’s group will strive to further understand the mechanism of epigenetic regulation of gene expression during early mouse and human development, through the lens of X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting and random monoallelic autosomal gene expression. Hiyaa’s project will be on regulation of homeostasis (a self-regulating process by which biological systems tend to maintain stability) and neuro-inflammation in the mammalian brain. “EMBO global investigator network supports life scientists who have an excellent track record and have been group leaders for at least one but less than six years. They must carry out research in an EMBC associate-member state (currently India and Singapore) or in a country or territory covered by a cooperation agreement with EMBC (currently Chile and Taiwan),” IISc said in a note. The global investigator network was launched in 2019 and the applicant success rate this year was 21%, EMBO said. The next application deadline is June 1, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/4-bluru-scientists-now-in-european-network/articleshow/88379953.cms||---

But sanitation workers elsewhere in the city are still managing without them. The struggle of Bellandur workers was successful only because a teenager in the area raised concern after seeing the driver of a waste collection auto-tipper cutting his hand while collecting garbage a few months ago. Seema Sharma, a member of KMB, was taken aback when her 18-year-old son questioned her about the safety equipment provided to sanitation workers. “My son was outraged seeing the injured driver tying up his hand in a dirty piece of cloth,” she said. His question had Seema pondering. “Solid waste management workers barely have basic safety equipment. They do not have a uniform, their clothes are soiled and they have no gloves,” she said. “We initially spoke to the BBMP health officer concerned on providing medical kits to their employees, but they paid no heed to us,” Seema said, explaining why the citizens decided to act on their own. “Every vehicle in the city has a medical kit, but BBMP auto-tippers don’t. Regardless of the numerous requests we raise, no attention is paid to the demands of sanitation workers,” said Clifton D’ Rozario, lawyer, All India Lawyers Association for Justice. Manjunath N, a sanitation worker and waste collector at Kengeri, said, “Many times while collecting waste, sharp objects cut our hands. We just pour some alcohol on it and tie it up with a handkerchief. There are no first-aid kits to help us.” Another auto-tipper driver, Prakash K from Pulakeshinagar, said BBMP does not care about the well-being of sanitation workers. “The last time we got a mask or gloves was a year ago and even then, we were given one pair each. How long can we work with them?” he asked.

---||Bengaluru||Why is Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike relaying footpaths in good shape, wonder citizens||BENGALURU: Residents across the city are peeved with BBMP’s zealousness to relay pavements that don’t need to be revamped. Footpaths in Byappanahalli, Jayanagar and Kempegowda Road among other places have been dug up overnight, though they were in fine shape. Citizens are wondering why the Palike is doing this when there are several other pavements in the city that require immediate attention. A sidewalk in a good condition opposite Byappanahalli police station is being dismantled. “I live near Old Madras Road and noticed that a perfectly good pavement is being carefully removed and replaced with a new one, while many roads in the city don’t even have footpaths. BBMP should start using concrete to build pavements as it lasts longer. When it comes to tiles, even if one comes out, all of them will start disassembling,” said a resident of Byappanahalli. The trend, some feel, is not new. Varun S, who often takes a stroll from MS Ramaiah hospital towards Sadashivanagar police station, said, “There was a point when the pavements on this stretch were relaid almost every year when there was absolutely no need for it. In the past few months, they have remained untouched and we genuinely hope it remains that way. This is happening in many places across the city.” Sapna Karim from NGO Janaagraha said, “Which are the roads where pavements need to be redone, require just repairs and the ones that are completely fine? If they (authorities) have this data for pavements across the 14,000km road network in the city, they will know in what order to prioritise their work. Without that, they will be undertaking work in a haphazard manner and some perfect infrastructure will get dismantled.” BBMP along with other agencies can do this in a systemic manner only if there is information and data exchange between agencies undertaking projects, Sapna added. ‘Work being done only where tiles are missing or broken’Speaking on the pavement being dug up opposite Byappanahalli police station, Mohan Krishna, chief engineer for east zone, said, “The work has been taken up by BBMP’s road infrastructure division’s traffic engineering cell under non-motorised transit project. Pavement work, including desilting of shoulder drain, laying of new tiles, junction improvement below ORR flyovers and resetting of cobblestones from Silk Board to Trinity Circle and from Old Madras Road to Domlur flyover, has been taken up and is being carried out at a cost of Rs 50 crore. The pavements are being relaid only where tiles are missing or broken.” “The executive engineer from the cell told us they will develop the footpath, hand it over to Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited and ensure there’s no repetition of work,” Krishna said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/why-is-bbmp-relaying-footpaths-in-good-shape-wonder-citizens/articleshow/88379958.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

Harish claimed he had close contacts in KPSC and could use his influence to get jobs for Kumar and his friend Chidanand. The duo believed Kumar and met him and others at a hotel at Nagawara on December 12. “Harish asked the youths to give him their marks cards and blank cheques as guarantee. Later, however, Prasanna and Chidanand smelt something fishy and filed a complaint. Preliminary probe revealed the miscreants hadn’t encashed the cheques as yet,” a police officer said.This is the second fraud case within a week related to recruitment of PWD assistant engineers through the Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC). KPSC held a competitive exam on December 14 to fill 660 posts across the state. A 30-year-old civil engineering graduate was arrested for allegedly using a Bluetooth-enabled electronic device in the exam. Police are trying to identify those who assisted the accused, Veerannagowda Devindra Chikkegowda of Jewargi in Kalaburagi district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/2-pwd-engineer-aspirants-conned-2nd-case-in-7-days/articleshow/88379960.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Legalise same-sex marriages, demand protesters||BENGALURU: More than 5,000 people participated in the 14th edition of Namma Pride, demanding overall sensitisation to the LGBTQIA+ community and legalisation of same-sex marriages. The principal organiser, Coalition for Sex Workers and Sexual Minority Rights (CSMR), maintained that the pride march was not a celebration but a protest. “We have come a long way. Our first effort was the abolition of Section 377 and now we want legal recognition for same-sex couples and parents,” said Yash, a ‘volunqueer’ at Namma Pride. Ayaan Syed, member of the organising committee, said the protest also focused on liberation of the transgender community. Underlining that most transgenders are forced to beg and involve themselves in sex work, Uma, a transgender woman, called for full and proper implementation of the transgender policy in Karnataka, which has seen no progress since receiving approval in 2018. “We want the ministry of education to implement a sensitising module in schools and colleges because discrimination can be unlearned there. We are also committed towards suicide prevention in the transgender community as suicides have been on the rise since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic,” she said. “The government is only serving the interests of gender-compliant people. We have always been ignored but now we would like to see reservations for our community in government jobs,” asserted Stephie Sheryl, a transgender woman. The protesters were also heard raising slogans in praise of Babasaheb Ambedkar. They stated that if he had not written the Constitution, they wouldn’t have been able to be on the roads today demanding their rights. “My body, my rights. My sexuality, I choose,” they sang as they completed their march from KSR railway station to Samsa Bayalu Rangamandira on the premises of Ravindra Kalakshetra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/legalise-same-sex-marriages-protesters/articleshow/88379965.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||No clarity on rules, flyers from Bengaluru airport choosing London transit left in lurch||BENGALURU: Several Indian passport holders, who had booked flights via London to reach Canada, have allegedly been denied boarding at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), Bengaluru, by various airlines citing vague Covid testing rules and visa hurdles. Travel experts termed the situation “unfair” with no clarity on rules during the Omicron crisis, resulting in huge monetary losses and heartbreak for those not being able to travel despite fulfilling travel requirements. There are limited options for Canada-bound passengers even as ticket prices are skyrocketing. Also, air bubble arrangements due to Covid-19 allow only point-to-point travel and transit at destinations like London which is creating problems for Indian passport holders without a UK visa, experts said. Recently, Mahesh Rajanna from Yelahanka booked a ticket on British Airways to Toronto from Bengaluru with a brief transit in London. He reached KIA on the dawn of December 5 only to be denied boarding. The ground staff said he’d failed to pre-book a Covid RT-PCR test for his transit in Heathrow. Mahesh booked another ticket with the same airline for travel on December 12 and this time too he was denied boarding, with the response that “Indian passport holders even with Canadian PR stamps are not allowed to transit via the UK”. The 39-year-old is now trying his luck with other airlines to fly directly from Delhi to rejoin work in Canada. Rajanna is one of the many who were turned away at KIA in recent weeks by airlines like British Airways and Qatar Airways over a rule, which travel experts say, doesn’t exist on paper. Indian passengers to Canada, mainly those holding Canadian PR, had been transiting via London without needing a visa for the UK. According to Indiver Rastogi, president, Global Business Travel, Thomas Cook (India) & SOTC, Indians holding a valid Canadian visa don’t need a transit visa but must obtain a negative test report at the airport in London, in addition to a pre-departure negative Covid test result in India. “It is highly recommended to pre-book the test at the airport in London, and a suitable transit time between connecting flights should be kept in mind, confirming details with the respective airline,” he said. However, the reality on the ground has been the opposite, rued many flyers. “I spotted a reasonably less expensive ticket to head to Montreal via London from Bengaluru and was sent back by Bengaluru airport staff who said Indian passport holders despite having Canadian PR stamps can’t fly via London. Now I’m booked on a direct flight by Air India from Delhi to Toronto after paying nearly Rs 2 lakh for the trip,” lamented a 27-year-old techie. ‘3 trouble-free options to reach Canada’Loveleen Arun, a Bengaluru-based travel expert and holiday package designer, said the information system for airline travel has broken down and no one is giving a clear answer on the status of Indians’ eligibility to transit via London. With British Airways unavailable for comments, their airline sources in Bengaluru said: “Indian passport holders are not allowed into the UK without a valid visa even for transit.” Loveleen said lack of clarity on the travel situation has affected hundreds of people with their ticket money stuck with booking portals and airlines. “At present, there are only three troublefree options for Indians to reach Canada, which are Air India and Air Canada via Delhi and Etihad Airways via Abu Dhabi. People must avoid the London route to save themselves the trouble,” she said. Officials tracing Omicron infection source in JNVThe health department in Dakshina Kannada is leaving no stone unturned to find the source of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, that was reported among four children of a Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in the district. The epidemiologic data of children who tested positive for Covid-19, showed no clue of them or their parents having a history of travel to foreign countries, or neighbouring state of Kerala.  The department is looking from all angles, to find the actual source of the variant that infected children, who are all below 14.  Of the 79 primary contacts and 203 secondary contacts identified from the JNV in the district, only 13 people tested positive. Of the 12 samples sent for genome sequencing, four tested positive for the Omicron variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-clarity-on-rules-flyers-from-kia-choosing-london-transit-left-in-lurch/articleshow/88379966.cms||Petlee Peter

---||Bengaluru||With 5 scripts, can Konkani writing be standardised?||BENGALURU: Konkani, a language spoken by a large and scattered population, can be identified in the discrete forms of Mangalorean Konkani, Kochi Konkani, Portuguese Konkani, Siddi Konkani and Navayati, among a few others. While those speaking some of these dialects such as Navayati want them to be recognised as an independent language, they have been bunched together as active yet distinct styles of spoken and written Konkani. Jnanpith award winner Damodar Mauzo dwelt at length on the existence of more than five scripts for Konkani expression at an event on Saturday as poet and activist Melvyn Rodrigues set the historical context for each dialect’s individual emergence. Mauzo is fluent in Marathi, English, Portuguese and Konkani but he chose to write in his mother tongue because it had pulled through many dark days in the past — from being banned for 200 years by Portuguese rulers to withstanding Marathi assertion over its identity. Paraphrasing Sahitya Akademi awardee Shashi Deshpande, he said it’s not that he chose the language, but it chose him. Konkani is written in Kannada, Malayalam, Devanagari, Romi and Perso Arabic scripts. At the session titled ‘Konkani: One Language Multiple Scripts’, the linguistic forces of Mauzo, Rodrigues and Vivek Shanbag mapped each style’s prominence in detail and underlined the impossibility for Konkani’s standardisation. “The Christians’ style of writing Konkani is entirely different from the Hindus’ and it is very difficult for one to be able to comprehend the other,” Rodrigues and Shanbag said. The trio mulled over the idea of a ‘Konkani state’ where all native speakers could find their ultimate linguistic sanctuary and they pictured the peaceful intermingling of culturally diverse yet ethnically matched Konkanis from South India. Experts in their own right, Kaveri Ponnapa, Sayeegeetha Hegde and Shanbag engaged in conversations covering the culture and histories of Kodava Takk, Tulu and Konkani, respectively. Kodava poet Appanna’s works in Ponnapa’s new book are in Kodava Takk, written using Kannada script. Kodava Takk, the language of Kodavas, does not have a script of its own. “The words hold more meaning than we can express,” said Ponnapa as she finished reciting one of Annappa’s transliterated poems romanised by her. Advocating the use of English script to increase the popularity and familiarity of Tulu, Hegde supported the idea of romanisation of Kodava Takk by Ponappa. Since the Kannada script is commonly used for transliterating Tulu as well, Hegde pointed out at the loss of linguistic nuance and pronunciation caused by the practice. “Tulu is a language of vowels. We are better positioned using the Roman script for its promotion than any other,” the academician opined. The discussion was part of Bangalore Literature Festival.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/with-5-scripts-can-konkani-writing-be-standardised/articleshow/88379968.cms||Sanika Athavale
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Vehicle registration certificate transfer enough to get insurance cover||BENGALURU: The transfer of vehicle registration certificate (RC) from the owner to buyer is sufficient to pass on benefits, including motor insurance policy, a consumer court has ruled. The court also ordered an insurance firm to clear the accident claim of nearly Rs 6.6 lakh and pay a compensation of Rs 60,000 to a man who had purchased a car and got its RC transferred to his name but not the insurance policy. Mysuru resident Abishek R Das, 25, purchased a Hyundai Verna car from Sheeba Robert in October 2019. On October 10, Das got the RC transferred to his name and planned to transfer the insurance paper within the stipulated 14-day period. But on October 12, his acquaintance drove the car and caused a serious accident, entailing repair costs of over Rs 6 lakh. With the car’s policy under United India Insurance Company Ltd active from January 16, 2019, to January 15, 2020, in the name of its previous owner Robert, Das raised an accident claim. While a surveyor was sent to assess the car damage, the firm turned down the claim, stating there was no contract between Das and United India and it was not liable to pay. Das approached the I Additional District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission with a complaint against United India Insurance on August 7, 2020. His lawyer presented his case while the insurer’s Bengaluru representatives failed to appear. The insurer’s Chennai counterparts countered the case through their attorney who claimed that the complaint was false. The lawyer argued that the insurance policy was in the name of Sheeba, the first owner of the car, and Das was nowhere in the picture. However, the consumer court cited Supreme Court verdicts in similar cases where the second owner, as per section 157 of the Motor Vehicles Act, enjoys certain benefits, including insurance cover, if he transfers the RC to his name. The court pointed out the accident had taken place two days after the RC transfer. In its verdict on November 18, 2021, the court held that the insurer repudiating Das’ accident claim for an active policy is a clear service deficiency. It asked the insurer to pay Rs 6,58,432 with interest towards car repair and additional sums of Rs 25,000 (for causing inconvenience), Rs 25,000 (damages) and Rs 10,000 (court expenses).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rc-transfer-enough-to-get-insurance-cover/articleshow/88379969.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Campus calling: Bengaluru students to fly to Australia||BENGALURU: Ria Lodha, a Bengalurean, is among a handful of students who will finally fly to Australia beginning mid-December and January to complete their higher studies. She has been chosen by her university for Australia’s pilot programme to reopen borders and allow international students and skilled workers to enter the country in a phased manner. Australia had shut its doors on the world in March 2020. Almost all returning students are those who had started their education online. The Oz government’s plan begins with the three-month pilot that will bring back 500 international students in December 2021, and more in 2022. Ria and her peers have had a roller-coaster ride since they decided to study in Australia. Ria, who started pursuing masters in strategic communication management from a university in Melbourne in February 2021, was unsure if she will ever get a chance to shift from online to on-campus studies. “I began applying for courses in 2020 for the July intake. But when I saw no chance of the borders reopening, I decided to start studies in 2021,” she said, adding that the Australian government’s decision to reopen borders from December 1 filled her with joy, but a U-turn on the decision again pushed her plans into uncertainty. Australia, on November 22 had announced reopening its borders to skilled workers and international students from December 1. But it was postponed to December 15 because of the Omicron variant of Covid. “I received a mail on November 22 that I had been selected for the pilot programme and we did not have even a 12-hour window to book plane seats before they all were sold out. I was waiting for Australia to keep its pilot on track after reserving my tickets,” said Ria, who will fly out from New Delhi on Monday. Shashi (name changed), a techie from Hyderabad, is all set to travel to Brisbane to continue his masters that he began in February this year. “I want to stay anonymous because I am scared my plans will be jinxed,” he said. Benazir I Shaikh, proprietor, Transcend Institute of Foreign Studies in Belagavi, said several of her students are set to visit Australia in the coming weeks. She said Oz’s border measures have hit students’ careers. “Australia is best for management programmes and many such students have been deprived of career opportunities there. In two years, due to lack of students, plenty of job opportunities have emerged in Australia,” she said, cautioning that if Omicron cases increase, it might shut its borders again. “I suggest candidates opting for Australia as their destination to have a back-up in Canada or European countries,” she said. Bhavana Kumar, 24, is doing just that. Though she has an offer from an Australian university to start programme in February 2022, she is applying for Canadian varsities for their September 2022 intake. A city-based counsellor said Canada, the UK and other European countries have been gaining students lost by New Zealand and Australia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/campus-calling-students-to-fly-out-as-part-of-oz-pilot/articleshow/88379970.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Citizens spend Rs 30,000 to clear black spot||BENGALURU: Fifty members of a residents’ welfare association in Muneshwara Layout, southeast Bengaluru, joined hands with BBMP and Bescom to clear a black spot in their locality and get additional streetlights installed. They spent nearly Rs 30,000 from their pocket for the work. The layout has over 1,000 families. The black spot that was festering for many years on Kodichikkanahali bus stop road, lining Kodichikkanahalli to Muneshwara Layout, was cleared last week. Sunil Thankan, secretary, residents’ welfare association of Muneshwara Layout said: “The whole process took nearly two months but the black spot was there for over nine years. We started by clearing the silt and eventually took out the garbage. People had started throwing offal and other such things there.” The black spot had sprung up between two vacant lands. “The area did not have many streetlights and we had to request Bescom to help us as chain-snatching incidents and similar activities were on the rise,” Sunil said. Sushma MS, junior health inspector of Bommanahalli ward under which the layout comes, said most black spots occur when people from other wards or lanes dump garbage in one particular spot as no one wants to dirty the street they live in. “Citizens’ participation is key to maintain cleanliness in the city. When I was transferred to this ward I was informed about this black spot. I had put marshals on night duty and got the spot cleaned every morning but it continued to reappear. There were even times when I went to the spot myself to fine people for dumping garbage there,” she said. Yogeshwar K, joint secretary of the association and resident of the area for 15 years, said the black spot has been there since 2006. “It took many years for us to create an association and then find a few members who were willing to volunteer their time to improve the layout. It has taken a long time, but the results are worth it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/citizens-spend-30k-to-clear-black-spot/articleshow/88379971.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: BJP wants AIADMK to remain strong, says K Annamalai||It’s barely five months since he was made Tamil Nadu BJP president, but Kuppu samy Annamalai is already in the thick of Dravidian politics. He has taken potshots at ally AIADMK when it was in office and is now a strong critic of the ruling DMK. In an interview with Jaya Menon, the 37-year-old IPS officer-turned-politician talks about his party’s vision for TN and an ambitious strategy to win over its people by the 2026 assembly election. You have accused the DMK government of selective amnesia, lacking intellectual ability, and corruption. What else?Selective amnesia because they have forgotten what they spoke of when they were in the opposition. Corruption, as it has started rearing its head. Public is speaking about it. Then there is a lack of intellectual ability to formulate new schemes, implementing them and taking them to a logical end. In the past six months, I don’t see a strategy and vision for the state. How do you assess the performance of the seven-month-old government?I was clear that for the first six months I will not rate the government. It’s not right to rate it. But they have settled down now. I don’t see an overarching vision, how TN should be five years from now, 10 years from now. Will it be a manufacturing powerhouse? Will it be a service sector powerhouse? Will the agriculture sector get revolutionised? All I am seeing is ministers making the same complaints of anti-Delhi, anti-Modi. I don’t see a cooperative atmosphere despite the Centre trying to do its best. The CM is trying to build something, working hard, travelling and trying to do everything. But I believe his team is letting him down. Especially the group of ministers around him. Did the BJP offer advice as a friendly ally in ironing out glitches between EPS and OPS?The BJP works in multiple ways. There are some national secretaries, general secretaries in charge of a state. So, the feedback loop happens at multiple levels. Many times, I am not part of that loop. We have taken a conscious decision after J Jayalalithaa’s death that the AIADMK should remain strong, a senior party which has supported us through thick and thin. The BJP would want the AIADMK to remain strong. What role do you see Sasikala playing in the AIADMK in the future?One thing I am sure of, in Tamil Nadu politics, you cannot rule anybody out. You can always make a comeback. Most of the parties are cadre driven. At the end of the day, if the cadre decides they want a leader, it is purely based on that. I don’t want to make personal comments of pluses and minuses of Sasikala, but I am a firm believer that for the betterment of the state, in the long run, all good leaders should come together and the AIADMK should remain strong. That is one important pole in Tamil Nadu politics and the pole should not disintegrate. Has the BJP tried to mediate between Sasikala, EPS and OPS?That is much above my pay grade. I am not really sure ... Different communication channels were at work. Is the PMK part of the NDA or not?As of now, they are part of the NDA. That is what they have stated too. We maintain a good relationship. I am sure the PMK will look at the larger picture of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. I am not giving a lot of traction to what the two leaders (EPS and PMK leader S Ramadoss) spoke. Do you see the DMK and the BJP coming together in future?Nothing can be ruled out. But the BJP and the DMK have become ideologically so far apart … the language we speak, the language that the ministers speak. The DMK’s vision and our vision for Tamil Nadu and India is divergent. I don’t think that (coming together) can happen. After Kamaraj, the national parties, both the Congress and the BJP have lost out in TN due to lack of strong leaders in state politics. Do you agree?Tamil Nadu politics is getting into a zone. Of course, personalities matter. But it doesn’t matter like it did in the 1960s to 1980s, especially now after social media. There was a time when personalities were carefully created and presented. More than personality, ideology matters. I see M K Karunanidhi as a politician with a strong ideology along with a personality. MGR had a strong ideology and personality. For the BJP, ideology trumps personalities. Ideologies come first and then a presentable personality who can take the ideology to the masses. Kamaraj was a man of character, vision, humility, living for the betterment of people that propelled him and made him greater than the Congress itself. The DMK is a party without an ideology now. It has deviated from its founding principles. Would you term Rajini’s decision to back out a loss for politics in TN?Hundred percent it is a huge loss for politics in TN. He was promising something different, visionary. The two speeches he delivered about youngsters and the educated coming into politics, trying not to bring religion into politics but spirituality, some kind of decorum into politics were significant. Over the years, the DMK and the AIADMK have strengthened their grip on TN. Whose grip do you intend to loosen first?If you look at the votes, this time the DMK has got 33.5%. This is the only ruling party with less popular vote than any other leader in any other state. This means 67% of the voters did not want the DMK. Without trying to break any party — they say the BJP is trying to break the AIADMK — I see other avenues where the BJP can grow without breaking anybody. I want to see the 10% neutral voters, who voted for the DMK, coming to the BJP. There is a lot of hard work to be done by us. We have to strengthen our booths, increase our reaching ability and social media presence and counter the false narrative. I have set 2026 as the BJP’s time. People ask aren’t you hurting AIADMK by this statement … for every party, the legitimate aspiration is to come to power at some point. What is your strategy to become the ‘ruling party’ in TN?If you look at the average votes polled for the AIADMK, they got about 84,000 votes in every constituency they contested this time. Wherever the BJP contested in their alliance, they got 62,000 votes in about 20 constituencies. All of our candidates were contesting for the first or second time. The BJP has made a great start. Candidates do matter. Next time they contest, they will do much better. The more votes we get, the more votes our ideology gets, and I see the party growing phenomenally. For the first time, we had a good fight. We wanted the AIADMK to contest more. We accepted seats, many of them offered by the AIADMK. Maybe we didn’t want to contest 10 of the 20 seats. But we didn’t have an option. A lot of tactical compromises were made to give AIADMK the best chance to face the DMK. We didn’t want to do a hard bargain and spoil the AIADMK’s chances. We felt the fight was between EPS and Stalin.]||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/bjp-chief-wants-eps-ops-sasi-to-join-hands-to-strengthen-aiadmk/articleshow/88379973.cms||Jaya Menon

The sewage water overflows from the inspection holes, floods the streets, and enters houses. In some of the houses, sewage water has also backed up into the toilets leaving them unusable. Around 16 families have been affected due to sewage entering homes while around 40 families have been affected after the streets are flooded with sewage mixed with water. A few other neighbourhoods too face similar hassle every time it rains. Chrompet got an underground sewage system around eight years ago. But the lines started to leak at many places leading to sewage getting mixed in stormwater and sumps. The erstwhile Pallavaram municipality had flagged several illegal connections too. There are four sewage pumping stations, but people say that these are inadequate as the problem continues. R Narayanan, president, Nethaji Nagar Residents Welfare Association said "pumping it out is difficult because people from other streets will complain. It does not percolate into the ground as groundwater level is high. The encroachments near Nemilichery lake are one of the reasons for the sewage overflow in low lying areas." He said that residents suffered a similar situation during continuous rain last month. S M Govindarajan, president, Federation of Residents Welfare Associations of Tambaram Corporation said the officials visited the spot based on our complaint. "The corporation will have to build more pumping stations and sewage treatment plants." “The state government should allot additional funds to the new corporation to take up the underground sewage work on priority.” Tambaram corporation commissioner M Elangovan said "We are working out temporary and permanent solutions for the problem. Repairs are being done using our funds. A team has studied each of the locations that were affected and a proposal has been submitted to the government to revamp the underground sewage network. The number of houses has increased tremendously in the last ten years."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sewage-enters-chromepet-houses-due-to-poor-drain/articleshow/88379974.cms||---

So far, 81 passengers were found infected on arrival. All their samples were sent to for genome sequencing to find out if they were infected with the new variants, Omicron. Results of 13 samples are back. Only one was found infected with Omicron and eight were infected by the Delta variant and four were categorised as 'not-in-sequence' (meaning their samples will be repeated). Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu health department in its labs found out S-gene drop in 33 of these patients. "All of them had mild infections and are doing well. They will be discharged once they test negative after seven or eight days," said Ma Subramanian, health minister.  On Sunday, a total of 610 tested positive and four died of Covid-19 in the state. Chennai reported the maximum number of new cases (129). The capital city did not report any deaths after five months. Despite increased testing in the district, the Test Positivity Rate (TPR) is still under one percent. It is slightly higher compared to the state's TPR of 0.6%.

Forty polyclinics and four diagnostic laboratories will also be established at an allocated cost of 88 crore. The civic body officials have proposed that the UHWCs function from 4 PM onwards till night. Currently the existing urban primary healthcare health centres take patients from 9 in the morning till 4 PM. “In most places, we are planning to convert the land used for Amma mini clinics as sites for UHWCs,” an official told TOI. The city currently has 140 UPHCs and 192 Amma Mini Clinics. However, latter is only used for vaccination purposes now. Officials said each UHWC will be set up at a cost of Rs 25 lakh and will be manned by five staff, medical doctors, sanitary nurses, multi-purpose health workers, and two hospital workers. “We have received the funds from Union Government and the land identification and staff recruitment process is underway,” said a senior corporation official. Officials said the UHWC’s primary aim is to to provide care in pregnancy, childbirth, neonatal, and infant healthcare services. While there is no proper database of a population registry for health, the UHWC aims to change that with its IT services. The Central Government has directed all the states to establish a ‘wellness room’ for creating a health database of patients visiting the UHWC. “It will also be involved in services like population enumeration, empanelment, and non-communicable disease screening,” officials said, adding that the 40 polyclinics would provide care for common ophthalmic and ENT problems, and basic oral healthcare.  The Centre has also said that the time taken for care at the UHWCs must not be more than 30 minutes and the medical officers must also refer patients to tertiary hospitals Meanwhile, the diagnostic labs in the city will facilitate screening for all the crucial communicable diseases under the National Health Programmes (Tuberculosis, Leprosy, Hepatitis, HIV- AIDS, Malaria Kala-azar, Filariasis, and other vector-borne diseases) and mental disorders and cancers. A section of these 140 UHWCs are expected to be opened by May 2022, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/healthcare-set-to-get-a-boost-in-city/articleshow/88379976.cms||Omjasvin M D

A resident of NTR Street in Kodambakkam, SV Radhakrishnan, raised a complaint on the portal of city corporation on December 13, saying sewage was stagnated in their street’s stormwater drain ever since the November rains and it was leaking into their underground sump. On December 17, the civic body replied, saying the complaint was ‘attended’ and they closed it. However, the residents said the issue remains unattended and sewage continues to be stagnated in the drains and leak into the sumps. Radhakrishnan again raised a complaint with the Corporation, questioning how they could close the complaint without attending to the issue, for which they again replied saying ‘estimates are being prepared to solve the issue.’ He has raised the complaint for the third time. “Sewage stagnation in drains is not just leading to leakage in the sump but also is causing mosquito menace,” Radhakrishnan said. M Sathyamoorthy, another resident, said nobody even visited the spot. A corporation assistant engineer said they have sent the estimates and new drains must be constructed here due to gradient issues. “We cannot block connecting drains now as the rainy season is yet to get over,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/corporation-closes-unattended-plaint-on-stagnant-sewage/articleshow/88379978.cms||Omjasvin M D

The tribunal also deducted 10 % from the compensation as the victim was not wearing a helmet. According to the petition by the victim’s family Ramanan was riding his motorcycle along Jawaharlal Nehru road near Koyambedu bridge, when a rashly driven school bus hit the bike from behind. The accident happened on November 1, 2017. The family sought a compensation of 50 lakh. In response, the insurer submitted that the vehicle had permit to ply only in Kancheepuram and Thiruvallur and use of the vehicle in Chennai is breach of policy conditions. The tribunal held that there was contributory negligence on part of the victim as he was not wearing helmet. The school management contended that the vehicle required repair works for which it was sent to Perungudi and was returning to Thiruvallur through Koyambedu when the accident happened. The 23-year-old deceased was working as a marketing engineer at a private company. Based on various factors including loss of dependency, loss of love and affection for the family members and other factors, the tribunal arrived at an amount of 23.3 lakh as compensation. After deducting 2.3 lakh for contributory negligence, the tribunal held that a compensation of 21.04 lakh be paid to the victim’s family. The tribunal held that since the bus is insured, the insurer can pay the compensation after deducting the contributory negligence and recover the same from the school management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/insurer-of-school-bus-asked-to-pay-21l-to-accident-victim-kin/articleshow/88379979.cms||---

---||Chennai||TN’s Manav in India U-19 WC squad||Chennai: After a gap of close to six years, Tamil Nadu will have a representation --- in Manav Parakh --- in the Indian U-19 World Cup squad. Manav was included in the squad that was announced on Sunday evening for the event that will take place in the West Indies from January 14 to February 5. The last time a Tamil Nadu player made the U19 squad for the World Cup was Washington Sundar when he made it to the 2016 event in Bangladesh.Allrounder Manav’s rise to the pinnacle of U-19 cricket has been as steady as the off-spin he bowls and his batting. The 18-year-old has risen through the ranks playing age-group cricket for the state. “Be it playing in the U-14 category or leading Tamil Nadu in the U-16 Vijay Merchant Trophy in 2018, the aim always was to do well in all facets of the game,” Manav told TOI. In the Vijay Merchant Trophy Manav scored 408 runs in 7 outings and also bagged 23 wickets. However, a knee injury during that season saw him miss the subsequent 12 months in order to recover. The subsequent Covid-19 pandemic only delayed his return to the field by another year.As Manav made a comeback this year, his strong work ethic and self-belief brought him the rewards. “The last two years have made me stronger mentally. It can be hard for someone my age to miss two years of cricket. But the belief I had in myself helped me wade through the tough times,” Manav recalled. Manav, who plays for UFCC (T Nagar) in the TNCA league, thanked his family for being a pillar of support in the last couple of years. “My father – who runs a business --- and my mother never allowed negativity to creep in. My brother Rohit --- who plays for Swaraj CC --- too kept things positive,” said Manav, a Loyola College student. If one looks at Manav’s performance this season --- across Vinoo Mankad Trophy, Challenger Trophy and the triangular series --- he has 21 wickets from 13 outings with best figures of 5 for 25. With the bat, Manav has 154 runs. “Manav has a great game awareness. His economy of 3.99 this year proves how he reads the opposition batsmen and keeps things simple,” said S Sharath, chairman of U-19 selection committee. With the India U-19 team going with a set top-order, Manav’s opportunities with the bat became limited.As far as his idols go, Manav didn’t have to look too far. “R Ashwin and Washington have been two players I have admired over the years. Both Ashwin and Washington keep things simple and are able to raise their game during crunch situations. I would love to have a chat with them if given an opportunity as it will do wonders to my game,” said Manav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tns-manav-in-india-u-19-wc-squad/articleshow/88379981.cms||Prasad RS

He also asked the party to initiate a fresh membership drive to attract more youth and women into the party. While an official notification for the local body polls is yet to be issued, indications are that an announcement is likely to be made after Pongal, the harvest festival celebrated in mid-January with much fanfare in Tamil Nadu, for holding the elections sometime in February.  Addressing a meeting of the DMK district secretaries, MPs and MLAs here on Saturday, Stalin asked the party machinery to be ready to face the polls and ensure 100% victory for DMK. “This government has got a good name from the people on account of its performance so far. And people are willing to back the DMK in the elections. But there should not be any room for complacency and hence asked party functionaries to get into the act soon,” multiple sources told TOI. Turning his attention towards strengthening the party further in the state, Stalin also asked those present at the meeting to begin a membership drive to bring more people, especially the youth and women, into the DMK fold. “Our president asked us to work hard, so as to make at least 30% of the voters in the state to be DMK members,” the sources added. According to the sources, party president Stalin asked DMK functionaries to strive to add at least 25,000 new members into the party fold in every assembly segment in the state. This way close to 60 lakh new members, especially youngsters and women, could become part of the DMK. “There was a general discussion about the urban local body polls. While the court had asked the state to conduct the polls by the end of January, 2022, the elections could be held in due course to fulfil the obligations,” senior DMK leader and Rajya Sabha member T K S Elangovan said, while adding that the inner party elections could be held only after the urban local body polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/stalin-urges-partymen-to-gear-up-for-urban-local-body-polls/articleshow/88379982.cms||D Govardan

Residents said the encroachment forces them to take a longer route to schools on Velachery MRTS Road. On Sunday morning, a group of residents blocked the traffic on Bazaar Main Road holding placards to attract attention of the authorities. Police reached the scene and pacified them after which they dispersed. In one of the placards, the residents also had the notice from the revenue inspector of Pallikaranai, dated January 23, 2020 which confirms the allegations of the locals. “Now, it is going to be about two years since the notice.

---||India||Army helping 700 Afghan personnel present in country on all fronts||NEW DELHI: From psychological counselling, extension of visas by six months and proposed scholarships for further studies to facilitating immigration to other countries or even their return to Afghanistan, the Indian Army is providing all possible help to the around 700 Afghan military officers, soldiers and cadets in the country. The 700 Afghan military personnel, who also have about 100 `dependents’ with them, were attending training courses at different Indian military academies and establishments when the Taliban took over their landlocked country in mid-August. India was annually providing the fledgling Afghan National Army with around 1,000 vacancies in its various institutions, ranging from the Indian Military Academy at Dehradun, Officers’ Training Academy at Chennai and National Defence Academy at Khadakvasla to the Army War College and Infantry School at Mhow, School of Artillery at Deolali and College of Military Engineering at Pune. On December 11, for instance, 40 Afghan gentlemen cadets passed out of the IMA. “The Army has been taking proactive measures, in consultation with the defence and external affairs ministries, to help the Afghan military personnel stranded in India,” a senior officer said. With the Afghan embassy in New Delhi itself in dire straits, with no support from the new ‘Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan’, the scheduled training of its military personnel in various Indian military institutions is continuing to ensure their security. “Psychological support through counselling is also being provided to those trainees under stress over the developments in their home country. The ones who have passed out are residing in India under their own arrangements due to the Afghan embassy’s inability to help or fund them. There is the danger of them falling prey to inimical agencies,” another officer said. The Army-MEA combine has worked to extend their visas by six months, while assistance is also being provided to those who want to immigrate to other countries. “Some Afghan nationals, for instance, have applied for special immigration visas to Canada,” he said. The Indian authorities are also facilitating ticketing via Iranian airlines Mahan Air to military personnel keen on returning home. “Nine Afghan personnel, for instance, were sent to Kabul on December 10,” he said. The Army has also taken up the case with the MEA for absorption of some Afghan personnel, who want to stay back in India after completion of their military courses, in graduate and post-graduate courses under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme and Indian Council of Cultural Relations (ICCR) scholarships. India trains officers and cadets of many other countries ranging from Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to Vietnam, Myanmar and Tajikistan, but the Afghans constituted the bulk of the foreign cadets till now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-helping-700-afghan-personnel-present-in-country-on-all-fronts/articleshow/88380004.cms||Rajat Pandit

Within minutes after the death of Harjit Kaur, 74, her family members contacted Dadhichi Dehdan Samiti, a voluntary organisation, and the eye department of IGIMS to retrieve her corneas for transplant to other persons facing visual disability. When the team reached, it failed to get proper help from the private hospital in carrying out the retrieval. However, the IGIMS team finally succeeded in retrieving the corneas by creating space in an ambulance outside the hospital. On getting information, the DM constituted a three-member team comprising additional chief medical officer of Patna Avinash Kumar Singh, official of civil surgeon office Awadhesh Kumar and labour superintendent Manish Kumar to probe the matter. The team found the hospital guilty of neglect, non-cooperation and disregard to human values. The DM said the denial of facility by the hospital not only stood against the medical ethics and the noble cause of organ donation, but also showed disrespect to the departed soul. He directed the civil surgeon to issue show-cause notice to the hospital and take proper action against it. The head of Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, IGIMS, Dr Bibhuti Prasan Sinha said it was obligatory on part of any hospital to cooperate in organ donation mission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dm-orders-action-against-private-hospital-for-denying-facility-to-retrieve-cornea/articleshow/88377777.cms||VK Tripathi

---||Mangaluru||Sea turtle nesting site found at Kodi Beach||Udupi: Local fishermen have noticed a sea turtle nesting site near the lighthouse at Kodi Beach in Kundapur on Saturday. Following this, the forest department with the support of NGOs and locals, are monitoring the place, and enclosures have been built at the spot. Kundapur DCF Ashish Reddy told TOI that nesting has already begun, and it is expected to go on till the end of January. The forest department will be monitoring the nesting sites round the clock. The local fishing community and NGOs will be part of the conservation efforts like last year, he said. Last year too, the nests were noticed from mid-December. “It is important to safeguard the nesting sites till the hatchlings emerge. The beach cleaning activity seems to have had a positive impact, and locals have joined hands in the conservation efforts. Last year, due to coordinated efforts, we saw an increase in the number of nests,” he said. Santhosh Kodi, a mathematics teacher working in the Morarji Desai Residential School, Bramhavar, and a volunteer of the beach cleaning activity of the Clean Kundapura Project, said that like last year, it was fisherman Babu Mogaveera who first spotted the nesting site near the lighthouse. “We are suspecting that there are around 80 to 100 eggs at the site. Last year, out of 11 hatcheries, around 250 hatchlings made it to the sea. The weather condition played spoilsport, and many eggs were destroyed. We hope this season we get to see more hatchlings getting back to the sea,” he said. In a first-of-its-kind in-situ conservation campaign in the state taken up last year, the overall hatching rate was around 50-60% from about 11 nesting sites. Reasons for the poor hatching rate could be that the female that has laid the eggs was not fully mature, and all the eggs may not have been fully fertilised. In addition, due to high tide, the nests got wet, and a few eggs had a fungal infection. NGOs, including FSL India and Clean Kundapura Project have joined hands in the conservation efforts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/sea-turtle-nesting-site-found-at-kodi-beach/articleshow/88377810.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

---||Vijayawada||After VAT & excise cut, new liquor prices at par with other states||Vijayawada: The latest slash in value added tax and additional excise duty has brought liquor prices in the state down to the pre-YSRC regime, even making the prices of some brands cheaper when compared to neighbouring Telangana. The state government has claimed that the rationalisation of taxes is to prevent spurious liquor and Non-Duty Paid Liquor (NDPL) coming in from other states. Soon after coming to power, the YSRC government announced a new liquor policy by taking over retail outlets. It was announced that the number of outlets would be reduced in a phased manner and by the end of the fifth year, there would be no liquor shop other than at a few star hotels. The government also announced that prices of liquor would be increased. After the new policy came into force, the state witnessed a spike in arrack brewing and NDPL from other states. Though the government constituted the Special Enforcement Bureau for implementation of its prohibition policy, little progress was made in that direction. On the other hand, the government started to lose revenue from liquor sale. Realising the ground level situation, the government reduced the tax on two occasions. Citing the same reason that arrack and NDPL continue to come into the state, the government slashed prices for the third time. The state government in the latest GO claimed that consumption has reduced by 37 per cent because of its policy intervention. Meanwhile, tippers are happy with the latest decision of the government and were seen celebrating the rate cuts that came into effect on Sunday. Some even went to the extent of giving ‘harati’ and breaking coconuts in front of wine shops. Celebrations were seen at a government-run retail liquor store at Singarayakonda in Prakasam district where people chanted ‘slokas’ and conducted a ‘puja’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/after-vat-excise-cut-new-liquor-prices-at-par-with-other-states/articleshow/88377932.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, in a press release, said, “Pavan K Verma, with his immense knowledge and political experience has worked ardently towards the betterment of people. His able guidance will help AITC reach greater heights and continue the fight to protect every Indian citizen’s democratic rights.” Varma, who was earlier an adviser to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, was expelled from the JD(U) along with the party’s then national vice-president Prashant Kishor (who is now the AITC’s poll strategist) on January 29, 2020 on charges of openly criticizing the JD(U)’s decision to support the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Population Register (NPR). Varma was JD(U)’s national general secretary at the time of his expulsion from Bihar’s ruling party. Diplomat-turned politician Varma was earlier elected to the Rajya Sabha in 2014 as a JD(U) candidate from Bihar. “Nitish Kumar gave more honour to Pavan K Varma than what he deserved. Making public a letter addressed to the party president and mentioning certain private talks in such a letter, show that the party’s discipline was not acceptable to Varma. The party runs on collective responsibility, but some people become victims of confusion that the party runs on their ideology,” JD(U) national secretary general K C Tyagi had said in a written statement issued soon after the expulsion of Varma and Prashant Kishor. Earlier on November 23 this year, Varma had joined the AITC in presence of party chief Mamata Banerjee during her trip to the national capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pavan-k-varma-appointed-vice-president-of-trinamool/articleshow/88377867.cms||Madan Kumar

The city, known mostly for its boutique heritage properties, is on the radar of both national chains and local brands. Some of the investment is focused outside the city, near the blue-tagged Paradise Beach area, but heritage properties in the French Quarter are also in focus. GRT Hotels & Resorts’s Radisson Resort Pondicherry Bay is a five-acre property comprising 46 chalets and five private pool villas overlooking Eden beach, one of ten Indian beaches to get the coveted Blue Flag status. The soft launch has happened and its banquet venues are booked for weddings through next year. "Our focus is to highlight Puducherry’s Franco-Tamil heritage both through the design of the rooms as well as through food and beverage," says Shubhangi N, GM, sales and marketing, GRT Hotels & Resorts. Airbnb search data shows that Puducherry is among the top five destination choices for domestic tourists between December 1 and January 31. ITC’s Zubin Songadwala says: "We are aggressively pursuing an asset-right expansion strategy of owned and managed properties. Puducherry is on our radar as a unique heritage destination. We will look for an alliance or a management tie-up, which can fit into one of our brands." ITC’s brands include boutique lifestyle brand Mementos, curated travel brand Storii and Welcomheritage. The city’s home-grown hospitality brand HiDesign, which owns the beach-front luxury hotel The Promenade and the heritage property Le Dupleix, is also looking to add properties. "We are beginning work on a new property similar to Le Dupleix and lots of add-ons and upgrades to existing properties," says founder Dilip Kapur. City hoteliers say Puducherry’s hospitality industry suffered through the pandemic. For nearly 18 months, the tourist flow was scanty and hotels ran empty. But things have changed for the better from September. "We are seeing a rush of bookings from September-October and these are all domestic tourists," says Lalit Verma, who runs the 22-bedroom Aurodhan Heritage Guest House. City hotels are already seeing bookings through weekends as the peak rush period of Christmas-New Year approaches. Between July and November, the city received more than 6 lakh visitors. That’s nearly one-third of the 2017 peak when 16.6 lakh tourists visited the city, including 1.3 lakh from overseas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rooms-with-a-view-investments-return-to-pondy-with-tourists/articleshow/88378372.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

With 6,428 voters of the total 11,616 exercising their voting rights at 41 polling booths spread across eight buildings of the varsity’s campuses, voter turnout stood at 55.34 %. As many as 27 candidates were in the fray. It was for the first time that the campus witnessed presence of so many political leaders right from BJP city unit office-bearers, MLAs, even corporators to those from the Congress camp and former student leaders in an election which otherwise remains restricted as a university affair. The stakes in this election were high with BJP city unit president Vijay Shah issuing an official mandate from the party in odds with the saffron camp of MSU referred largely as ‘team MSU’. Large hoardings, ‘shamianas’ where snacks and refreshments were served, campaigning material like printed t-shirts, caps that supporters of candidates adorned made it seemed as if it was an election for some assembly constituency. For the educated registered graduates, who simply came to exercise their voting right with their families, it seemed like a fun fair, a re-union or a picnic spot. A candidate from Faculty of Arts had even made arrangement of wheel-chairs and ambulance for the elderly registered voters. The polls ended peacefully except for a couple of controversies. At Faculty of Commerce, a candidate contesting from Faculty of Law alleged that a former syndicate member, who was moving around as an election observer, was openly campaigning for a rival candidate. After intervention of police, the heated arguments between the duo calmed down. Faculty of Science too witnessed some anxious moments when a female’s photo was seen in the electoral list of Faculty of Commerce instead of a male voter’s photo. Similarly, election officer had to intervene when objections were raised on photos being clicked in the election for the one seat of Faculty of Education & Psychology which was held at Faculty of Law. At some polling booths, the university’s rule of not allowing mobile/ electronic gadgets inside the polling booths went for a toss. The sealed ballot boxes have been shifted to university head office where counting will take place on Monday noon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/first-high-pitched-poll-battle-on-msu-campus/articleshow/88378097.cms||---
---||Kolkata||New Town to get smart steel fences||Kolkata: The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) is phasing out the green coloured bamboo fences from the road sides and road medians in New Town and replacing them with designer steel fences to be in sync with the green smart city look. Plans are on to install radio frequency identification (RFID) readers in these steel fences to track whether the waste carrying vehicles were collecting the daily generated waste at the scheduled timings everyday. Officials said these bamboo railings get damaged easily and get uprooted following heavy rains and storms. In some places pedestrians even go over the bamboo fences to cross the streets. A few years back traffic police had requested the authorities to replace these bamboo fences with permanent steel fencing. The first of such designer permanent steel fences were built at the roundabout near Eco Space a few years back as a prototype. The authorities then decided to roll out the plan in other areas in consultation with traffic police. Officials said the bamboo fences off the main arterial road and median dividers will be fully removed in phases with designer steel fencing. In the next phase once the steel fences are placed, the plan is to tag RFID readers with the fences and waste carrying vehicles. “The RFID tagged fences will detect the vehicles and will send alert messages to the control room to check whether the vehicles were properly coming and collecting the daily generated waste from the waste bins and other places of the township,” said an official. The authorities had earlier planned to set up such IOT enabled smart fencing on a 170-km stretch of the main arterial road in New Town from Mahisbathan box bridge to Biswa Bangla gate The authorities are also working on plans to have a smart dustbin monitoring system. The plan is to have 50 selected dustbins of 240 liters’ capacity each off the main arterial road in New Town to ensure real-time 24 hours monitoring. The waste bins will have level sensing to alert you once optimum level of waste is reached.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-to-get-smart-steel-fences/articleshow/88378541.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Primary investigation by Pandesara police revealed that the attack was over old enmity between the deceased and the accused. According to the police, deceased duo, Shivshankar alias Bhola Jaiswal, a resident of Radheshayam nagar and Pravin Solanki, a resident of Gayatri nagar society in Pandesara were friends with Bunty alias Sonu Shukla (23) a resident of Suman-Srmuti Aavas in Pandesara, a native of Uttar Pradesh and working as a land broker and a complainant in the case. Shukla told the cops that the three friends would meet each other regularly. On Saturday evening too, the trio gathered at around 7pm along with two other friends namely, Ashutosh Pathak and Arvind Rai, near Ashutosh’s school at Jai Jawan Jai Kishan society and after sometime were standing near Annapurna restaurant in the same area. At around 8.45pm, while all the friends were chatting, the two accused — Kishan Singh and his friend Vishal — reached the spot on a bike. They called Pravin aside and were talking to him. As it was time to go home, Bhola called Pravin when suddenly Kishan started abusing both Pravin and Bhola. He also attacked Pravin with a knife, and stabbed him multiple times. In the meantime, the other accused, Vishal, brought big ladle from a Chinese food cart and hit Pravin on his head. When Bhola tried to intervene and save Pravin’s life, the accused stabbed him too.

A trip to a mall in Coimbatore seven years ago gave them their big startup idea and Juicy Chemistry was born. "A salesperson tried to market a ‘natural/organic’ skincare product to Megha and it piqued my interest," remembers Asher. The couple found that the ingredients list told a different story. "A few ingredients were natural but most were petroleum-based or synthetic. As someone whose family business was in industrial auto lube, these ingredients were familiar to me," he says. "Seeing them in a ‘natural/organic’ product was surprising." The husband-wife team thought about a line of organic personal care products without lab-grown ingredients. Juicy Chemistry is now certified organic by Ecocert France, the largest organic products testing body in the world. With no background in the beauty industry – Pritesh is a business management graduate from Griffith University in Australia and Megha has a degree in journalism from the same university – the couple’s venture had a slow start. Juicy Chemistry was started with a seed capital of `5,000 and took five years to be registered, but it is now attracting investor interest. Its first fundraise last year brought in $650,000 in an angel funding round from Amit Nanavati. Since then things have gotten juicier. In March this year, Juicy Chemistry raised $6.3 million (`45.7 crore) as part of its Series A funding round, which was led by Belgium-based family fund Verlinvest and Manash Lifestyle, the holding company that runs the online shopping portal Purple.com. "We will have a Series B round of around $20 million by Diwali 2022," says Asher. "We are ramping up products and production as well as retail footprint. Juicy Chemistry’s current annual revenue is `35 crore-`40 crore and we want to get to `100 crore in the next 18 months," he adds. The money could not have come at a better time. Juicy Chemistry’s factory in Coimbatore, which currently makes 1.5 lakh units a month, is being expanded. "Production will hit 7 lakh units a month in the next 18 months," says Asher. The brand, which currently retails on Nykaa, Purple.com, Amazon and other online platforms, is building an offline presence. "We’re in talks with Nykaa and Purple.com as well as other big retailers for exclusive brand outlets or store-in-store presence," he adds. That footprint is important as Juicy Chemistry expands its products to include serums and colour cosmetics. "We currently have 100 products and we rely on oil-based phytonutrients. The critical segments we were not present in earlier were serums and actives." Juicy Chemistry recently launched seven products in the serum category. It is entering the cosmetic segment with ‘certified organic’ eyeliners, eyeshadows, foundation, colour correctors, and lip products. The brand is also present in Australia, Singapore, UAE, South Africa, Nepal and France.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/their-chemistry-brings-them-juicy-returns/articleshow/88378400.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

What attracts them are operating costs 20% lower than in other tier-2 towns such as Coimbatore and local talent that’s happy to stay on once hired. The region’s evangelists also report an increased interest among professionals from Madurai working in Chennai and Bengaluru to return home and start their own ventures. Engineering and MBA institutes such as Thiagarajar College of Engineering and MEPCO (Sivakasi) are nurseries of talent that they hope to tap into. Chennai-based tech startup GoFrugal recently launched a 15,000 sqft office in Madurai employing 90 people and plans to hire 60 more. GoFrugal founder Kumar Vembu says they wanted to be closer to south TN’s booming business hub. HR tech firm Neeyamo, which has a centre at an Elcot IT park in Madurai, recently opened a 65,000 sqft office and plans to hire around 1,200 staff in the year ahead. "We create cutting-edge products here, same as in Chennai or Silicon Valley. It’s not just data entry or sweatshop work," says its CEO, Rangarajan Seshadri. "We pay them well enough to stop them from migrating to metros, but we don’t over pay to spoil the market dynamics," he adds. However, the region’s entrepreneurs say luring investors and clients to the region is an uphill task given poor international air connectivity and public perception of "Madurai’s notoriety". Madurai also suffers from lack of visibility. Not many know of Great Innovus, for instance, launched by serial entrepreneur Kalyana Sundaram. He shunned a US job to build numerous tech startups (one of whose IPs was acquired by Blackberry) from the garage of his home. The IT services firm now serves more than 300 global clients including Honeywell, BestBuy and L&T with a team of around 150. "I considered different cities such as Chennai and Bengaluru to start up, but the traffic put me off. I can travel anywhere in Madurai in 10 minutes," says Kalyana Sundaram. "We may not have IITs and NITs, but the tier-2 colleges nurture great talent that can be molded to our needs," he adds. While the city has long hosted conventional business firms such as Madura Coats, Thiagarajar Mills and the TVS Group, the emergence of IT firms HCL Tech and Honeywell in the mid-2000s as large employers sowed the seeds for tech proliferation. Government agencies kept pace with Elcot setting up two IT parks at Vadapalanji and Ilanthaikulam. In addition, the Gangaikondan IT park in Tirunelveli is a stone’s throw away. HCL Tech currently employs 5,400 people and the Madurai centre serves global customers in Cloud Native, .Net, Full Stack, and other modern tech. Srimathi Shivashankar, corporate VP, HCL Technologies, says they will continue to hire engineers and other talent in the city.  For first-time tech entrepreneurs, the city has the technology business incubator (TBI) of Thiagarajar College. Established in 2014, TBI currently hosts 25 tech startups across domains. S Balaji, faculty coordinator, says 18 of these startups were incubated after Covid-19 and that there has been a rise in inquiries from techies who wish to return to Madurai. Sivarajah Ramanathan, founder of Nativelead Foundation, who engages with policymakers, says Madurai needs an image makeover. "More government-backed centres of excellence in traditional strengths such as agri tech and in emerging areas will help," he adds. Ebenezer Daniel, founder of tech-powered two-wheeler financier Orange Retail and a native of the region, says "the talent here has the right attitude and a zeal to learn new skills and excel." But Great Innovus’ Sundaram says finding talent in niche areas is a pain point. "Raising funds is also tricky since most investors ask us to shift to Chennai," he adds, noting that real estate prices today almost equal Coimbatore’s. I A S Balamurugan, co-founder of Anicut Capital, says Madurai may have missed out on new-age digital ventures but that’s changing. "It is more of a reputation management issue and a question of breaking the shackles," he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/madurai-as-silicon-valley/articleshow/88378353.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Patna||Bihar: University employees to launch agitation over salary delay||PATNA: More than 25,000 employees of the universities and colleges in Bihar on Sunday threatened to launch a statewide agitation in the first week of January if their salaries and other emoluments were not paid without any further delay. The decision to launch an indefinite agitation was taken at a meeting of the Bihar State University and College Employees’ Federation held here on Sunday under the presidentship of Ganga Prasad Jha. The federation expressed its grave concern at the recent deaths of several employees due to lack of medical facilities. The employees of almost all the universities in the state have not been paid their salaries since September this year. Worst sufferers are the retired employees who have not been paid their pension for the last four months, it said. The federation condemned the alleged apathetic attitude of the state government towards the university staff and demanded immediate release of funds for payment of salaries and pension to the working and retired staff. The federation decided that agitating employees will stage dharna at their respective institutions on January 7 and go on mass casual leave and gherao the vice-chancellors on January 18 and 19. Then, they would remain on strike from February 1 to 4 and stage a massive demonstration before the state legislature during its budget session. And, if their demands were not conceded even by that time, the employees will go on indefinite strike from April 5. Meanwhile, Bihar Secondary Teachers’ Association president Kedar Nath Pandey and general secretary Shatrughna Prasad Singh have urged the education minister to fix the pay of teachers with 15% increment only after removal of existing anomalies in earlier pay fixation. They pointed out that the calculator for pay fixation has reportedly been prepared and now the pay would be fixed as per pay metrics. Hence, it is necessary that the existing anomalies be removed before the new pay fixation. Both the education minister and the chairman of the legislative council have already made an assurance to this effect, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/university-employees-to-launch-agitation-over-salary-delay/articleshow/88377727.cms||B K Mishra

The association members, led by their president A K Singh Thakur, submitted a memorandum to CM Nitish Kumar’s secretariat on Saturday, mentioning about non-payment of salaries and pension for the last four months. Thakur said several pleas to Raj Bhavan and CM’s secretariat in the past went unaddressed. “The teachers and pensioners are solely dependent on their monthly salaries and pension. The university has passed the buck on the government saying that the latter has not released grants to the university,” he said. PPU registrar Jitendra Kumar said the university would make payments only after getting grants from the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ppu-teachers-threaten-to-move-court/articleshow/88377743.cms||Kumod Verma

Police said the incident took place at the terrace of a house around 11am on December 16. The child, who received injuries in her private parts, was treated at a private hospital before being shifted to the district sadar hospital. The accused was identified as Vinod Bhagat alias Vinod Bhandari, a resident of Sarairanjan village in Samastipur district. He had come to Hajipur to attend the marriage of his niece. The rape survivor is the daughter of Vinod’s elder niece. Sadar SDPO Raghav Dayal said the matter came to light on Saturday when the girl’s mother approached the police. “Family members had tried to hush up the matter by agreeing to bear the cost of the girl’s treatment. Her mother, however, approached the police two days after the incident. An FIR was lodged with the Women’s police station in this connection,” he added. SHO of Women’s police station Pushpa Kumari said the cops have started an inquiry into the incident. “The girl’s mother had washed her blood-stained clothes, pillow and bedsheet out of ignorance. We could not collect anything as evidence from the spot,” she added.

Despite the 22.9% rise in population having access to improved sanitation facilities, Bihar has been placed at the bottom after Ladakh when it comes to percentage of population deprived of sanitation. The percentage of population with basic sanitation facility in urban Bihar is 67.9% and it’s just 43.5% in rural areas of the state. According to the report, households without proper sanitation facilities have a greater risk of diseases like diarrhoea, dysentery and typhoid than households with improved sanitation facilities. In Bihar, nearly two-fifths (39%) of all households do not use any sanitation facility, which means that household members use open spaces or fields. Open defecation is more common among rural households. “Over three-fifths (62%) of households in Bihar have access to toilet facility, with a much higher accessibility in urban areas (89%) than in rural areas (57%). Access to toilet facility ranges from 46% among scheduled caste households to 82% among households which are not scheduled caste, scheduled tribe or OBC,” the report says. Access to a toilet facility varies widely across the districts, from the lowest in Araria (41%) to the highest in Rohtas (82%). More than 95% of urban households have access to toilet facility in seven districts – Patna, Saharsa, Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, Munger, Khagaria and Siwan. Patna has also seen an increase in the use of improved sanitation facilities in households in the last five years. In 2015-16, 52.3% people in the district used better sanitation facilities in their homes, which increased to 61% in 2019-20. Mayor Sita Sahu said the Patna Municipal Corporation had got the open defecation free (ODF) plus certification from the Centre last year. “This year, we will claim for ODF++ certificate to get better ranking in Swachh Survekashan 2022. More modular toilets will come up in the municipal area. We are focusing on every aspect of sanitation to provide better amenities to people,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/access-to-sanitation-up-22-in-bihar-but-still-miles-to-go/articleshow/88377846.cms||Faryal Rumi

This is 10% of the total estimated scope of 17,085 MU out of the total energy demand of 66,530 MU. According to state officials, Andhra Pradesh has so far reduced 5,600 MU of electricity consumption worth Rs 3,800 crore by rolling out schemes such as Ujala, PAT (perform, achieve and trade) and LED street lighting. Besides, the state has also saved around Rs 2,500 crore by purchasing electricity in the spot market at cost-effective prices and implementing other best practices. Addressing a gathering on the occasion of National Energy Conservation Week-2021 on Sunday, chief executive officer, AP State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM), A Chandrasekhara Reddy, said energy underpins every aspect of modern life, driving economic growth and prosperity. “It has a direct link to people’s standard of living. The primary energy demand in India is expected to increase to about 1,500 million tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) by 2030 from 770 million toe in 2012. In view of this, the state government has laid a special focus on enhancing energy efficiency,” said Chandrasekhara Reddy. The APSECM CEO added that Andhra Pradesh has already made a significant progress towards energy efficiency by achieving good results in the PAT scheme, which is a market-based compliance mechanism to accelerate improvements in energy efficiency in energy intensive industries. “Andhra Pradesh has implemented the PAT scheme in 30 energy intensive industries under PAT cycle-2 for the period of three years under the supervision of APSECM. It has over-achieved PAT compliance with 0.295 Mtoe of energy savings worth Rs 2,185 crore. This was officially declared by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency,” said Reddy. Explaining the potential in the building sector for energy saving, he said that as per the report submitted by the Administrative Staff College of India to the Andhra Pradesh government, there is a potential to save 888 MU of energy worth Rs 565 crore in government buildings alone. “The APSECM appeals to all the stakeholders, including government departments, public and private organisations and electricity consumers to come forward to contribute their bit in energy efficiency,” said Chandrasekhara Reddy. Andhra Pradesh has so far reduced 5,600 MU of electricity consumption worth Rs 3,800 crore by rolling out various schemes .

The fees will also help smaller fintechs that were being squeezed out of the UPI race as they could not match the cash burn by multinational giants. Last week, the government ended the two years of zero-fee policy that it had adopted since December 2019. Under the scheme announced, banks that install card-swipe machines or QR codes in shops will be incentivised by the government by way of paying a percentage of the value of transactions done through RuPay debit cards and low-value BHIM-UPI modes of payments, at an estimated financial outlay of Rs 1,300 crore for one year from April 1, 2021. The merchant-acquiring banks will, in turn, pass on part of the revenue to the card-issuing banks. A government notification on December 17 said that, on RuPay debit card transactions (on card-swipe machines in shops and e-commerce sites), banks will get 0.4% of the transaction amount with a ceiling of Rs 100. For use of UPI in shops and in online transactions, banks will get 0.25%. For use of RuPay card or UPI during/on purchase of insurance, mutual fund, government, education, railways, agriculture, fuel, jewellery and hospitals, banks will get only 0.15% capped at Rs 6 per transaction. For UPI, the incentives will be paid only for transactions below Rs 2,000. Banks will also have to show at least 10% year-on-year growth in RuPay transactions and 50% growth in UPI. “Public sectors, who are the major issuers of RuPay cards, were losing out. Now with fees back in place (like in case of Mastercard & Visa), even private banks will start to push RuPay,” said a senior banker. According to payment service providers, the reimbursement will promote innovation in fintech as well. Currently, among third-party apps, UPI payments are dominated by Google Pay and Walmart-owned PhonePe.“The industry has had its share of problems since the announcement of ‘Zero MDR’ (merchant discount rate), but they will greatly benefit from this initiative of reimbursement of transaction charges levied on digital payments, which will help them to scale up the payments infrastructure in the country, thereby enhancing financial inclusion,” said Vishwas Patel, chairman of the Payments Council of India and director of Infibeam Avenues. The MDR is the fee that the shopkeeper pays to the card company. This fee is shared between the card-issuing bank, the bank that installs the point-of-sale machine and the card network. It is the MDR that covers the cost of cashback and other promotions for debit card usage. Earlier, before the ban on charges for RuPay cards, the fee ranged from 0.3% to 0.9%, depending on the size of the merchant. Following the imposition of the ban, banks stopped promoting RuPay card transactions as they had to bear all the costs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-funds-to-boost-usage-of-rupay-upi/articleshow/88379205.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Business||Prepare for ESG activism: Parekh||MUMBAI: HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh has warned companies that shareholder activism on environment, social and governance (ESG) issues is here to stay and the boards of companies need to figure out how to manage it. According to Parekh, there is a change in the boardroom’s climate. “ESG and a purpose-driven strategy is an expectation by all investors today. This entails a range of issues from diversity, inclusion, climate risk, emissions, supply chains, labour rights, anti-corruption, among several others. There is a sea change in terms of increased non-financial disclosures by companies and greater board oversight on these parameters is being called for,” said Parekh. He was speaking at the 21st ICSI National Awards for Excellence in Corporate Governance. In his address, he said that company secretaries play the role of a chief board adviser and should be part of the ‘speak up’ culture, keep an eye on all activities of the company and stay abreast with technology. “Boards have to be prepared to face increased demands from shareholders — be it on the say on pay, say on climate, choice of directors, voting against resolutions, among others. Shareholder activism is here to stay and it is up to the collective wisdom of the board on how this is best managed.” He said that if the internal governance structures are strong, incentives of key executives are reasonable and companies are sensitive towards their stakeholders, they are less likely to run into troubled waters with shareholder activism. He noted that the new development finance institution set up by the government to fund infrastructure has various protections built into the act to safeguard employees and directors against actions taken in good faith while discharging their duties. However, he said that at a system level there weren’t enough checks and balances to ensure protection against bona fide transactions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/prepare-for-esg-activism-parekh/articleshow/88379085.cms||---

The passenger was tested thrice and the result came positive all three times. He was then transferred to an isolation ward in a private hospital. His swab sample has been sent to NIBMG-Kalyani for genome sequencing to check if he has been infected by the Omicron variant.  An 11-year-old who arrived in Kolkata from Sweden also tested positive for Covid and has been sent into home isolation under doctors’ supervision. “Samples have been collected from both for genome sequencing,” said Ajay Chakraborty, director of heath services. These are the fifth and sixth in Bengal to be tested for Omicron so far. Only one, a seven-year-old boy from Murshidabad, has so far tested positive to the variant. According to airport officials, the 19-year-old — an Indian — reached Kolkata aboard the Air India flight AI 164 at 4.56am on Sunday. He first underwent a rapid RT-PCR test. After the result came positive, he underwent another rapid RT-PCR test to check if there had been an error. When that result, too, came back positive, the passenger insisted on an RT-PCR test. Six hours later, the result came positive. “At 2.35pm, the boy who had arrived by the flight was put in an ambulance that took him to a hospital in Dhakuria,” an official said. Since the boy was seated in 36J, all passengers in the row, as well the ones behind and ahead, have been alerted to monitor their health during the seven-day home quarantine, get RT-PCR tests done on the eighth day, and contact state health officials if they get symptoms during that period. If the 19-year-old boy tests positive for the Omicron variant, all the passengers seated close to him will undergo Covid test. On December 14, a 69-year-old Kolkata resident who had returned from Nigeria had tested positive to Covid at the airport. His swab sample has been stored at the School of Tropical Medicine from where it will be forwarded to NIBMG-Kalyani for genome sequencing on Monday. The patient is now admitted at a private hospital off Bypass and has mild symptoms. Sources said he is on a normal diet and his health parameters are normal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/19-yr-old-uk-flyer-and-11-yr-old-from-sweden-test-covid-positive/articleshow/88378786.cms||Subhro Niyogi

While one college organised its foundation day on December 9, another organised its convocation on December 11. A university is conducting trials for a sports event. College authorities said they were organising these events with only a handful of students, and in the open air, so as to maintain social distancing. “A college is not only about studies. There are several non-academic activities and programmes that are as much a part of daily college life and we will have to resume them gradually. With offline classes resuming in a phased manner, we are trying to organise non-academic activities, too, but with extreme caution. The college foundation day was held on on December 9 in the open air following all Covid-safety guidelines,” said Subhasis Dutta, principal of Maulana Azad College. Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira in Belur held its ninth convocation on December 11 in the Vivekananda Sabhagriha on campus. “Several dignitaries attended the convocation — both in person and virtually. We ensured all Covid-appropriate protocols were followed,” said a college official. Ramakrishna Mission Residential College (autonomous) Narendrapur will organise the 26th biennial reunion of its alumni association on December 25. “We are taking all possible measures to ensure everybody’s safety,” said a college official.

The new bypass will connect NH-16 in Krishna and Guntur districts with a new river overbridge. The bypass will be coming up almost 40 kilometres away on the eastern side of Vijayawada. The Centre has given the green signal to the project following a special request made by chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy. The Centre has also agreed to share about 50 per cent of the cost of acquisition of land required for the project. The 78-km-long new bypass highway is expected to cost around Rs 600 to Rs 800 crore including the cost of land acquisition. This is the second bypass for Vijayawada as works on the Gundugolanu (Krishna district)-Chinakakani (Guntur district) have already been put on the fast track. Though the Gundugolanu-Kaza bypass was granted almost a decade ago, work picked up pace after the YSRC came to power in the state. The previous TDP government had put the project on hold with a view to designing the river overbridge as an iconic structure. However, the designs were not cleared even after a lapse of five years. Considering the high cost involved in the bridge project, the Centre asked the state government to bear a 50 per cent share of the project.  Subsequently, the YSRC government revisited the project and cancelled the designs of the iconic bridge model. It requested the Centre to go ahead with the original designs to complete the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/centre-gives-nod-for-bypass-to-decongest-traffic-in-vij/articleshow/88378045.cms||Samdani MN

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: SUV topples at Aksa beach, youth on footrail crushed||MUMBAI: A birthday outing went horribly wrong for a group of seven young men when their SUV overturned at Malad's Aksa beach on Saturday, killing one and hurting the rest. A 22-year-old student, Ritik Kale, who was at the wheel, has been arrested. Malwani police said they suspect at least some of the men were drunk. Kale's blood sample has been sent for tests to determine if he was driving under the influence of alcohol. Lifeguards at Aksa beach who witnessed the incident said the SUV entered the sandy part of the beach despite guidelines forbidding it. The group live in Ghatkopar and were celebrating the birthday of Akshay Pawar, 27. They set out in his SUV and reached Aksa around 4.30 pm. "Typically, there are policemen patrolling the stretch outside the beach. But on Saturday, they were diverted to handle complaints of traffic congestion. The group took advantage of the fact that no cops were around to steer the vehicle into the sandy part of the beach," said an officer. The SUV attracted a lot of attention as the men hollered and honked at other visitors. "Two of the men were standing on the footrail of the moving car on either side. The vehicle was moving between 60 to 70 kmph and we were concerned that the men might get hurt," said a civic lifeguard, Nathuram Suryavanshi. Police said Kale was an inexperienced driver but requested Pawar to let him take the wheel. Kale, however, couldn't control the vehicle while executing a U-turn and the SUV overturned to a side. Rahul Yadav, a 22-year-old BPO employee, had been standing on one of the footrails and was crushed. The lifeguards rushed towards the car and were joined by other bystanders. "It took a dozen of us to move the SUV back to its upright position and extricate Yadav from beneath. We carried him on a stretcher to the main road and sent him in an autorickshaw to the hospital. His friends got out of the car on their own and two of them went to hospital with Yadav," said Suryavanshi. At the hospital, Yadav was pronounced dead by doctors. His body was sent for an autopsy. The others in the car were Tejas Kadam, 27, Sharad Salekar, 24, Mritunjay Chaudhari, 25 and Nikhil Chikne, 23. One of them fractured his arm while the rest suffered minor injuries, police said. A case of negligence was registered against Kale under provisions of IPC and Motor Vehicles Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-suv-toppled-at-70kmph-on-sand-killed-footrail-rider/articleshow/88379166.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Met eyes mercury dip, minimum temperature may slide below 12°C||KOLKATA: Although the minimum temperature climbed up to 15.1°C, Kolkata remained chilly on a windy Sunday. Weathermen said it could get chillier with the mercury set to drop from Monday and may slide below 12°C. The northwesterly winds that are carrying in the chill from the Himalayas have gained strength. Hence, it will remain cool in Kolkata till December 22, after which the minimum temperature may rise marginally. “It will get colder on Monday and Tuesday as the northwesterly winds have gotten stronger. The temperature could plunge below 12°C and remain between 11°C and 12°C on Monday. The chill will persist till Wednesday, after which the northwesterly will lose strength, leading to a marginal rise in temperature,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. As the minimum temperature went from 13.5°C on Saturday to touch 15°C on Sunday, the chill factor rose with the wind getting stronger. It pulled the ‘real feel’ temperature down to 12°C, according to private weather forecasting service AccuWeather. Real-feel temperature is the measure of how it feels on human skin and is calculated on the basis of multiple factors, like wind speed, sun-ray intensity, humidity, rainfall, cloudiness and elevation. The minimum temperature could hover around 15°C on Christmas. “We expect some easterly winds to flow into Kolkata around that time. So, the minimum temperature may not slide below 15°C. But it will drop again subsequently,” said Das. Last week, a low-pressure trough above Bay of Bengal had led to clouds and intermittent rain in Kolkata. The minimum temperature got pushed up to 19°C, three notches above normal. The cloud cover had brought the maximum temperature down to 22°C and reduced the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures to just two degrees early last week. This is the season’s first chilly spell that commenced earlier this week with a three-degree drop in mercury from 18°C to 15°C on Monday. Since then, the minimum temperature has remained below 15°C. Weather experts expect the chilly spell to continue for a week since there is no system that can block the northwesterly winds yet. “Now, the mercury is set to drop further,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/met-eyes-mercury-dip-min-temp-may-slide-below-12c/articleshow/88378799.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The boy, Vansheel Doiphode, had been manhandled by two youngsters, in their 20s, on December 14. The boy did not reveal this to his parents out of fear, and he was possibly threatened against revealing it too. The victim’s six-year-old sister Shaurya finally narrated the thrashing incident to her father Harshavardhan. The family then got the victim medical help, but it was probably too late, and he died soon after returning from a hospital visit. Nandanvan police, despite the sister’s revelation of the thrashing incident, have decided to treat the case as an ‘accidental death’, awaiting the post-mortem report. Sources said the boy had some internal head injuries. He also had a scar on the forehead. Vansheel Doiphode, a Std VI student, died at his residence shortly after returning from hospital on Saturday. He was the only son of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Harshavardhan. “These two youngsters would abuse and randomly hit my son. My son would get irritated and retorted on a couple of occasions, following which they thrashed him more,” said the distraught father on Sunday. Harshavardhan said he had cautioned the youngsters not to hit his son and approach him if he misbehaved or did something naughty. “Ignoring my warning, the two youngsters would keep thrashing my son. This time, my son was so scared that he did not tell me about being thrashed. When I took him to the doctors, he could barely tolerate being touched or pressed on the head, shoulder and also back of the neck,” said the sobbing father. The younger sister had told the parents that the two boys had intercepted them when they were going to purchase some chips at a shop in the vicinity. Fearful of being targeted again by the youngsters, who thrashed him repeatedly, Vansheel did not tell his parents that he was thrashed by them. Harshavardhan said his son had fallen down on the ground two days back due to weakness, as he was ailing since he was beaten up. “I told the cops that my son was beaten and asked them to register an offence of murder. Still, they did not take my FIR,” he said, seeking justice from senior police officials. Senior PI Kishor Nagrale of Nandanvan police station said forensic experts from Government Medical College and Hospital will be giving a detailed report, following which the future course of action would be decided. “The boy had some scar on the forehead, but he had fallen from the bed too some time back. Earlier, he was also bitten by a dog,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/thrashed-by-neighbourhood-bullies-11-year-old-boy-dies/articleshow/88379171.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Seven-year-old drowns in elevator shaft at construction site||MUMBAI: A seven-year-old boy drowned after falling into a lift shaft filled with rain water at an under-construction site in Andheri West late on Friday. Police said the child and his parents were attending a wedding ceremony that a worker had organised on the ground floor of the site. The DN Nagar police registered a case of negligence against the supervisor. No arrest has been made. The building is located at Patkar Compound in Gilbert Hill area. Construction had come to a halt at the site about three or four years ago. The site is manned by security guards, while labourers live close by. Police said one of the labourers decided to organise his wedding ceremony on the ground floor without permission, as he thought nobody would find out or object. “The victim, Rajik Khan, was playing at the site. He is suspected to have ventured to the lift shaft and may have slipped inside. The water level was about five feet high. As the labourers had put on music, nobody heard him fall. Someone spotted a slipper floating in the lift shaft and summoned Rajik’s parents,” a police official said. The boy was fished out and taken to hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead. “We have booked the site supervisor under section 304 (A) of IPC as he failed to take adequate precautions. The labourer who organised a wedding ceremony at the building will also be probed,” a police officer said. A few months ago, another child from the nearby slum had drowned in a pit dug in the same building compound.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-7-year-old-drowns-in-elevator-shaft-at-construction-site/articleshow/88379173.cms||---

The epidemiologic data of children who tested positive for Covid-19, showed no clue of them or their parents having a history of travel to foreign countries, or the neighbouring state of Kerala. The health department is looking from all angles, to find the actual source of the Omicron variant of the virus that infected children, who are all below 14. Out of 79 primary contacts and 203 secondary contacts identified from the JNV in the district, only 13 people tested positive. Of the 12 samples sent for genome sequencing, four tested positive for the Omicron variant. Deputy commissioner K V Rajendra told TOI that the health department will collect more samples from nearby villages, of the JNV cluster in Bantwal taluk. “We will send more samples from the vicinity of the cluster for RT-PCR tests and genome sequencing. This will help us reconfirm whether the Omicron variant is present in the surrounding areas. There is no need to panic, as all of the infected individual have recovered, and were asymptomatic,” he said. The DC added that it was a very mild infection that lasted for just one or two days in children. “We have carried out contact tracing properly, and so far could not find the source of the Omicron variant. In fact, we found the cluster in JNV on November 21 and based on the government’s direction, samples were sent for genome sequencing in December. All unvaccinated children have recovered within two days. Even their contacts had not suffered from the infection. There is nothing serious about the Omicron variant, as none of those infected suffered from the virus for more than two days. However, people should be responsible and continue to follow the protocols by wearing masks compulsorily,” he said. Dr Ashok H, district nodal officer for Covid-19, said that all children from the JNV cluster are attending classes now. “It is still a mystery how children from the JNV, and a nursing student tested positive for the Omicron variant of the virus. We are on the trail to find the source of the Omicron variant in them,” he added. As per a genome sequencing report announced by health minister Dr K Sudhakar on Saturday, five cases of Covid-19 from Dakshina Kannada were of the Omicron variant. While four are children below 14 from the JNV cluster, the fifth infected person was a 19-year-old nursing student from a college in the city, who had received both doses of vaccine before July 7. Dr Ashok said that the nursing student was also asymptomatic, and did not have a travel history.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/health-officials-tracing-source-of-omicron-infection-in-dk/articleshow/88377833.cms||---

Residents are also protesting against the scheme of new flats to be constructed in Sector 20. Speaking on the occasion, Chander Mohan said, “BJP is looting people in all ways. When residents pay taxes, there is no need of a paid parking system here.” He also raised the issue of poor facilities being provided to residents living in Sector 20 and trans Ghaggar sectors. K K Jindal, president, RWA, Sector 20, an umbrella body of 115 societies, said that the protest is aimed at pressurising the administration for withdrawal of the anti-public decision. He said that the Sector was designed on a apolicy of no profit and no loss and residents had already paid for all common areas. He asserted that the civic body had no right to impose paid parking on the area. Residents said they would continue their protest till December 22. Former Congress mayor Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia also joined the protesters with Congress workers. The residents alleged that the administration was planning to deforest 10 acres of land having mango trees between the sector to make flats. They said that with even the existing population not given requisite facilities, adding more population would be disastrous, the protesters said. Association general secretary Avinash Malik criticised HUDA, accusing the authority of looting and torturing the public mentally and economically for the 20 years. Association vice-president Yoginder Kwatra said that the treatment plant was not working properly and HUDA had failed to lay sewerage pipes. “The local government has no right to collect any tax till it provides proper civil amenities to residents,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/former-dy-cm-cong-leaders-supports-protesting-residents/articleshow/88378548.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ahmedabad||E-way lags behind October numbers||Raw material prices, dwindling order volumes, rising freight costs have dramatically impacted dispatches in the manufacturing sector of Gujarat. Clearly, the number of e-way bills generated have declined in November by one-third. According to the state commercial tax department, 67.94 lakh e-way bills were generated in November — down 33% against 1.01 crore e-way bills in October. State government officials attribute the decline to closure of manufacturing units during Diwali. However, industry stakeholders further claim that overall production and consequently dispatches took a hit in Gujarat in November due to skyrocketing coal and raw material prices. Explaining this, Milind Torawane, state commercial tax commissioner, said, "During the Diwali holidays, businesses were closed and as a consequence, the business activity was less. Moreover, due to input cost increase and container shortage, dispatches have been impacted including those for exports. Therefore, e-way bill numbers declined in November. The massive surge in e-way bill generation in October was largely due to pent-up demand ahead of the festive season." The number of e-way bills generated, in fact, declined marginally by 3% as compared to 70.1 lakh e-way bills generated in November 2020 as well. However, most part of November reflected a shutdown due to Diwali and a surge in Covid-19 cases soon after the festive season. Pathik Patwari, senior vice-president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, "Raw material prices were high and so were freight costs, due to which there were massive supply chain disruptions. Moreover, due to increased fuel prices, even transport movement was affected. Diwali holiday season also led to closure of industries for about five days and as a consequence, overall e-way bill generations declined." A raw deal for apparel manufacturers With yarn getting costlier and job charges for textile processing going up, apparel makers downsized production significantly after Diwali. Estimates by Gujarat Garment Manufacturers’ Association (GGMA) indicate that apparel makers are operating at 50% capacity since a week before Diwali. "Pent-up demand did drive sales significantly in October. However, just ahead of Diwali, fresh order volumes nosedived. Sales of festive and wedding apparel were decent since then whereas for denims, casual and formal wear declined. With raw material costs soaring, manufacturers have curtailed production," said Arpan Shah, honorary treasurer, GGMA. Foundries remained shut for a fortnight Foundries which manufacture metal castings remained shut for at least a fortnight over and above the Diwali break in November. "Reeling under extreme cost pressures with rise in prices of coal as well as pig iron — a key raw material for manufacturing metal castings, foundries are facing acute working capital shortage and as a result, are forced to curtail or shut production," said Subodh Panchal, past president, Institute of Indian Foundrymen (IIF). Gujarat is home to at least 2,500 foundries which are mainly concentrated in Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Rajkot and have a cumulative installed capacity of some 5-lakh tonne per month, according to IIF estimates. "With units remaining shut, dispatches are bound to be affected and as a result, e-way bill generation is bound to be impacted," said Panchal. Some 7,000 foundries and other engineering units are also observing a day’s shutdown on December 20 to protest the dramatic surge in price of steel, pig iron and other metals. Freight dampens exports of plastic products Spiralling raw material prices coupled with very high ocean freight have discouraged plastic products’ exports as well as domestic demand. As a result, production has been scaled down, which has brought down dispatches. "I have not received any export orders in the past two months. Ocean freight has gone so high that buyers are unable to procure goods. They place orders only when it is inevitable," said an Ahmedabad-based plastic products manufacturer. Even high volatility in raw material prices is further discouraging manufacturers to stockpile raw materials in anticipation of the future demand. "Overall, manufacturers are procuring raw material in tandem with the orders in hand," the manufacturers added. Tile dispatches decrease 40% The dispatches from India’s largest ceramic tile cluster in Morbi have taken a beating with tile prices going up in the past few months. The price rise has affected demand and consequently the production has slowed down, said ceramic tile makers. "The loading and unloading of goods, both raw material and finished goods, plummeted by 40% in November. For example: If previously 100 trucks were loaded every day in Morbi, only 60 were loaded in November daily. Buyers are in wait and watch mode as the prices of ceramic tile have firmed up," said Nilesh Jetpariya, president, wall tiles division, Morbi Ceramic Association. Surge in natural gas prices combined with a surge in coal and transportation rates as well as raw material prices have resulted in various tile prices going up by 30-40% over the past six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/e-way-lags-behind-october-numbers/articleshow/88378557.cms||Niyati Parikh

The market, constructed at the cost of Rs 7 crore, can accommodate more than 250 vendors, while more than 30 cars and 50 two-wheelers can be comfortably parked at the centre.More than 110 shops at the market, called the ‘Shanivara Santhe’ have been built under a tensile roof, while separate lavatories for men and women have also been constructed. A 7.5-metre wide road will help motorists navigate the market, and facilitate parking.HDSCL managing director CW Shakeel Ahmed exuded confidence of completing all pending work by the first week of January. “Very little work, mostly minor, is left to be completed. We are confident of the market being inaugurated in the first week of January,” Ahmed said.He added that the market had been designed in such a manner so as to enable its use for other purposes on all days of the week, barring Saturday, when it would be exclusively used by vegetable and fruit vendors. “It can be used for cultural events, yoga sessions, et al. It can accommodate up to 800 people,” Ahmed said.HDSCL deputy general manager Basavaraj said that work on the market started in mid-2019. “We had to suspend work following the outbreak of Covid-19. Unseasonal showers delayed completion further. But we have completed work on the landscape, the katas have been constructed, and work on fencing, electricity has also been finished,” he said.Johnson, a banker who resides in Shanti Colony, said that authorities should inaugurate the ‘Shanivara Santhe’ at the earliest. “The lack of a dedicated space compels vendors to set up shop by the side of the road in Bengeri, and in Sulla, which adds to the problems on the roads. Customers have to purchase vegetables in the face of constant danger from speeding vehicles,” he said.MaintenanceActivist Ramesh S said, “The authorities must enforce hygiene at the market. The market appears to be equipped with the latest technology, and authorities must deploy people round-the-clock to ensure that the place remains clean.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/smart-market-set-to-open-soon-in-bengeri/articleshow/88376803.cms||J Abbas Mulla

While an Ilkal-based organisation has already filed a public interest litigation in the high court, several other organisations, including the Karnatak Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have formed an action committee to oppose the exorbitant hike. They are also considering approaching the court and preparing to launch a state-wide agitation. Vinay J Javali, president of the KCCI, informed TOI that taxes are raised excessively at all urban local bodies (ULBs) in the state except for the BBMP. "When the government implemented the Self-Assessment Scheme in 2005-06, it promised a 15-20% increase once every three years. It released a statement in February stating that it would raise property taxes by 2% to 15%, despite our request not to do so because the economy had collapsed due to the Covid epidemic. Now we have reports from 25 business organisations that tax has been increased while disregarding all norms and regulations. In the last 4-5 months, we filed numerous memoranda to the administration and even met ministers, but to no avail. Hence, we have formed an action committee to fight the issue. Our legal team is gathering all documents in order to file a public interest litigation in court. If the government does not take it seriously, we will initiate a legal battle," he said. Vasant Ladawa, chairman of the KCCI Action Committee, said that property taxes are raised by a minimum of 50% and a maximum of 840% in reality. "For instance, HDMC collected Rs 18 lakh in tax from a property last year. However, it has been raised to Rs 15.94 lakh in the challan this year. When we approached the officials, they said it was automatically done by the software. The government should note that the software, portals, and websites meant for property tax collection are completely inappropriate. However, many taxpayers are unaware of this unfair tax hike. Payers who paid Rs 2,000 last year have paid more than Rs 9,000 this year. Because there is no assessment, tribunal, or appellate authority over property tax issues, ULBs illegally collect high taxes. As the tax is hiked, the cess towards health, library, beggars, SWM, and city transportation is automatically raised," he explained. Praveen Hebsur, a member of the Hubballi-Dharwad Kalyan Mantaps Association, and Sachin Shah, a member of the Karnataka Automobile Dealers Association, alleged that the illegal but silent hike has put a burden on all commercial and residential property owners during the financial crisis that has arisen from the Covid pandemic. "It's harassment for everyone at a time when people are reeling under the economic crisis," they added. Mysuru Chamber of Commerce and Industry has already registered a protest, and Vasant Kumar, former president of the Shivamogga Chamber of Commerce and Industry, will file a PIL soon. "The government should take a decision during the ongoing winter session in Belagavi. If this does not happen, we will intensify our fight and the legal battle," Ladawa said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/property-tas-hiked-by-up-to-800-industry-to-intensity-stir/articleshow/88376810.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

As many as 37 students tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the biggest single-day spike in the district after two months. District surveillance officer Dr Jagadeesh told TOI that cases were reported from three active containment zones in the district–a paramedical college, a nursing college and an ayurveda college. “All the fresh cases reported today are students, who are primary and secondary contacts of those who tested positive earlier. We are now finding Covid-19 cases among the student population. We have been collecting samples from students of medical, paramedical, and professional colleges in the district, on a rotational basis, at regular intervals,” he said. Deputy commissioner K V Rajendra said that the district administration has increased surveillance, in the wake of detection of the Omicron variant of the virus. People of Kasaragod and Kannur districts of Kerala have a strong bond with Dakshina Kannada, and they visit here for health, education and other purposes, regularly. The test positivity rate of Covid-19 is still around 8-9% in Kerala. Dakshina Kannada and Kasaragod districts share a 40km border, and Mangaluru city is just 10km from Kasaragod.

The general body meeting was held in Vizag city and zilla parishad chairperson J Subhadra presided over the meeting. Elamanchili MLA Kannababu claimed that the vice-chairman and the MP should sit in the audience and not on the stage as per the protocol. However, minister Srinivasa Rao insisted that they be invited. Apparently disappointed over the minister’s attitude, the MLA threatened to walk out of the meeting and once again pointed out that there is a protocol violation in the meeting.  Sensing that the situation was turning for worse as the senior MLA has raised objection over the protocol, the minister immediately consulted joint collector Venugopal Reddy on the seating arrangements as per the protocol and the latter explained to him that vice-chairmen and elected MPs and MLAs should sit in the audience. Finally, Satyavathi, who already had taken a seat on the dais, had to return to the audience. The senior ZPTCs also said that as per the protocol, chairperson Subhadra is supposed to conduct the meeting instead of the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ysrc-mla-protests-protocol-violation-at-parishad-meeting/articleshow/88377858.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Stationary No More||Kolkata: There was something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery — Charles Dickens once said. The notebook-and-pencil addicts unanimously agreed and kept the neighbourhood stores going until a certain virus made these businesses bleed red ink. Luckily, life, liberty and the pursuit of stationery is slowly and steadily outrunning the pandemic. The industry is moving out of its stationary phase with the resumption of offices and offline classes, and market leaders are hitting the innovation button hard to make up for lost time. Indian conglomerate ITC had made its foray into the education and stationery business with its brand Paperkraft in 2002, and later expanded further with Classmate in 2003. Vikas Gupta, ITC’s chief executive (education and stationery products), told TOI that the staggered opening of academic institutions was the key to recovery. Vikas Gupta“ITC Classmate is launching a slew of innovative products such as the origami notebooks. While we are bringing notebooks to the youth portfolio under Classmate Pulse, we are also making inroads into the premium office stationery segment with pens and diaries. Classmate UVO is a simple yet elegant pen in the value segment,” Gupta said. Leveraging the accelerated digitisation, Classmate has also established a D2C platform called classmateshop.com, which gives a customer the opportunity to upload any design of his or her choice and get the product delivered on the doorstep. Shaleni S Biswas, the managing director of Kolkata-based Easy Note Stationery, said their brand Klassnote was born in 2009. “Our business is receiving the required thrust with the reopening of schools and colleges, and this has inspired us to ramp up production. The demand for stationery products is growing at a sustained pace. It may take us a year to operate at a desired demand-and-supply level. We are gearing up for a 40-50% growth in demand in the coming months as compared to the pre-lockdown phase,” Biswas told TOI. Shaleni S BiswasEasy Note Stationery offers a wide range of products, including long exercise books, drawing books, lab notebooks and practical project papers. “Among 200 products, these items have given our company a commendable position in 300 schools across Bengal and in other eastern India states. The stationery business is a dynamic one. To capture the imagination of students, we frequently launch a new line of products. A fresh range of pencil boxes, erasers, sharpeners, rulers, notebooks and spiral notepads are on the cards,” Biswas added. Linc Pen & Plastics -- founded by Surajmal Jalan some 45 years ago and currently run by his sons Deepak and Aloke -- is all geared up for the launch of its new products in January 2022. Speaking to TOI, Deepak said their pens were exported to more than 40 countries and at least 20% of their total revenue came from international sales. “We have manufacturing units in Bengal and Gujarat. In 1976, when our company was founded, fountain pens were quite popular. We produced both fountain and ballpoint pens. There has been a dramatic change in consumer preferences though. Now, we make ballpoint and gel pens. On an average, we sell more than 50 million pens a month,” he said. Deepak JalanIn the January-March quarter, Linc will launch its Pentonic brand for pens. “We are also expanding the penetration of several office stationery items like calculators, scissors and desk organisers under the brand Deli. There has been a steady recovery in sales since July this year and we have been able to achieve pre-Covid sales since October across the country,” Deepak added. The stationery industry is back on track, believes Keshav Agarwal, who looks after business development for Future Educare. “It has been barely a month since schools reopened in Bengal. Our top selling products now include notebooks and registers. Over the years, we have increased our production capabilities 10 times and have been able to work with institutions in Bengal and northeast India,” he said, adding that their elite clientele comprised Ramkrishna Mission schools, Don Bosco, DPS and West Bengal Textbook Corporation. Keshav AgarwalAccording to Biswas of Easy Note Stationery, companies drafted extraordinary strategies to break the pandemic jinx and stay ahead of the curve. “We introduced doorstep delivery in Bengal and convinced some residential complexes to allow stationery camps. It was a win-win situation for both students confined at home and us. In addition, we launched a new unit for packaging materials that supplied to the hospitality, aviation, healthcare and medical industries,” she said. Agarwal said Future Educare stuck to the basics. “We could predict well after the first wave that it would take time for schools to resume classes. We planned accordingly and identified areas where we needed to channel our efforts. The new verticals thus identified are helping us further business,” he added. ITC’s education and stationery business took the e-commerce route to tide over the crisis. “Both Classmate and Paperkraft have enabled us to make significant inroads for the expansion of business through various channels. We are in continuous pursuit of creating an innovative portfolio in alignment with emerging consumer preferences,” said Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stationary-no-more/articleshow/88376213.cms||Sarthak.G
---||Dehradun||Will implement Delhi’s simplified governance model in U’khand: Sisodia||Rudrapur: On the last day of his four-day visit to poll-bound Uttarakhand, senior AAP leader and Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia said that both Congress and BJP had “looted Uttarakhand for 20 years since the state’s formation”, that the hill state “has immense possibilities” and if voted to power, AAP will implement a “simplified system of governance”, tackling long-standing problems of unemployment, migration and inadequate health facilities. During an interactive session with traders, farmers and industrialists at an event in Kashipur bypass, Sisodia said that the Kejriwal-led AAP govt in Delhi took extensive feedback from traders, implemented changes like reduced taxes and single-window clearances, and helped the state manage funds efficiently while reducing reliance on the Centre. Sharing anecdotes from Delhi elections in 2015, Sisodia said, “Before presenting the budget for 2015-2016, we did lots of homework, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal held walks with traders in almost every locality of the city.” He recalled that “the state had a budget of only Rs 30,000 crore and after all expenditures, we were left with only Rs 1,000 crore for development schemes.” “We continued our interactions with traders and based on their suggestions, abandoned the enforcement directorate, reduced taxes and opened a single-window clearance system. Traders of Delhi no longer needed to run from pillar to post to get clearances but government officials showed up at their doorsteps. It worked and in just seven years, Delhi is a self-sustained administration on a budget of Rs 60,000 crore, without the Centre’s help.” Sisodia said that his party aims to replicate the Delhi model in Uttarakhand, where free education would be given to children and a simplified business model to traders. “All these promises will be included in the party’s manifesto for the state elections,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/will-implement-delhis-simplified-governance-model-in-ukhand-sisodia/articleshow/88377882.cms||Aakash Ahuja

The teachers have taken to the roads and boycotted academic work due to the failure of the Punjab government to implement the 7th pay commission recommendations for the past six years. Teachers took took out a protest march to Madhya Marg on Sunday, where they received huge support from passers-by. Foregoing the winter recess advanced by Panjab University after postponement of the scheduled semester-end exams, Tricity teachers turned up to support fasting volunteers on a Sunday. The chain hunger strike, under the aegis of PFUCTO and PCCTU, entered its 14th day on Sundat with Dr Amitabh Dwiwedi, Dr Raman Soni, Dr Iqbal Preet Kaur and Dr Prashanti (all from DAV College) sitting on hunger strike from 9am to 5pm. Prof Sudhir Mehra (PU, Chandigarh), Dr Kulwinder Singh (PU) and Dr Navneet Kumar (DAV College) are continuing the strike from 5pm on Sunday to 9am on Monday. In a bid to end the stalemate, the All India Federation of University and College teachers Organisations (AIFUCTO) leadership wrote to AICC president Sonia Gandhi, informing her that Punjab was the only state which had not implemented the 7th Pay Commission recommendations. Dr Sumit Goklaney, president, DAVCTU slammed authorities and warned that women faculty members would join the strike if nothing was done to resolve the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/teachers-press-on-with-protest-as-state-govt-refuses-to-budge/articleshow/88378565.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Gold dust in lingerie lands 18 Kenyans in customs net||MUMBAI: Eighteen Kenyan women have been held by airport customs for smuggling around 4kg of gold worth Rs 1.6 crore. The gold was in the form of bars, wires and dust, concealed in a host of personal belongings, including the linings of footwear and lingerie, masala containers, and coffee cans. All 18 women arrived from the Kenyan capital Nairobi via Sharjah at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International airport early on Sunday morning. “Looking at such a large and uniform group, that too from a highly underdeveloped part of the world, suspicions were raised that they could be acting as couriers for gold smugglers,” said a source. Soon, women customs officials were brought in the picture and a thorough inspection of their luggage, handbags and other personal belongings was done. “At first, nothing emerged as the concealment was clever. But persistence paid off and the hidden gold started emerging,” the source said. “They had mixed gold dust in masala and coffee… in toothpaste too. They had put gold dust in their lingerie. They had gold wire in their footwear linings.” In the end, 4kg of gold was recovered from the group. The women, after they were booked for smuggling, told officers that they sold gold in India and pocketing the price difference bought garments to sell back home. “It is tragic. Because of dire economic conditions in east Africa, ordinary people are forced into crime, especially smuggling. What do you do when there is raging poverty all around you? We have observed an increasing number of Kenyan nationals getting involved in the smuggling of gold as well as other contraband,” said a veteran customs expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-gold-dust-in-lingerie-lands-18-kenyans-in-customs-net/articleshow/88379212.cms||Ahmed Ali

These three aspects have often yielded good revenue for the city corporation over the years. The cashier, who was placed under suspension, had cancelled receipts after receiving cash in case of issuance of tar cutting permits. The probe team collected the statement of cancelled receipts for 2019-20 and found that although receipts were cancelled, permits were still issued and money due to the corporation as restoration charges never got credited. In the complaint submitted to Kazhakootam police, corporation secretary demanded that charges be slapped against the official under sections of IT act, criminal conspiracy, breach of trust and cheating. With the register having details of receipt, site plan and applicants, the team is also collecting details of applicants to whom permit passes were issued and receipts were cancelled. This is being done to find out if there was any nexus between the official and the agent. In case of tar cutting, no similar fraud has so far been detected for 2020-21 and 2021-22. The officials are now examining the statement of 2018-19. In addition to tar cutting files, documents and statements related to regularization fee collected for unauthorized constructions and building permit fee are also being collected. A common factor which enabled the official to swindle the funds is that very rarely does an applicant seek receipts regarding tar cutting. As for permits and regularization, applications are usually filed and dealt with by agents and once they get the permit or get the buildings regularized, they don’t come back to accept receipts for the same. The city corporation made more revenue out of road restoration than the cumulative amount it collected as rent and revenue from its assets in 2019-20, according to the annual administration report for 2019-20. The corporation fetched Rs 15.26 crore from road restoration charges in 2019-20, nearly 280% higher than anticipated in the budget estimates for the fiscal. The fee collected by city corporation for regularizing unauthorized constructions recorded a 161% rise in three fiscals, as per the figures presented in the budget document of 2021-22. The civic body which grossed Rs 68 lakh in 2017-18 as regularization fee fetched Rs 1.7 crore in 2019-20, the actual collection records show. The humongous rise in collection of regularization fee has spurred corporation to project an estimate of Rs 3.5 crore as regularization fee in the next fiscal. Assembly records show that till February 2019, the total fee collected from regularization of unauthorized constructions in urban civic bodies was Rs 2.82 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/regularization-permit-fee-tar-cutting-spurred-fraud/articleshow/88378601.cms||Aswin J Kumar

As per Met experts, plain areas like Dehradun, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar are facing more severe cold conditions as compared to the hills due to the difference between maximum and minimum temperatures there. “The increasing diurnal variation, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum temperature, is causing the intense cold,” said Bikram Singh director of the regional Met centre. On Sunday, Pantnagar in Udham Singh Nagar district recorded maximum temperature of 18 degrees celsius while the minimum was 2.7 degrees Celsius. In Dehradun, the maximum temperature on Sunday was 22.1 degrees while minimum was 4.1 degrees. The lowest temperature in the state was recorded at Ranichauri in Tehri Garhwal where the mercury plummeted to -2.4 degrees. Mukteshwar in Kumaon recorded a temperature of -0.2 degrees celsius.

The technology for vaccine manufacturing and testing of goat pox vaccine was obtained from Indian Council of Agriculture Research - Indian Veterinary Research Institute (ICAR- IVRI and has been tested and certified by IVRI for commercial release. IIL’s vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine and the primary vaccination has to be done at three months of age and revaccination annually with a dose rate of 1 ml, to be administered subcutaneously (under the skin). Goat pox is highly contagious and spreads through aerosol, contact and through vectors such as flies and the disease is very severe in young, old and lactating animals. It is characterised by high fever, generalised nodules or papules over skin, face, mucus membranes of mouth, nasal cavities and severe internal lesions that results death in many cases. India has a goat population of about 150 million and this disease causes huge losses to the small animal farmers or livestock growers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/iil-launches-goat-pox-vaccine/articleshow/88378598.cms||---

Last week, Congress minister Aslam Shaikh had alleged cartelisation and rigging of the bids and demanded an Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) probe. TimesViewIn the past too, tainted firms have bagged the Byculla zoo contracts. A Rs 106 crore cost escalation in the construction of new animal enclosures raises eyebrows. The allegations by the Congress minister are serious and must be probed.Ashwini Bhide, additional municipal commissioner, said, “I have received one complaint letter...The department’s remarks are sought. The tender is under process and evaluation is underway. It has not yet reached a logical conclusion.” The BMC has sought remarks from the zoo and building maintenance department on the complaint letter. The BMC had invited tenders for two works: one for construction of new animal enclosures for black jaguar, cheetah, white lion, wallaby, chimpanzee, ring-tailed lemur, mandrill and lesser flami-ngo; and the other for building exhibits for the hippo, African savanna, emu and a bird aviary. These enclosures are to be built on land received from Poddar and Mafatlal Mills adjacent to the zoo. While the tenders were estimated to cost Rs 91 crore and Rs 94 crore, or a total of Rs 185 crore, the two companies bid Rs 146 crore and Rs 145 crore, or a total of Rs 291 crore—an overall escalation of Rs 106 crore. “The conditions incorporated in these tenders were to ensure only...Highway Construction Company and Skyway Infra Projects qualified in this tender and it can be clearly seen that each of these companies have given each other a supp-orting bid and bagged one tender each,” Shaikh claimed in his letter to BMC chief Iqbal Chahal. He has asked Chahal to scrap the tenders. “If there is no action from BMC, I will take up the issue with the ACB and other agencies,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-explain-rs-106cr-cost-escalation-in-bids-bmc-asks-byculla-zoo-and-civic-dept/articleshow/88379228.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Around 96 such people, who are in home quarantine, had expressed their desire to vote. Most of these people voted at the polling booths in south Kolkata. A State Election Commission directive asked the state administration to ensure proper facilities for Covid-19 positive patients if they want to exercise their franchise. According to sources, some Covid-19 patients called up their respective ward coordinators, expressing their desire to cast votes at the polling booths. A man in his late 50s, who is a resident of Ballygunge Place, called up a TMC leader and wanted to cast his vote at the polling booth at Ballygunge railway station. “We offered to send him a car for coming to the booth. But he insisted that he would be coming on his own. He reached the booth around 4pm and cast his vote in a PPE kit offered by the poll personnel,” said a polling agent on duty at the venue. A young resident of Beliaghata, who tested positive to Covid 10 days ago, went to a polling booth in his area and requested a polling officer to make arrangements so that he could vote. The youth who wore a PPE kit was taken to a secluded place for pressing the button on a voting machine A Trinamool Congress polling agent at Rongkol slum, located near Golf Green, got a call from a woman who had tested positive for Covid but made up her mind to visit a polling booth near Lord’s more to cast her vote. She was offered a ride to the polling booth, which she accepted, and reached the booth around 4.30pm. As per norms, the state election commission had sent a ward-wise list of Covid patients to the poll personnel across the city. While four patients from borough X — which had topped the recent list of Covid-19 cases — reached the polling booths, three each from boroughs XI and XII were seen casting their votes. Polling stations in borough I, III and XVI recorded two such patients each exercising their franchise.

---||Delhi||Delhi to assess readiness for fresh Covid fight as city records over 100 new cases after 6 months||NEW DELHI: With the number of Covid-19 cases rising in the capital — and the Omicron variant being an added concern — lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will on Monday review the state of preparedness in the city at a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority. According to sources, apart from the overall preparedness to tackle the growing number of cases, including that of the Omicron variant, the ongoing vaccination drive would also be discussed at the meeting. Ensuring Covid-appropriate behaviour at public places during the festive season would be on the table as well, the sources said. The Covid-Care Centres earlier created in different parts of the city are likely to be reopened for establishing isolation wards. The Covid Care Centre at the Commonwealth Games Village has also been prepared with oxygen beds. The meeting will be held through video conferencing, starting at 11.30 am, and will be attended by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul, Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain, revenue minister Kailash Gahlot, the chief secretary and other senior officials. Kejriwal had on Saturday said that the Delhi government was ready to tackle the Omicron variant of coronavirus and advised people not to panic. He said Delhi was unlikely to face another wave of infections since, according to the serosurvey conducted by the Delhi government, 96% of the city population was found to have antibodies and a majority of them were vaccinated. While the Delhi government had first designated isolation wards at its Lok Nayak Hospital for patients of the Omicron variant, it later directed authorities of the Max Smart Super Specialty Hospital, Saket, to establish a separate isolation unit for Covid-positive international passengers who have travelled from or transited through the countries classified as ‘countries at risk’. Directions were given to establish similar isolation units on payment basis at the Batra Hospital and Research Centre, Tughlakabad Institutional Area, Fortis Super Specialty Hospital, Vasant Kunj, and Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital. The total number of patients infected with the Omicron variant jumped by 12 on Friday to reach 22. Sunday recorded 107 fresh Covid cases in 24 hours, the highest single-day spike in nearly six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-to-assess-readiness-for-fresh-covid-fight/articleshow/88378619.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Jaipur||Easy to provoke, tough to calm: Rajasthan CM||JAIPUR: Taking the debate on Hindutva further, chief minister Ashok Gehlot said that West and East Pakistan were created on the lines of Muslim religion further divided into two separate nations—Pakistan and Bangladesh over the difference in language is a lesson for those batting for religious fanatism brand of politics in the country. While delivering his concluding remarks on the third anniversary of the government in a state programme at his residence, Gehlot said, “Those talking about Hindu Rastra should tell where they will ask people of other religion to go?. India is the land of several languages Telegu, Malayalam, Gujarati, Punjabi etc and (Pakistan) had only two languages – Urdu and Bengali. How will ask everyone to keep one language in the country.” Underlining the dangers of extremism, he said 40 years ago in our childhood there was a demand for separation on the basis of the Telegu language. “How would you ensure unity under these circumstances. That’s why I say that it easy to fan provocation but not easy to calm it down,” said Gehlot. Recalling the contribution of the father of nation Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, BR Ambedkar, Sardar Vallabhai Patel and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad in creating policies which are protected the nation, he said, “I always say that Constitution is supreme and sacrosanct. If we sincerely follow the constitution, the nation will have harmony forever,” Gehlot expressed concern that he could see that people are worried due to the prevailing situation in the country. “It appears that Constitution and democracy are in danger which is not a thing to happen,” said Gehlot. Taking a swipe at PM Narendra Modi, he said, “Modi ji promised 2 crore jobs annually and assurance to bring money from the Swiss Banks. He, however, has stopped repeating these claims,” said Gehlot while informing that they had provided 1 lakh government jobs and 80,000 are in the pipeline. He stressed the need of creating more jobs in the private sector to provide jobs to unemployed youths. “I have been meeting business conglomerates for the investment summit programme to ensure that investments will bring more jobs in the private sector.” Responding to the opposition claims of the highest crime rate in the state, Gehlot defended by stating that since the state follows a policy that no one is denied of filling FIR has shot the figures. “Our state has provided a great relief to the people by ensuring that if the police station doesn’t file a complaint, the SP office has to register it. The resultant effect is that at least cases are being recorded,” said Gehlot. BOX CM on inauguration spree Chief minister Ashok Gehlot laid the foundation stone and inaugurated a total of 1,194 projects to mark the third anniversary of his government on Sunday. These projects are under 12 departments with an estimated budget of Rs 1,122 crore. These include laying the foundation stones of 90 projects with an estimated cost of Rs 454 crore and inaugurating 1,104 projects worth Rs 668 crore. Gehlot informed they have allocated Rs 200 crore for the Udaan scheme for providing free sanitary pads for females across the state.

---||Dehradun||Paper validates efficacy of chyawanprash, says Patanjali||HARIDWAR: A research paper validating the efficacy of chyawanprash has been published in “Frontiers in Pharmacology”, a Switzerland-based peer-reviewed journal that specialises in submissions on traditional medical approaches. General secretary of Patanjali Research Foundation Trust (PRFT) Acharya Balkrishna claimed this is the first research done to prove chyawanprash’s health benefits scientifically. Calling this “beginning of a new mission” and “yet another landmark achievement in deciphering ancient Ayurvedic knowledge in the light of modern science”, Balkrishna said the paper, which contained research done on the chyawanprash formulated by Patanjali Ayurved, proves that the health supplement helps fight inflammation, fever, cough and cold. Anurag Varshney, vice president of Patanjali Research Institute (PRI), told TOI that scientists had conducted studies with samples of ‘Patanjali Special Chyawanprash’ on human immune cells and on five groups of 24 adult wild type zebrafish each. “Zebrafish were fed on PSCP-infused pellets at stipulated doses for 13 days before inducing inflammation through lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection… PSCP exerted a strong prophylactic effect on the zebrafish that efficiently protected them from inflammatory manifestations at a human equivalent dose,” an excerpt from the paper reads. Varshney said like humans, zebrafish also became less active when down with fever and when “fed the chyawanprash, the fish’s biomarker CRP came back down to normal levels and their agility and locomotive behaviour got better”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/1st-research-paper-published-in-intl-scientific-journal-that-proves-chyavanprash-has-health-benefits-claims-patanjali/articleshow/88377905.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

The incident came to light in the afternoon when he was being questioned by the investigators at a special cell office. He went to the bathroom for some time and, upon his return, claimed to have consumed the substance. Kataria was rushed to a hospital in Rohini and, then, taken to AIIMS. His condition was said to be stable. Police were probing if he was lying. Meanwhile, investigators claimed that Kataria was trying to mislead them. Sources said when he was confronted with the CCTV footage about his movements in court, he claimed to have no idea about it. TOI was the first to report on Saturday that the blast was not terror related and had been orchestrated by a DRDO scientist. Kataria started planning the attack a month ago and procured the essentials through e-commerce sites and other means, which cops are verifying. He used an anti-theft system meant for bikes as a remote control to trigger the blast. He is suspected to have learned the technique online using DIY videos and web pages, apart from using his professional expertise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rohini-blast-accused-in-hospital-after-drinking-acidic-substance-stable/articleshow/88378625.cms||---

In the first phase, 28-30 lakh women will be benefited by this scheme and in the next phase which will start from March, a total of 1.20 crore women will be benefitted through Udaan scheme. On such a large scale, this is a unique initiative of Rajasthan in the country itself,” said Gehlot.

The model who has appeared in advertisements of several leading brands said that during her long stay in the village during the lockdown, she understood the problems in detail. “People need better healthcare, roads, education and employment. There is corruption that does not allow aid to reach the poor,” she said.

Entry to the city was restricted on Sunday due to the Section 144 imposed for polling. BJP leaders will also move a breach of privilege motion before Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla for restricting movements outside the KMC area. While Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar is in Balurghat, BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh is in Delhi for the Parliament winter session. At Bidhannagar, leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari called a meeting of south Bengal leaders. By the time they reached his GC Block residence, they were stopped. A little after the BJP leaders entered Adhikari’s house, a large team of Bidhannagar Police surrounded the area by 3pm. Bengal BJP vice president Jayprakash Majumdar got into a heated exchange of words with DC (headquarters) Surya Prakash Yadav of Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate when cops stopped them from coming out. “This area does not fall under the jurisdiction of Kolkata. How can they stop free movement of citizens in the area where Section 144 is not imposed?” Majumdar asked. By 5 pm, BJP leaders, including Kolkata civic poll in-charge Arjun Singh, tried to come out when they were stopped by police. “This area is in North 24 Parganas and the poll is being held in KMC area. There is no valid reason for them to stop us,” Singh said. They were finally allowed to go at 6.10 pm. At MLA Hostel on Kyd Street, eight BJP legislators alleged that the main gate was locked since the afternoon and they could not come out. “We were supposed to reach Bidhannagar for a party programme. But the cops locked the main gate,” said Sudip Mukherjee, MLA of Purulia. Bankura’s BJP MLA Niladri Sekhar Dana was stopped near Vidyasagar Setu while he was going to Bidhannagar to attend the meeting. Later in the evening 15 BJP legislators reached Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar’s office. “We could be freed after the Governor stepped in” said Adhikari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/movements-restricted-outside-kmc-area-bjp/articleshow/88378620.cms||Rohit Khanna

The Alappuzha district collector has issued prohibitory orders under Section 144 in Alappuzha on Sunday and Monday to pre-empt public unrest and violence. Workers of BJP-RSS and SDPI were among around 50 people taken into custody so far, said IG (south zone) Harshitha Attaluri who is in charge of the probe. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan condemned the killings and said the government would take strict action against those involved. BJP state president K Surendran said Ranjith's murder was planned and executed by Popular Front of India, whose political arm is SDPI. He said RSS or BJP had no role in Shan's murder. SDPI state general secretary PK Usman alleged that a "serious conspiracy" was behind the killing as there was no political tension in Mannanchery that could've led to such an attack. Ranjith, 44, was murdered around 6.30am after a group of men broke into his house and stabbed him in front of his mother, wife and daughter. He was rushed to Alappuzha general hospital, but could not be saved. Police have recovered CCTV visuals of 12 people walking through a bylane and escaping in six bikes after the crime. The autopsy will be conducted at Alappuzha government medical college hospital on Monday. Ranjith was a lawyer and so is his wife Lisha. Bhagya and Hridya, students of class IX and VII, are his daughters. The attack on Shan, 38, happened around 7.30pm on Saturday at Kuppezham junction. The SDPI member was returning home on his two-wheeler when he was knocked down by a car and stabbed repeatedly by a four-member gang. They escaped in that car. Shan was seriously wounded in his arms, legs, abdomen and head. He was rushed to a hospital but later succumbed to his wounds.

District and sessions Judge P M Gupta’s order did not mention for which previous offence the accused was lodged in jail. Additional public prosecutor Vijay Mundhe told the court that on June 22, 2019, the accused, then aged 24, came to the jail’s clinic for treatment without informing the staff. The accused asked a sepoy deployed there to shift an undertrial being treated at the clinic to another hospital. When the sepoy expressed his inability to do so, the accused hurled abuses at him, attacked him with a stone and tore his uniform. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-trans-person-gets-2-yr-ri-for-jail-staff-attack/articleshow/88379240.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Residents’ miseries likely to continue even as road work on||Thiruvananthapuram: As the first phase of work on Manacaud-Kallattumukku road progresses, the residents of Kallattumukku are upset. With interlock tiles being laid on this stretch, the height of the road has increased significantly. As the area is low-lying, water will flow into the houses and shops, say residents. The completion of road work will only be a temporary relief as the drainage is blocked due to soil and other waste materials, they added. “The water level increases during rains and the pits on roads are not visible. In the past two years, we have witnessed many accidents and deaths. Repairing the roads without clearing the drainage block is not a good idea. The roads will get destroyed again and similar things will continue. However, this is a temporary relief,” said Abdul Rasheed, a resident of Kallattumukku. According to local residents, the newly-constructed road will not solve the problem of water logging. “All that is needed is to clear the drainage blocks. The water logging will continue till the blocks are cleared. If water logging recurs, there is a possibility of tiles getting damaged. As a result, the road will be damaged again and accidents will occur,” said a resident. As water from other places flows towards Kallattumukku, the area gets flooded during the rain. Accidents are common as the water level rises to knee height. Recurring water logging has caused serious damage to the road. The Manacaud-Kallattumukku road has been blocked since last Tuesday due to road construction and PWD officers said that it would be completed by December 28. The work is causing inconvenience to those travelling to Thiruvallam road since they have to take a diversion. The wholesale and retail shop owners in the area are unable to conduct business as customers cannot reach their shops. “As the vehicles are being blocked, no customers are coming to the shop. The sloping concrete portion of the sides can cause accidents and the water can flow more strongly into the low-lying areas, including my shop,” said Davood Khalid, a plant shop owner. The authorities said that the drainage will be cleared as soon as funds are available. “The work will be completed by December 28. The sloping concrete is laid on both sides as an essential setup. The decision is to repair the drainage as soon as funds are available. The water logging issue can be resolved only after removing the drainage blocks,” said a PWD official. “The road repair is being done as a preliminary process. In order to remove the drainage block, a proposal has been given to the higher authority. The drainage issue will be resolved in collaboration with the irrigation department,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/residents-miseries-likely-to-continue-even-as-road-work-on/articleshow/88378630.cms||---

The motorcycle ambulances will be a part of the new agreement between the state government and a private firm, GVK-EMRI, for running the government ambulances services. The state government and GVK-EMRI have signed a pact to run a total of 917 ambulances. Earlier, the state government had only 34 ALS ambulances. For the last eight years, GVK-EMRI has been providing free 108 ambulance response services to the people of Rajasthan with 701 ambulances. Now the agreement has been renewed and the number of ambulances will be increased from 701 to 917. "For the first time, the motorcycle ambulances are being included in the fleet of 108 ambulance response services. A total of 45 bike ambulances will operate to cater to emergency cases. Motorcycle ambulances will be deployed at old city areas and populated narrow streets areas where the big 108 ambulances (ALS/BLS) cannot reach. The motorcycle ambulances will act as the first responder 24*7," said, Praveen Sawant, state head-GVK-EMRI. "Whenever an emergency call is received from an area where the ALS/BLS is unable to reach due to narrow street, the nearest motorcycle ambulance shall be assigned to reach the spot and stabilise the victim or provide first aid till the arrival of nearest ALS/BLS ambulances," he said. Ambulances under the 108 emergency response services run by the state government remain available 24x7 free of charge for the people who need ambulances to reach hospitals. The 108 ambulances services will be known as the Chiranjeevi Ambulance Yojana, which is expected to revolutionise the emergency care scenario in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/917-bike-advanced-life-support-ambulances-to-boost-emergency-response-in-state/articleshow/88379249.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Tribunal rejects claim of Rs 9.5 crore in motor accident case, frowns upon ‘fact manipulation’||NEW DELHI: While dismissing a petition for a claim of Rs 9.5 crore by the family of a man who was allegedly killed in a motor accident, a Delhi tribunal said that while sympathising with the bereaved family, the case facts appeared to have been manipulated, with eyewitnesses emerging after police had filed a closure report. Additional sessions judge Shuchi Laler declared that allowing claims against insurance companies through a collusion between the claimants and the vehicle owner would not only mock the judicial system, but also encourage middlemen who arranged such collusions between parties. These observations came after the court noted the manner in which the initially unknown offending vehicle was suddenly identified six months after the accident by two alleged eyewitnesses and the defence case mounted by the owner of the vehicle. This strongly indicated a collusion among the vehicle owner, brother of the deceased and the two so-called eyewitnesses, the court said. The court’s earlier grant of a Rs 1.1 crore compensation to be paid to the family of the deceased by an insurance company had been challenged in Delhi High Court, which set aside the order and sent the file back to the trial court for a relook. When the matter came before the Motor Act Claims Tribunal again, the insurance company was permitted to cross-examine one of the petitioner’s witness on the ground that following his testimony to MACT, the witness had turned hostile during his deposition before a magistrate in the criminal case related to the accident. On December 14, the tribunal noted that the case filed by the brother of the deceased in 2010 did not mention the registration number, make, model and colour of the vehicle involved. And though police were unable to trace the offending vehicle, the brother submitted in writing to the cops that two persons had witnessed the accident. One witness stated that he did not know how he was traced by the relatives of the deceased. The other said that he went to police to give his statement after seeing news of the accident on TV. He too admitted being approached by the brother of the deceased. The court observed that the offending vehicle hadn’t suffered any damage in the accident. It also said that the vehicle owner did not try to prove his defence case by cross examining the two eyewitnesses, but admitted to involvement in the accident. Saying that a collusion between the contending parties in cases involving a big insurance amount couldn’t be ruled out, MACT, “The tribunal cannot be a silent spectator to the collusion between vehicle owners and claimants, especially in cases where the police filed a closure/untrace report on the ground that the offending vehicle could not be traced and so-called eyewitnesses come forward and supported the case of the claimants before the tribunal and the case of the vehicle owner/driver before the criminal court, thereby actually duping the insurance companies … of crores of rupees.” It added, “Though the tribunal fully sympathises with the pain and suffering of the petitioners due to sudden demise of the deceased, at the same time, it is equally the responsibility of the tribunal to ensure that the process of justice is not abused.” The additional sessions court observed that the insurance company could not be made liable to pay compensation in cases where the accident had either been staged or the insured vehicle had replaced an uninsured vehicle actually involved in the accident or when the accident was a hit-and-run case where the offending vehicle couldn’t be traced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tribunal-rejects-claim-of-rs-9-5-crore-in-motor-accident-case-frowns-upon-fact-manipulation/articleshow/88378648.cms||Usha Das

---||Mumbai||MVA promoting culture of graft & touts: Union home minister Amit Shah||PUNE: Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday accused the MVA government of promoting a culture of corruption and touts since coming to office. He also claimed that Shiv Sena ditched BJP and compromised on the Hindutva agenda for the lure of power, report & Shiladitya Pandit. At a BJP workers’ meet ahead of the civic polls in February, Shah said: “They have given a new meaning to the term DBT (direct benefit transfer). While Congress has taken ‘D’ for dealer, Sena has ‘B’ for broker and NCP ‘T’ for transfer-cut money. Amit Shah likens MVA govt to an auto with 3 flat tyresUnion home minister Amit Shah on Sunday described the MVA government in the state as “an autorickshaw with three punctured tyres — all going in different directions and barely working. It just emits gas and increases pollution”. He went on to dare MVA functionaries to step down and together fight an election against BJP. “I was in a power-sharing alliance talk with the Shiv Sena for the 2019 assembly polls. It was decided that Devendra Fadnavis will be the chief minister and the elections will be fought under his leadership. But BJP was backstabbed by Sena, which was eyeing the CM’s post. Sena compromised with the agenda of Hindutva for power,” Shah said. He said BJP was being blamed for inflation when the Centre had cut tax on fuel. He said many states cut the tax, but not Maharashtra. “Maharashtra government instead reduced the levy on liquor,” Shah said. He said the Pune Municipal Corporation polls will script the fall of the MVA government. Prior to the party workers’ meeting, Shah unveiled a statue of Babasaheb Ambedkar and laid the foundation for a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at the new main building of PMC. He also addressed the ‘Convocation 2021’ at the Vaikunth Mehta National Institute of Cooperative Management (VAMNICOM). At PMC, Shah said: “Congress has not left any opportunity to keep Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar away from the mainstream. BJP wants to acknowledge the works of Ambedkar and bring him into limelight.” “Ambedkar has played a major role in making the Constitution a reality. The unification of society across classes could become possible due to this Constitution. His contributions pre- and post-Independence are remarkable,” Shah said, adding that the celebration of Constitution Day has been started by the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. At VAMNICOM, he said the Centre is working on a new policy for cooperatives. He said a central university for cooperative management is in the works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-amit-shah-likens-mva-govt-to-an-auto-with-3-flat-tyres/articleshow/88379265.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad municipal corporation junks 9 traffic-easing plans||AHMEDABAD: At least nine projects mooted for easing the traffic flow in the city have been junked by the civic body. The projects had also intended to reduce accidents at ‘nuisance junctions’. Technical problems and numerous other reasons have been cited by the AMC to reject the plans. The report junking various mobility projects has been accessed by TOI. The report was prepared on September 15 this year. The report has been shared by the additional city engineer (traffic) of the AMC. The AMC said that the plans necessitate a change in the overall alignment of roads and bridges and require the shifting of underground utilities. In some cases, the AMC said that construction will be impractical. The structures were suggested by the CSIR-Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), which was engaged by the civic body a few months ago to suggest a mobility plan for the city. The widening of Chimanbhai flyover, for instance, was dumped as AMC engineers said that the flyover cannot handle heavy traffic any longer. As circumstances stand now, a traffic jam builds up on the flyover even if a vehicle breaks down. The flyover is a major route for traffic moving towards Gandhinagar. At Vadaj Circle, the Bhimjipura-Chandlodia overbridge plan has been put on hold because of the Sabarmati Ashram redevelopment project. The project makes a change of alignment of the bridge necessary. The AMC has also struck down the proposal to build underpasses and flyovers in the eastern part of the city which records the highest number of road fatalities. Between January 2019 and February this year, 491 people were killed in road accidents; the figure was 395 in the west. In the whole of 2020, 592 accidents occurred in eastern Ahmedabad, of which 191 were fatal. In western Ahmedabad during the same period, 493 accidents occurred of which 118 were fatal. In 2019, 772 accidents occurred in the eastern part of the city while there were 592 in the west. In the eastern part areas such as Nikol, Odhav, Ramol, and Amraiwadi 54 road fatalities were recorded. Moreover, 49 fatalities were registered in Danilimda, Kagdapith, and Narol. While in the west, the highest number of accidents were recorded in Chandkheda, Ranip, Sabarmati, and Riverfront east police stations. “In the eastern parts of the city, residential, commercial, and industrial clusters literally overlap one another,” an AMC official said. “Also, heavy vehicles such as dumpers and lorries pose a danger to pedestrians, cyclists, and two-wheeler riders. We need more planning in those areas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-junks-9-traffic-easing-plans/articleshow/88378650.cms||Soumitra Trivedi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Delivery man lets go of day’s pay to save hurt dog||MUMBAI: Your city does have a heart, after all. A delivery boy recently provided some food for thought in the alacrity with which he went out of his way to pick up an injured stray dog to get it to hospital. Last week, Hasan Shaikh (32) was on duty, delivering food parcels for Zomato customers around Kurla when he happened to chance upon a stray dog, lying in deep distress. As the dog was visibly in pain and writhing on the road, Shaikh called up animal activist Vijay Mohanani of Bombay Animal Rights (BAR) to ask for an animal ambulance to get the stray canine to hospital. “Since an animal ambulance was not immediately available, I asked Hasan if he could arrange for a private car or an autorickshaw in order to transport the dog to the animal hospital in Deonar,” said Mohanani. And, he was pleasantly surprised to learnt that this Zomato delivery man picked up the injured dog and gently put him inside one of his food delivery bags. He then rode his motorcycle straight to Deonar where he reached the hospital within 20 minutes from Kurla. “Shaikh did not even bother about the fact that he would be losing almost a day's wages by going out of his way to help an animal,” said Mohanani. BAR has now appreciated Shaikh’s compassion towards animals by rewarding him Rs 1,500 in order to compensate for the loss of his day’s salary. When Zomato learned about why Shaikh had skipped the day’s work earlier, it gifted him a new helmet, a bag and a mobile phone stand to appreciate his gesture. When TOI contacted Shaikh, he said: “It feels nice to see people praising you for your efforts. However, I have been feeding and helping animals since childhood.” Recalling theincident about the injured dog from Kurla, he said that it seemed like either a vehicle had run over him or someone had hit him badly. “I just could not carry on with my regular work after seeing this dog. Unfortunately, he could not make it after being admitted to the animal hospital; but at least I tried.” Shaikh, who lives in Mahul, Chembur, had taken up the job at the food delivery chain six months ago to support his family, said Mohanani “I first came in touch with him earlier this year when he had jumped into a gutter to rescue a dog. He is an energetic animal welfare person, and therefore BAR has appreciated his efforts,” said Mohanani. When Shaikh was asked about the current scenario, where many animal feeders are being harassed by residents and animal haters, Shaikh said: “I feel that everyone in our society should live in harmony with a lot of ‘pyaar-mohabbat’ [love] for each other and also for animals. If you give just one biscuit to a dog, he or she will become your friend for life. So, let us all live together in harmony with animals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/delivery-man-lets-go-of-days-pay-to-save-hurt-dog/articleshow/88377954.cms||Vijay Singh

Police said accused Jaspal Singh Jassa and his mother Satnam Kaur, 46, suspected the elderly woman, Swaran Kaur, 70, of practising witchcraft on them. All three are residents of the village.Swaran’s son Gurmel Singh, an eye-witness, said, “Like every day, my mother and I were going to a gurdwara in the village around 6.30am. My mother was walking ahead of me. At a turn near the gurdwara, Jaspal lay in wait and stabbed her when she reached there. On hearing her cries, I ran towards her and saw Jaspal stabbing her. He stabbed her five to six times. She was bleeding excessively. Jaspal escaped from the spot and I took my mother to a hospital, where doctors declared her dead.”Meharban SHO inspector Lovedeep Singh said, “The family of the accused had a rivalry with the victim. Satnam accused Swaran of practising witchcraft on her family. This often led to verbal spats between them. On Saturday night, too, Jaspal and Satnam had gone to Sawaran’s house and fought with her, asking her to admit that she did black magic on them. However, Swaran refuted the allegations.”“Jaspal was furious over Swaran not admitting it. And so, he, along with his mother, hatched a conspiracy to kill her. Jaspal took a kitchen knife from his house and waited for Swaran near the village gurdwara. He knew she went there early in the morning. He stabbed her several times and escaped. We have arrested Jaspal and Satnam,” the inspector added.A case has been registered under sections 302 (murder), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120 (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/neighbour-kills-70-yr-old-for-practising-witchcraft/articleshow/88377959.cms||---

Naqvi, who was in Dhule district’s Dondaicha to inaugurate several development works, said the PM did not forget to focus on inclusive development by helping people of all communities. “Modi focused on capacity-building awareness and at the same time, got the infrastructure ready to fight Covid. As a result, the country, which used to import personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and other things, is now self-reliant and is producing medical equipment, medicines and vaccines. This has ensured better treatment of citizens,” he said. “We now have a robust healthcare system to fight Covid,” Naqvi said. Speaking about the all-inclusive policy of the Government of India, the minister said 9 crore women benefited from the Ujjwala Yojana, in which the below poverty line (BPL) families were given free LPG connections. Of them, 38% of women were from the minority community. He said a total of 44 crore accounts were opened under the Jan Dhan Yojana — the financial inclusion scheme — in which 32% of minorities have benefited.  Naqvi also warned against the political parties that were engaged in derailing the progress and prosperity achieved by the country in a short time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pm-a-troubleshooter-says-minister-of-minority-affair/articleshow/88509753.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||60% ventures shut shop, 53% sprouted: GEM report||Ahmedabad: The year 2020 was challenging for the businesses – but Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) report for 2020-21 highlighted that how Covid-19 changed the entire landscape for Indian entrepreneurs. For the start, the report said that about 60% of the respondents said that they knew someone who had shut their business during the period. But the silver lining is, 53% also said that they knew someone who had started afresh, giving only 7% dip in net ventures. Dr Sunil Shukla, director general of EDII and lead author of the report for India, said that the report encompassing 47 countries has both hits and misses. “The overall sentiments – right from starting a new venture to nascent firms keeping afloat – went south. The reason was primarily fear induced by the lockdown. But it was also the time of quicker thinking and finding opportunities – many either pivoted their existing practices or found a new opportunity to cater to the emerging market,” he said, adding that the ventures looked inward and targeted local markets when international demand dried up. The report, launched recently by Union minister Narayan Rane, also delved upon issues of gender factor, perceived opportunities, government support and household income. Amit Kumar Dwivedi, associate professor at EDII and co-author of the report, said that compared to men, women entrepreneurs were hit harder. “Compared to 53% drop in activities for men, it was 79% if we compare the results of 2019-20 and 2020-21 survey. Moreover, compared to 35% who said that they intend to start up in next three years, the number dipped to 22% this time,” he said, Pankaj Bharti, assistant professor at EDII and co-author of the report, said that there are glimmers of hope, though. “The pandemic taught entrepreneurs to think fast, mobilize their resources to profitable and sustainable ventures and also look at various avenues to fund their dreams. The number of youths who felt that they possess the skills for a venture has kept increasing, this time reaching 82%,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/60-ventures-shut-shop-53-sprouted-gem-report/articleshow/88378711.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Hyderabad||Missing Jawan emptied two accounts by December 16: Telangana cops||HYDERABAD: Missing Army jawan B Sai Kiran Reddy is yet to be located by the Telangana police. Police found that Reddy has two debit cards with him and he withdrew almost the entire amount in both linked bank accounts. Meanwhile, the search in Karimnagar town, where the last ATM withdrawal took place, so far remained futile. After a Siddipet police team, which went to Punjab to locate the whereabouts of the 21-year-old gunner, traced his movements back from Bathinda railway station to New Delhi railway station on December 6, there were no further clues till December 16, when a cash withdrawal took place from his SBI account at Karimnagar town. Police were unaware of this second bank account till the family members informed them. “We were only informed about his Punjab National Bank account from which he withdrew Rs 19000 on December 6 while travelling from Bathinda to Delhi. The balance in that account became less than Rs 100. The family members informed a few days ago about the joint account in SBI he holds with his father,” a police official from Siddipet said. According to police, the balance in the SBI account was about Rs 1,500 and Reddy almost emptied that account too. “His latest withdrawal was from an Andhra Bank ATM near Karimnagar bus station. From the cash withdrawals by Sai Kiran so far, we know that he withdrew about Rs 20,000 from December 6 onwards and spent about Rs 4,000 on taxi fare from Bathinda to Delhi. Rest of the amount he might have spent towards travel from Delhi to Karimnagar, lodging and food. So far, he has not contacted the family or friends,” an investigator said. In the last three days, police along with the family searched lodges in Karimnagar town and other places he might have possibly visited. However, so far, they have not managed to locate him. From CCTV footage analysed so far while tracking Sai Kiran, police found him moving alone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/missing-jawan-emptied-two-accounts-by-dec-16-cops/articleshow/88378653.cms||---

Zubair, a resident of Bagh-e-Jahan Ara in Old City, was on his way back home from Attapur when the manja got entangled around his throat at New Jiyaguda, where a few youngsters were flying kites. Zubair then fell off his two-wheeler and sustained injuries on his neck. “After the manja got entangled around my throat I fell off my moving bike. Even though the youngsters who were flying kites saw me bleeding, they fled from the spot. I struggled to stand up and rushed to a nearby hospital. There, I was told to go to Osmania General Hospital,” Zubair told TOI. Zubair got five stitches on his throat as it was a deep cut. He said that the officials are at fault as the banned Chinese manja is still being sold illegally. He sought immediate action by the Forests and Wildlife Protection Society (FAWPS) officials into the matter. Mirza Karim Baig, founder and president of FAWPS told TOI that the matter was brought to the government’s notice. “Such incidents need to be taken seriously by officials,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/man-injured-after-banned-chinese-manja-slits-neck/articleshow/88378655.cms||Omar bin Taher

---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Election year forces civic authorities to revise its budget||LUDHIANA: With it being an election year, the civic authorities had given a nod to more development works, especially those of roads and streets. Therefore, they have to revise their annual budget, for which they will put up a resolution in the MC general house meeting on December 22. If passed, the resolution will go to the local bodies department for approval. Against the sanctioned budget, the MC has spent Rs 144.65 crore in excess. But residents are not impressed. They say the civic officials did all the construction work in the past one year and nothing in the previous four years, when they were forced to pass through deep potholes. For this year’s budget of the MC, the local bodies department had sanctioned Rs 116.8 crore for works of bridges and road branch, but the officials have either spent on or have started works worth Rs 261.45 crore, which is Rs 144.65 crore in excess. Major hike has come in the repair and construction of roads—from Rs 35 crore to Rs 95 crore. The budget of works related with streets and drains also increased from Rs 40 crore to Rs 108 crore. Sources say since it was election year, they could not deny works to any councillor or MLA. Apart from bitumen work, many tasks like installation of interlocking tiles in the inner areas and also roadsides have been undertaken. The officials are tight-lipped over the issue. A senior MC officer says due to poll year, more works were done, and they will show an increase in their expenses in the MC house. He says they will also put up a resolution that MC is taking around Rs 100-crore loan, therefore their income will also get revised. “As per the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court, we cannot go ahead with development works in case we do not have funds to clear the outstanding liabilities,” he adds. MC additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal says, “The resolution will be tabled in the MC house meeting for revision of expenses and it is up to the members to approve it or not.” Activist Kuldeep Khaira says, “For almost four years, people braved potholes and many became accident victims. And now when elections are round the corner, the officials are constructing more roads. People should not vote for such parties or politicians who work only when elections are near.” Solid waste management resolution The MC officials will also bring a resolution related with solid waste management in the MC house meeting and tell the members about measures being taken for hiring an agency to process the garbage. The officials claim that on Monday, consultants will come from Delhi for a presentation on the solid waste management project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/election-year-forces-mc-to-revise-its-budget/articleshow/88377969.cms||Nidhi Bhardwaj

The three freedom fighters were executed by the British on December 19, 1927. The artists also decided to undertake the renovation of Abbie Rich Inter College, a school founded by an American social worker in the 1850s. The school is the alma mater of Bismil and Ashfaq, who studied there till class VIII. The institution has also preserved attendance records from the early 20th century when Bismil and Ashfaq were students there.  The school is currently facing infrastructural issues, which SRM activists said they will try and address. “The outer area of the building was whitewashed nearly 40 years ago and in 2017, all the teachers had to contribute to painting the classrooms," said principal Mihir Phillips. In 1991, some students put up statues of the two heroes on school grounds. The authorities have for a long time wanted to replace them with better statues in marble. “The statues are placed facing the wall, making it difficult for anyone to see the faces from either inside or outside the school. We have contacted the minorities commission, MLAs, and even MPs but no one has come forward to support us. Even UP's health education minister Suresh Khanna, who is an eight-time MLA from the city, studied in this school till class X," said Phillips. Khanna was invited as a chief guest at the event. He skipped commenting on the issue of the school but said that his party is doing "everything possible" to ensure that due respect is given to the heroes of the freedom movement. Meanwhile, Shamim Azad, general secretary of the SRM committee, announced that the committee will run a campaign to ensure that the school commemorates its past. "Abbie Rich holds immense historic value for everyone in the district. It has been neglected by the government. Local politicians didn’t pay heed to it either. We will now connect with people through our shows, meet industrialists, and ensure that the school of our heroes gets due respect.” Besides being the place where Bismil and Ashfaqullah forged their friendship while they were students, the school also had many students and even teachers who served in both World War I and World War II. Their names have been commemorated on a wall plaque. It currently has over 700 students, with nearly 200 being girls. Studies are free till class VIII, while a minimal fee is charged for higher classes, said principal Phillips.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/theatre-artists-pay-tribute-to-kakori-conspiracy-heroes-pledge-to-renovate-school-where-they-studied/articleshow/88377982.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Mumbai||HC ensures wife, kids of Ghana man told to ‘Leave India’ can return later||Mumbai: Ensuring that the Indian wife and children of a Ghana national can return to India in future, Bombay high court allowed them to leave the country. The direction was passed by justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar on Friday on a petition by George Nesta Kwofie and Surpriya Bhopale who reside in Pune. They had challenged a ‘Leave India’ notice by Foreign Regional Registration Office (FRRO) when they were in Bengaluru. George came to India in 2012 to pursue a BCom degree in Pune. The couple married on October 16, 2014. In December 2015 Surpriya shifted to Bengaluru for work. George registered himself with the FRRO there. When his visa came up for extension in July 2016, the officer insisted his wife remain present. She could not as she had just delivered their first child. Thereafter, George made multiple visits. On July 31, 2017, he was served a ‘Leave India’ notice. On Thursday, the judges were told by senior advocate Mihir Desai, for the couple, that George does not wish to pursue the challenge, and in fact, wants to leave India with his family. The judges expressed concern about his wife and two children, “that they could return to India should that need arise in future.” On Friday, Desai submitted two affidavits by the couple. George said he proposes to return before February 15, 2022 to Ghana where he has a well-settled family. He said he is an economist and marketing consultant and assured he would take care of his family. Under the Citizenship Act of Ghana, 2000, a non-citizen married to a Ghanaian citizen may apply for citizenship and consequently, his two children are eligible for citizenship. Surpriya’s affidavit said she and her sons have valid visas for Ghana for 12 months from October 7, 2021. She said she wishes to keep visiting her father in Sangli. Allowing the couple and their children to leave India before February 15, 2022, the judges directed the immigration authorities to allow them to pass immigration and board their flight out of India. They said so long as Surpriya and her sons have Indian citizenship and are travelling on valid Indian passports, they will be allowed entry. Further, “even if the two minor children and wife obtain citizenship of Ghana, and in consequence are required to surrender their Indian passports, they should be permitted re-entry into India on the basis that the wife will at the very least be an Overseas Citizen of India by birth.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-ensures-wife-kids-of-ghana-man-told-to-leave-india-can-return-later/articleshow/88363797.cms||Rosy Sequeira

In a heart-warming display of rare integrity, two TRB jawans, who were posted near the police commissioner’s office, called up the senior citizen to apprise him about his wallet. While he was very happy and also surprised, the senior citizen appreciated the two jawans’ honesty when he went to collect his purse. Bhupendra Raiji a resident of Athwalines area, took VRS from his work as an insurance agent in a bank a few years ago. The elderly man regularly goes out for morning walks and on Sunday morning, after his routine walk, went to fill petrol in his vehicle and returned home. “When I was returning home, my mobile phone rang but I did not receive the call as I was driving. When I reached home, the phone was ringing again, and I noticed the call was from an unknown number. I received the call, and the caller identified himself and told me that he and his colleague found my wallet and asked me to collect it from the point where they have been deputed near the police commissioner’s office. Only then did I realize that my wallet was actually missing. It must have fell off,” the senior citizen told TOI. Bhupendrabhai reached the spot where he met the two TRB jawans — Suresh Rathod and Hiren Patel — who said they found his number from a laboratory receipt in the wallet which also had around Rs 9,000 in cash besides other important documents. “I truly appreciate their rare integrity and honesty. We will call them to our senior citizen’s club and felicitate them for their wonderful deed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/two-traffic-brigade-jawans-return-senior-citizens-wallet/articleshow/88378195.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Online honey trap: Three from Rajasthan arrested||Thiruvananthapuram: The city cyber police have arrested three men hailing from Rajasthan on charges of extorting a huge sum from a city youth following online honey trap. The police identified the accused as Vallabh Patidar, 23, Ashok Patidar, 26, and Nilesh Patidar, 19, hailing from Durgapur district in Rajasthan. The cyber police officials said that the three accused were caught following an investigation that extended over two months. An IT professional residing in the city is the complainant. He had lost over Rs 10 lakh to the gang after he fell prey to their trap. City cyber crime police station house officer DSP T Syamlal said that the gang trapped the complainant through a pop-up advertisement they had placed on a pornographic website. Through the advertisement, the complainant got in touch with the gang, who offered to provide him lewd content. Later, one of the gang members contacted him from another number pretending to be a CBI officer and threatened to publish his online activities on social media. Following this, the complainant transferred an extortion amount through online money wallets in several installments. He approached the police with a complaint when the gang continued to demand more money. “The gang constantly kept changing their locations, making it difficult to track them. After studying the movement pattern of their mobile phone signals, we noticed that they always returned to Durgapur district, following which we confirmed it as their base of operations,” said Syamlal. After they were taken into custody, it was revealed that the gang committed similar offenses in the past too. Majority of their victims were school students who used their phones, meant for online classes, to browse pornographic websites. No complaints were made against them earlier as they often extorted small amounts, ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000, depending on the age and financial capabilities of the victim, the DSP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/online-honey-trap-three-from-rajasthan-arrested/articleshow/88378668.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The government should look at slums and not just the main areas. What is the use of tweeting that they will take away cantonment?” he said at a press conference.

---||Nagpur||With only 2 mths for Term-2 exam, CBSE schools worried about completing syllabus||CBSE schools are now worried about completion of course for term-2, which accounts for 50% of the syllabus, as they get just two months to do it. Starting from the current academic session, CBSE has changed the way board exams are conducted. Term-1 board exams were conducted in November-December based on half of the syllabus. Term-2 may be held in March and marks of both the exams will be used to tabulate final marksheet. A CBSE school principal said, “Now, term-2 will take care of the other half of syllabus but many of us are lagging behind. In a normal year, Std X and XII syllabus study is completed by December or maximum mid-January. But this year, we did not have all students joining in offline mode, which created lots of problems in conducting classes. Online classes just don’t not have the same impact as we had expected.” For schools in Nagpur, it is a double whammy as they reopened late. Another CBSE principal said, “For rural areas, schools reopened months ago and they had a head start. But since bulk of the students come from city, physical attendance was not very encouraging. Still, it was better as compared to schools in city which reopened very late.” But with online classes going on since 2020, one would assume that both teachers and students have got used to it. A senior CBSE teacher said that’s far from the truth. “Getting used to means that it has become accepted as a form of teaching. But that is different from effective teaching. I can stand in front of a camera and just ramble on and complete my syllabus. But a sincere teacher who wants to ensure all students understand what is being taught will have to put in extra efforts. That is very difficult in online mode,” said the teacher. Another concern for CBSE schools is the difference between term-1 and term-2 board exams. A principal said, “Term-1 was an MCQ format exam, while term-2 will be the traditional subjective-type format. Students are not in the habit of writing anymore and this will be a big challenge for them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-only-2-mths-for-term-2-exam-cbse-schools-worried-about-completing-syllabus/articleshow/88379282.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The data shows that 99.28% of the eligible persons have received the first dose.There was an increase of 4.8% of those who received the second dose in November.The report shows that 50.6% of the healthcare and 32.4% of the frontline workers have received both the doses. This percentage is 44.9 in 18 to 44 years age group; 49.9% for 45 to 60 years old; the highest 59.27% for 60-plus age group.District immunisation officer (DIO) Dr Puneet Juneja said, “People are coming forward to get the second dose of vaccination as well, which is why the percentage has gone up. The omicron risk has had an impact on vaccination. We could have vaccinated more people, but we are running about one-third of vaccination sites due to strike by some employees. We expect more vaccinations in the coming days. For, a van, which will have vaccination staff, will make rounds of the district from Monday, creating awareness. It will be in Ludhiana for eight days.”The health experts said it was vital to get vaccinated.“Getting fully vaccinated is possibly the best way to avoid a serious outcome. But vaccination will not prevent infection or transmission,” said epidemiologist Dr Clarence Samuel, who heads the department of preventive and social medicine department at CMCH.The residents want the authorities to enforce Covid rules strictly.“At markets, most of the people don’t wear mask or maintain social distancing. In the wake of the Omicron threat, the authorities should ensure the pandemic rules are followed,” said Narinder Singh, a city resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/amid-omicron-fear-nearly-5-rise-in-fully-vaccinated-persons-this-mth/articleshow/88378012.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Delhi||Give Details Of All Vending Committees: HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court has ordered the AAP government to furnish details about all town vending committees (TVCs) in the national capital set up under the Street Vendors Act. It directed the government to “produce the relevant record pertaining to the constitution of all TVCs in the NCT of Delhi, to explain as to how the various members have been nominated, particularly under the categories: non-governmental organisation, bank/associations of street vendors, community-based organisations, resident welfare associations and market/traders associations”, brushing aside opposition from Delhi government. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said members of petitioner associations, including New Delhi Traders’ Association, Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal and a counsel representing the interest of the hawkers/vendors can inspect these records. The court is examining the validity of the constitution of these committees, particularly the procedure adopted by Delhi government while nominating the members as representatives of market or traders associations, NGOs, community-based organisations and resident welfare associations. It also ticked off the trader associations for not doing due diligence before approaching the court. “You have not done your homework, you should have inspected these organisations which are members of TVCs, done a recce of the place they operate from, what is their background, who are the members, what kind of work they are doing? But you have nothing to show, what is the point in claiming there are irregularities?” the bench remarked during the hearing. The court ordered that the records of constitution of all TVCs in the areas falling under New Delhi Municipal Council and the three municipal corporations should be made available at the office of urban development department at ITO, starting from Friday till the inspection is over. The court has been dealing with issues arising from the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Scheme, 2019, as raised by various market associations and vendors. Senior advocate Sanjeev Ralli, representing the associations, had pointed out various irregularities in the constitution of town vending committees and inconsistencies in the street vendors scheme. The high court had earlier underlined that no right is absolute and it needs to be balanced, adding that while street vendors do have a fundamental right to ply their trade, but when they use a public way, they impinge on someone else’s right to walk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/give-details-of-all-vending-committees-hc/articleshow/88378680.cms||Abhinav Garg

The hospital administration has refuted allegations that it is not taking care of unidentified bodies. “The capacity of the mortuary’s cold storage is presently 24. The mortuary has completed 10 years and its repair, renovation and expansion has been undertaken. However, the administration has taken steps to ensure proper storage of unidentified bodies,” the BMC said. “Such bodies have to be stored for two to three months as identification is often delayed. This puts a strain on the cold storage system. Therefore, for regular repairs, it takes some time to get the corpse out of the compartment and put it back,” said BMC, claiming the pictures were taken to tarnish the civic body’s image.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-neglect-of-bodies-at-morgue-says-bmc/articleshow/88379297.cms||---

On December 7, the accused had held the dera head and followers captive and escaped with Rs 1.65 lakh, cellphones and two silver karas. Though the complaint was lodged the same day, the FIR took time as an inquiry was conducted, said Dehlon police.Ravinder Singh, 50, who has been living in the dera for the past two decades, said in his police complaint, “Around 1.30am on December 7, I woke up on hearing some noise. When I saw a group of men scaling the boundary wall of the dera, I bolted the door of my room from inside. However, the men broke open the door. Claiming to be cops, they said they have come to check the dera. They snatched my cellphone and locked me in the room. They were armed with blunt weapons.”The group then manhandled the dera head, Baba Rameshvra Nand, and his followers and locked them in another room. They took with them Rs 1.65 lakh, two silver karas, two cellphones and keys of two cars, he added. “Before fleeing, they damaged two other cellphones. When they left, we called up the village sarpanch from a cellphone the group could not find,” he said.After the sarpanch and villagers unlocked them, they called up the police.“One of the accused had asked for a ladder to damage the recordings of the CCTV cameras. However, they could not find one. It seems the group was familiar with the dera and knew where the DVR was kept,” Ravinder added.Dehlon sub-inspector Surinder Pal said the case has been registered under sections 457 (house trespassing), 380 (theft), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 506 (criminal intimidation), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/robbers-hold-dera-head-men-captive-make-off-with-cash/articleshow/88378016.cms||---

Demanding representation of Muslims in government bodies proportional to their vote percentage, AMOUBA president Prof Shakeel Ahmad Qidwai said, “All political parties are lobbying to get the vote of backward communities and Muslims in their favour. These communities have been exploited by pseudo secular political parties and have not been given any political importance in the state.” He said that it is the opportune time for them to bargain rather than enter into caste and religion based politics. “We demand reservation for Muslims (8%) in higher educational institutions in line with West Bengal government which will be in accordance with Sachar Committee recommendations, establishment of good schools, ITI and vocational centres in minority and Dalit dominated areas, establishment of minority university in Lucknow in the name of renowned educationist Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, who should also be conferred with Bharat Ratna posthumously,” he added. Addressing a press conference at a private hotel, Qidwai also demanded employment opportunities of minorities in Police and para military forces and abolition of the religious cap of Article 341 to open doors of reservation of Dalit Muslims and Dalit Christians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bargain-for-representation-from-political-parties-muslims-told/articleshow/88379289.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Last year (till the same period), 463 cases were reported and 335 solved. “More than 190 cases of thefts, including 185 e-FIRs, were registered out of which 41 were solved. For baggage theft, we have told the airlines to be vigilant and report anyone involved in the crime,” the officer said. In some cases, the accused committed theft in dark zones (areas where no CCTV cameras were installed). “In most cases, CCTVs helped us solve the crime,” added the officer. About 56 cases of cheating and 59 of forgery were reported and 95% were solved. “After the resumption of flights, many people who tried to travel through forged documents were caught. Several gangs who cheated people on the pretext of providing them jobs in foreign countries or at the airport were busted. A separate proclaimed offender cell was made for tracing agents,” said police. In Delhi Metro, 80% of crimes were of theft. The data till November 7 showed that 2,174 cases were reported this year, 1,380 were solved and 564 people arrested.

In some cases, the criminals posed as passengers and fled with their belongings. When the trains slowed down, criminals targeted people standing near the gates,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/crime-on-move-theft-cheating-and-forgery-top-offences-reported-from-metro-airport/articleshow/88378699.cms||Abhay Singh

There were no injury marks on the birds and they may have died due to the on-going cold wave, forest officials said. Temperatures in the region are hovering around 5-6 degrees Celcius, posing a risk to certain bird species. A probe has been ordered since peacock is the national bird and comes under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, that pertains to species that need rigorous protection. Shahjahanpur’s divisional forest officer (DFO) Adarsh Kumar said, “There was a sudden dip in temperature on Saturday morning and it perhaps led to the birds' deaths. Two of them were peahens. One peacock was provided treatment by veterinarians and later released into its habitat." The DFO further said, "Our team carried out an initial investigation and there was no foul play. But we still registered a case under the sections of Wildlife Protection Act for our records and have started our own probe. The carcasses were sent for autopsy which will be carried out by a panel of experts at Indian Veterinary Research Institute on Monday."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/3-peacock-carcasses-found-in-up-may-have-died-of-cold-say-officials/articleshow/88376924.cms||कंवरदीप सिंह

Villagers claimed that their fertile land within the DSIR was being acquired without any notice. “While the government is acquiring 120metres width of and from Sanathal in Ahmedabad to the periphery of Dholera SIR, land of 250 metres width is being acquired within the SIR,” said Priyarajsinh Chudasama, who along with other farmers of the village, made a representation to the collectorate last week. Farmers contend that according to land acquisition norms within the SIR, compensation is paid for just 50% of the land, while an alternative plot of land measuring the remaining 50% is provided nearby to the farmers. The land being allotted nearby is saline and not conducive for agriculture, farmers say. “The gram panchayat passed resolutions several times declaring the acquisition illegal. Despite this, the government has not paid heed. As a mark of protest, nobody filled any form for the post of sarpanch and members. Let the government appoint an administrator,” said deputy sarpanch Pradyumansinh Chudasama. The 70-year-old deputy sarpanch added the population of Bavaliyari village is about 5,000 with 2,500 eligible voters. The villagers claim that the district administration have twice in the past two months, attempted to destroy standing crops with land movers. “About a couple of months ago, they destroyed standing crops at Bavaliyari and about a fortnight ago, they did so at Amlisaraslapara village,” alleged Priyarajsinh Chudasama, a farmer of the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/boycott-triggered-by-dsir-land/articleshow/88379318.cms||---

On its expiry, she overstayed in India. The prosecution case is that when she tried to leave for Sri Lanka illegally from Ramanathapuram, she was arrested in September this year. Subsequently, she filed a petition seeking bail before the Ramanathapuram principal district and sessions court. By an order dated November 1, the court granted bail to her on certain conditions. One such condition was that she shall stay at the special camp in Trichy district and sign before the officer in charge daily at 10am until further orders. Since she was still detained in prison despite the release order, she moved HC Madurai bench seeking a direction to release her and permit her to stay at the special camp in Trichy.Justice G R Swaminathan said that the sessions court had granted bail to the petitioner. She had executed sureties as early as on November 2 and the concerned jurisdictional magistrate had also issued the release order. However, the same had not been honoured till date. Invoking the inherent powers of the high court to give effect to the release order, the judge directed the superintendent of Puzhal central prison for women to release the petitioner forthwith.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-orders-lankan-womans-release-from-jail/articleshow/88378683.cms||---
---||Madurai||Plea for pension: Madras HC relief for freedom fighter’s daughter||MADURAI: Madras high court has granted relief to the daughter of a freedom fighter from Trichy seeking family pension under Centre’s Swatantrata Sainik Samman Pension Scheme. Petitioner Mariammal’s father V Kaliappan was a soldier in Indian National Army in south east Asia during World War II under the leadership of Nethaji Subash Chandra Bose. During the freedom movement, her father joined the Indian Independence League at Dallah branch in Rangoon, Burma in 1945. He was arrested by the British and lodged at Rangoon central jail from May to December 1945. She stated that her father had submitted an application with relevant documents to the freedom fighters division of the home ministry seeking pension in 1999. The ministry forwarded the same to the state government which had to send the recommendation for pension. Petitioner’s father died in 2000 and her mother in 2001. Since the state did not send any recommendation, she submitted her application for family pension in 2014 to the state government which however asked her to submit an application to the Trichy collector. The collector forwarded the application to the tahsildar who in 2017 recommended that the petitioner was eligible for pension. Since no further steps were taken, she moved HC Madurai bench in 2018 seeking relief. Calling it an unfortunate case, which should not have entered the portals of the court at all, Justice C V Karthikeyan took note of the collector’s counter-affidavit stating that the petitioner and her father had not applied for sanction of Centre’s freedom fighter pension due to which the proposal has not been forwarded. Observing that he is deeply pained by the collector’s affidavit questioning the credentials of the petitioner’s father, the judge said while the tahsildar had examined the genuineness of the certificates and made the recommendation, the collector had taken a different stand. The judge observed that it is not known whether the collector signed the affidavit with knowledge of the contents or with deliberate intention to deny pension to the petitioner. “It is very unfortunate that the Trichy collector had also acted in the very manner which had been deprecated by the Supreme Court in a verdict,” the judge said. Hence, the judge allowed the petition by directing the petitioner to submit a representation to the collector with all relevant documents within January 10. After examining it, the collector shall take a decision in this regard before February 10, 2022 and forward the application to the Union ministry which shall pass necessary orders within four weeks, thereafter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-for-pension-hc-relief-for-freedom-fighters-daughter/articleshow/88378697.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The businessmen gave a memorandum to the minister for reduction of the rates of steel, ban on export of raw steel, and a steel regulator to control the rates. Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) president Upkar Singh Ahuja, who met the minister, said: “The biggest hurdle in the progress of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) in the country is procuring raw material from large steel manufacturers. We suggested to the union minister that steel companies be asked to extend a line of credit to the buyers, where the Indian government can act as a guarantor. We also suggesting exploring long and short-term finance options for the small and medium-scale industry.”CICU demanded production-linked incentive for the MSMEs and the makers of bicycles and parts, automotive and farm machinery components, and the sewing-machine sector for their revival. Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisations (FICO) president Gurmeet Singh Kular said: “The meeting with the steel minister was successful. We asked for a steel regulatory commission to save the MSMEs. We requested for ban on the export of steel for the sake of controlled price and availability.”United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association president D S Chawla said: “I shared with the steel minister that steel wasn’t available to the Indian industry for reasonable price.

Brahmins, who constitute 13% of the population, will get a lion’s share of tickets this time and we will tap this simmering angst to notch up a poll victory,” he told TOI. Brahmins are self-reliant and don’t seek benefits from the government, but they are ready to die to uphold self-respect, he added. Most Brahmin leaders from 20 UP districts who participated in the conclave echoed the former Speaker’s views, even as the organisers rallied those present with the battle axe of Lord Parshuram and announced a “dharm yudh” against the anti-people policies of BJP government. Talking to TOI, party vice-president Jai Shankar Pandey while skirting a query on whether Samajwadi Party was trying to replicate Mayawati’s social engineering formula, said, “Each district will have one or two Brahmins in the fray on a Samajwadi Party ticket.” The summit at Katehri, 45km off Ayodhya, coincided with ‘Jan Vishwas Yatra' flagged off by BJP national president J P Nadda in Akbarpur, headquarter of Ambedkar Nagar district. The conclave began with a 'shankhnaad' (blowing of conches), followed by a ‘hawan' and recitation of ‘sundar kand’. Then Brahmin icon Parshuram’s battle axe motif along with conches were distributed among participants. Talking to TOI, Ashish Pandey Dipu, organiser of Brahmin conclave, said, “Samajwadi Party has always given respect to Brahmins and they are stoutly behind Akhilesh Yadav this time.

Flagging off the Jan Adhikar Yatra from Bijnor, Gadkari said under previous governments, “roads were in potholes” which were repaired and rejuvenated by the BJP government. He said the National Highway was coming up with a host of projects including new routes from Delhi to various cities like Dehradun, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Amritsar, Katra and Srinagar. “The highways will drastically reduce travel time,” he added. Gadkari recalled how people used to complain about the long travel time between Delhi and Meerut. “We have built a 16-lane road from Delhi to Meerut. After construction of two ROBs, you will reach Meerut from Delhi in just 45 minutes,” he said. The Union minister said the BJP government constructed more roads in UP than the ones laid in the last 50 years. “Unless roads are built, there can be no basic facility. Even industries would not come,” Gadkari said, hailing Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for giving the state a new direction. “Ram Rajya started in the country in 2014 under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. The country is changing and so is UP,” he said. Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, Union minister Sanjeev Baliyan, west region’s president Mohit Beniwal were also present on the occasion. Starting from Bijnor, the yatra will reach Rampur on January 1 through 14 different districts of Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, Shamli, Baghpat, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Bulandshahr, Hapur, Amroha, Moradabad, and Sambhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-govt-gave-up-more-roads-thanthe-ones-laid-in-50-years-gadkari/articleshow/88379340.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Future is electric: ‘Ludhiana can be global EV, e-bike hub’||Times News NetworkLudhiana: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) organised an interaction in association with the BCM Foundation on the localisation of e-bicycle and scooty components. The session’s objective was to sensitize the local industry, bicycle and automobile component manufacturers of the region especially, as to how they can upgrade their technologies and diversify into electric vehicle and e-bike component manufacturing. In this session, Hero Cycles managing director SK Rai, Birmingham City University director enterprise Bernard Curren, Ajay Sinha, STEAMhouse-MBCIE director P S Choudhary, Hero Lectro Cargo CEO Upkar Singh Ahuja, and BCM Foundation director Dr Prem Kumar, shared their experience of the e-vehicle technology world with the gathering. Rai described the scope of e-vehicles as vast in India because of the government’s support under different schemes and subsidy progammes. He said that IC (internal cobustion) engines are going to disappear from the Indian roads and be replaced with futuristic technologies such as e-vehicles.Bernard Curren talked about tbhe scope of e-vehicles in the foreign market and the concepts by which India can become a global supplier of e-vehicles. Ajay Sinha of STEAMhouse-MBCIE talked startups and the basic requirements to grow the businesses. P S Choudhary told the audience about the current market and the growth of e-vehicles in the market. He also discussed future technologies to make India industrial superpower in at least the automobile sector.CII Ludhiana Zone chairman Ashpreet Sahni said: “Electric cars and bikes are the new age of transport, so the world is switching to e-bikes and e-bicycles. Ludhiana, which has been a traditional hub of bicycle and automobile component making in the country, now has the opportunity to become a global hub for high quality mass production of premium e-bicycles along with the high-end bicycles.” Dr Prem Kumar moderated this interaction and requested the other foreign speakers to share their knowledge with the gathering. More than 100 members of the CII and industrial associations were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/future-is-electric-ludhiana-can-be-global-ev-e-bike-hub/articleshow/88378057.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Noida, Greater Noida, Loni to have million+ population in 20 years’||NEW DELHI: All the cities around Delhi, including Loni, Noida, Greater Noida and even Muzaffarnagar, would have more than a million people by 2041, according to the population projection made in the ‘draft regional plan’ notified by the NCR planning board (NCRPB). At present, besides Delhi, only Gurgaon, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Meerut have million-plus populations. The Uttar Pradesh government has proposed to develop Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Area (YEIDA) with design population of 12 and 20 lakh, respectively. “According to Census 2011, the population of NCR was 5.81 crore. It is expected to grow to around 7 crore by 2031 and to about 11 crore by 2041. The region will be highly urbanised in the coming decades with urban populations of about 57% by 2031 and about 67% by 2041,” the draft plan says. Delhi is expected to be 100% urban in the next 10 years, it says. To meet the requirement of growing population, the plan proposes to encourage mixed land-use to meet local requirements and also to reduce travel times and traffic congestion. It has proposed allowing mixed land-use in both vertical and horizontal development. “Higher floor area ratio (FAR) of around 400 and above has been recommended for all intensive development and redevelopment and regeneration areas (including revitalization or called by any other name) with appropriate ground coverage for adequate ventilation,” says the draft plan. The plan also proposes the repeal of the Delhi Land Reforms Act to enable organised and orderly development of rural areas of Delhi in harmony with their surroundings inside and outside. It says this is necessary since despite many committees in the last many decades the Lal Dora and extended Lal Dora areas continue to remain islands of haphazard, chaotic development in the midst of planned areas. To deal with the problem of depleting ground water, the draft plan has proposed registration and geo-tagging of all bore wells and tube wells and sensor monitoring of ground water status should be carried out across the NCR. Flagging stubble burning as a major cause of acute seasonal air pollution, the plan has proposed that every village or group of villages should have a bank or pool of harvesting equipment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/noida-greater-noida-loni-to-have-million-population-in-20-years/articleshow/88378740.cms||Dipak K Dash

Around one lakh smartphones and tablets will be given to final year students of BTech, BA, BSc, MA, ITI, MBBS, MD, MTech, PhD and skill development course, among others, at Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Stadium in Lucknow. The step brings the spotlight on the ruling BJP escalating its youth outreach ahead of UP elections. A large number of students, including girls, from every district of the state will participate in the programme. The UP government had announced free smartphones and tablets for one crore youth to “make them technically sound”. In the first phase of the scheme, the CM will distribute 60,000 smartphones and 40,000 tablets. This is for the first time in the history of the country that such a large number of youths are being given free smartphones and tablets. Special secretary, IT and electronics, Kumar Vineet said over 38 lakh youths had been registered on DigiShakti portal.

They are asymptomatic and are kept in isolation ward at SVP Hospital, said health department officials of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC).With the update, Gujarat now has 13 positive cases of Omicron variant. All four major cities of Gujarat now have at least one active Omicron case, said state health department officials. AMC sources said that the couple aged 48 and 47 years, had arrived in Ahmedabad on December 11. “They were tested upon arrival at Mumbai where they tested negative. They were again tested at Ahmedabad airport where the result was negative again. They then got admitted at a private hospital on SG Road for a surgical procedure,” said the health department official. The man tested positive when the pre-surgery RT-PCR result came positive. The authorities were informed about the same. “The couple first requested the authorities if they can get admitted to the same hospital. But as it was not possible, they were asked to get admitted to SVP Hospital. Their condition is stable,” said the official, adding that contact tracing has already commenced. With one patient from Anand admitted in Civil Hospital for Omicron, the city currently has three cases. All three are asymptomatic and are given primary treatment of Covid-19 according to the protocol, said authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tanzanian-couple-in-city-test-positive-for-omicron/articleshow/88378742.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Four more visits in December, Modi already criss-crossed UP with inauguration spree||LUCKNOW: When PM Narendra Modi laid the foundation of the ambitious 594km-long Ganga expressway from Shahjahanpur on Saturday, he had criss-crossed almost all six organisational regions of poll-bound Uttar Pradesh to drum up BJP’s flagship projects. And he completed the cycle even as four more visits are scheduled in the next 10 days. Experts point out Shahjahanpur, from where the PM rolled out the country’s longest expressway project, comes under BJP’s Braj organizational region comprising 36 assembly seats. Likewise, inauguration of Jewar airport in Gautam Buddh Nagar by Modi on November 25 covered the west UP region comprising 71 assembly seats, where BJP felt the heat from farmers’ unrest against the now repealed farm laws. This was immediately followed by Union home minister Amit Shah laying the foundation for Maa Shakumbhari Devi University in Saharanpur’s Behat Assembly constituency on December 2. On November 16, the PM chose to flag off Purvanchal expressway from Sultanpur, which falls in the Gorakhpur organizational region, comprising 62 assembly seats. In fact, Modi specially visited Gorakhpur, the political backyard of CM Yogi Adityanath, to inaugurate AIIMS and a revived fertilizer factory on December 7 in what was BJP’s bid to put Modi on the forefront to escalate the poll blitz in politically crucial east UP. A week later, on December 14, PM Modi inaugurated the first phase of Kashi Vishwanath Dham corridor, igniting BJP’s Hindutva pitch in Kashi organizational region comprising 71 assembly seats. The development also saw the spotlight shifting to Ayodhya — a key Hindutva nerve centre — which was visited by BJP president JP Nadda and CMs of 11 BJP-ruled states to offer prayers at Ramjanmabhoomi. Similarly, Modi’s visit to Balrampur on December 11 to inaugurate the Saryu Canal project marked BJP’s attempt to step up its campaign in Awadh region comprising 82 assembly seats. On November 19, the PM visited Mahoba in Bundelkhand organizational region comprising 19 assembly seats to inaugurate a host of key irrigation projects, including Arjun Sahayak canal. His visit to Bundelkhand coincided with his announcement to annul the three contentious farm laws and then launch an attack on opposition accusing them of pushing farmers in a quandary to cement their foundation. Experts said, PM touching all organizational regions coincides with BJP launching its flagship Jan Vishwas Yatra by senior BJP leaders from six regions on Sunday. BJP leader and party’s secretary, Chandra Mohan, said PM Modi is the leader of the double-engine BJP government. “He was bound to touch every organizational region to set the tone for the party’s election campaign,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/four-more-visits-in-dec-modi-already-criss-crossed-up-with-inauguration-spree/articleshow/88379344.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Delhi||2-phase plan for east Delhi hospital’s upgrade||NEW DELHI: With a portion of the Swami Dayanand Hospital complex turning old and unsafe, coupled with a rise in the number of patients, East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has submitted a detailed plan to the Centre through Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for sanctioning funds in two phases to redevelop it into a 500-bedded super-speciality facility. The first phase includes sanctioning of Rs 72 crore for constructing the emergency block, upgrading the OPD block, augmentation of drainage, sewer network, etc. “We made the plan a long time ago and named it Vision 2020. We submitted the proposal to Delhi government, but got no reply. Now, we are pursuing the matter with DDA, which is the nodal agency for the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs,” said an EDMC official. EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand said DDA had scrutinised all documents and forwarded the file for the first phase to the ministry. “The matter is under consideration and we are hoping for allocation of funds. Recently, some facilities were shifted to other wards after a portion of the building was found dangerous. We are carrying out repair work of all unsafe areas. But in the long run, we need improvement of the hospital infrastructure,” he added. The ICU was shifted to the new OT complex and emergency to the surgical ward after the need for repairs was realised. “Initially, there was a plan to procure machines and surgical equipment. But due to the huge footfall and demand for medical facilities, we decided to get the infrastructure developed first,” said Anand. The second phase costing Rs 359 crore would include creating a 500-bed inpatient care block, residences for the medical superintendent and doctors, a central medical store, equipment and furniture. “We have no obstetrics ICU. At present, it’s a secondary care hospital despite having the third largest child delivery cases (35-40 deliveries per day) after Safdarjung and Lok Nayak. Even during the pandemic, we worked dedicatedly with a 90-bed facility. We are prepared for the third wave and all facilities, including oxygen supply, are there in wards 4 and 5,” said a senior doctor at the hospital. To fulfil the requirement of a paediatrics ICU, the hospital administration has tied-up with an NGO. “The facility will be available within a month. Despite shortage of staff, the OPD and casualty wards are operating well,” said the doctor. In the budget for 2022-23, the commissioner had proposed developing a medical college within the hospital and converting the existing nursing schools into colleges. “There is a lot of unutilised land that can be redeveloped into a college. The faculty members can also work in the hospital after classes,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-phase-plan-for-east-delhi-hosps-upgrade/articleshow/88378759.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Madurai||Madurai: Low-cost sensor to detect glucose level developed||MADURAI: Researchers at the School of Chemistry in Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) have developed a bendable, low-cost electrochemical sensor strip using material from a biodegradable garbage bag that can detect up to the lowest blood glucose level. The strip can be used with a conventional commercial glucometer to test the glucose level from human blood serum. “There are quite a few commercial glucometers available in the market. However, it is not commonly used by public in households due to the high cost,” said Dr G Gnanakumar, head in-charge, Department of Physical Chemistry, MKU. He said expensive strips and the catalysts took up a major portion of the cost. “To overcome the limitation, we have used biodegradable garbage bag derived from corn as a strip. The strip is modified with hollow structured metal oxide/carbon nanocatalysts derived from the soft templates of metal organic frameworks,” he told TOI. One strip can be reused for eight to ten tests without any degradation in the glucose sensing performance. He said the hollow and hierarchical porous architecture of the material of the strip is such that whenever the glucose in human blood serum comes in contact with the catalyst, it easily enters the bulk or centre of the catalyst. “To identify or explore the optimal catalyst or optimal configuration, we have done computational analysis. From the analysis, we found out the optimal catalyst, how the glucose is entering the catalyst or adsorbed over the catalyst and oxidation of glucose,” said the researcher. He added that this can be used to determine and detect up to lowest glucose level concentration of 45 nanomolar by using the strip. The research was published in Chemical Engineering Journal, a peer-reviewed top scientific journal on sensors and devices-related research. “We are working further in devising wearable flexible sensors for detecting glucose level from human sweat as the research showed the strip being sensitive towards sweat as well. We are applying for a patent for it,” said Dr Gnanakumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/low-cost-sensor-to-detect-glucose-level-developed/articleshow/88378739.cms||---
---||India||Civic polls: Slog-hour voting pushes turnout to 63.6%, conflict pockets in north and central Kolkata||KOLKATA: Heavy last-hour polling, which saw the voter turnout increase from 52% at 3pm to 63.6% at 5pm — a few notches below the 68.5% recorded in the 2015 civic polls — dissipated early fears of a low turnout as 144 wards of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation went to the polls on Sunday. The day was marked by two different types of polling: the first — and the overall — picture was largely peaceful, as borne out by official statements by the state election commission and the police brass; while the other — confined to some pockets of the city — saw instances of conflict. Across large parts of south Kolkata (in 81 of the 144 wards) voting was peaceful, even giv-ing off year-end festive vibes. Most reports of conflict were from the north and central parts of the city. Bike-borne goons injured three people, one of them critically, when they lobbed two crude bombs at Taki Boys’ School in Sealdah. Several candidates claimed they were assaulted. The state poll body ordered a probe into complaints by BJP candidate and veteran councillor Meena Devi Purohit that she was manhandled, and her clothes torn. Apart from Purohit, BJP’s Vijay Ojha and Rajarshi Lahiri, along with LF candidates Faiz Ahmed Khan, Sujata Saha and Congress candidate Akbar Hossain, alleged assault. Joint CP (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar said all complaints were being probed and action-taken reports submitted to the commission. Till 5pm, there were 209 arrests. State election commissioner Saurabh Das said there were 453 complaints and reports of 55 malfunctioning EVMs, which were replaced. The clashes were confined to pockets that gave the opposition (BJP, Congress and the Left) leads in the 2015 KMC polls. These were also the same zones where there was some fight against Trinamool in the assembly polls earlier this year. In central Kolkata, there were two instances where TMC and BJP candidates came to blows with each other. In Brabourne Road, police resorted to a lathi-charge to separate the candidates and their followers. Four persons were arrested. But what was different from the April assembly polls was the conflict, which was mainly between Congress, Left Front and Trinamool workers, with BJP workers largely inconspicuous except in one or two zones in the Burrabazar-Brabourne Road area. Along with the Congress, the fightback by the Left could be gauged as complaints started pouring in since morning from the Garia-Ramgarh-Baghajatin-Jadavpur belt and Kidderpore. Roadblocks were staged in Baghajatin and Kidderpore by Left workers. CM Mamata Banerjee, before casting her vote at Mitra Institution in Bhowanipore, said: “There are 144 seats for councillors. If somebody cannot contest the election and does some drama, let them do it. It is also a process of democracy. It is better to ignore them.” Asked about the turnout, she added: “We are satisfied with the turnout. It is not bad by KMC election standards. Till 3pm it was around 53%, which is satisfactory in a civic election.” TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee took a dig at the BJP. “How can TMC be held responsible if BJP doesn’t have polling agents?” he wondered. “They lack the will to work, hence the drama. Even the BJP leadership is not serious about the election. They had prepared a list of celebrity campaigners prior to the vote. Half of them didn’t turn up.” On allegations of violence, he said: “I am also appealing to everyone, if you have footage that shows any of our party workers involved in violence or disrupting the poll process, bring it to the public domain and we assure that stern action will be taken by the party in 24 hours.” The opposition dubbed the election a farce. Leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari, went to the state poll body and sought a repoll. “People could not vote. The CCTVs were not working. Candidates have been assaulted. This isn’t an election but a farce. What else would you expect when state police, which takes orders from the state, conducts polls,” he said. CPM leader Sujan Chakrabarty alleged that the commission and the police were acting on the instructions of the Trinamool. Pradesh Congress president Adhir Chowdhury held that the CM couldn’t place “trust” in people despite her party having formed the government for three successive terms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/civic-polls-slog-hour-voting-pushes-turnout-to-63-6-conflict-pockets-in-north-and-central-kolkata/articleshow/88380109.cms||Debashis Konar

Akhilesh said BJP knows that people of UP will vote it out, and therefore, it is taking all steps to limit the people's support that SP is receiving. On Sunday, Akhilesh accused the BJP of tapping the phones of SP leaders, including him. He said BJP knows that people of UP will vote it out, and therefore, it is taking all steps to limit the people's support that SP is receiving. Speaking at Jan Vishwas Rally in Mathura, Yogi said, "I saw yesterday the Samajwadi Party was getting pained at Income Tax raids. So, I asked someone, why? He replied 'chor ki dadhi mein tinka (the thief has a burning hat)'. Can anyone imagine how someone's wealth grows 200 times in five years?" In Lucknow, addressing a press conference, Akhilesh said, "Our phones are being tapped ... phones of SP headquarters ... or those of people associated with us ... their mobiles are under surveillance ... all are conversations are being listened to ... and even the chief minister listens to some of the recordings in the evening." He added that some of the IAS officers behind this snooping say they are helpless while some others are doing it merely because they are sycophants. "This is on the lines of what had happened when the present government got together to ensure SP defeat in Kannauj," Akhilesh said in an apparent reference to the Lok Sabha polls. Asked who was behind this phone tapping, Akhilesh said it was being done on the instructions of "unupyogi mukhya mantri".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/how-can-wealth-grow-200-times-in-5-years-yogi-after-raids/articleshow/88380113.cms||Pervez Iqbal Siddiqui

The businessmen are relieved at the development and expect the government to accept the other major demand, which is for the abolition of professional tax. Indirect Taxes Consultants Association former president Vikas Goyal said: "In a big relief to the taxpayers, the Punjab One-Time Settlement of Outstanding Dues (second) Scheme, 2021, has come into force from the date of its publication in the official gazette."The scheme applies to assessment years 2014-15 to 2017-18, which fall under criterion three of the assessment policy approved on September 15 for the assessment years 2014-15 to 2016-17 and the first quarter of 2017-18, and have been assessed by November 30. Forms OTS-1, OTS-2 and OTS-3, OTS-4 and OTS-5, have also been approved. No application for the settlement of dues under this scheme for the cases mentioned will be entertained after April 30, 2022.Welcoming the notification, Moti Nagar United Factory Association executive member Hemant Abbi said: "The gazette notification was the last hurdle in the official start of OTS scheme, and with this done, the businessmen will be able to sign up for the scheme by just filling a form based on their liability and submitting it with the state taxation department office. We thank chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi for fulfilling the promise he made on his visit to Ludhiana on October 27. We expect him to now work on abolishing the professional tax."Bhartiya Vyapar Mandal senior vice-president Radhe Shyam Ahuja said: "Introduction of the OTS for settling VAT dues for all previous years is a commendable step by the state government but Ludhiana’s businessmen continue to be burdened with filing the professional tax. The state government still has time left to prove its industry friendliness. For that, it should do away with the professional tax that was imposed on us during the tenure of his predecessor."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/finally-gazette-notification-out-for-one-time-settlement-of-vat/articleshow/88378076.cms||Mohit Behl

The first incident happened between 10 pm and 11 pm on Saturday near Neduntheevu (Delft Island) when 43 men on six boats from Rameswaram were arrested while 12 others on two boats from Thangachimadam were caught on Sunday.Demanding their immediate release in a letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, chief minister M K Stalin said repeated attempts by the Sri Lankan navy to prevent exercise of traditional rights by Tamil Nadu fishermen through intimidatory tactics must not be allowed to continue. Condemning the arrest, 11 mechanised boat owners associations from Rameswaram Island announced an indefinite strike saying they would refrain from fishing-related activities till the arrested people returned. The six seized boats were among the nearly 570 mechanised boats and trawlers that set off from Rameswaram on Saturday morning and were supposed to return on Sunday morning. They crossed the international maritime boundary line (IMBL) and were fishing near Delft Island, when the Lankan navy chased the smaller mechanised boats. The detained men are aged 19 to 54 years. Sri Lankan navy said that 43 fishermen were arrested in a special operation in the seas southeast of Delft Island, Jaffna, by its northern naval command to check foreign fishermen poaching in their waters. The arrests were made keeping in view the livelihood of the local fishing community and sustainability of fishery resources of Sri Lanka, it said in a statement. The fishermen were taken to Myliddy harbour and handed over to the relevant authorities for legal action adhering to Covid-19 protocols, it added. The boat owners said the fishermen had gone in search of their livelihood. They would hold a mass protest at Rameswaram bus stand on Monday .Earlier, chief minister M K Stalin rang up external affairs minister S Jaishankar and urged him to take steps for immediate release of the fishermen and 73 boats in the custody of the navy. “I would also like to point out that in the year 2021 there were 19 incidents of apprehension and attack of Tamil Nadu fishermen. This is in addition to the two instances of attacks in which five fishermen were killed this year,” he added in his letter later.Tuticorin MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi also urged S Jaishankar to take up the issue with the Sri Lankan authorities immediately. PMK founder S Ramadoss said the stretch of sea on the Indian side is very small along the central and southern coast of Tamil Nadu, due to which it was natural for fishermen to cross the IMBL. AMMK founder T T V Dhinakaran, TMC(M) president G K Vasan and former AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala have also asked the Union and state governments to bring an end to the action being taken by Lankan navy against Indian fishermen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sl-navy-arrests-55-tn-fishers-in-2-incidents/articleshow/88378751.cms||---

Addressing a gathering, Thakur said Uttarakhand had witnessed maximum development and that both central and state governments are working on the state’s rapid growth. The minister praised Modi government’s way of handling Covid-19. “Uttarakhand is the only state to have achieved the 100% vaccination target. While the Congress only indulged in scams, Modi government provided free ration to 80-crore people for 20 months and built toilets for the poor. The work of providing pucca houses is also being done continuously,” he said. Launching an attack on the Congress, state president Madan Kaushik accused the party of lying to the public. He also took a dig at the Aam Aadmi Party. Vijay Sankalp Yatra will bring the BJP to power again, which will help people see development from a different perspective. Buoyant after seeing a huge turnout, CM Dhami said it was an indication that the BJP will come to power. Promises are being kept, development works are being carried out at the gram panchayat level, the country and Uttarakhand are on the path of development, he said. Listing the party’s works, Dhami said Mahalaxmi Kit Scheme has been launched, recruitment process is underway and 24,000 vacant posts will be filled at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/modi-govt-wants-ukhand-to-witness-rapid-growth-anurag-thakur/articleshow/88378080.cms||---

The victims were identified as S Lakshmi, 22, son Balasakthi, 4, and daughter Vismitha, 2. Lakshmi and Saravanan, a security guard in a coconut farm, got married five years ago. They lived in Ayyampalayam village near the banks of Maruthanathi river where the coconut farm was located. According to a preliminary inquiry by police quoting her mother Ramalakshmi, Lakshmi was mentally disturbed over the last few weeks. This had prompted her to stay with her daughter and take care of her and the grandchildren over the last two months.On Saturday morning, Saravanan went out and on returning in the evening found his mother-in-law asleep while his wife and children were missing. As Ramalakshmi was unaware of their whereabouts, they searched for them and finally found the bodies in the open well on the same farmland late at night.Pattiveeranpatti police conducted inquiries and the bodies were retrieved with the help of fire and rescue services personnel. They were taken to Dindigul medical college hospital where an autopsy was performed on Sunday. It is suspected that lakshmi could have thrown the children into the well before taking her life. A case was registered under section 174 (unnatural death) of the code of criminal procedure. Since the couple was married for less than seven years, the case is being probed by the revenue divisional officer who will check if dowry harassment could have instigated the woman to take the extreme step. Police said Lakshmi’s family does not suspect any foul play in the deaths as they were aware of her mental illness and that she was under medication.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/woman-two-kids-found-dead-in-well/articleshow/88378752.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Emerging as defence manufacturing hub, UP key to Atmanirbhar Bharat||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh is fast emerging as the major hub of defence equipment manufacturing and is playing a crucial role in making the country self-reliant in the sector. Recently, the state added another feather to its cap when the central government approved a project for the manufacturing of over 5 lakh AK-203 assault rifles in a unit in Korwa of Amethi. A senior government official said the project is a significant stride towards making UP a key contributor in defence manufacturing in the country. This project will be completed in partnership with Russia. The 7.62 x 39 mm caliber AK-203 rifle is set to replace the in-service INSAS Rifle inducted over three decades ago. “The AK-203 assault rifles, with an effective range of 300 metres, are light weight, robust and easy to use modern rifles with proven technology that will enhance the combat potential of soldiers to adequately meet operational challenges,” a government official said. The special project has been planned under Indo-Russian Rifles Pvt Ltd (IRRPL). Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also laid the foundation for Rs 400 crore Bharat Dynamics plant to make propulsion system for anti-tank guided missiles, in Jhansi node of UP Defence Corridor. The Centre had decided to set up two defence industrial corridors in the country – one in Uttar Pradesh and the other in Tamil Nadu. The Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor has nodes in Agra, Aligarh, Jhansi, Chitrakoot, Lucknow and Kanpur. Inspired by traditional Indian weapons used in man-to-man combat, a Noida-based firm, Apastron Pvt Ltd, recently developed non-lethal weapons for security forces. The requirement of non-lethal weapons for the Indian Army was felt after 20 jawans were reportedly martyred in June 2020 in combat against the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China in Galwan Valley. Two companies, Encore Research Lab LLP and Allen & Alvan Pvt Ltd, are investing Rs 550 crore and Rs 30.75 crore, respectively, to set up plants in Aligarh to manufacture sophisticated drones. These unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will not only be of great help for Indian security forces, but can also be used in disaster management, and to enhance security and agriculture, a government official said. He added that 10 hectares of land has been allotted to companies. According to Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA), 29 companies have submitted their proposals to the state government for setting up factories near Aligarh, 11 around Lucknow, eight in Kanpur and six in Jhansi. Based on the requests received from these companies, UPEIDA has so far allotted 55.4 hectares land to 19 reputed companies in Aligarh node. Together, these companies will invest Rs 1,245.75 crore to manufacture defence equipment. In February 2020, Uttar Pradesh had also hosted the Defence Expo 2020. As per government officials, defence ministers of nearly 40 countries, over 3,000 foreign delegates from 70 countries and over 1,000 delegates from India had participated in the event. More than 200 MoUs were inked during the Expo. Many companies are ready to set foot in the state in view of better law and order situation and an investor-friendly atmosphere, a government spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/emerging-as-defence-manufacturing-hub-up-boosts-indias-atmanirbhar-plan/articleshow/88379346.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Lucknow||Trafficking syndicate lived life kingsize with foreign jaunts & 5-star stay; Rs 10cr funds flow in 12 months||Lucknow: Mammoth funds transactions have been traced to accounts of the trafficking syndicate, which smuggled Bangladeshis and Rohingyas into India through the porous Bengal border and then packed them off abroad on forged passports and Hindu identities. Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (UPATS) that busted the network with international linkages, found over Rs 10crore transactions in accounts of facilitators, middlemen and kingpins in a one-year span. Twenty-one gang members have so far been nabbed from West Bengal and brought to Lucknow on transit remand. Those arrested included four facilitators, six conduits and the mastermind, who lived life kingsize with lavish spending, five-star stays and foreign jaunts, but did not make assets to avoid taxman’s glare. A senior ATS officer privy to the probe said, multiple bank accounts of kingpin, Mithun Mandal, show a money trail of crores of rupees. And if total funds flow to the syndicate was calculated, it crossed Rs 10crore in less than 12 months. The facilitators included Ratan Mandal, Sameer Mandal, Noor Alam and Mohammad Jameel. Expensive apparels pegged at lakhs of rupees, five-star hotel bills and passports with stamped visas of exotic European and south-east Asian destinations were seized. “They don’t stay at one place and keep travelling in south-east Asian countries and stay in rented apartments,” said the officer. Explaining their modus operandi, ATS offices said kingpin Mithun Mandal operates a travel agency in the name of European Tour and Travels in Bardhaman district of West Bengal. His aide, Mahfuzur, used WhatsApp to communicate with clients in Bangladesh and Myanmar, who were interested in going abroad. He created a WhatsApp group (‘Only Bro’) and operated it under the name, Tony. “Those ready to infiltrate and move abroad were asked to cough up Rs 5-7 lakh, depending on the country of their choice,” an officer said. Once smuggled into India, the syndicate would provide them with fake Hindu identities and forged documents. Then they would be put across to middlemen in Gulf, South Africa and UK. The gang would pocket the fee after spending just Rs 50,000-70,000 on forging documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/trafficking-syndicate-lived-life-kingsize-with-foreign-jaunts-5-star-stay-rs-10cr-funds-flow-in-12-months/articleshow/88379348.cms||---

They are still on the hunt for the employee whose gang of six had grabbed the moneybag from a hosiery unit owner and injured him.The factory owner lost two debit cards and two iPhones with the bag. The arrested accused are Vishal Simba, 19, of SBS Nagar, Sunny, 22, of Giaspura, and Azad, 25, of Shimlapuri. Alleged main conspirator Sonu Kumar of Giaspura flats and three more of his accomplices are on the run. The cops have recovered Rs 2.72 lakh of the stolen cash and the gang’s getaway motorcycle. The robbers had dumped the bag, debit cards, and mobile phones into the Sidhwan Canal. Police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar has said that accused Vishal and Sunny were arrested from a Sector 25 house of Chandigarh and their lead took the cops to the third accused, Azad, whom they arrested from Bharat Nagar Chowk. The gang had taken out the cash and mobile phones from the bag but left the debit cards inside. It stuffed the bag with stones and tossed it into the canal. After that, they threw both mobile phones into the water as well at different spots and left the city. The police used divers to recover the bag and the mobile phones. Bhullar said that seven months ago, Sonu Kumar had quit his three-year-old job as sanitary worker in the factory of robbed hosiery owner Radha Mohan Thapar. Sonu was aware that the factory owner used to distribute salary among his staff on the 10th of every month. "Sonu spied on him on that day and coordinated the robbery. A hunt for the other accused is on," the police commissioner said. Sub-inspector Harminder Singh, officer in charge of the crime investigation agency-1 said: "Sonu is married to Sunny’s cousin and so they are relatives. Sonu and Sunny hatched this conspiracy three months ago and later joined their friends in it. Sonu and Sunny kept the larger share and gave away Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000 to their accomplices, promising the rest later. Sunny’s mother also escaped after locking the house, so police are investigating her role as well in this crime. The sub-inspector said: "Sonu had explained the factory plan to the accused and so they didn’t require to do any reconnaissance. The accomplices were all new to the place and yet they were able to execute the robbery." On December 10, a gang of six had robbed the factory owner of Rs 9.50 lakh on the RK Road near Cheema Chowk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ex-employee-in-moti-nagar-robbery-cops-after-3-arrests/articleshow/88378098.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Season’s coldest day as icy winds grip Lucknow||LUCKNOW: As dry icy winds continued to sweep the state, the city recorded its coldest day of this winter on Sunday. Despite bright sunshine, the maximum temperature dropped to 19.8 degrees Celsius, 4.4 units below normal. Similarly, minimum temperature recorded in the wee hours plummeted to 6.7 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal. No relief is expected till Tuesday as the state Met office predicted shallow fog/mist in the morning with maximum and minimum temperatures between 18-20 degrees Celsius and 5-7 degrees Celsius, respectively. These icy northwesterly winds are coming from the hills of the northern states that recently witnessed snowfall/rains. The chill of the snowfed mountains has created cold wave conditions in many parts of the state, said Met officials. The wind speed was between 5-6 km per hour, but sufficient to usher in a ‘biting effect’ in the air that made people shiver even during the day. The cold intensified after sunset, forcing many to stay indoors. A Western Disturbance is expected to hit the Himalayan ranges on Wednesday. It will cause more rains and snow in the hills, but cut off flow of icy winds towards the plain, resulting in gradual rise in temperatures to normal levels on Wednesday and Thursday. However, another wave of intense cold is expected by the weekend as icy winds may resume after the western distuirbance fizzles out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/icy-winds-make-city-shiver-during-day/articleshow/88379358.cms||---

---||Lucknow||UP: BJP is tapping my phone, IAS officers too involved in snooping, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: A day after Income Tax searches on the premises of Samajwadi Party leaders and their associates, party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday accused the BJP of tapping the phones of SP leaders including him. He said BJP knows that people of UP will vote it out and therefore it is taking all steps to limit the people's support that Samajwadi Party is receiving. “ … Humare sabhi phono ko suna jar aha hai … humare jitney bhi phone hain sapa ke karyalaya ke … ya humare sambandhit jitney log bhi hain … unke mobile ko suna jar raha hai … sabko listening par lagaya hua hai … aur mukhya mantri khud shaam ko kuch ki recording sunte hain (Our phones are being tapped … phones of Samajwadi Party headquarters … or those of people associated with us … their mobiles are under surveillance … all are conversations are being listened to … and even the chief minister listens to some of the recordings in the evening),” Akhilesh said at a press conference in Lucknow. He added that some of the IAS officers behind this snooping say they are helpless while some others are doing it merely because they are sycophants. “This is on the lines of what had happened when the present government got together to ensure SP defeat in Kannauj,” Akhilesh said in an apparent reference to the Lok Sabha polls. “Four people, including senior police and IAS officers of a particular caste, got together and entered into a conspiracy to ensure SP’s defeat in Kannauj,” he said. Asked who was behind this phone tapping, Akhilesh said it was being done on the instructions of “unupyogi mukhya mantri (CM without any utility).” Akhilesh also accused the BJP of misleading the Nishad community on the issue of reservation for them. “Nishad community expressed its disapproval before the BJP leaders who had come from Delhi and even tried getting on the stage and voiced their resentment as the chief minister began his address (at Lucknow rally last week) ,” the SP chief said. The former CM said IT searches were an attempt to deviate media and political attention from unsavoury happenings at the Nishad party rally in Lucknow. “At the moment, I can announce that within three months of the formation of the SP government we will get the caste census done,” he said. SP national spokesperson Rajiv Rai, whose premises were searched in Mau and Bangalore on Saturday, also addressed the press conference and accused the government of harassment in the garb of IT searches. He said the IT sleuths could manage to unearth only around Rs 70,000, including the amount that four of his employees present at his house were carrying. “They got so embarrassed with the recovery that they were not willing to give it in writing,” Rai said. Rai claimed that he was being targeted because he had arranged transportation of 15 students from Mau stranded in Malaysia during the lockdown when the central and the state governments had refused to help them. “I had distributed food and clothing to the needy during the pandemic in the presence of district officials in Mau and had adopted children whose parents died in the pandemic. The government has failed on all these fronts,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-tapping-my-phone-claims-akhilesh/articleshow/88379351.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Speaking at an event, Mishra said that Yogi endures to be called as “Maharaj” though he does not deserve to be CM. The BSP leader added that Yogi has a liking for people of a particular caste, while the remaining castes, including Brahmins, face all kinds of atrocities. A day after PM Narendra Modi endorsed Yogi saying that UP+Yogi is ‘upyogi’ or useful, Mishra said that the 2022 elections will showcase how ‘upyogi’ is the CM. He said that an atmosphere of fear has been prevailing in the state under BJP rule just like it was during the SP regime. In another searing attack, Mishra said that the achievements of BJP are not visible on the ground but only in newspapers, that too by spending public money. “Corruption, crime, dacoity, loot, murders, extortion, land grabbing, atrocities on farmers, fake encounters, riots have been flourishing under the BJP government,” he said. Mishra said BJP sacrificed 700 farmers in the face of its “fake and inflated ego”. Did the unemployed vote for the BJP so that they do not get jobs. Instead they had to face police lathis,” he said. “CM Yogi calls teachers as “sinners”. He says that they must have committed some sin in the previous life to have become teachers,” the BSP leader said. Citing the death of a block pramukh from Aligarh, Renu Sharma, in police custody. Mishra said the Yogi government wants the same to happen to Khushi Dubey, widow of slain gangster Vikas Dubey’s close aide Amar Dubey. “Both are Brahmins,” Mishra said. Likewise, a businessman from Kanpur was killed in Gorakhpur by police. “Lawyers are not safe in the entire state; if they vehementaly oppose the government then they are shot,” he said. “No section, no human is safe in the BJP government and yet it gives the slogan ‘Yogi is useful’,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-biased-towards-one-caste-says-mishra/articleshow/88379374.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Samajwadi Party synonymous with corruption, says JP Nadda||LUCKNOW: An aggressive BJP on Sunday turned to carpet bombing on the opposition while roping in a host of top party leaders to flag off the much anticipated “Jan Adhikar Yatra” from all six organisational regions of poll bound UP. BJP national president JP Nadda, who kicked off the yatra from BSP stronghold of Ambedkarnagar, led the charge by launching one of the most acrid offensive at the Samajwadi Party terming it as “synonymous” with “corruption and misconduct”. “Bhrashtachar, anachaar, durachaar...ye sab Samajwadi Party ke paryayvachi hai (Corruption and misconduct are synonyms of SP),” Nadda said. The BJP chief was also accompanied by union education minister and BJP’s UP election in-charge Dharmendra Pradhan. Nadda categorically accused the previous SP government of swindling Rs 16,000 crores through the Gomti river front scam and reining in corruption by not giving utilization certificates in various projects worth Rs 93,000 crores. The BJP president also claimed that the previous SP government purchased laptops worth Rs 14 lakh but distributed less than half. The BJP boss, in fact, tore into the SP campaign catch line -- `Ye nayi Sapa hai’ -- saying: “Ye nayi sapa nahi hai...ye wahi sapa hai... (This is not the new SP but the same old SP),” he said. The BJP chief also flayed the SP ranks for giving “unsavory” statements after the age limit for getting girls married was raised from 18 to 21 years. “And Akhilesh defended his party leaders’ statements which were against women empowerment and dignity,” he said. Nadda’s pointed caustic attacks came even as SP flexes its political muscles to thwart saffron juggernaut and arrest BJP chances of returning to office after 2022 assembly elections. “The culture of directly addressing the people, showing government report cards and fulfilling promises has been cultivated by the BJP under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi,” he said. CM Yogi Adityanath, who flagged off the Jan Vishwas Yatra from Mathura under Braj region, too attacked the SP while referring to Saturday’s IT raids, saying: “Jab Chhape pad rahe to SP ko dard ho raha tha...”. The raids were ostensibly conducted in the premises of SP ranks. Yogi said that it was under the previous government that the net assets of political figures rose astronomically by 200 times within five years. Similar Yatras were flagged in four other organizational regions by senior BJP leaders on Sunday, in what marked the saffron outfit’s attempt to ramp up its poll blitz in the run up to high-stake UP assembly elections. While Union Defense minister Rajnath Singh flagged off the yatra from Jhansi in Bundelkhand region, Union minister for road transport Nitin Gadkari did the same from west UP’s Bijnor. Likewise, Union minister for women and child health Smriti and MP CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan reached Ghazipur and Ballia, respectively, to flag off the yatra which BJP plans to traverse through all 403 assembly seats. Nadda maintained that the various welfare schemes started by the BJP government at the Centre were not meant for any particular caste or religion. “In contrast, the opposition harps on combination and permutations of various castes and communities for their political gains,” he said, pointing out how various political outfits across the country were infested with nepotism and casteist approach. He lauded PM Narendra Modi for cultivating the culture of speaking directly to the people, showing government report cards and fulfilling the promises made to the people.  The campaign marks a throwback to 2017 UP assembly elections when the BJP harped on `Parivartan Yatra’ which contributed its bit in lending a traction to the saffron wave. The party seeks to go back to the same strategy to take on an assertive opposition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/19-pankaj-jan-adhikar-yatra/articleshow/88379380.cms||Pankaj Shah

After much anticipation, permutation and combination of botanical facts, one of the two seeds procured from a Guggal (Commiphora wightii) plant, a rare specimen, has finally germinated. One of the 10 rare species of “ conservational concern” in the national capital, and a tree that once used to be a part of Delhi’s centuries-old forest system, Guggal was believed to have been wiped out. However, this new sapling and about 1.8 lakh others of 120 species of trees, shrubs, herbs, grasses and creepers, which include 69 native species that were either lost, rare or becoming uncommon, have given hope of a possible resurrection of Delhi’s lost floral glory. For this, the experts at Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) and the forest department have a plan. The seed bank that has helped in the germination shall be used to plant saplings in a scientific manner following an integrated reforestation approach. Experts said, under this plan, the soil quality and fertility value of the area would be determined. The sapling would then be planted. These would include 69 native or indigenous species, of which 22 are rare and 10 of conservational concern. “We have identified land at Devli Asila, Maidan Garhi, Neb Sarai, Bhatti and a few other places. The plots are being prepared and freed of encroachment. We have begun testing the soil health and other factors before marking the land best suited for a specific species of trees. This is being done to ensure that the native species, which had been challenging to germinate, grow healthy. We are trying to bring back the lost glory to Delhi’s forests,” said Sohail Madan from BNHS. Madan pointed out that earlier the plan was chalked out to regenerate at least 22 native species, like khair and peelu or miswak, which are very rare in Delhi. His team had to collect seeds from a specimen that enjoys ASI’s protection at Qutub Minar. “Later, we increased the number of species and finalised a list of 120 trees, shrubs, herbs, grasses and creepers to give Delhi a floral variety. Of these 120 species, 69 are native and 10 are practically lost from the city. They used to be in abundance once, but have become rare over time. For instance, Guggal has been almost wiped out from not just Delhi, but the country. It is very rare in wild or urban forests. Because of its religious values, felling occurred at a large level. It’s almost gone from India, but is found in Pakistan. We succeeded to grow it here from a sample in the nursery,” said Madan, adding that reforestation would commence based on suitable weather conditions for each species. Currently, the experts are assessing the soil health of over a hundred sites where plantation will occur. To begin with, the botanists are testing the soil type, salinity, PH levels, moisture-holding capacity and alleviation. Giving the example of the Salai (Boswellia serrata) tree, a rare species, the experts asserted how soil with less moisture holding capacity, higher salinity and area at an elevation was best suited for it to be grown, that too in a “sporadic manner” like it grows in the wild. “Not all lands were freed of encroachment and some were taken from different departments. Our planning is in an advanced phase and we are working on recognising the land. It’s a first of its kind re-afforestation drive where we are establishing a relation between nursery and plantation. Germinating the rare Guggal was an important part of it,” said Amit Anand, deputy conservator of forests (South).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lost-world-how-reforestation-plan-has-sown-seeds-of-hope/articleshow/88378789.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||India||Large parts of NCR out of conservation zone in new plan: Entire Aravali hill to lose protective cover?||NEW DELHI: The final 'Draft Regional Plan 2041' for the National Capital Region has proposed to replace the provision of 'Natural Conservation Zone' (NCZ) with 'Natural Zone (NZ)' and specified which natural features would qualify to be part of the new categorisation. Going by this, a substantial portion of the NCR area, including the Aravalis, which now qualifies to be conserved, would fall out of the bracket. Environment analysts said 70-80% of the current NCZ would not qualify to be included under NZ. The NCR planning board, which published the draft plan, has sought feedback before finalising it. According to the draft, the Natural Zone will comprise mountains and hills, rivers and water bodies which are notified for conservation under central or state laws and recognised as such in land records. The extent of these natural features will be identified and delineated by the states in accordance with the definition, using ground truthing and revenue records. The new draft plan also proposes that any change in NZ areas, which has been approved by NCRPB in the past as NCZ, can be carried out by the participating state concerned as per the revenue records, satellite imagery and ground truthing. This means the states will have the option to take out already demarcated conservation zones at a later stage. Currently, almost the entire Aravali range in Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan qualifies in the NCZ, where construction is not allowed beyond 0.5% of the area and that too only after getting prior approval from the Centre. Incidentally, Haryana has not yet completed demarcation of its NCZ. In the 2021 Regional Plan, NCZ covered all areas including the extension of the Aravali ridge, forest areas, rivers and tributaries, major lakes, water bodies and ground water recharging areas irrespective of the status of their land records. Most forests in south Haryana, which includes the Aravali region, are not notified forests and these are also not recorded as 'forest' in the revenue records. But after a 1996 Supreme Court judgment, which expanded the definition of 'forest', these areas are now treated thus and hence qualify to be conserved. One such classic example is the sacred Mangar Bani grove in Faridabad, which was declared a no-construction zone by Haryana government after a long campaign bye. "The new draft is a major change in planning. The entire Aravali hill in Faridabad will be out of the Natural Zone. A large chunk of area which is now treated as forest due to the Supreme Court order will not get the protection of the Natural Zone once the government changes the definition of forest. Nearly 70-80% of the current NCZ area will not be eligible to be part of the Natural Zone. Most of the Aravalis in Gurgaon and Haryana have been privatised and are not recorded as forest in revenue records," said environment analyst Chetan Agarwal. The Centre has proposed changes in laws to amend the definition of 'forest'. A former NCRPB planner said the draft regional plan "doesn't look like a plan document, rather it's a policy document". Successive Haryana governments over the past decade have been lobbying against the enforcement of NCZ provisions in the region and despite repeated reminders from the NCRPB, it is yet to complete the exercise of delineation of conservation zones. Interestingly, the draft plan which was circulated among states a few months ago for their feedback specifically mentioned that the components under NCZ as in the Regional Plan 2021 "shall remain and be continued to be conserved". It mentioned: "A distinction shall be made between 'forests' and 'green cover', wherein areas now categorised as forests shall continue to be conserved, while conservation of the areas now designated as green cover areas shall not be mandatory."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/large-parts-of-ncr-out-of-conservation-zone-in-new-plan-entire-aravali-hill-to-lose-protective-cover/articleshow/88380127.cms||Dipak K Dash

The organisers claimed to have offered masks and sanitisers to the marching devotees but found no takers. “We can’t force anyone to wear the mask,” said an organiser. The decorated chariot began its journey from Durga Mata Mandir, carrying the idols of Lord Jagannath (Krishna), his brother, Balaram, and sister, Subhadra. The chariot and moved towards Nav Durga Mandir after crossing the Stadium road, Fountain Chowk, Ghumar Mandi road and Ferozepur road, with devotees lined up to receive the procession and have a glimpse of the Lord.The rath yatra had several attractions for the devotees, as priests from Haridwar performed the Maha Aarti in a similar fashion as the Ganga Aarti for the holy river. At the stalls, people were offered the eatables. “This is the only occasion when the Lord himself walks out of the temple to shower His blessings on the devotees, so how can the devotees sit home,” said Pankaj, one of the devotees, who claimed that participating in this procession had always been a wonderful experience for him. The procession created some difficulties for the commuters, as the road from Old Session Chowk to Fountain Chowk, Bharat Nagar Chowk to Fountain Chowk, and Aarti Chowk to PAU Gate Number 2 remained jammed. At some of the points, police had to raise barricades for segreating the procession from normal traffic. The entire Ghumar Mandi road was closed for traffic. Channi declares Rath Yatra ‘state festival’Flagging off the rath yatra, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi declared it as “state festival” and announced Rs 2.51 crore donation for Ludhiana’s Iskcon Temple.Addressing the gathering near Shri Durga Mata Mandir, Channi said he had high regard for Srimad Bhagvadgita, and that when he became a municipal councillor about 25 years ago, a noble soul had advised him to recite one shloka a day from this holy test for inner peace. He said: “The holy book gave a direction to my life. Youth should imbibe the teachings of the Gita and practice those. Imbibing even one shloka was enough to succeed in life.”He said the Punjab government was developing a Gita and Ramayana research centre on 20 acres in Patiala, since these religious texts were a big inspiration to people. He said: “Scholars will draw wisdom from the epic texts of the Ramayana, Mahabharata and Srimad Bhagvadgita to further our knowledge.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/krishnas-day-out-turns-atmosphere-devotional/articleshow/88378145.cms||---

Take the example of Thakurganj resident Batin Khan who received a message recently that his vaccination is complete after taking the second dose. It also had a link to the digital certificate. He checked the Co-Win portal and found that it also mentioned that he had taken the second dose on December 11. When contacted, district immunization officer Dr MK Singh, said, “It might be a rarest of the rare case in which an automated message might have reached the wrong number. If the victim complains to us, we will probe into it.” A 22-year-old Barabanki resident, Abhay Pratap Singh, also claimed that he received a vaccine certificate of full vaccination on December 1, although he has not taken the second shot. “Health workers are now refusing to administer the second dose saying the data shows I have already been covered,” he said. Similar has been the case of Qmaruddin, also a resident of Barabanki. “I don’t know how to prove that I have received only one shot,” he said. Barabanki chief medical officer Dr Ram ji Verma said, “It might be a human error, but we will probe the matter and after verifying the facts administer a second dose to such people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/taken-one-shot-but-co-win-says-fully-waxed/articleshow/88379386.cms||---

Both the people had tested positive at Charbagh Railway station during a random sampling drive, he added. A person from LDA Colony Kanpur Road area, who came in contact with the woman found infected on December 12, has also been diagnosed with infection. The woman, who is also a resident of LDA colony, had visited Punjab to attend a wedding function, where she got infected. Till now, four of her contacts have been diagnosed with the infection. Similarly, a Jankipuram resident, who came in contact with a person who tested positive on December 13, was confirmed with Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/two-who-tested-positive-during-random-drive-now-unreachable/articleshow/88379383.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Knock off KLIS component from gazette notification: Telangana requests KRMB||HYDERABAD: Telangana has requested Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) to look into the dire needs of in-basin areas of the state and take steps to undo the injustice meted out to the areas falling under the limits of the basin. Telangana irrigation and command area development engineer-in-chief (general) Ch Muralidhar on Sunday shot off a letter to the KRMB chairman requesting the board to take steps to remove the component number 1.15 from schedule I and II of the gazette notification issued in July 2021. He stated Kalwakurthy Lift Irrigation Scheme (KLIS) was shown as two components in schedule I and II. “The lift irrigation scheme was not enhanced to utilise additional 15 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) from the original scope of the project but was earmarked by the Telangana government commensurate with the ayacut envisaged by the state government in erstwhile Andhra Pradesh. The same fact was already clarified to KRMB several times,” he pointed out. Hence, the component 1.15 may be deleted from schedule I and II. KLIS was taken up by erstwhile AP to irrigate 2.5 lakh acres in Mahbubnagar district by lifting 25 TMC from Srisailam reservoir through G0 535 dated December 23,1997. Later, the ayacut was increased to 3.65 lakh acres through GOs and memos. However, water utilisation commensurate to ayacut was not increased. Telangana government, as part of re-engineering, enhanced the water requirement from 25 TMC to 40 TMC in proportion to the ayacut and was seeking allocation out of 75% dependable flows before Krishna Water Dispute Tribunal (KWDT-II), Muralidhar said. “While submitting DPR before KWDT-II in 2006, the erstwhile AP furnished water drawl level for KLIS should be at +800.525 feet at Srisailam reservoir. At the same time, it submitted the drawl levels of the surplus-based projects — Handri-Neeva Sujala Sravanthi, Galeru-Nagari Sujala Sravanti, Veligonda and Telugu Ganga Project from Srisailam reservoir — with water levels at or near FRL (i.e +885 ft),” he stated. It shows that the in-basin surplus water-based project KLIS was to draw water from +800.525 ft while outside basin surplus-based projects were proposed to draw water from FRL or near FRL in Srisailam reservoir, he said. He said erstwhile AP did not plead for any allocation of Krishna water to these schemes out of dependable water under Section 89 proceedings before KWDT-II while Telangana has pleaded for dependable water for its KLIS. KWDT-I has stipulated while allocating water for future uses, in-basin uses should be given preference, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/knock-off-klis-component-from-gazette-notification-telangana-requests-krmb/articleshow/88378785.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Hyderabad||CJI urges lawyers not to give up services||HYDERABAD: Complimenting the modern court complex built at Warangal, Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana on Sunday said that it was his dream to see all courts in the country have similar facilities and buildings, but lamented that his five-month-old written request to the Union government, seeking setting up of Indian Judicial Infrastructure Corporation to take up such works, is yet to receive any response. Speaking after inaugurating the court complex, the CJI, however, expressed a hope that the Centre would introduce a bill to this effect in the upcoming winter session of Parliament. Acknowledging the benefits of the virtual court system that allowed advocates from even remote places to argue their Supreme Court case from their homes, the CJI was again critical of the Centre’s lack of response to his second letter to compensate the poor rural advocates with mobile networking courts at their places to enable them to argue their cases from their vicinity. “This is very essential. Otherwise, we are staring straight into a stark reality that may soon cause the extinction of an entire generation of lawyers,” the CJI warned. Driving home a message that it was both a request and a reminder, Justice Ramana said that the rich among lawyers could survive the virtual challenge thrown by Covid-19. “The problem is not yet over,” he added. He also appealed to all the lawyers in the country to keep in mind that it was lawyers who fought and won the country its independence and be always ready to work for society. “Do not give up that part of your lives,” he said, while underlining the current reality that many lawyers in today’s society had given up social service. Justice P Naveen Rao, a senior judge from Telangana high court, who conceptualised and supervised the re-emergence of the Warangal courts complex, that has several sensible and digital solutions, took the CJI through the complex and explained the various facilities meant for children, senior citizens and women. Telangana high court chief justice Satish Chandra Sharma requested advocate general BS Prasad, who was present at the inaugural function, to convey his desire to the state government to set up Warangal-type integrated court complexes in all districts of the state. The CJI, while acknowledging the liberal way in which the state has been extending its support to the judiciary, wanted a similar response from the central government as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cji-urges-lawyers-not-to-give-up-services/articleshow/88378788.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Goa||Cong alleges Rs 100cr scam in GIDC land allotment||Panaji: Congress on Sunday urged voters to exercise their franchise and vote out the BJP-led government in the ensuing assembly elections because of “the rampant corruption and misgovernance”. It said that BJP has stalled industrial growth by demanding bribes from entrepreneurs seeking industrial plots. State party president Girish Chodankar alleged a “multi-crore scam” in the auctioning of the repossessed SEZ plots. “IDC chairman Glenn Ticlo and industries minister Vishwajit Rane have sought an extra rate for allotment of plots. We have not made an estimate, but it must be more than Rs 100 crore. Prime Minister Narendra Modi must conduct a probe and investigate the illegalities,” Chodankar alleged. Congress said that the Prime Minister’s high profile visit is just a means to fool Goa before the elections. Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao said that BJP has proved to be the most corrupt government in Goa and needs to be voted out. The state Congress president also took a dig at the Prime Minister, who inaugurated several infrastructure projects in Goa. Chodankar reminded Modi that despite laying the foundation stone for the electronic manufacturing cluster at Tuem in October 2016, the project which could have created 5,000 jobs, remains incomplete. Chodankar also said that one phase of the cable-stayed Zuari bridge was also supposed to be completed by December 19 according to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, but the bridge remains incomplete. “The last time when the Prime Minister came in October 2016 he inaugurated the EMC at Tuem and at the same time he had launched the IT Park at Chimbel. We ask him to look at the foundation stones for these two projects that were started before the 2017 elections. He should call for a review of the two projects,” Chodankar said. He said that the lack of attention, oversight and swindling of the Rs 160 crore granted by the Centre has delayed the Tuem IT project. “A world class ecosystem was supposed to come up at Tuem to create jobs and manufacturing. Nothing has happened. This is a scam. Imagine how the Prime Minister comes here and promises to create industries and jobs for which Rs 160 crore was released,” Chodankar said. Chodankar also said that the government took over Alvara land belonging to farmers without following due process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-alleges-rs-100cr-scam-in-gidc-land-allotment/articleshow/88379437.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Besides, they do not have enough teachers for multi-disciplinary teaching. Talking to TOI, Chandra Mohan Upadhyay, principal of Kalicharan Post-Graduate (PG) College, said: “We do not have economics teachers and the NCC is also not available in our college. We also need more trained teachers for vocational courses. As of now, we have decided to introduce cinematography as a vocational course, but due to limited equipment and budget, it is very challenging for us.” Principal of Bappa Sri Narain Vocational PG College Ramesh Dhar Dwivedi said: “For the vocational courses we want to implement medical lab technician (MLT), carpentry and goods and services tax (GST). But due to lack of infrastructures and teachers, it is so difficult for us to proceed.” Principal of Lucknow Christian College, Pronoti Singh, said: “There is a lot of ambiguity in the terms of major and minor subjects. At the moment we are focusing on increasing the strength of teachers for both co-curricular and vocational courses.” Vice-principal of Sri Jai Narain Misra PG College, Vinod Chandra, who is also a senior professor of sociology, said, “LU has not uploaded the syllabus of sociology yet on its website. In such a scenario, how am I supposed to teach students. There is a lack of planning and coordination from the LU side.” Principals also informed TOI that though the NEP 2020 prescribes that a student can opt subjects of other streams/faculties, but LU has not given permission for it. For example, a student of arts can opt for a subject of science or commerce and vice versa. However, LU guidelines say that a student will have to opt for subjects within the same stream in which she/he has enrolled. Rajiv Kumar, principal of DAV College, said that many students want to choose subjects from other faculties, but since LU has not given permission, we are not providing such an option. Principal of Shia PG College, Mohammad Miyan, also said that students are not getting intra-stream of faculty subjects of their choice because of limited options. “LU has also not provided the list of vocational courses till date,” he added. LU spokesperson Durgesh Srivasatava, when contacted, claimed "University has uploaded the syllabi on its portal and all colleges have been notified about vocational subjects.” Regarding restriction on inter-stream subject combinations, he said that introducing intra-stream/faculty in one go would have overloaded colleges with work, hence it was decided to first introduce inter-department within a faculty and then gradually step into inter-faculty studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-associated-colleges-lackinfra-to-implement-nep-20/articleshow/88379400.cms||---

On Sunday, the freedom fighter’s martyrdom anniversary was observed with fervour at Faizabad Jail, where he was hanged exactly 94 years ago by the British government. People from different walks of life, including representatives of political, social and religious organizations gathered at Faizabad Jail and paid homage at the very spot, where he was hanged. Ashfaq Ullah Khan along with Ram Prasad Bismil and eight other revolutionaries enacted a daring heist of British treasury, which was loaded on Saharanpur-Lucknow passenger train on August 9, 1925. A programme was organized in the prison premises by the 'Ashfaq Ullah Khan Memorial Shaheed Shodh Sansthan', an organization formed three decades ago to commemorate the martyrs of the freedom struggle. Famous Urdu poet Nusrat Mehdi, Hindi writer Apoorv Joshi and social worker Abid Hussain, who is also known as the original 'Bajrangi Bhaijan' were conferred with ‘Mati Ratan’ award by the organization. Talking to TOI, the organiser of the programme, Surya Kant Pandey, said, “The bond of friendship between Ashfaq Ullah Khan and Ram Prasad Bismil is a striking example of Hindu-Muslim unity and we are trying to inculcate this culture of harmony among the people. Everyone must remember their sacrifice for the country and follow the path of the two revolutionaries," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tributes-paid-to-kakori-train-action-hero-ashfaq-ullah-on-94th-martyrdom-day/articleshow/88379387.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Delhi||North corporation auctioned off 13 parking sites at throwaway prices: AAP||NEW DELHI: AAP MLA Atishi on Sunday alleged that the BJP-governed North Delhi Municipal Corporation had auctioned off 13 parking sites to private players at “throwaway prices”. She claimed that if the sites had been auctioned at market rates, the revenue could have helped pay salaries to the corporation’s employees. “A few days ago, we observed that 13 multilevel parking complexes, which were meant as an important revenue source for the corporation, were auctioned off to private players at prices below market rates. Clearly, BJP is acting out of fear and haste as they are well aware that they are going to be ousted from governance in a matter of months. They have decided to sell the assets of the corporation to private players as this is their last opportunity to amass money and fill their pockets,” alleged Atishi. Delhi BJP didn’t respond to queries when asked about the allegations. “For the last several years, we have been repeatedly seeing that workers in the BJP-led corporations have been going on strike every two-three months, be it safai karamcharis, doctors or nurses. They go on strike because the corporation does not pay their salaries on time and cites the excuse of not having enough funds,” said the AAP functionary. The MLA further alleged that while parking was a major revenue source for the municipal corporations, the revenue didn’t reach their vaults. “Currently, there are around one crore cars in Delhi. It is the responsibility of the corporations to provide them parking. However, all legal parking spaces available with the civic bodies can only accommodate one lakh cars. This means all other parking arrangements are illegal and do not provide any revenue to the corporations,” Atishi claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-corpn-auctioned-off-13-parking-sites-at-throwaway-prices-aap/articleshow/88378795.cms||---

In a press meet, the minister stated the Centre is willing to extend the procurement deadline from December 31 to another month. “The original target agreed upon by the FCI and the state government for this season was only 24.75 lakh tonnes, but after the state government requested, the target was increased to 44.75 lakh tonnes, of which 30.50 lakh metric tonnes rice has been given to the FCI, all of which is parboiled type,” he said. He went on to say the state government must account for the delay. He said the Centre has not refused to purchase parboiled rice and the target for the next procurement season, which will begin mid-January and end in July (for 2021-22), is 40 lakh metric tonnes, as opposed to 32 lakh metric tonnes procured during the same season this year. The minister said that parboiled rice will be purchased then as well. “Nearly 21 lakh metric tonnes of parboiled rice from the state is lying in FCI godowns, so we asked about reducing parboiled rice from the procurement season beginning in July next year. Chief Minister is confusing farmers by talking about this when there is no such issue in current season,” he said.

Several residents, with many children among them, held the march, while holding placards. “It’s high time that the elected representatives work for the development of the area. The broken roads have resulted in frequent accidents. We all have the right to get better civic facilities,” said NLK Laksmi, a resident. “At least three stretches here need immediate attention. We had forwarded our petition to the area councillors and the MLA, but there was no action,” Laksmi added. Shopkeepers said they were losing customers due to the broken roads. “People don’t want to come here due to the bad roads,” said a trader.

PV Narsimha Rao Telangana Veterinary University experiments on broilers revealed that chicory powder stopped antibiotic growth in the gut. Researchers led by Gurram Srinivas of the department of poultry science, College of Veterinary Science, of the university said that the beneficial effect of chicory root powder in broilers might be due to the prebiotic properties of inulin. “Inulin is a soluble, fermentable fibre that is not digested by broiler digestive enzymes and serves as a substrate for beneficial bacteria in the gut of birds. The researchers said that the fermentation activity inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli and Salmonella and selectively stimulates the growth of good bacteria in the gut,” said the researchers. Researchers published their study in Plos One journal. Researchers conducted the study to find out the effect of chicory root powder on the gut performance of broilers. “Two hundred commercial male broiler chicks were randomly divided into five treatment groups with eight replications of five birds each and reared in battery brooders up to 42 days of age. The results revealed that supplementation of one per cent chicory root powder recorded significantly higher body weight gain, feed intake and better Feed Conversion Ratio compared to antibiotic.” Supplementation of chicory one percent and 1.5 per cent groups significantly increased the goblet cell number in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum of broilers. “Therefore, chicory root powder can be used as an alternative to antibiotics for improving gut performance of broiler chicken,” revealed researchers. Dietary supplementation of chicory root powder at one percent and 1.5 percent level significantly decreased the gut pH and reduced the harmful bacterial count in the intestines of broilers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/chicory-powder-alternative-to-antibiotic-in-poultry-industry-say-researchers/articleshow/88378815.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Though DS met AICC president Sonia Gandhi a couple of days ago in Parliament and reportedly got a nod from her to come back into the Congress, senior party leaders in Telangana are opposing his comeback. Senior leaders in Telangana Congress have shot off letters to Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and other AICC leaders cautioning them about a possible backlash from party members. They warned that many of them may resign if DS is welcomed back into the party. “Congress is not a rehabilitation centre where people can leave it and come back into it anytime. Also, DS has lost his hold in Nizamabad politics. DS has never condemned the statements abusing Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. ,” a senior leader said.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Nizam-era baubles get global collectors giddy||HYDERABAD: The artefacts, jewels, arts and paintings of the Nizams of Hyderabad have always commanded a very high price in international auction platforms. Even small and insignificant objects of the Nizams or princely Hyderabad state have held collectors and connoisseurs in awe. On December 17, a small white metal silver plate placeholder depicting Mir Osman Ali Khan, Nizam VII, in royal robes and young Edward VIII, had fetched Rs 11,000 in auction house Christie’s in London. It was a good price as the object was damaged and not too prominent among collectors. According to heritage experts, the Nizam' s objects – small and big - have thus far earned an estimated Rs 10,000 crore during various private and public auctions around the world in the last 70 years. These objects don't include priceless pieces like the Nizam’s diamond or Bala Kohinoor mined in the Krishna river basin, probably in the present day Mahabubnagar district, or the 11 kg gold mohur. Heritage experts date the silver plate placeholder auctioned on December 17 to the visit of then Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII), to Hyderabad in 1922. Ahmad Askander, a heritage expert from London, said the early 20th century Anglo-India related white metal silver plate placeholder is 8cm tall and was sold for £110 (Rs 11000) in the auction. “There is some minor damage to this piece. One of the figurines of tiger has its tail missing. Moreover, the picture of the Nizam is not in its best form. But it bears the photograph of the Nizam that appeared on the cover page of the Time magazine,” he said. City historian Dr Mohammad Safiullah said the piece is a hand coloured image of the Nizam VII in the Star of India Robes, awarded in July 1914. “The Nizam VII is seen wearing the robe along with the Star of India and the accompanying orders and garter. After the first war of Independence of 1857, the British had created a hierarchy of awards and medals meant for the ruling chiefs and princes of Indian princely states. Both Nizam VI and Nizam VII were awarded the Star of India Robes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nizam-era-baubles-get-global-collectors-giddy/articleshow/88378818.cms||Syed Akbar

The killing took place at Katepuram chowk in Pimple Gurav on Saturday morning. “We have arrested Ganesh Dhamale (25) and Akshay Kengle (21), both residents of Sangvi, following a tip-off. They are the main conspirators, who hatched the plot to eliminate Jagtap and got it executed through the assailants,” said senior police inspector (SPI) Sunil Tonape of the Sangvi police. “Dispute over area supremacy and revenge for Jagtap’s act of assaulting one of the plotters seven to eight months ago were the motives behind the murder,” he added. However, the two main suspects, who opened fire at Jagtap, are still at large. The police are searching for them, besides seven more. The police are also yet to recover the firearm used in the crime. The killers fired at least four rounds from close range at Jagtap around 10.30am. Two of the bullets hit him in the chest and stomach. He died later under medical attention at a hospital in Pimpri. The Sangvi police also registered a separate case of attempt to murder against the two assailants, who had threatened a 37-year-old scooterist from Dapodi passing by the spot at gunpoint before taking away his scooter to escape from the crime scene. The scooterist is the complainant in this second case. Suspect was externed An officer from the Pimpri Chinchwad crime branch told TOI that one of the two suspected assailants, Ganesh Mote, has seven cases registered against him. “He was externed from Pune district for a period of two years in September,” the officer said, adding that the police were tracking him via a mobile app. He was also sending his location and photographs through his sister’s smartphone. “But, since the last 10 days, he was not updating his status on the app,” the officer said. After the murder, Mote and another assailant were active on social media. “We are taking the help of the cybercrime cell to trace them,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-held-for-criminals-murder-in-pcmc-area/articleshow/88379414.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The man, who works at an MIDC Bhosari-based AIDS research facility, lodged a complaint with the Chatushrungi police on Saturday morning. He stated that the three men were armed with wooden sticks and slapped his colleague before robbing them. Assistant inspector Santosh Koli told TOI, “The complainant and his colleague had reached the Pashan-Sus hill for an evening stroll after finishing their day’s work, when they were stopped by the trio. The three men threatened them of dire consequences. Before the complainant could realise what was happening, one of the them slapped the woman.” Koli said the trio then asked the woman to hand over her gold chain and gold ring to them. “The three men kept on threatening the complainant and asked him to hand over his gold ring to them. The suspects then frisked them and robbed their cell phones,” Koli said. “The trio also robbed complainant’s wallet, which had cash, ID cards and driving licence. The suspects took the booty and ran from the spot,” he said. “We are working on some clues based on the questioning of residents of the Sus-khind slums, evening walkers and an analysis of cellphone data to establish the culprits,” he added. “When the incident happened, there was no one on the hill. After climbing down the hill, the victims approached the police and lodged a police complaint,” Koli said.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Now, flyers from non-risk countries to wait for result||HYDERABAD: From Sunday onwards, passengers coming from non-risk countries will also be detained at the Hyderabad airport until their RT-PCR test reports are in, said health authorities. So far, roughly two per cent of the international passengers coming from non-risk countries are being selected by the health surveillance team at the airport and the samples being taken for RT-PCR tests, as per the central guidelines. The passengers were allowed to go home or proceed to the connecting flight without having to wait for the results. “This however caused a lot of trouble to trace them after they tested RT-PCR positive and especially when they tested positive for the Omicron variant. It has been a time-consuming process. Hence, we have decided that the passengers will be detained at the airport itself till the results come in,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health, Telangana. “If they test positive they will be taken to an institutional quarantine or else they will be sent home and monitored,” he added. Over the last two weeks, tracing and tracking RT-PCR positive passengers become a big headache for the state government as many had done the vanishing act. Several passengers gave wrong phone numbers, wrong addresses and many others had switched off the mobile phones when the surveillance teams tried to contact them later on. This has also led to a scenario where tracing of few passengers took over three to four days and health authorities had to rope in police to apprehend the passengers. Also tracing of contacts has been increasingly difficult for officials as many continue to deny having met anyone after they returned. However, all passengers coming in from non-risk countries won’t be detained. “It will only be the two per cent of passengers randomly selected. At the Hyderabad airport roughly 250 passengers will be tested each day,” the state director of public health informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-flyers-from-non-risk-countries-to-wait-for-result/articleshow/88378936.cms||Amrita Didyala

At a time when gay marriages are illegal in India, the couple held a ‘promising ceremony’ wherein they exchanged rings and vows and celebrated their union with close to 60 family and close friends. Wearing white tuxes, Supriyo Chakraborty (31) and Abhay Dange (34) solemnised their eight-year long relationship in the ceremony. “For the wedding, we walked down the aisle and exchanged vows and rings. Following the event, best man speeches were delivered,” said Chakraborty. Their ceremony was officiated by Sophia David, a friend who is also a part of the LGBTQ community in Hyderabad. Although no marital rituals or formalities involved, the couple brought together the Bengali and Punjabi traditions. “Mehendi is always a woman-centric ceremony. We wanted to break that stereotype by holding the same for all men at the venue. During Haldi, we wore the Bengali topor (a headgear). Subsequently, a sangeet function was held wherein Kathak performances were given,” said Chakraborty. Even as the Indian law does not recognise their relationship as husband and husband, the couple called themselves ‘soul-mates’. “Ever since we declared our union, we have received mixed reactions from people. At large, people have been very supportive of our relationship and this ceremony was just a celebration of the same,” said Chakraborty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/1st-time-in-t-gay-couple-says-i-do/articleshow/88378984.cms||Preeti Biswas

On October 3 this year, Jennifer died on the spot while her fiancé Ajay sustained grievous fractures to his hand and spine after Kasa Srujan Kumar (28), a drunk businessman, rammed his car into their two-wheeler at Madhapur. In a twist of fate, Jennifer became the breadwinner of the family after her father John had an accident, which lead to a rod being inserted in his leg. Apart from paying for her own education, Jennifer has been taking care of her family’s needs since her Intermediate second year. She worked part-time and later full-time as quality analyst at AGS Health Pvt Ltd. Not just her parents, Jennifer funded her brother Jonathan’s education too. He was studying to become an engineer. “The atrocious thing is the apathy of the accused. On that day, he stopped for a second at the signal, but then just zoomed away in his car,” Aprisya tells TOI. Jennifer was looking forward to getting married the next year with family members preparing for the event in full swing. The horrific CCTV footage, which went viral across social media, showed Jennifer, who was riding pillion on the two-wheeler, flung high after impact. She sustained fatal head injuries. Locals rushed to assist the couple and noticed that the 23-year-old was bleeding from her nose and ears and rushed both of them to a local government hospital. However, Jennifer was pronounced brought dead. John fears that the usual delay in trial for drunk and drive cases might impact them too. “Some people are saying that the trial might begin only after two years to three years. In many cases hearings have not even started after five to six years. We fear this injustice might happen to our family as well,” John tells TOI with tears welling in his eyes. While they miss their daughter’s unconditional love and support, she continues to be a beacon of hope for them. Still financially vulnerable, the family depends on their daughter’s insurance money to help fund the rest of their son’s education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/accident-victims-parents-hope-for-justice/articleshow/88379008.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

This, as several persons arriving from both ‘at-risk’ and ‘non-risk’ countries are not following protocols and the state government has no control over isolation. The government has now petitioned Centre to modify the rules so that those who have tested negative at the airport can also be placed in quarantine. According to officials, currently, those who come from at-risk countries have to undergo mandatory testing and those testing positive will be taken to isolation centres. Those testing negative are allowed to go home but have to tested again for being in isolation for eight days. However, officials say that those testing negative were leaving their homes and going outside. “We don’t have control over them expect following up over the phone,” a health department official said. “Our officials have spoken to the Union government about these rules as the state government does not have the authority to make its own rules,” state health director Dr G Srinivasa Rao said. As of now, returnees from non-risk countries can give their samples and leave during random testing. However, most cases of Omicron detected so far have been of arrivals from non-risk countries. “The concern is that if they positive, there is no monitoring,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/current-isolation-rules-a-concern/articleshow/88378946.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

He will join TMC in Kolkata on Tuesday in the presence of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee. Lourenco’s resignation has left Congress in a state of shock. Four days ago, he was announced as the party’s Curtorim candidate for the 2022 assembly elections in Congress’ first list of eight candidates. “There were a lot of issues… people issues. So many things had to be decided and we (Congress) were not able to do it. I waited but there was no move from Congress. So, I decided to move to a party that is ready to take up the issues. And TMC does that,” Lourenco, who has held talks with both BJP and AAP before settling for TMC, said. “We are all Congressmen and we are accepting Banerjee’s Congress,” he said in a video message from Kolkata. On Monday, he submitted his resignation to the legislature secretary, and later, speaker Rajesh Patnekar accepted it. With Lourenco’s resignation, the strength of Congress in the 40-member legislative assembly has been reduced to two — leader of opposition and Margao MLA Digambar Kamat, and senior Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane. In the 2017 assembly election, Congress had emerged as the single largest party winning 17 seats. Political observers say that for more than a year, Lourenco has been exploring his political options, and finally he found it in TMC. A while ago, speculations were rife that Lourenco was to join AAP, and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal was even scheduled to visit Goa for his induction into the party. But state party president Girish Chodankar and Kamat convinced him to stay by promising to give him a big role to play in the party. Rahul Gandhi spoke to him and later, he was appointed the second working president of the party. Lourenco had also met BJP Goa election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis and discussed his plans to join BJP, but that didn’t materialise. Lourenco was the most vocal of Congress MLAs over the past five years, both inside and outside the assembly. He had raised various issues, including the three linear projects at Mollem. Recently, former chief minister and former Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro had resigned from Congress to join TMC, which nominated him as a Rajya Sabha member. Another former chief minister and former Congress Ponda MLA Ravi Naik, too, recently resigned and joined BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-working-prez-3-time-mla-lourenco-quits-to-join-tmc-today/articleshow/88399763.cms||Murari Shetye

Father Stanley, assistant parish priest, St Patrick’s Cathedral, Ghorpadi, said, “We will be having two services each on December 24, an earlier service will be held at 7 pm, followed by another at 11 pm. We usually have only one service, but this year we are having two to divide the crowd as there are limitations on the capacity. On Christmas Day we will be having five services throughout the day to accommodate as many people as we can to attend the service while maintaining all safety precautions.” St. Paul’s Church, CNI Pune (Maharashtra) will also be having two services with limited capacity. “We will be putting up special decorations for Christmas eve for the attendees to get a feel of the festival like the previous years. The nativity scene will be set up while our full capacity is 250 people, we will only be accommodating 100 attendees for each service at a time. On Christmas Eve the mass will start at 11 pm , and the Christmas Day service will be at 8 am. The same format will be followed for the New Year service accordingly,” said father Azariah, preist in-charge. At the Immaculate Conception Church, popularly known as City Church in Nana Peth, visitors will not be allowed to enter without masks for the services. “Previously the church premises used to be packed with people, when the seats would be full, people would stand on the side of the ground to attend the midnight mass, but there will be limited capacity this year,” said a church member. Churches can accommodate upto 50% capacity and 25% capacity of their open spaces. Premila Jacob, resident of Viman nagar, said, “Going to church is the most important ritual for Christmas, but we could not go last year as senior citizens were advised to stay home.

---||Hyderabad||GST hike will be death blow to textile sector: K T Rama Rao||HYDERABAD: Handlooms and industries minister K T Rama Rao has written a letter to the Central government urging it to withdraw its decision to increase GST on handlooms and textiles from January 1, 2022. In a letter to union commerce, industry and textiles minister Piyush Goel on Sunday, KTR said that the handloom and textiles sector suffered the most in the last two years due to the pandemic and would not be able to take the burden of increased GST from present 5% to 12% from the new year. It will be a death blow to the sector, KTR added. Stating that it is the textiles and handlooms sector which provides the highest employment in the country after the agriculture sector, minister KTR said that the right step in the current scenario is to extend incentives, additional advantages and other required support to the handlooms and textiles sector and not burden it with additional tax. The decision to increase the GST on handlooms and textiles is not wise, he stated in the letter. Reminding the union ministry that there was a strong opposition from the handlooms and textiles sector when 5% GST was levied on the handlooms sector, he said the current decision to impose additional seven% GST on handlooms would leave the sector crippled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gst-hike-will-be-death-blow-to-textile-sector-ktr/articleshow/88378843.cms||---

The mandal, that has been working for people in rural areas, came to know that due to accute water shortage in the village, women here had to spend hours — during the day or at night — to fetch water from outside the village. “We noted that the women and girls spent almost half of their day in fetching water. They got water from a well located 1.3 kilometre from the village. Often they would stand in the water queue for hours together,” said Father Joel Noronha, the director the MPSM, Nashik. The organisation, with the help of two companies which made contributions as a part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR), directed funds to get a pipeline from the well, which is the village’s water source. They also installed a solar-powered pump. The NGO then brought the women together to form the Jaldhara Mahila Pani Vayvasthapan Samiti, Vadmal (B) organisation. This organisation of local women would ensure the maintenance and upkeep of the piped water supply sytem that will cater to each of the 125 houses, two schools and anganwadi in the village. “Initially, there was some resistance among the women. But eventually they were convinced and we formed an organisation that decided to get drinking water to our homes,” said Selina Kashvir, one of the women from the village. In the past, a piped water scheme had been sanctioned by the state government, but was left incomplete. The villagers have now removed silt from the well, laid a separate pipeline and have also constructed two major tanks and installed taps outside the houses. Since it is a solar-powered system, the recurring cost came down drastically. “The best part is that women will no longer have to walk far for water. It is a major relief,” said Shakuntala Gangurde, another village resident. “The piped and metered water system has been set up on land donated by Raghunath Tople. Water bills will be generated every three months. The money collected will be used for repairs and maintenance ,” said Dhanraj Gangurde, who has supervised the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/remote-tribal-village-gets-piped-water-with-ngos-help/articleshow/88377548.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Meerut||UP: After khaps, now Deoband clerics oppose raising marriage age of girls||MUZAFFARNAGAR: After khaps of western Uttar Pradesh, now clerics of Deoband, too, have opposed the Centre's decision to raise the marriage age of girls from 18 to 21 years. Several ulemas in Deoband said on Sunday that the decision seems to have been taken "in haste and must be reconsidered". Jamiat Dawat Ul Muslimeen's patron Ishaq Gora said that if the Union government wants to make it a law, “then they should have consulted the religious heads of all faiths". The cleric further said that "India is a country where people follow and obey religious heads more than the government." "Our government has the right to make any law. But after raising the age of marriage for girls, the government should not be in a hurry to implement it," he added. Another Deoband cleric, Mufti Asad Qasmi, said, "They (government) won't listen to anyone. If they want to make it a law, they will do so. But I would like to point out that if a boy and a girl are not married at the right time, then there is a risk that they may commit sin. So, they should be married at a younger age." Several khaps had recently opposed the Centre’s decision, claiming it will "increase crimes against women” and that "the government should not interfere in personal lives of people". “Parents should have the sole right to decide when to marry off their daughters,” Naresh Tikait, BKU leader and head of Baliyan khap (having over a lakh followers in 78 villages of west UP), had said. Echoing similar sentiments, Thamba khap leader Chaudhary Brijpal had said, “The move will increase crime in society. Girls should be married off at the age of 16.” The Union cabinet recently took the decision to raise the legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years. The legal age of marriage for men is 21 years. The government, with this decision, will be bringing the age of marriage for both at par.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/after-khaps-now-deoband-clerics-oppose-raising-marriage-age-of-girls/articleshow/88378231.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The Gujarat Subordinate Services Selection Board (GSSSB) exam was held on December 12. Gandhinagar cops arrested the three on Saturday. The questioning of the three accused has revealed that the paper was leaked from a Sanand printing press which the board had contracted. The accused have been identified as Deepak Patel, a resident of Hathijan in Dahegam; Mangesh Shirke, a resident of Nava Naroda; and Shirke’s relative, Kishor Acharya, a resident of Manipur in Sanand. “Gandhinagar Police were given the task by range IG Abhay Chudasama to nab the accused,” said Gandhinagar SP Mayur Chavda. “A team of the local crime branch officers in coordination with Sabarkantha Police began an investigation.” Chavda said cops have found that the main accused, Jayesh Patel, and Deepak Patel had been introduced by another accused named Deval Patel. Jayesh had sold the question paper to three students: two in Prantij and one in Mehsana. Deepak was an ambulance driver at a hospital where Deval was a nurse. Deepak contacted Shirke, who worked as the night manager at a private hospital in Mithakhali. Acharya, the uncle of Shirke wife, worked at the printing press in Sanand. Chavda said that Acharya, a printing press supervisor, obtained the paper and along with Shirke and Deepak sold it to Deval and Jayesh for Rs 9 lakh. Chavda added that cops have seized Rs 7 lakh from Shirke’s house. Chavda said that Jayesh took a token amount of Rs 1-2 lakh from a target candidate and retained the candidate’s original documents. If the candidate received the leaked paper, he or she had to pay Rs 10-12 lakh. The documents were returned only after the hefty amount was paid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/paper-leaked-from-sanand-press-3-held/articleshow/88378240.cms||---

The district tour of CM KCR is likely to commence on December 23 or after Christmas. Though the CM’s tour was actually scheduled to start on December 19, it was postponed due to various reasons and also that the party announced state-wide agitational programmes like rasta rokos and dharnas on Monday in protest against the anti-farmer policies of the centre and demanding Modi-government to do justice to the paddy farmers of Telangana. The CM’s tour to the districts is likely to begin from Wanaparthy wherein he would inaugurate the new integrated district collectorate complex, lay foundation stone for a medical college and also inaugurate the TRS party office.Also, he would review with the district administration the status of various welfare and irrigation schemes in respective districts. CM’s tour dates to various districts are being finalised. He would tour Wanaparthy, Jangaon, Nizamabad, Jagtial, Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri, Vikarabad and other districts, said a senior TRS leader.

---||Pune||Pune: Shine off Wablewadi school over corruption allegations, village wants full control||PUNE: Villagers of Wablewadi in Shirur taluka want the Pune zilla parishad to return the land they had donated for building the ZP primary school. They said they want autonomy for their school which has long been the state’s poster for success stories drawing national attention for high standards of education. This year too, the school recorded 100% results in the state scholarship exams. Zilla parishad officials have called the move as pressure tactics from a group, including the principal who is under investigation for misappropriation of funds and other allegations. Till 2012, the school had just two classrooms and 34 students. After Dattatraya Ware took over as principal and with public participation, it transformed into an institution of high quality offering its 700 plus students learning in robotics, coding, invention labs, foreign language, technology departments and music. The anganwadi run by the school has 185 children. The letter, purportedly sent on behalf of the villagers of Wablewadi, complains that never has the government provided them with adequate teachers or funds for infrastructural development and the entire institution has been managed by public participation and some CSR funding. With a waiting list of 4,000 students hoping to get admission, Wablewadi school with its green buildings, techno-savvy students and innovative experiments has been a role model for the government-school system. The education secretary last year had urged other schools to replicate the model. However, what started with a single complaint by a nearby villager, who said that a donation was sought for admission of his ward, soon snowballed into an investigation into the funds coming into the school and the personal assets accumulated by Ware finally resulting in his suspension last month. A hearing will now be held in the divisional commissioner’s office. “The person who complained belongs to a political party and the allegations are false. All funds that came to the school are managed by a group of eight villagers and anyone can check the accounts. The CSR funds are not given as funds but the company either directly appoints the construction company or purchases materials for the school. I am in no way connected to the donations to the school as I am not one of the eight members managing that account. We have been conducting financial audits regularly. I have done nothing wrong. Otherwise, the school’s management committee and the villagers would not have supported me,” he said. Ware said the ZP has been talking about financial irregularities and corruption to defame him and to appease political leaders behind the allegations. But, in the suspension letter, they have only mentioned dereliction of duties, negligence, irregularity in administrative works. ZP officials who conducted the investigation said that while Ware has been successful in creating a model school, and while the suspension order does not mention any corruption charges, they have found large amounts of cash transactions in his personal bank account. These transactions have not been notified to the government as per the rules. “We have found in his personal bank statements that he has received amounts to the tune of Rs 1lakh to Rs 10 lakh from various people. As per government rules, such large transactions need to be notified, which he has not. We have not mentioned misappropriation of funds or added corruption charges in the suspension order because these are under investigation. We have three months to investigate the source of these large transactions,” a high-ranking ZP official said. “We may send the complaints to the Anti Corruption Bureau for further investigation,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shine-off-wablewadi-school-over-corruption-allegations-village-wants-full-control/articleshow/88378868.cms||Ardhra Nair

They also alleged unnecessary delay and mismanagement. Nikita Verma, a participant, alleged, "They had called us at 9 am. The marathon started at 11.30 am.

Pooja, another participant, alleged that she wasn't given a T-shirt with the slogan of ‘Lakdi hu lad sakti hu’ even after she completed all three rounds of the marathon. "I was one among the first to arrive at the event. But those who arrived much later received T-shirts and even prizes," she said. The Congress, however, suspects the hand of "other parties" in trying to create deliberate chaos at the event. The party's district president, Avnish Kajla, said, "We had the registration of 5,700 women but 2,000 more participants turned up at the venue and demanded T-shirts and even mobile phones. It wasn't possible. Some of the participants then started creating a scene." "We are aware that there are some political parties that want our events to get negative publicity.

Dnyaneshwar Sonawane, a resident, first spotted the trapped bird in an open garbage dumping site in his neighbourhood and called rescuer Manoj Gaikwad. Gaikwad said, “Someone had thrown the adhesive mousetrap, with a mouse caught in it. The white-throated kingfisher might have flown down to catch the mouse, but got trapped after getting stuck itself.” The trapped bird had been shrieking desperately for hours until the rescue team freed it from the mousetrap. “The adhesive from mousetrap was stuck to the bird's wings. We used pure petroleum jelly to remove the adhesive from the wings. The tricky exercise took a lot of time before the wings were totally clean,” Gaikwad added. After keeping the bird under observation for a few hours, it was released into its natural habitat. Known for its attractive bluish-green tinged back and upper wings with a white patch on the throat, the white-throated kingfisher has a characteristic pointed dark dull-red bill. The bird, which is categorised as of ‘least concern’ as per the IUCN Red List, has a large food base including insects, earthworms, rodents, snakes, fish and frogs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/experts-rescue-kingfisher-stuck-in-mousetrap/articleshow/88377560.cms||---

There are 19% Muslims in UP, but they don’t have their leaders in any other party. It is time when we choose our leader to resolve all our issues. We will fight for the rights of Muslims in the state." Addressing a public meeting in Nagina, a stronghold of Samajwadi Party, Owaisi said, “Parties like the SP, BSP and Congress only use Muslims as vote banks and never resolve their issues. They get their votes and later deceive Muslims.” Denying the possibility of alliance with SP, BSP and Congress, he said, "We will never have an alliance with these parties." Referring to the Meerut and Muzaffarnagar riots, Owaisi said that no one came forward to express sorrow over the death of Muslims.  Speaking about the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act , the AIMIM leader said, "Two youths were killed during the CAA protest in Bijnor. Their families were not given justice by the government. It only points out that Muslims are not safe under BJP’s rule."

In the past also, Vekariya had proposed to deposit the amount by way of compensation, but later withdrew his bail application. In granting bail to Vikariya, the high court noted the he was behind bars for more than two years.

Prakash has seen the fruits of his hard labour. With the tree showing signs of life, he is now planning to transplant it. Prakash intends to translocate the tree at a government school in Suddala village in Konaraopet mandal in Karimnagar district. Since this may cost around Rs 50,000, he is hoping for help from people to chip in and see to it that the tree regains its lost glory. The banyan tree collapsed on the outskirts of Suddala in the agriculture fields of Burra Bhoomaiah Goud and Burra Ramesh Goud. Prakash noticed that the tree was fast drying up and immediately got into the act.  Prakash took permission from another farmer to draw water from a borewell in his agricultural field and began to water the fallen tree. When new leaves started emerging, Prakash’s hopes revived. Once in two or three days, he watered the tree spending nearly three hours. What had almost become dry has now turned green with the leaves that have sprouted over the last one month. “Tears rolled down my eyes when I first saw the tree falling to the ground. During my childhood, my friends and I used to swing holding on to its hanging roots,” 32-year-old Prakash said. In the last eight years, he has collected 18 lakh seeds from villages and sprinkle them in the nearby forest areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/youth-resurrects-uprooted-70-yr-old-banyan-tree-in-karimnagar-district/articleshow/88378886.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The local gram panchayat has declared a fine of Rs 200 should an unvaccinated individual enter the village and has put up posters at village entry points about the ban. Posters banning entry of non-vaccinated individuals have been erected at entry points in Tembhurni villageTembhurni sarpanch Yashodabai Patil said on Sunday that anyone coming to the village should have taken at least one dose of the Covid vaccine. “There is a ban on entry of hawkers, workers or any other person if at least part vaccination is not done. While our village has achieved 100% first dose vaccination, almost 75% of the eligible beneficiaries here have also received the second dose. Such measures are a must during the pandemic,” Patil said. The village gram panchayat, which also encompasses nearby Pawanmari village, has invoked the enabling provisions of the Bombay Village Panchayat Act, 1958, to impose the ban on unvaccinated people. Former sarpanch Pralhad Patil said villagers have unanimously supported the ban. “Many of us have personally known how Covid can affect our near and dear ones. Besides, we have witnessed the lingering health issues some individuals have faced even after recovery. Many families have become debt-ridden while fighting Covid. All this had resulted in villagers fully supporting the ban,” he said. Mayur Andelwad, block development officer of Himayatnagar, said novel measures like the ban adopted by Tembhurni, were essential if vaccination coverage is to be enhanced in the rural areas. “At our end, we are contemplating to promote the Tembhurni model in other villages. Besides, we have decided to felicitate gram panchayats that have achieved 100% vaccination,” he said. The Tembhurni-Pawanmari gram panchayat, which has a population of around 849, as per 2011 Census, made headlines in the recent past for bagging the “mosquito-free village” tag following extensive use of soak-pits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/unvaccinated-cant-enter-this-mwada-village/articleshow/88377570.cms||Prasad Joshi

He added, “Our government has given permission for extracting ethanol from rice besides cane, which will double the income of farmers. Now, engines are being developed to run entirely on ethanol. Farmers will become energy donors besides feeding the nation.” Gadkari was in the heart of the sugar bowl of west Uttar Pradesh to launch BJP’s ‘Jan Vishwas Yatra. He was accompanied by ’state’s deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. The yatra will passed through 15 districts of western UP and conclude in Rampur. Addressing a gathering, Gadkari said, "I am a farmer. Earlier, farmers used to commit suicide in my village. Now, conditions have changed. Previous governments had never paid the cane dues on time." Extolling the development works done under the BJP government for improving connectivity, the union minister said, "Earlier the roads were full of potholes. Now, under our government, roads have been rejuvenated. The national highway authority is working to connect one state with another. It takes just an hour to complete a journey which took three hours earlier. We are making a new route from Delhi to Dehradun. In the next two years, you will reach Dehradun from Delhi in just two hours. A 16-lane road has been built from Delhi to Meerut. You will reach Meerut from Delhi in just 45 minutes." Bowing before the people in the land of Mahatma Vidur of the Mahabharat, Gadkari said, “Now, the Mahabharata of elections is set to begin. Mahabharata has taught us the difference between ‘dharma’ and ‘adharma’ and truth and untruth. You have to choose now -- to go for nation, society and welfare or hooliganism.” On his part, UP's deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, slammed the SP-RLD alliance, describing its leaders as “goons in red cap”. He said, "This alliance is an alliance of mafia.

---||Pune||At 11.5 degrees Celsius, Pune was second coldest in Maharashtra on Sunday||PUNE: The city, along with Gondia in Vidarbha region, was the second coldest place in the state at 11.5 degrees celsius on Sunday, after Jalgaon in North Maharashtra which recorded 11.3 degrees celsius. Officials at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Pune forecast a further drop in the night temperatures by 2 to 4 degrees over the next four to five days owing to the absence of any strong weather system adjacent the state and the continuing penetration of the northerly winds. “Pune and adjoining parts too will see mainly clear skies and dry conditions with the likelihood of partly cloudy weather towards afternoon and evening and late night or early morning chances of haze and a little bit of reduction in visibility,” Anupam Kashyapi, the IMD Pune’s head of weather forecasting, said. On Sunday, the IMD’s Shivajinagar observatory recorded a minimum temperature of 11.5 degrees C, which was a little over 1 degree less than Saturday’s 12.6 degrees C. Citizens could feel the cold. Besides foggy weather conditions prevailed in the morning. The met officials attributed this to the dry conditions and incursion of the northerlies into the region. Kashyapi said, “As of now, a western disturbance prevails over Jammu and adjoining parts in the form of a cyclonic circulation and another cyclonic circulation prevails over the south central Bay of Bengal. The same is like to move further and form into a low pressure area over south east Bay of Bengal. There is no system near Maharashtra and so the weather for the next four to five days in the state will be mainly clear skies, dry conditions and nil chance of rain.” He said, “With the exception of north Maharashtra, where the day temperature is likely to remain above normal, the maximum and minimum temperatures across the state are likely to remain on the lower side of the normal. This includes the ongoing December 17 to 23 week and further December 24 to 30, he added. North India is under a cold wave with the temperature falling to as low as minus 0.5 degrees Celsius in parts of Punjab and Haryana. Meanwhile, north Maharashtra districts witnessed colder conditions with a sharp drop in the minimum temperatures. According to the Dhule-based weather station of the College of Agriculture affiliated with the Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, Dhule city registered a minimum temperature of 7 degrees Celsius on Sunday — down from Saturday’s 10 degrees Celsius. Nashik city recorded a minimum temperature of 12.5 degreess celsius on Sunday against a minimum temperature of 13.6 degrees celsius on Saturday.

After a meeting with owners of Singanallur housing board flat owners in the city on Sunday, Muthusamy told reporters that the new apartments would be more spacious, stronger and better than the existing one. “The current housing unit lacks several amenities. We have discussed providing a lot more amenities in the new housing unit,” he said. Muthusamy said the 960 houses were built more than 35 years back. Over the years the building got damaged, and the structure was weakened so much that residents could no longer live there. The owners of the housing units have been demanding the government to rebuild the housing unit. Recalling that former DMK minister Pongalur N Palaniswamy as well as party’s former SInganallur MLA N Karthik had raised the issue several times, Muthusamy said that when chief minister M K Stalin learned about the plight of the housing board residents, he directed the minister to resolve the issue. “So, we have held discussions with the owners and took a decision. A 22-member committee comprising representatives from the apartment owners has been constituted for the purpose. All decisions pertaining to the construction will be taken only after discussion with the committee,’’ he said. However, details like the total area of the proposed housing unit, area of each apartment and number of floors in the building are yet to be worked out. While the state government has proposed to spend about Rs 90 crore initially, the builder would be investing a portion of the amount required for building. In return, the builder would be given a certain number of flats which he could sell and recover the money invested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/govt-to-construct-960-houses-for-housing-board-flat-owners/articleshow/88378907.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Pakistan not to allow Kartarpur pilgrims without RT-PCR report||AMRITSAR: The Pakistan government has turned down the demand of the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) to exempt the Indian pilgrims arriving at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur Sahib, via Kartarpur Corridor from carrying negative Covid-19 RT-PCR report of a test conducted within 72 hours prior to undertaking the pilgrimage. Sources said fully-vaccinated pilgrims were allowed to cross the international border from the Integrated Check Post at Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur district even if they didn’t have RT-PCR report of the test conducted within 72 hours before undertaking pilgrimage and they were also allowed by the Pakistan side to travel up to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib. Talking to TOI over phone on Sunday, Muhammad Latif, chief executive officer (CEO) of Project Management Unit (PMU), a separate department created under Pakistan’s Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) for the management of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, said the national command and operation centre (NCOC) had directed that only fully vaccinated individuals who were in possession of valid vaccination certificates would be allowed to enter Pakistan through Kartarpur Corridor besides they should be in possession of maximum 72-hour-old negative RT-PCR report before traveling to Pakistan. NCOC is the Pakistan’s governing body that implements Covid-19 policies across the nation. In the recent past, PSGPC president Ameer Singh had written to NCOC to do away with the clause of RT-PCR test for the Indian pilgrims visiting Gurdwara Darbar Sahib and urged that to allow everyone who had got two jabs of Covid-19 vaccine. Sources said pilgrims arriving in Pakistan without RT-PCR test would be turned back from the border. However, Latif remained non-committal when asked whether they will return the Indian pilgrims who wouldn’t have negative RT-PCR report. The decision is likely to be implemented from Sunday. The CEO, PMU, also informed that rapid antigen tests of the pilgrims arriving in Pakistan with cough, flu, or fever symptoms would be conducted on arrival at Pakistan side of Kartarpur Corridor and if they were tested positive, they would also be turned back to India. The PSGPC had also urged the Pakistan government to increase the strength of pilgrims arriving from India from 300-1,000 individuals. Quoting the decision of NCOC, Latif informed that as per the memorandum of understanding, they were ready to receive 5,000 pilgrims every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kartarpur-pak-not-to-allow-indian-pilgrims-without-rt-pcr-report/articleshow/88379727.cms||Yudhvir Rana

---||Meerut||UP: Cop's 'stealing' act in Hapur caught on viral video, police issue clarification||MEERUT: A cop's alleged "questionable" act in Hapur came under the scanner and was much talked about on social networking platforms, particularly Twitter, on Sunday. In a viral video, the cop can be purportedly seen "stealing" a bike from outside a bank. In the minute-long video, he can be seen sitting on the bike, using duplicate keys of the two-wheeler to open the lock and about to take the vehicle away. The cop was eventually stopped by the "vehicle's owner". UP Police on Sunday came up with a clarification: “There is a deceptive video of a policeman making the rounds on social media in which it has been alleged that the cop is stealing a bike. We want to mention that the video was shot in Hapur’s Railway Road, where several banks are located. People visiting banks park their vehicles on the road leading to traffic jams. Some people also leave their vehicles open, which can lead to theft. The cops, hence, take such vehicles to the police station and later they are handed over to their owners." Netizens, though, were not convinced. "The cop in question looked clearly suspicious as he first sat on the bike and then opened the lock,” a man tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/cops-stealing-act-in-hapur-caught-on-viral-video-police-issue-clarification/articleshow/88378280.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Goa||‘Swayampurna Goem makes Atmanirbhar Bharat stronger’||Panaji: PM Narendra Modi said on Sunday that the state’s ‘swayampurna Goem’ mission was helping strengthen the country’s resolve of becoming ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. He said that apart from Goa’s scenic natural beauty that has made it a popular tourist destination, Goa has now acquired a new identity by achieving excellence in various fields of human endeavour. Speaking at an event to mark the 60th year of Goa’s Liberation, Modi said that while the state has secured number one positions in good governance and per capita income, its score on various initiatives such as making the state open defecation-free, providing separate toilets in schools for girls, door-to-door garbage collection, har ghar jal, Aadhar enrollment, food security, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, all-weather road connectivity, (and) birth registration records, has been cent per cent. “…And the list goes on and on. When Goa starts some work, it takes it to a logical conclusion,” he said. Modi congratulated the state for achieving 100% first dose vaccine coverage for the eligible population, and expressed satisfaction over the pace of coverage of the second dose. Goa is among the few states which have performed well in vaccination coverage, he said. Chief minister Pramod Sawant came in for Modi’s appreciation for leading the state towards development. “On one side you have the vast ocean,” Modi said, “and on the other, there are youth whose dreams are also as vast as the ocean. In order to help them realise their dreams, there needs to be an equally vast vision. Pramod Sawant is working with such a big vision.” He said that the promotion of coding and robotics in schools for “future-ready” education, subsidisation of technical education, 50% fee waiver in higher education, and making youth employable through skill training would help youth realise their aspirations. Speaking further, he urged the people of Goa to set new goals to ensure Goa achieves greater heights by the time the state celebrates the 75th year of Goa’s Liberation. “The way India is taking new resolutions in the 75th year of independence for 100 years of independence, I similarly appeal to the people of Goa to take a resolution to set new goals and determine where Goa should be in the 75th year of its Liberation,” he said. His speech was interspersed with a smattering of Konkani. The PM inaugurated five projects in virtual mode — the renovated Fort Aguada jail museum, the super-speciality block at Goa Medical College, the new South Goa district hospital, the aviation skill development centre at Mopa airport, and the gas-insulated substation at Davorim, Navelim. He also laid the foundation stone for the India International University of Legal Education and Research of the Bar Council of India Trust. Freedom fighters and veterans of ‘Operation Vijay’ were honoured on the occasion. “The history of Goa’s freedom struggle is not just a symbol of India’s resolve but is a living document of India’s unity and integrity,” Modi said. Earlier, upon his arrival in the state, Modi paid homage to the martyrs’ memorial at Azad Maidan, Panaji, and also witnessed the sail parade and fly past at Miramar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/swayampurna-goem-makes-atmanirbhar-bharat-stronger/articleshow/88379763.cms||---
---||Agra||Road in Agra renamed after late VHP leader Ashok Singhal||Agra: The Ghatiya Azam Khan Road in Agra was on Sunday formally renamed 'Shri Ashok Singhal Marg', after former Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Ashok Singhal, who played a key role in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. A proposal to change the name of the road had been tabled during a municipal board meeting in September. A few months ago, 'Mughal Road' in Agra had been renamed 'Maharaja Agrasen Road', while ‘Sultan Ganj Ki Puliya’ was renamed ‘Vikal Chowk’, after late BJP leader Satya Prakash Vikal. Agra mayor Naveen Jain, who was present at the ceremony as the chief guest, said that the process to change the names of places that are reminiscent of “periods of slavery” will continue. He added, “Ashok Singhal laid the foundation of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement in 1984. He played a lead role in shaping the movement by uniting Hindus across the country for construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya.” According to Jain, the decision to rename the road was taken to honour Singhal, an engineer by training, who had been born in a house located on Ghatiya Azam Khan Road in 1926. He later joined the RSS as a full-time pracharak, and in 1981, became general secretary of VHP.

The Sena leaders are furious as the Congress and NCP leaders are not ready to accommodate them in the alliance to form a panel to contest the election for the bank which is the financial lifeline of the rural Kolhapur. A total of 21 directors are elected for a term of five years to run the bank. The Sena had supported the Congress and NCP in Gokul cooperative dairy and MLC elections. Now, the Sena leaders want their share in the seats. Recently, NCP leader and minister Hasan Mushrif said that he has agreed on giving two seats to the Shiv Sena leaders. Vijay Devane, Shiv Sena’s Kolhapur district president said, “We demanded five seats and unequivocal support from the Congress and NCP for the victory of our candidates in the bank elections. We will wait till Monday afternoon. If the Congress and NCP leaders do not accept our demand, we will form our own panel and contest the election.” Against Congress and NCP, independent MLAs Vinay Kore, Prakash Awade and Mahadevrao Mahadik are forming a panel. The Congress and the NCP want the majority of 11 seats if they win unopposed. One candidate — district guardian minister Satej Patil — has already won from Gaganbawda tehsil unopposed. Monday is the last day of withdrawal of the candidature and announcement for the panel. The representatives of cooperative financial societies who get lending from the apex district central cooperative bank are the voters. If Sena announces its panel and fields its candidates, then the Congress and NCP candidates may face trouble in winning the election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sena-may-field-candidates-against-congress-ncp-in-kdcc-bank-polls/articleshow/88377604.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Amid SilverLine row, two road projects make steady progress||Thiruvananthapuram: Even as the controversies over SilverLine rail project meant for speedy connectivity between Kasaragod and Thiruvananthapuram hot up, two major connectivity projects are silently making headway. The hill-highway project and the coastal highway project that are among the priority projects of the government are progressing at a brisk pace with the detailed project reports of 32 stretches being implemented by the Kerala road fund board (KRFB) having been cleared, 25 given financial sanction, 21 given technical sanction and work tender floated for 20 stretches. The work is going on in as many as 14 stretches, while four have been completed, as per the details accessed by TOI. The government’s plan is to create a 1,251km-long hill highway beginning at Nadarappadavu in Kasaragod and concluding at Parassala, that would traverse through 13 out of the 14 districts in the state. The government had given an administrative sanction of Rs 3,500 crore for the project. Of the 54 stretches that together form the project, 41 stretches (915km) are being implemented by KRFB, three each by the Kerala state transport project (KSTP) (68km) and the national highways authority of India (NHAI) (99km), four by the PWD roads (37km), two under district flagship infrastructure projects (DFIP) (67km) and one by road infrastructure company Kerala (RICK) (11km). Since several of these stretches passes through the forest land, the documents for forest clearances in Kasaragod, Kannur, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Thrissur, Ernakulam and Kottayam have already been submitted or have received clearance through the Parivesh portal. Since there were minor issues with the land for the route identified in Palakkad, the national transportation planning and research centre (Natpac) officials have visited Palakkad and suggested an alternative route through Karuvarakkundu-Melattur- Ucharakkadavu-Meenkara dam-Kollengode-Nenmara and Vadakkancheri. Similarly, the coastal highway that runs to 627km has 55 stretches, covering nine districts beginning from Poovar in the capital to Kunjathoor in Kasaragod. Of the 55 stretches, 42 (covering a length of 420km) are being implemented by the KRFB. While financial sanction has been obtained for five stretches, work is going on in two of them. Of the remaining 13 stretches, nine are being implemented by the NHAI (67km), two by the roads and bridges development corporation of Kerala (RBDCK) (76km) and one each by the KSTP (12km) and DFIP (2km). The preparation of DPRs for 33 stretches is progressing, for which the government has selected Infrastructure development corporation, Karnataka, (IDECK) as the technical consultant for the stretches in Kasaragod, Kannur, Kozhikode and Malappuram districts. An agreement was executed with IDECK for DPR preparation on November 24, and the site visits have begun. Regarding three stretches in Kozhikode being undertaken by the NH division, the DPR has been finalized and has been submitted to KIIFB for approval. Natpac would submit the DPR for Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Alappuzha by February. Though the deadlines have been skipped multiple times, the projects are expected to be completed during the tenure of the present government itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/amid-silverline-row-two-road-projects-make-steady-progress/articleshow/88378345.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Pune||20 exams in 3 yrs under police scrutiny after TET malpractice||Pune: The cyber police are now having a closer look at all the 20 exams in the last three years for which the task of question paper setting, compilation and declaration of results and other works were outsourced to the GA Software company. The company’s director, Pritish Deshmukh, is in police custody along with two aides since December 11 in connection with an alleged bid to leak the Mhada recruitment exam question paper. The police have since come across Deshmukh’s links with the state health department recruitment exam paper leak and the alleged malpractices in the Teachers Eligibility Test-2020 in which Maharashtra State Council of Examination commissioner Tukaram Supe and Abhishek Savrikar, a consultant to the education department, were arrested last Friday. Deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake said, “Deshmukh and his aides were associated with the recruitment examinations for different state departments. We are questioning all the people involved. Also, we are going for the arrest of some more suspects in the TET malpractice case.” On Sunday, police started questioning some more officials from the MSCE. Of 20 recruitment exams, outsourced partially or on an end-to-end basis to Deshmukh and his firm, 16 were related to the recruitment exams conducted by different police units across the state. Investigators said they have not come across any malpractice in these exams. “However, there were malpractices in the recruitment exams of the state health department (for group C and D posts), MHADA (attempt to leak question paper) and the TET exam where marks were altered for money to declare some candidates eligible. The investigators are probing the possible recruitment exam leak case of another department,” a senior police officer told TOI. Supe was booked by ACB in 2016 and a case against him was registered with the Ale Phata police station in Pune rural. Navatake said. “The teams dispatched to Aurangabad and Jalna, are stationed there. More arrests are expected,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/20-exams-in-3-yrs-under-police-scrutiny-after-tet-malpractice/articleshow/88378960.cms||---

---||Pune||Amit Shah accuses MVA of ‘culture of corruption, touts’||Pune: Union minister for home affairs and cooperation Amit Shah on Sunday charged the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government with promoting a “culture of corruption and touts” since coming to power in the state of Maharashtra. He also accused the Shiv Sena of ditching the BJP for power in the state and for compromising on the Hindutva agenda for similar reasons. Addressing a BJP workers’ meet ahead of the civic polls in Pune, Mumbai and parts of Maharashtra slated in February, Shah said, “The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena have given a new meaning to the term DBT (direct benefit transfer). The Congress has taken D for dealer, the Shiv Sena has taken B for broker, and the NCP has taken the T for transfer or cut money.” “So many cases of taking commission in transfer have been registered. Big people have gone to jail. There are only two characteristics of this government — criminalisation of politics and extortionist governance,” he said. Speaking about the Sena, Shah said, “I was in a power-sharing alliance talk with the Shiv Sena for the 2019 state assembly elections. It was decided that (BJP’s then CM) Devendra Fadnavis will be the chief minister and the elections will be fought under his leadership. But the BJP was backstabbed by the Sena, which was eyeing the CM’s post. Sena has compromised with the agenda of Hindutva for power.” Shah went on to dare the MVA leaders to step down and then together fight an election against the BJP in the state. Shah described the MVA government as an autorickshaw with three punctured tyres — all going in different directions and barely working. “It just emits gas and increases pollution,” he said. Prior to the party workers’ meet, Shah unveiled a statue of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar and laid the foundation for a statue of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji at the newly constructed main building of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). He also addressed the Convocation 2021 at the Vaikunth Mehta National Institute of Cooperative Management (VAMNICOM). At the workers’ meet, Shah said the BJP is being blamed for inflation. “The Union government has reduced tax on fuel. Many state governments have also reduced the levy but Maharashtra has not done it. Instead, the Maharashtra government has reduced the levy on liquor. The citizens should ask the state why petrol and diesel prices have not been reduced,” he said. Shah said the PMC elections will script the fall of the state government and indicate the outcome of the assembly polls in 2024. Earlier, at the PMC, Shah said, “The Congress has not left any opportunity to keep Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar away from the mainstream. The BJP wants to acknowledge the works of Ambedkar and bring him into the limelight. Ambedkar played a major role in making the Constitution a reality. The unification of society across classes was made possible by the Constitution. His contribution in pre- and post-Independence is remarkable.” Shah said the celebration of Constitution Day has been initiated by the Narendra Modi government. The real idea of Swaraj was instituted by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at a time when there was hardly any talk about it, Shah said. “The statues will keep reminding the citizens about the messages which these great personalities have given in their lifetime,” he said. At VAMNICOM, Shah said the Union government was working on a new policy for cooperatives. He also announced that a central university for cooperative management is in the works that will collaborate with states and stakeholders in the cooperatives segment for affiliation to it. “We need a cooperative policy for the next 25 years, and the Union government is working on a policy for the cooperatives segment, which will be released shortly. We are also working to establish a national university on cooperative management, which will offer training courses through institutes in various parts of the country,” he said in his address. Shah touted the “vision” of the Modi government in establishing a ministry of cooperation to streamline the sector, providing examples of Amul and IFFCO, among others, to demonstrate the potential of the cooperative segment as part of the economy and providing employment and income to a huge number of people. “Our aim is to create stronger cooperatives by strengthening the multi-state cooperatives act. We also want to help the primary agricultural societies, which many farmers depend upon, by computerising their processes, linking them to cooperative banks and to the National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) for help in financing so that small farmers too get benefited,” he said. “A lot of farmers are into organic farming as there is a lot of demand for organic food. However, farmers often do not get good prices and they also do not get certification or marketing chains. We will give them globally valid certificates that will also help them in exports,” Shah said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/amit-shah-accuses-mva-of-culture-of-corruption-touts/articleshow/88378976.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Agra||Oppn did not have guts to build Ram temple, scrap Art 370: Yogi||Agra: UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath claimed on Sunday that the BJP has fulfilled all its promises -- from construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya to abrogation of Article 370 that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir -- something he alleged that “no other party had the guts to do.” Yogi was addressing a public rally in Mathura before launching the party's ‘Jan Vishwas Yatra’ on Sunday. He said, “If they (Congress, BSP and SP) had been in power, they would not have been capable of taking such tough steps.” He went on to say that no political party could have thought of granting pilgrimage site status to Vrindavan, Mathura or Barsana either. Targeting opposition leaders for adopting policies “appeasing the minorities”, Yogi claimed, “Hindus were forced to leave the state during the rule of the previous governments. Under the BJP regime, only criminals and gangsters have left the state.” Yogi along with five other senior BJP leaders simultaneously launched the yatra from separate organisational regions of Uttar Pradesh. The day coincides with the hanging of the heroes of the Kakori conspiracy, Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaq Ullah Khan and Thakur Roshan Singh, in 1927. Continuing his attack on the opposition, Yogi said, “They were not capable of constructing the Ram temple in Ayodhya or the Vindhyavasini Dham. They would have also failed to fight against Covid-19 pandemic.” Urging people to support the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in their endeavour to establish a “Ram Rajya” in the country Yogi said, “The .opposition doesn’t like ‘Ram Rajya’-- where a poor man has his own house, electricity connection, toilet and a secure atmosphere to live in.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/oppn-did-not-have-guts-to-build-ram-temple-scrap-art-370-yogi/articleshow/88378340.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Nashik||Ambad industry body seeks fire cess rollback||Nashik: The Ambad Industries and Manufacturers’ Association (AIMA) has urged the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) to roll back the fire cess that was recently levied for the industrial units in the Ambad industrial estate in Nashik city. An AIMA delegation, led by its vice-president Nikhil Panchal, recently met senior MIDC officials on the issue. The industrialists said the MIDC had sent letters to industrial units, asking them to pay fire cess from the 2019 calendar year. The annual fire cess charges are Rs 4.54 per sq metre. Panchal said the pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the industrial sector over the past two years. At a time like this, the MIDC’s decision to levy fire charges has left the industries worried. He added that they recently met senior MIDC officials and urged them to roll back the new fire cess. When contacted, MIDC officials said they have built a fire station in the Ambad industrial estate, which has been operational since 2019. Therefore, the fire cess has been levied for the industrial units in the Ambad industrial areas only. “The revenue we get as fire cess will be spent on operation and maintenance of the fire station in Ambad. We are expected to get revenue of Rs 1 crore through fire cess every year,” they said. The MIDC officials added that they had set up a fire station in the Satpur industrial area too, but later, the fire station had been handed over to the Nashik Municipal Corporation, which is now recovering fire cess from the industrial units in Satpur. MACCIA seeks withdrawal of proposed GST hike on textile industry The Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MACCIA) has urged the Union government to roll back the proposed hike in GST for the textile industries.

---||Pune||PMC to suspend licences of vendors over dues||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has planned to temporarily suspend the trade license of those hawkers who have not paid their hawking fees. During the lockdown, the civic body had waived off fees worth Rs13 crore in this regard. Madhav Jagtap, head of PMC’s anti-encroachment department, explained, “The civic body is charging the fee for the period other than the lockdown. These remaining charges are yet to be recovered. So, PMC has given an intimation about the same to roadside vendors.” The civic areas have 21,000 licensed hawkers. Of these, around 40% have received the said notices, stating that they should make the payment at the earliest. If not, a future course of action will be plotted. They owe total dues of around Rs6 crore. Meanwhile, hawkers’ unions have opposed the move, saying payment of charges is a tough task at the moment. The amount to be paid is as high as Rs70,000 in some cases, they said, highlighting that the waiver for eight months was a lockdown discount. “Traders are not able to generate adequate income. Their businesses are yet start flourishing and reach pre-pandemic levels. Paying such high dues is not possible. We are demanding a concession from PMC,” said Balasaheb More of Pathari Panchayat, an organisation working for roadside vendors. Hawkers’ unions have demanded that PMC give some respite to vendors, and said that if reducing the charges is not possible, at least the option of paying in installments should be offered. According to PMC, the process to review traders and their work permits is underway. The civic body needs to establish 288 hawker zones to accommodate all vendors. If hawkers from merged villages are added, they will have to be included in existing zones or new ones will be created.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-suspend-licences-of-vendors-over-dues/articleshow/88378980.cms||---

Pointing out that it would be a bipartisan movement, Sudarshan said that leaders from the BJP and JD(S) were welcome to participate in the padayatra. “Our aim is to urge the government to start work on the project immediately. Once completed, it will benefit farmers in 10 districts, and ensure sufficient supply of drinking water to all the people in the region,” he said. Sudarshan said that the Congress would invite Kannada activists, leaders of farmers’ outfits to participate in the padayatra. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president DK Shivakumar will share the mission of the padayatra at Talacauvery, after offering puja to the River Cauvery at her birthplace on December 24, Sudarshan said. “Bengaluru Rural MP DK Suresh will be in-charge of organising the padayatra, which will last 10 to 12 days,” he added. The KPCC president, Sudarshan said, would tour Mysuru from December 23. “He will meet with the public as part of the Congress’s membership drive,” the Congress leader added. The much touted ‘double engine’ BJP government – a coinage referring to the saffron party being at the helm at the Centre and in the state – has failed to expedite work on the project, Sudarshan said. Why is the state government not keen on starting work on the Mekedatu project? Why can’t we hold discussions with the Tamil Nadu government, and resolve any outstanding issues?” Sudarshan asked. KPCC spokesman M Lakshman said that Karnataka could get an additional 66tmcft of water, besides being able to generate up to 440MW of power once the Mekedatu project was completed. “It will help the state government supply drinking water to 2.5 crore people across 10 districts, including Bengaluru,” said Lakshman, allaying fears of the project adversely impacting the ecology. He added that the project would not harm Tamil Nadu’s interests. “The project is aimed at storing water that would otherwise flow into the sea. The BJP must not politicise this issue, and take steps to start work on the project immediately,” Lakshman added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/congress-to-launch-padayatra-demanding-implementation-of-mekedatu-project/articleshow/88378022.cms||---

Homeless people in the city generally seek shelter at rain baseras run by government and NGOs at night. The numbers go up during winter. “At least, we get a blanket at these shelters. I cannot let my kids spend the night in the open. I had to seek shelter at one of the raen baseras after my husband’s passed away a few years ago,” said Mahi Siraz, a native of Bareilly, who sells balloons at intersections in the city. With winter in its throes, shelters are also seeing an increase in the number of beneficiaries. “We have an arrangement for 100 people. Before Covid, shelters used to be packed. But the number of people came down to 30-40 after lockdown. Ever since the cold wave hit, we are seeing around 54-60 people. This will go up further as it gets colder,” said a supervisor at the shelter at Clock Tower. Currently, the city has four shelters that are run by DMC. Meanwhile, district administration is working on distributing blankets among the homeless. “We have procured 300 blankets that will be distributed at the tehsil level,” said district magistrate R Rajesh Kumar. DMC on Sunday alsomade provisions for bonfires at 11 public spots in the city, including places like Dilaram chowk, Sai mandir, ISBT, railway station, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/with-dip-in-mercury-rain-baseras-get-busier/articleshow/88378350.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi
---||Goa||State butterfly declared, but its habitat in need of urgent protection: Goa greens||KERI: The Goa government’s decision to notify the Malabar tree nymph as the state butterfly highlights the urgent need to protect the state’s forest stretches, the natural habitat of this threatened species. Endemic to the southern Western Ghats, the Malabar tree nymph falls under the ‘near threatened’ category in the international Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) list. It is mostly found in habitats where water gradually drains out from moist hilly soil, stagnates and flows slowly in shallow streams passing through cool, undisturbed and moist forests. In Goa, this butterfly has been documented in moist forests as well as the Myristica swamp vegetation in Sattari, Sanguem and Dharbandora and in Canacona’s protected forest areas. “In declaring the Malabar tree nymph the state butterfly, the Goa government has taken the most appropriate decision. It is high time that the forest department takes necessary steps to protect the remaining patches of the Myristica swamp vegetation from increasing pressures of anthropogenic activities,” geography teacher at Government Higher Secondary School, Khandola, Vijay Gaonkar told TOI. This butterfly is known to often glide above tree canopies and fly lower in forest openings every now and then. Its flight movements have earned it the name, paper kite. In the larval stages, the caterpillar thrives on plants found in ecosystems dominated by moist deciduous and evergreen forests and in Myristica swamps. Belonging to the danaid group of the butterfly family, Nymphalidae appears mostly as a white butterfly with black markings. “One can enjoy the most mesmerising gliding flight of this butterfly inside the forest patches of the Myristica swamp vegetation of Aajobachi tali and Nirankarachi rai, the sacred groves of Sattari,” wildlifer Gajanan Shetye said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-butterfly-declared-but-its-habitat-in-need-of-urgent-protection-greens/articleshow/88399264.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

Freshers who are yet to turn 18 years but are only weeks away were considered as special cases to administer vaccines since they are staying in hostels with other students. While educational institutions such as the National Institute of Technology (NIT) Trichy have not launched classes for the first-year students, most of the arts and science colleges have started physical classroom sessions for freshers. Considering the situation, which is vulnerable to forming clusters, the corporation is conducting vaccination camps on the college campuses. In the past three days, around 700 freshers in the colleges in the city were vaccinated even though some of them were days or weeks away to complete 18 years of age. Medical officers said that most students are interested to take the jab as vaccination certificates are required to enter cinema theatres and other public places. “Some colleges are not cooperative and hesitant, but we are in the process of identifying the students who are yet to take vaccine shots and revise the target population. College managements were contacted frequently to conduct camps on priority,” a medical officer said. “We were told to prepare the vaccination status of the students. Most of the students in the government arts and science colleges were covered, but there are no specific instructions on the freshers,” A Mekala, regional joint director, collegiate education, Trichy region, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corporation-begins-vaccinating-freshers-in-colleges/articleshow/88378990.cms||Deepak Karthik

Most hotels and homestays are booked for the season and political parties have also begun holding large rallies in the run-up to next year's state polls. At the same time, the government has relaxed all Covid-related curbs and testing has also reduced drastically. Speaking to TOI on the condition of anonymity, a senior health department official said, "The state needs to immediately put a curb on mass gatherings and conduct at least 25,000 tests per day. Omicron has already knocked on the doors of neighbouring states and may appear anytime in Uttarakhand unless we act swiftly." Incidentally, Uttarakhand is able to conduct barely 18,000 tests per day, senior doctors in the state government believe, this is not a good show. "Though as per the Centre we are doing decent sampling, but this will not help us. We have to anyhow keep the sampling above or at least 25,000 per day. More testing will tell us our actual positivity rate and also, a scan of the Omicron variant," said another doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tourism-omicron-growing-together-govt-must-take-note/articleshow/88378375.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Kolkata||Docu turns lens on human trade survivors’ plight||Kolkata: A documentary with interviews of over 35 survivors of human trafficking in Bengal — ‘Malaise of Mankind’ — was recently screened at the Max Mueller Bhawan. Survivors — both girls and boys — shared stories of their physical abuse and how they were being forced to satisfy as many as 20-30 clients daily. According to director Abhijit Dasgupta, who has also directed a documentary on Purna Das Baul and is working on a series on Vivekananda, said, “At least two survivors who are now helping rehabilitate the ‘victims’ have expressed their anguish at what happens at the ‘homes’. A very active woman police officer narrated her experience of arresting rogue officers associated with child trade. The Baduria case is a pointer.” The 94-minute documentary has some chilling accounts of survivors, including one who became a slave for three years before being rescued. She spoke about how she was asked to bathe in turmeric water if her body ached due to incessant sexual and physical abuse. “Some said ‘I paid Rs 2.5 lakh to see your pretty face’,” the survivor said on camera before breaking down while talking about how rolling pins were inserted if she refused to attend to 50-55 customers. An interview with psychiatrist Kedar Ranjan Banerjee, founder of National Institute of Behavioural Sciences, elaborated their agony. “All the major ‘Puja’ festivals are the time when they have to serve 18 to 20 men a day,” he said. The plight increases when cops are less sensitized and fail to follow correct procedure. “I was told it was I who had seduced the boy. Even the chair I was on was snatched,” a survivor said. The challenge of getting compensation for survivors and risk of trafficking increasing due to child marriage were also touched upon. “I do not want to rely on statistics. It’s a shame even if one girl gets exploited. That’s why screening in villages is important,” Dasgupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docu-turns-lens-on-human-trade-survivors-plight/articleshow/88378381.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Trichy||Trichy roads dug up by DMK cadres to put up flagpoles||TRICHY: Several roads in Trichy have been dug up to put up party flagpoles leaving commuters and residents livid. As a special public grievance meeting is scheduled to be held for the voters of Trichy West assembly segment at St Johns Vestry Anglo Indian School in Cantonment on Monday, DMK cadres have erected dozens of DMK party flags on roads connecting the school. The Major Saravanan Road and Collector Office Road in Cantonment were drilled at multiple places, not less than 50 spots, to set up the poles for DMK flags. “Much has been said about how illegal it is to dig up the roads for positioning flag poles and flex banners, but nothing has changed. Safety of the people commuting on the roads is not of concern,” C Balasubramanian, a resident of Karumandapam said. As buses take up most of the road space, two-wheeler riders lack adequate space to travel. At multiple places, the flag poles were dug for at least 1-2 feet into the carriageway, which could lead to deterioration of condition of the roads after rains in the coming days. As the stretch already lack adequate parking space, cars usually parked at the vacant space adjoining the roads have also been struggling due to the flagpoles. “Our high command has strictly told not to misuse public space for erecting party flags or banners but some of the over-enthusiastic cadres are not listening. The flag poles will be removed,” a source in the DMK Trichy unit said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-roads-dug-up-by-dmk-cadres-to-put-up-flagpoles/articleshow/88379018.cms||---

With this, the citizens will get a place to spend time in the natural surrounding. Astik Kumar Pandey, the AMC administrator, said the play park landscaping, outdoor gym, seating arrangement along with the pathways would be ready before January 20. Pandey said, “We have also discussed the development of urban dense forest on around 1.2 acres of land along the Kham river near the Income Tax office wall with the help from Village Social Transformation Foundation. The Foundation will install water tanks to suffice the need of watering for the dense forest, which will also act as an oxygen hub in the urban landscape,” he said. The restoration movement for the Kham river started in January this year with the involvement of citizens, private partners and government authorities. Besides AMC, Cantonment Board, Aurangabad Smart City Development Corporation, Varroc Group, Confederation of Indian Industries and Think-Tank Eco Sattva are working towards the rejuvenation project. As a part of the initiative, deepening, widening and pitching of river banks on 7km stretch has been done so far, along with plantation of more than 10,000 trees.

---||Goa||Zantye’s fate uncertain as BJP inducts MGP candidate||Panaji: MGP’s candidate for Mayem, Premendra Shet, joined BJP on Monday, raising uncertainty over the candidature of sitting MLA Praveen Zantye for the upcoming assembly election. Shet’s brother Anant, who died in 2020, was a former Mayem MLA and speaker of the House. Premendra had contested the ZP election, but narrowly lost to the BJP candidate. Recently, he had joined MGP to contest against the BJP candidate. BJP said that due to the “unholy” MGP-TMC alliance, Shet joined the party. Its Mayem mandal assured CM Pramod Sawant and state BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade that the party would win Mayem. Sawant said that a lot of people have joined BJP and this will continue. Sawant said that only BJP can develop the state, and added that Congress is almost finished in the state. “Only leader of opposition Digambar Kamat is left in Congress, and I am not inviting him to BJP,” he said. Hitting out at Trinamool Congress (TMC), Sawant said that in two days, 140 people were killed in Bengal and many women have been raped. Sawant said that Goans will preserve its culture and “TMC should not tell us”. Shet, meanwhile, said that he will work for the party as per directions. Tanavade said that Shet told him that he was forced to join MGP. Tanavade expressed confidence in BJP Mayem karyakartas to get a party candidate elected. Taking at dig at TMC over launching a campaign to give doles to women, Tanavade said that if it was announced by Sawant people would have believed it, but that they will not believe TMC. “TMC should first start the scheme for their people in West Bengal,” he said. Tanavade said that there is no democracy in West Bengal, adding that people are brought from Bengal and agencies have been hired to campaign in Goa. He also said that instead of spending money in Goa, TMC should spend the same money in Bengal to help its people. Tanavade said that out of eight candidates declared by Congress, only five will remain by next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/zantyes-fate-uncertain-as-bjp-inducts-mgp-candidate/articleshow/88399279.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Running out of coal, Gehlot turns to Sonia as Chhattisgarh delays mining clearances||New Delhi: Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has turned to Congress president Sonia Gandhi in the hope of speeding up state-level mining clearances for commencing production of coal from blocks allotted to its power projects in Chhattisgarh where the party is in power.In a letter to the party president last week, Gehlot said the delay in mining clearances for the Parsa coal block from the Chhattisgarh government could leave 4,340 megawatt generation capacity in Rajasthan stranded because the mineable reserves of two mines fuelling Rajasthan’s power plants since 2013 are expected to be exhausted by the end of this month.Gehlot’s knock on Gandhi’s door comes after his appeal to party colleague and Chhattisgarh counterpart Bhupesh Baghel in October and letters from his senior bureaucrats seeking interventions by the Union power and coal ministries went unheeded, as first reported by TOI on December 12.If the new mines are delayed and the existing mines run out of coal, tariffs in Rajasthan will rise further as utilities will be forced to source coal or power — or both — from outside at much higher cost. This could have a negative political fallout as tariffs were recently raised by 33 paise per unit, making them one of the highest in the country.The blocks in the eye of the storm are, Parsa East, Kante Basan, Parsa and Kante Extension in Sarguja district of Chhattisgarh. Located in the Hasdeo Arand forest area, the blocks and mines have been in the eye of protests by tribals who in October opposed mining activity in the area.Parsa East and Kante Basan were allotted to Rajasthan power utility in 2007 and their Phase-I mines will run out of coal this month. Parsa and Kante Extensions were allotted in 2015 and are causing strain between the two Congress-ruled states.The Chhattisgarh forest department has yet to give mining clearance for Parsa — with a projected production capacity of five million tonne per annum — even after the Union environment and forests ministry according Stage-II forest clearance on October 21. For the Kante East and Kante Basan blocks, the Chhattisgarh administration is yet to make the necessary amendment in forest clearance for handing over 1,136 hectares of land approved by the Union environment ministry. The additional land is estimated to raise production from the two mines by 40% to 21 million tonnes a year from 15 million tonnes.For the Kante Extension block with an estimated production of nine million tonne a year, the Sarjuguda district magistrate is yet to hold public hearings needed for clearance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/running-out-of-coal-gehlot-turns-to-sonia-as-chhattisgarh-delays-mining-clearances/articleshow/88379526.cms||---

Flight 6E 865/872 will operate on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. It will start at 5.25 am from Delhi and arrive in Trichy at 8.25 am. The flight will return from Trichy at 2.25 pm and reach Delhi at 5.20 pm. In all, 14 members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha from the central districts led by Mayiladuthurai DMK MP S Ramalingam had recently submitted a memorandum to the civil aviation minister demanding a flight to Delhi from Trichy. Ramalingam said a long-pending demand of travellers here will now be met as they need not depend on Chennai or Bangalore to reach the national capital and vice versa in return. He said travellers can save up to four hours without stopover. “The first-ever direct flight in the sector will be very helpful for parliamentarians like us. Supreme Court advocates, officials, academicians and industrialists are struggling to reach Delhi without a direct service,” he told TOI. The flight will be a boon for officials, scientists and academicians from several central government as well as scientific and educational institutions in the region. They include public sector units like Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, Heavy Alloy Penetrator Project, Ordnance Factory Trichy, research institutes like National Research Centre for Banana, Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology in Thanjavur and higher educational institutions like National Institute of Technology, Indian Institute of Management, Bharathidasan Institute of Management and Bharathidasan University functioning in and around Trichy. This apart, the new service will open avenues for domestic cargo also, a senior official at Trichy international airport said. Raw materials, machinery, spare parts and finished products can be airlifted in both directions from Trichy airport. Postal transaction can also be done without any delay, the official added. IndiGo had operated a flight earlier to Delhi from Trichy via Bangalore on a trial basis. However, it did not last long due to low patronage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/indigo-to-launch-direct-trichy-delhi-flight-in-jan/articleshow/88379034.cms||---

K S Shan, 38, SDPI state secretary, was knocked down from his bike by a car in Mannanchery around 7.30 pm on Saturday after which a four-member gang repeatedly stabbed him. Shan, who was rushed to hospital, succumbed to his injuries around midnight. Adv Ranjith Sreenivasan, 44, BJP OBC Morcha state secretary, was murdered in Alappuzha town at around 6.30 am on Sunday after around 12 armed men barged into his house and hacked him to death in front of his wife, mother and younger daughter. Both murders happened barely a dozen kms apart, prompting speculation on intelligence failure and lack of adequate precautionary measures on the part of the police. The district collector has issued prohibitory orders under Section 144 in Alappuzha on Sunday and Monday considering the possibility of further violence. Condemning the killings, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said, “Such heinous and inhumane acts of violence are dangerous to the state. I am sure that all the people would be ready to identify and isolate such killer groups and their hateful attitudes". The police have been asked to nab all people behind the murders, he added. IG (South Zone) Harshitha Attaluri, who is in charge of the investigation, said police have taken around 50 people, including anti-social elements, general public as well as workers of BJP-RSS and SDPI, into custody. Denying charges of police failure, especially after the first murder, she said: "We cannot give protection to every house." It is learnt that Mannanachery police have taken 11 persons into custody for Shan's murder and Alappuzha South Police 15 persons for Ranjith's killing. An ambulance belonging to SDPI has also been seized and three persons travelling in it have been detained. BJP state president K Surendran said Ranjith's murder was planned and executed by Popular Front of India (PFI). He told reporters in Kozhikode that support from CPM and police had emboldened the outfit to commit crimes. He also said RSS or BJP had no role in Shan's murder. SDPI state general secretary P K Usman said there was no political tension prevailing in Mannanchery that could have led to such an attack and alleged that there was a serious conspiracy behind the incident. Shan had done exemplary work for the party in Mannanchery and this could have upset organizations like the BJP, he said. The attack on Shan happened around 7.30pm on Saturday at Kuppezham junction along Mannanchery-Ponnad road. The SDPI leader was returning home on his two-wheeler when he was knocked down by a car and stabbed repeatedly by a four-member gang travelling in it. The gang members escaped from the scene in the same car. Shan, who was seriously injured in his arms, legs, abdomen and head, was first rushed to a private hospital in Alappuzha and then shifted to a private hospital in Ernakulam for an emergency surgery. He, however, succumbed to injuries by around 11.30pm. The visuals of the attack have been recovered from a CCTV camera installed in a house in the area. BJP leader Ranjith was murdered around 6.30am on Sunday, when a group of men barged into his house. The front door of the house was left open by his elder daughter who went out for tuition classes. He was rushed to Alappuzha general hospital but could not be saved. Police have recovered CCTV visuals of 12 persons walking through a bylane and escaping in six bikes after the crime. The autopsy will be conducted at Alappuzha government medical college hospital only on Monday morning as the Covid test result came late on Sunday. Ranjith’s wife Lisha is a lawyer practising in Alappuzha. Bhagya and Hridya, students of class IX and VII respectively, are his daughters. Fansila is Shan’s wife while Hiba Fathima (class VI) and Liya Fathima (UKG) are his daughters. His body was brought to Mannanchery in a procession from Ernakulam on Sunday evening and the funeral was held at Ponnadu Muslim Jamaath burial ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/political-killings-back-with-a-vengeance-as-sdpi-bjp-leaders-murdered-in-alappuzha/articleshow/88379043.cms||---

Four cases were picked up at the Mumbai airport surveillance, while the rest were detected from Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune (rural). State health authorities said that 28 patients have already been discharged, while the rest remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. The four cases detected from Mumbai were travellers returning from abroad—a 21-year-old woman from Aurangabad and a 41-year-Daman resident who had returned from the UK, and a 57-year-old and a 38-year-old from Karnataka who came from Tanzania—who tested positive for Covid-19 when screened at the airport. While the Aurangabad resident is vaccinated with both shots of the Pfizer vaccine, the other three have taken double shots of Covishield, the BMC confirmed. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC executive health officer, said all four don’t have any symptoms and have been hospitalised as a precaution. The Pune case is of a five-year-old boy from Junnar district, who is a close contact of a traveller from Dubai. He is asymptomatic, state health officials said. The Pimpri-Chinchwad case is a 46-year-old returnee from a middle eastern country. He has mild symptoms and is admitted at a private hospital. His vaccination is complete, the officials confirmed. All six were found positive for Covid-19 on December 14 following which they were admitted at Andheri’s SevenHills Hospital and their samples sent for genome sequencing. The Pune-based National Institute of Virology con-firmed the variant on Sunday. Mumbai has treated 23 Omicron cases till now, of which 10 are residents and 13 overseas returnees who had landed at the airport. Thirteen of them have been discharged already. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said most of the positive cases are vaccinated with both shots and sometimes even three shots of the vaccine. Almost all have mild to no symptoms, which could be attributed to their vaccination status. Experts globally have said that breakthrough infect-ions from Omicron are common among the vaccinated. Of the 54 cases in Maharashtra, 23 are from Mumbai, 11 from Pimpri-Chinchwad, seven from Pune rural and three from Pune city. Three cases have been detected in Satara and two each in Kalyan-Dombivli and Osmanabad. There are also patients from Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Kerala. Maharashtra has carried out an RT-PCR test of nearly 22,000 travellers at the airport of which 83 have come positive for Covid-19. Overall, over 600 samples have been sequenced of which 54 have been found with the Omicron variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/6-new-omicron-cases-take-maharashtra-tally-to-54-28-patients-discharged/articleshow/88379037.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Under Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, Morth launched the ‘Green Highways (Plantation, Transplantation, Beautification and Maintenance) Policy, 2015’ which promotes greening of highway corridors with participation of the community, farmers, private sector, NGOs and government institutions. In an exclusive chat with TOI on board his aircraft to an election rally at Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh, the Nagpur MP explained the various green energy projects he is pursuing and plans to make the country pollution free. Excerpts: Q. In what way will a green highway be beneficial?A. It would help the country in achieving zero pollution. It would be a completely new road, which would be starting from zero and straight in alignment. We will be using materials like plastic and rubber in bitumen. There will be a large number of green tree plantations on both sides. Importantly, it would be a fully access control expressway and due to its straight alignment, it would save a lot of fuel and effort. In the current system, we are changing two lanes to four and four lanes to six, but they are consuming more fuel and time. Q. Morth is also working on the e-highway concept.A. We are currently building 26 green highways that would connect ports, airports, railways and bus stations, capitals and religious tourism centres. We are trying to make Jaipur-Delhi Expressway into an E-highway where the trucks and buses would run on the electric cables just like a train. Some of these 26 green highways are under the Bharatmala project and Gatishakti scheme. When I took charge of Morth, the total length of highways was 96,000 kms and now it’s over 1.47 lakh km. Our aim is to take it to 2 lakh km. We are going to implement many new concepts and technologies with a view to make transportation cost-effective, pollution free and environment friendly. Q. You often talk about hydrogen fuel. A. We are planning to use the green hydrogen fuel from wastewater by using solar energy. It is possible by using electrolyzers. One of the start-ups in Bangalore exports all its electrolyzers to the United States. We can use it in India. In municipal corporations and councils, sewage water is available in plenty. By segregation of solid waste management using the rooftop solar, we can make green hydrogen with the help of electrolysers. The power and water cost of producing it would be negligible. We can use this fuel even in railway engines along with cement and chemical companies instead of coal. It is the fuel of the future, due to its economic viability. We can also run trucks and buses. It is going to save our imports in a big way. From an environmental and ecology point of view it would be the best thing happening to our country. Q. Is green hydrogen tried and tested in India?A. In the first week of January, we are starting a pilot project where we would be getting a green hydrogen car from Toyota in Japan. We will be filling up green hydrogen from the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) Faridabad laboratory, which already produces it. It is an experiment to show people that using this form of fuel is possible. A day will come in two years, where we would have vehicles running on hydrogen, which would be a big revolution in the country, and it can also reduce pollution. Q. Why do you always strive to use green fuel?A. We are currently importing crude oil which is costing the nation over Rs 8 lakh crore. In the next five years, the cost would jump to Rs 25 lakh crore. Fuels like ethanol, bio-LNG ad bio—CNG which is made from rice straw, electric vehicles are all solutions to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. We are also granting permission to use flex engines in two, three and four wheelers. We are coming up with hybrid-flex engines like Toyota Camry that can produce power while running on ethanol. We are already working on the battery chemistry using batteries of lithium, sodium, zinc and aluminium. In two years, the cost of electric vehicles would be equivalent to petrol and diesel products. Electric is also one of the technologies of the future and we want to make trucks running on it. Even in construction equipment, we want to use biofuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/green-hydrogen-fuel-from-waste-water-is-technology-of-future-says-gadkari/articleshow/88379040.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Wagh criticised the incumbent legislator Francis Silveira for not taking up development works after joining BJP along with nine Congress MLAs in 2019. “Currently, local governing bodies in St Andre have no power. All decisions are taken by the current legislator. Local officials who were working hard have been transferred to other places,” he said. “Over the past one and a half years, there have been no gram sabhas held by panchayat members, which is mandatory for village development. Why are they afraid to organise gram sabhas?” he asked. “St Andre constituency needs to be fearless. This fear was dispelled by my brother Vishnu Wagh when he was an MLA, and hence many development works were completed. Unfortunately, the fear is once again prevalent among people here,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-quitting-bjp-wagh-joins-aap/articleshow/88399318.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He said the government had already increased the fund allocated for renovation of old school buildings from Rs 75 crores to Rs 250 crores. Steps will also be taken to get additional funds from Nabard if needed, he added. “We have been discussing the demolition of unusable school buildings with chief education officers for the last four months,” he said. A total of 410 school buildings have been identified as damaged ones in Trichy district. Meanwhile, demolition of dilapidated government school buildings in Theni began on Sunday. District collector K V Muralidharan told reporters that 96 classroom buildings have been identified to be razed down in the first phase. “We have also formed a committee of experts comprising 58 officials of the rural development, revenue, public works department and Tamil Nadu water and drainage board to supervise the demolition and identify the left-out government, government-aided as well as private schools that might have weak buildings,” the collector said. The expert teams, one each for the eight panchayat unions, will be monitored by the respective department heads at the block, taluk and district-level.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Schools reopen for Class VI and above, some mull cancelling winter break||NEW DELHI: After a break of almost two weeks, students of classes VI to XII are back at private schools. Government school students had joined classes on Saturday. However, due to the rising Covid-19 cases, parents are worried and even schools are concerned about attendance. Some schools are deliberating on cancelling the winter break, especially for students of classes IX to XII so that they can complete their practical classes. After receiving several representations from parents, the education department and Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, and with improvement in air quality, the Committee on Air Quality Management had allowed reopening of schools for classes VI to XII from December 17. For junior classes up to Class V, classes are expected to start on December 27. Sudha Acharya, principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka and chairperson of National Progressive Schools Conference, said, “Students of classes VI to XII will be attending school at 50% capacity following all Covid-19 protocols. We will ask students to carry the consent form along with them.” Acharya is thinking of cancelling the winter break for senior students. “There has been a lot of learning loss due to the closure. We could compensate for practical classes during the winter break. The second-term examinations also need to be scheduled, so we will have to make some adjustments,” she added. The Indian School, which usually has its winter break from January 2 to 7, may carry on as planned. “Online classes were continuing, so I don’t think we will cancel the break. Moreover, as it is a part of the academic calendar, many parents say they have trips planned,” said principal Tania Joshi. She had called students of classes VI to XII from Monday, but was unsure how many would turn up. Nihal Sethi, a parent of a Class XI student, said, “My son wants to attend school, but Covid-19 cases are increasing and we really don’t know how infectious the Omicron variant is.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/schools-to-reopen-today-some-mull-cancelling-winter-break/articleshow/88379048.cms||---

On Sunday, the state reported 902 cases, pushing the cumulative Covid load to 66.49 lakh, and nine deaths to take the death toll to 1,41,349. Mumbai recorded 321 new cases, the highest since November 10 (339), and two deaths. The city’s overall caseload is now 7.67 lakh and death toll 16,365. Coronavirus live updatesSuresh Kakani, BMC additional municipal commissioner, said that the slight rise in cases in Mumbai could be due to more foreign travellers testing positive gradually. “Earlier we hardly found any positive cases. Gradually that number started to go up to two and three, now it’s about eight. On Sunday, it was ten,” said Kakani, adding that once foreign returnees come positive, their close contacts too have to be tested.

---||Goa||FC Goa very disappointed to lose Juan Ferrando: Puskur||Panaji: FC Goa will announce their new coach in the next 24 hours after Juan Ferrando triggered the release clause in his contract and moved to ATK Mohun Bagan. In swift developments on Sunday, Ferrando told the club that he will pay the necessary fees – as per the release clause in his contract – to free himself for the contract. Once the money was paid, he moved to ATK Mohun Bagan’s team hotel and will be on the bench for the club’s next clash against NorthEast United FC on Tuesday. The developments took Goa by surprise, but they are expected to quickly have a new coach in place. As reported by TOI on Monday, the club will choose between technical director Derrick Pereira and Spanish coach Angel Viadero, who was previously interviewed for the job. “We are very disappointed to lose Juan,” Goa’s director of football Ravi Puskur said in a statement on Monday. “His decision to leave the club was rather unexpected and came as a surprise, particularly at this juncture, where we are in the middle of the season. “We are particularly disappointed that we were kept in the dark until yesterday (Sunday) morning where he communicated his desire to leave the club. However, once he stated his stance and the release clause was activated, we were left with little alternative. I wish Juan the best for his future.” Ferrando did well with Goa taking the team to the playoffs of Indian Super League (ISL) last season, securing three draws in the high-profile AFC Champions League and then winning the Durand Cup early this year. For the rest of the season, though, he will be at ATK Mohun Bagan. The Kolkata giants confirmed on Monday that Ferrando will replace Antonio Lopez Habas, who quit on Saturday following disappointing results this season. “I will give my 110% from day one, so all fans can enjoy the best brand of football and hopefully we can celebrate together soon. I will consistently work towards helping our team give their best,” Ferrando said after completing the move.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-very-disappointed-to-lose-juan-ferrando-puskur/articleshow/88398659.cms||---

NMC will provide breakfast, lunch and dinner to Covid patients during the projected third wave of Covid. The civic body has already floated tenders for the purpose and the division-wise contractors are to be appointed for all six divisions after the bidding process is over. During the second wave, NMC had provided food to the Covid patients at some of the Covid facilities, while NMC had also taken help from NGOs and social outfits to provide the food. This time, NMC has planned to provide food on its own. The second wave was bigger than the first wave. While the number of active Covid patients had increased up to 6,200 during the first wave of Covid, the active cases had reached 28,000 during the second wave. Considering that there may be a spike in Covid cases, the NMC administration has already planned for more beds. NMC has planned to set up 13,000 beds in both civic and private hospitals. Of the 8,500 beds which are ready, NMC has 3,500 beds prepared for Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/contractors-will-supply-food-to-patients/articleshow/88377721.cms||Tushar Pawar

Following the block, around 20% of the work on the 9.4-km-long stretch is likely to be completed, said officials, adding that pending work on the stretch would be completed in the next few months. “The 18-hour block was crucial as our teams had to cut and connect the newly laid lines between Kalwa and Mumbra. We will need few more blocks, including some spanning over 36 to 72 hours to make the stretch fully operational,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief spokesperson at CR. The railways have cautioned local residents to not cross the lines, especially between electric poles 36/21 and 38/7 and tunnel 1. The dormant lines will be made operative in both directions immediately after the block ends and there will be traffic moving on it, said Sutar. The CR also undertook a megablock of five hours on the Harbour line the same day to install the girders of Sandhurst Road bridge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-18-hour-mega-block-held-by-cr-to-connect-5th-6th-lines/articleshow/88379056.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Wordplay, pun and fun mark Khasdar Mahotsav||Nagpur: Don’t underestimate words for they hold the power to create history, said eminent poet Kumar Vishwas as he took the stage to host poetry night at the ongoing Khasdar Mahotsav here on Sunday. Kumar, along with other poets Shambhu Shikhar, Shikha Pachauri and Vineet Chauhan made the night exciting for all the poetry lovers who came braving the chilly weather. Underling the importance of poetry, Vishwas, better known for his satirical creations, said audience loves to be entertained by way of various performances at any festival, which also touch human emotions, but these cannot overwhelm the words full of wisdom as they have the power to show mirror to all. Soon after the introduction by Vishwas, first poet to take the stage was Shambhu Shikhar. The perfect way to get the audience in mood was through making them laugh and that is exactly what Shambhu did. Using satire as an apt tool to highlight the present day situations and netas, the comedian-cum-actor-poet, from Bihar, did not mince words to describe what politics in Uttar Pradesh, which is going to polls next year, is. Shambhu also left the audience in splits when revealed his amusing experiences in Nagpur. Next on the stage was elegant Shikha Pachauri, who soon became the heartthrob of the event with her recitals on love and romance. Her presentation made the audience re-live the romantic feelings of being in the films of yesteryears. Making things a little serious, Vineet Chauhan emphasized his passionate nationalist feelings for the motherland through the poetry and sparked the same zeal among the audience. Recalling his Marathi background, he also spoke in much reverence of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Lastly came the one the audience was eagerly waiting to listen to. Kumar Vishwas lived up to the vishwas with his dynamic finish to the splendid night. Not sparing politicians of all hues, Vishwas’s satire, in his typical style, made the audience ponder over several current issues, balancing perfectly with his wit and choice of words.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wordplay-pun-and-fun-mark-khasdar-mahotsav/articleshow/88379050.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Varanasi||SP is pained at end of mafia empire: Smriti Irani||VARANASI: Union minister Smriti Irani slammed the Samajwadi Party, accusing it of patronising criminals and mafia, and said watching the state government bulldoze the illegal buildings and economic empire of the mafia was very painful for the opposition party. Addressing a public meeting at Lanka ground in Ghazipur on Sunday afternoon while flagging off the Janvishwas Yatra of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Irani said that the mafia’s empire could be bulldozed in UP because the steering of the government was in the hands of the people. Keeping the SP on her target on the home turf of jailed mafia don and MLA Mukhtar Ansari, who along with his family and gang members faced demolition of properties created with illegally earned money as well as their confiscation, Irani said the people of Ghazipur have witnessed how the empire of mafia is getting bulldozed. The crackdown on mafia was proving very painful for SP and if the steering wheel of the state goes in some other hands, the direction of bulldozers would change again, she added. “The SP leader got vaccinated himself but misled the innocent people on Covid-19 vaccine. People of UP will decide whether they will prefer those who stood with them like a shield during Covid-19 pandemic or those who did nothing except sowing doubts in minds to mislead,” said Irani. Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for steering the country ably in difficult times, she said, “The PM not only ensured free vaccines for all countrymen, but also provided foodgrain for the poor in view of the economic problems faced during pandemic.” Taking a jibe at Congress leadership without taking any names, she said, “When elections approach, some people start claiming they are Hindu. But a Hindu would never seek evidence from the army and air force on their operations. The brother and sister, who used to visit Amethi once in five years, have now started spending more time there after only two and half years,” she said. Before flagging off BJP’s Janvishwas Yatra, she said this yatra symbolises the ‘Vikas Yatra’ (journey of development) of five years of the Yogi Adityanath government in UP. It will help the people recall how government jobs were robbed, unemployed were cane charged, farmers were harassed and mafia amassed wealth during the SP regime and will compare it with the Modi and Yogi governments, which cared for all people and served all sections of the society. The yatra will culminate in Amethi after passing through 71 assembly seats across Chandauli, Sonbhadra, Mirzapur, Prayagraj, Kaushambi, Pratapgarh, Bhadohi, Varanasi, Jaunpur and Sultanpur. During this yatra, 10 public meetings and roadshows will be organised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/sp-is-pained-on-watching-mafia-empire-getting-bulldozed-irani/articleshow/88378411.cms||---

During the hearing Congress and MGP petitions were taken up together. Arguments on the MGP petition began and went on for sometime after which the judges said that the present bench is only available till Thursday and that it would, therefore, be appropriate to keep the matter after the Christmas vacation. The high court last month issued notice to the defectors and speaker. Chodankar filed a petition challenging the speaker’s order which had held that the 10 defector MLAs didn’t incur disqualification by joining BJP. Goa Forward Party (GFP) has filed an intervention application in the case. In April, terming the merger of 10 out of the 15 Congress MLAs with BJP as valid, speaker Rajesh Patnekar had said that the 10 former Congress legislators, including deputy CM Chandrakant Kavlekar, could not be disqualified. “It is not in dispute that on July 10, 2019, the strength of Congress was reduced from 15 to five because 10 MLAs that constituted 2/3rd strength of the party merged into BJP. My office received the intimation and seating arrangements in the House were accordingly changed,” Patnekar had observed. His order stated that a decision by a political party regarding a merger was not required to be proved as per paragraph 4(2) of the Xth Schedule of the Constitution of India. Chodankar’s case was that the 10 MLAs had voluntarily given up party membership, making them liable for disqualification under the 10th Schedule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-adjourns-cong-mgp-pleas-to-disqualify-defector-mlas-to-jan-5/articleshow/88399356.cms||---

After secretary Rajendra Gawas explained the GPDP plan to members at a special meeting on Liberation Day presided over by sarpanch Manisha Chopdekar and sought approval, the members criticised it, as it contained plans for construction of gutters and their maintenance, and also waste management. A VDC member, Ganesham Shirvoikar said that 95% work in GPDP includes construction of gutters. “There is no project or community programme, developmental scheme on points of health, education, sports, promotion of farming, agriculture, environment protection, employment generation or promotion of traditional and cultural activities,” he said. Another VDC member Tushal Priolkar said preparing the plan without VDC members was in breach of constitutional procedure. An earlier gram sabha had resolved to hold VDC meetings on Sunday to allow the working class members to contribute to the plan. But members alleged that the panchayat held them on weekdays. Tukaram Kunkolkar, another member said that such works and waste management have to be carried out routinely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chimbel-locals-reject-devpt-plans-say-require-health-edu-schemes/articleshow/88399349.cms||---

At a virtual discussion on nature and environment with actor Gul Panag on Sunday, the author said, “Due to rapid urbanisation, nature lovers have to go to far-off places as one can see shops and hotels almost everywhere.” Saying that climate change was a major challenge before the world, he asked global leaders to take the issue seriously. “Governments and leaders keep holding meetings but nothing concrete happens. Climate change has to be handled globally but we live in a broken world where nobody seems to agree with each other,” he lamented. Speaking about the impact of Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdowns over the past year, the noted author said that the period was a difficult one, especially for children and youngsters. “During the lockdown, I would see different birds from my window, some of which I had never seen before. But once the restrictions were lifted, the winged creatures were no longer visible,” Bond said. He added that during that period, he wrote more than he would usually do. This online discussion was organised at the launch of his new book titled “While the birds still sing”. Speaking about the book, the author said that it was a compendium of poems and essays written by him recently as well as some written by him over the years. “This book is about my understanding of the natural world,” Bond said. The book has been published by Doon-based Natraj Publishers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nature-lovers-now-have-to-travel-far-to-experience-nature-ruskin-bond/articleshow/88378408.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Pune||Vaccines can be tweaked for variants: AIIMS chief||Pune: AIIMS-Delhi director Randeep Guleria on Sunday said the current vaccines against Covid-19 could be tweaked to offer protection against newer variants of the contagion. He said the production of a new influenza vaccine every year demonstrates it is possible to adapt existing vaccines to keep up with viral mutations. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, director said that immunologists are concerned about the possibility of accruing further mutations, which could render the vaccines less effective. However, such vaccines could be “tweaked” to overcome this problem. He said that apart from manufacturing billions of doses, the real challenge is the equitable distribution of vaccines to rich and poor countries. Guleria was speaking at the 22nd Dr VS Prayag Memorial Oration 2021 organised jointly by the Association of Physicians of India and Dr Shirish Prayag family at the Yashwantrao Chavan Academy of Development Administration (YASHADA). According to Guleria, the 21st century is witnessing more outbreaks. “We had outbreaks of bird flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), H1N1 pandemic, Ebola, Zika, and Nipah viruses. If observed closely, most of the infections are zoonotic in nature.” A zoonosis is an infectious disease that has jumped from a non-human animal to humans. According to Guleria, the reasons behind the increase in new infectious diseases are growing travel, trade, and connectivity, increasing urbanization, and encroachment into new environments. “The whole concept of ‘One Health’ becomes very important, wherein animal and human sectors work together to protect health and ensure food safety and security,” he said, adding that human and animal health are interdependent as well as linked to the health of the ecosystem of which they are a part. “Hence, we need to work on solutions at a local and global level to prevent future pandemics keeping in mind: the interconnection of human and animal health, the interconnection of human and ecosystem, and the interconnection of animal health and ecosystem,” he said. Guleria added that the third wave will be decided by the new variant that is more transmissible and at the same time can escape prior immunity. On the way ahead in pandemic times, Guleria said investing in public health services and pandemic preparedness should remain high on the priority list. “Developing better surveillance systems, building better laboratories and biosafety facilities, having trained public health officials and developing existing public health framework to deal with outbreaks is the need of the hour, along with having the research capacity to quickly develop medicines and vaccines,” he said. Guleria said public health measures such as hand hygiene, masks, and social distancing can mitigate pandemics and epidemics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccines-can-be-tweaked-for-variants-aiims-chief/articleshow/88379060.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Both these constituency have had higher number of positive cases during the first as well as th second wave of the pandemic. The civic officials — who fear a resurgence in Covid cases following the emergence of the Omicron variant — feel these two divisions may see a fresh spike. According to the data provided by the NMC, nearly 49% of the 178 active Covid patients in the city are from Cidco and Panchavati divisions. Another 18% of the active cases are in the Nashik Road area. These three divisions together have 67% of all active patients, while the remaining 33% of the active patients are in the other three divisions — Nashik East, Nashik West and Satpur. The main reason is that these two divisions are highly populated and have a large floating population of contract workers and migrants, said the NMC officials. Nashik APMC is also located in the Panchavati division, from where vegetables are supplied to Mumbai and Gujarat every day. “Over 100 vegetable-loaded trucks are sent to Mumbai on a daily basis by the traders in Nashik. This is the reason the slums and residential areas near the APMC had become one of the major Covid hotspots during the second wave,” said the NMC officials. Moreover, thousands of people from various states in the country come to the city by train and deboard at the Nashik Road railway station, they said. NMC officials said the focus of NMC is on these two divisions and random Covid tests are being carried out here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-wary-of-high-covid-case-count-in-cidco-panchavati/articleshow/88377725.cms||Tushar Pawar

Soon water sports will also be inaugurated here, said the CM. Earlier, he during program of ABVP he said that in 1980 when Ramjanambhoomi movement started people used to wonder whether the dream of Ram temple will ever come true, “But today a grand Ram temple is being constructed.” “Article 370 was introduced silently and Baba Saheb opposed it but his voice was suppressed, however, Shyama Prasad Mukharji protested against the article and raised his voice for one nation one symbol.” Praising PM Nafrendra Modi, the CM said, “When in 1916 Mahatma Gandhi came to Kashi and reached Kashi Vishwanath temple for darshan, he gave sharp comment on dirt and narrow lanes around the temple but now PM Modi has flipped the entire situation and Mahatma Gandhi will be very happy after seeing the beauty of Khashi.” Targeting the opposition, he said, “Those who got the power in the name of ending poverty are silent after seeing how PM Modi performed puja of Lord Shiv and also respected labourers in Kashi. They only divide the society in the name of caste, language and area.” CM Yogi praised ABVP for its effort for bringing people of North East into the mainstream and said that the work which was supposed to be done by the then governments was being done by an organization like ABVP, “Today BJP has government in Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh. Now, I can say that ABVP was doing a good job.” Describing his meeting with 22 BTech students, the CM said that among 22, 16 students wanted to start startups but were not aware of government schemes about it. He appealed to ABVP to create awareness about welfare schemes of the government so that people could be benefited. The chief minister said that with the ODOP scheme UP has become a export hub. Terracotta artists earned Rs 8 lakh in Lucknow and instead of China’s Lakshmi Ganesh idols, local made idols reached houses for Diwali puja, he said, adding, “We banned plastic and earthen soil glasses were sold instead of pastis glasses.” CM praised PM Modi for his Covid management and said that India’s population is higher than US and its health infrastructure is week in comparison to US but during corona wave more people died there. “PM inaugurated AIIMS and fertilizer plant in Gorakhpur and encephalitis is under control now,” he added. During the foundation laying/inauguration program CM also distributed equipment among 1,261 differently abled children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cm-yogi-adityanath-lays-foundation-opens-334-projects-in-gorakhpur/articleshow/88378421.cms||Arjumand Bano

The power generators are a necessary backup in case there is a power failure. “As per the government directives, we have increased the number of oxygen plants in the rural areas and each of the rural hospitals and the sub-district hospital now has at least one PSA oxygen plant capable of drawing oxygen from the air for medical use,” Thorat said. The tests of all the plants have been carried out and all of the plants are working. The pipelines for the beds have also been completed to ensure the oxygen generated is supplied to the patients admitted to these hospitals. Considering the importance of ensuring the plants continue to run non-stop during the emergency period, the decision to install the power generations was taken.  The foundations for the generations have to be created first based on which the generators can be placed. “We have requested funds from the district administration through the district planning committee. They are now awaiting administrative approval. Once we get the funds, the work of the foundation will be carried out by the Public Works Department (PWD) after which the generators will be installed,” the officer added. In addition to the PSA, filled oxygen cylinders have also been added at the hospitals. “The oxygen cylinders have also been stationed at the hospitals so that they can be provided to the patients if and when required,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/29-o2-plants-get-power-generators-in-rural-areas/articleshow/88377723.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Many new posters have been made and they are being distributed among them. He told TOI that inspections were also being conducted with the help of their local sub-committees. “Inspections are being conducted. Those not following the regulations are being warned. We do not want a situation in which cases start rising exponentially yet again resulting in a full or partial lockdown type situation. It is an appeal to all shopkeepers to carefully follow the norms,” another office bearer of the association added. Pitalia said that 10% of the shops in Pune couldn’t open after the spate of lockdowns last year.  “There were around 30,000 shops in Pune affiliated to us. Once things started to open after a spate of lockdowns last year, close to 10% of the shops never opened their shutters again,” he added.  “These traders had mainly rented out the shops and the lockdowns decimated their livelihoods. Many of them have returned to their hometowns,” he said. “We will continue to issue advisories and messages to keep them on their toes. Instructions have been passed on to the traders and shopkeepers to keep sanitizers for themselves and customers as well. They have also been told to ensure a system which allow social distancing to be maintained,” he told TOI. Many new shops in the city have recently opened up for business and a closure will hit them hard.  “The small groceries located across the city need to be extra careful and follow each and every regulation needed,” the office holder added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traders-shopkeepers-told-to-strictly-follow-norms/articleshow/88379063.cms||Joy Sengupta

Acting on a complaint by NMMC’s medical officer Dr Kailas Gaikwad, the APMC police have booked the three accused under relevant sections of the IPC for cheating and forgery, and under the Epidemic Diseases Act. “The illegal beneficiaries might be misusing the certificate for obtaining universal pass to travel by trains and buses and for visiting malls and movie theatres where it is mandatory to produce the final covid-19 vaccination certificate for entry,” said Dr Gaikwad. The accused have been identified as Nitin Shinde (34), owner of a Xerox centre in Vashi sector 19D, and two NNMT bus conductors identified as Viraj Vakshe (29) and Amol Zende (35). Zende had been temporarily deputed as data entry operator at NMMC’s Urban Health Primary Centre (UHPC) at Turbhe for the past four months. Shinde and Vakshe connived with Zende to provide fake covishield certificate by making false entry into the vaccination register at the UHPC. They issued fake final vaccination certificate by using NMMC’s official User ID and password for logging into the ‘Cowin.Gov.in’ website. Acting on a tip off, , the APMC police sent a decoy to Shinde and sought a fake Covishield final vaccination certificate. Shinde, in turn, approached NMMT bus conductor Vaskhe, who then got in touch with Zende at Turbhe UHPC and obtained the fake certificate from him. After PSI Sharad Awhad busted the racket, he summoned Dr Gaikwad for verification of the record maintained for vaccination doses administered at Turbhe UHPC. It was found that the certificate issued to the decoy mentioned same batch number for both the covishield vaccine doses, thus revealing the forgery. The three accused have been remanded to police custody till Sunday, informed the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-3-held-for-misusing-govt-site-to-issue-fake-final-vax-certs/articleshow/88379090.cms||George Mendonca

The woman concealed the narcotics inside the double cloth lining of her plastic suitcase. Customs officials said it was the first time they had seized drugs at the airport. Rajasthan: 2kg heroin worth Rs 15 crore seized at #Jaipur airport from Kenyan woman. https://t.co/WHO3MagLYd— TOI Jaipur (@TOIJaipurNews) 1639970731000Customs officials said, “The substance, collectively having a net weight 2,150 grams having an estimated market value of Rs 14.65 crore, has been seized under the NDPS Act, 1985, read with Customs Act, 1962. The passenger has been detained and further investigation is underway.” “A 33-year-old Kenyan woman arrived from Sharjah by Air Arabia flight at 3.50am on Sunday. She was intercepted by customs officials on the basis of a look out notice (LOC) received from immigration officials,” said a customs official. “According to the LOC, the passenger had given the same mobile number in her visa application as provided by two other Ugandan women passengers who were intercepted by the customs officials at Delhi airport on December 13 carrying 12.9kg heroin worth Rs 90 crore. On suspicion of being part of a syndicate involved in smuggling of narcotics/psychotropic drugs, the baggage of the passenger was thoroughly checked, both physically & using X-ray, and personal search of the passenger was also conducted which initially did not reveal anything,” added the customs official. Officials said the passenger remained composed during preliminary interrogation and her behaviour also did not appear suspicious. However, customs officials decided to empty the contents of her suitcase to conduct X-ray examination. Elaborating further, the official said, “The empty suitcase appeared to be heavier than usual. X-ray of the suitcase revealed the presence of some organic material in lump/powder form. Thereafter, thorough physical examination of the said suitcase revealed the presence of false bottoms on the upper and lower sides which were cut open to reveal the presence of two big paper envelopes, one each neatly stuck on both sides using a strong adhesive.” On examination, the paper envelopes were found to contain whitish (off-white) coloured substance which was in the mixed form of small lumps/granules and powder, which prima facie appeared to be some psychotropic/narcotics drug. Preliminary testing of the concealed substance using the drug-detection (DD) kit revealed that the substance was most possibly heroin. Representative samples of the substance have been sent to the Central Revenues Chemical Laboratory (CRCL) for confirmatory tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2kg-heroin-worth-rs-15cr-seized-at-city-airport-from-kenyan-woman/articleshow/88379528.cms||---
---||Delhi||Air India flight from and to North America to save an hour, Hindu Kush route comes to rescue||NEW DELHI: Air India’s popular nonstops between Delhi and North America have just become a lot faster by cutting about an hour in flying time, thanks to the Hindu Kush route. Since the closure of the Afghan airspace for non-defence aircraft on August 16, AI Boeing 777s flying between India and North America took a longer route — leading to more flying time and fuel burn. They flew via south Pakistan below Afghanistan and, then, entered Iran-Turkey-beyond, instead of the shorter Pakistan-Afghanistan-Turkmenistan/Uzbekistan route earlier. Since Thursday, AI B777s have started heading straight north, over the Hindu Kush range and, then, taking the usual route to the west. As a result, the flying time of AI 101 (Delhi-New York JFK) is now going to be less than 16 hours, instead of the over 16.5 hours on the longer route avoiding Afghanistan — leading to fuel saving of 7 tonnes one-way. On December 16, captains Zoya Agarwal, R Someshwar, Sandeep Mukhedkar and Abhay Agarwal operated AI’s first B777 (VT-ALQ named Manipur) over the Hindu Kush while operating from Toronto to Delhi. Pilots describe this as a “very critical and challenging sector”, given the high mountain ranges the aircraft flies over. Incidentally captain Zoya was also among the pilots who had operated AI’s first San Francisco-Bengaluru flight — one of the world’s longest nonstops — this January that took the polar route. “Our management played a critical role in getting this route cleared for the B777s. Cutting flying time means less fuel burn and lower emissions, something we did by taking the polar route and, now, with the Hindu Kush,” said a senior pilot. As reported by TOI, AI had started flying its Boeing 787 Dreamliners between Delhi and Europe over the Hindukush from this October and, now, the B777s to and North America have also joined them. “The logistics for B777 and B787 are very different. A fully laden B787 (with passengers, cargo and fuel) can have a maximum altitude of 35,000 feet. But a B777, due to factors like its different wing design and the fact that more fuel has to be carried for the much longer North America nonstops, can have a maximum altitude of 29,000 feet,” said a senior official. Taking the Hindu Kush route means fly over the awe-inspiring Tirich Mir (7,780 metres or 25,525 feet) — the world’s highest peak outside the Himalaya-Karakoram range.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ai-flight-from-and-to-north-america-to-save-an-hour-hindu-kush-route-comes-to-rescue/articleshow/88379074.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Kanpur||UP CM Yogi Adityanath’s inswingers unplayable for opposition: Rajnath Singh||JHANSI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh praised UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath profusely on Sunday for controlling crime in the state and working wholeheartedly for its development. Using a cricket analogy while addressing the public at the launch of BJP’s Jan Vishwas Yatra, Singh said, “I have seen Yogi Adityanath working. He is an all-rounder. He can bat, and when he bowls, he uproots the stumps — be it SP, BSP or Congress. Nobody can face his inswingers and outswingers. Hence we do not want Bua or Babua but only Baba.” Singh said, “CM Yogi has done wonders. His two-alphabet name increases the heartbeats of the mafia. Earlier, criminals used to come out brandishing country-made pistols after sunset, but they don’t dare to do so now.” We do what we say unlike SP or BSP that only make commitments and never fulfil them, he added. “Under Modi at Centre and Yogi in state, our governments fulfilled each promise of our election manifesto. Whether it was the repealing of Article 370, construction of Ram temple, getting Bundelkhand rid of water scarcity, or providing house and food to the poor,” said Singh. Cautioning people against SP, he said they will stop all the ongoing developmental work like the mega Ken-Betwa river linking project. “There are 84 ‘aasans’ of which we have done 83 and left one for SP and that is ‘Sheersh aasan’ (upside down) that the party (SP) is doing right now,” Singh said. “Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had admitted that of the 100 paisa sent from Delhi, only 15 reach the beneficiary due to corruption but Prime Minister Modi ensured that full amount is transferred directly into the accounts now,” he added. Singh said even developed nations like the US, Russia, China and UK were not as successful in tackling Covid-19 as India. “Even on international platforms, earlier no one used to heed our voice, but now they listen to us and even follow us. We have been giving a befitting reply to all the terror attacks by our neighbour Pakistan which dreams of fragmenting our country,” said Rajnath. The minister also broached the subject of incursions in bordering areas by China, without taking its name, and urged people to have faith in the country’s leadership. “There is another neighbouring country, I will not discuss much. But, as a Defence Minister, I urge you to have faith in us. We will not allow the country’s head to bow down even if that means making a sacrifice. We should have faith in our jawans,” he said. Earlier, Deputy CM Dr Dinesh Sharma said, “Our government focused on overall development of the state while ensuring zero tolerance to crime. 4.8 lakh jobs were generated reducing unemployment from 17% to 4.8%.” The Jan Vishwas Yatra will cover 47 Vidhan Sabha seats before culminating at Bithoor on January 2. Later, Rajnath Singh went to visit the strawberry farm developed by a girl student Gurleen Chawla during Covid lockdown and her efforts were appreciated by PM Modi in his radio programme ‘Mann ki Baat’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/yogis-inswingers-unplayablefor-opposition-rajnath-singh/articleshow/88378428.cms||Arindam Ghosh

Currently, there are two ‘vaccine on wheels’ vans provided by the NGO and the vans are rendering service in Trimbakeshwar and Surgana taluka. The NGO provided the vehicles and the data entry operator while the ZP provided the health staff including the medical officer and auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM). The ANM vaccinates the eligible beneficiaries. The NGO will provide four more vehicles, which will serve the health department especially in tribal-dominated talukas where vaccinating people is a difficult task as the population is scattered and walking from one house to the other takes at least 15 minutes. “In a meeting between the Nashik ZP CEO Leena Bansod and the NGO, it has been decided that there four vehicles will be providing services in Igatpuri, Peth, Surgana and Trimbakeshwar talukas,” said Dr Kailas Bhoye, the taluka health officer and in charge of vaccination. Under the new arrangement, where four vaccine vans will be added, the foundation has decided to provide ANM also. “The number of people who have taken the first dose of vaccine is around 80% in the district, which means a small number of beneficiaries are now left to take the first dose. They are scattered all across the district and hence searching for them is an arduous task. The more number of vaccine teams will only ensure the possibility of spreading out and trying to figure out the people who have not been vaccinated yet,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/health-dept-to-get-more-vax-vans-to-cover-rural-areas-in-nashik/articleshow/88377729.cms||Abhilash Botekar

It added that 25 more such plants would be installed across the district soon. The 40 plants have a functional combined capacity of around 36 metric tonnes of oxygen generation. Of the 40 oxygen generation plants, Pune rural has 25, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has 12 and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has three units. With the addition of 25 new oxygen generation plants, the capacity will further increase to 65-plus metric tonnes. A PMC official said that they had installed around 12 medical oxygen generation plants across the civic hospitals and six more were proposed. The remaining ones would also be installed and made functional soon. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, Pune chapter, said, “We faced oxygen-related issues during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and this time we could not afford any lethargy. We need to concentrate on the production part. This is a gradual process and better we do it as early as possible.” “As Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad see a lot of patients from rural areas, we need to strengthen the urban capacity of the oxygen generation plants at the earliest,” he said. Patil said that the private hospitals too were now installing such oxygen generation plants. There are at least three to four private hospitals, which have done so after the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/40-o2-generation-plants-in-govt-hospitals-in-dist/articleshow/88379076.cms||Piyush Bhusari

If these results are found to be Covid-positive, the persons will be tested further for genomic sequencing to identify the presence of the new variant. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO) of Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP), said, “We are tracking down the close contacts of the four positive Dubai returnees. The process to trace, track and test those who came in contact with the travellers is underway, and many of the residents have been told to home quarantine themselves.” Prasad said that since all of the positive cases are asymptomatic, there is nothing to panic about, adding that the administration and the health department are equipped to restrict the further spread of the contagion. Rajesh Karyakarte, head of genome sequencing of state and head of department of microbiology at BJ Government Medical College, told TOI that the result of the swab samples is still awaited — once it is confirmed, the positive samples will be sent for genome sequencing. According to Karyakarte, it could take somewhere between three to five days for the completion of the whole genome sequencing. At present, it is conducted at Sassoon General Hospitals, NIV, IIISER, NCL, and NICS in Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/38-swab-samples-to-be-tested-for-new-strain/articleshow/88379092.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Nashik||Nashik: Presbyter tries to end life, suffers minor burns||NASHIK: A 61-year-old presbyter set himself ablaze outside a church on Sunday morning. He suffered minor burns as people who had come for church services quickly put out the fire. The presbyter, Anant Apte, of St Thomas Church, has been admitted to the Nashik civil hospital. PI Dattatray Pawar of the Bhadrakali police station said, “Apte will be booked for attempting to end his life. There were allegations of corruption against him and an inquiry has been initiated by a committee of the Church of North India (CNI), under which St Thomas Church comes. He was told not to continue with his work as presbyter at the church.” Apte’s wife Anita said her husband has been serving in the church for the past 20 years. She said the allegations against him were baseless and that he was divested of his duties for no reason. She said her husband had also been demanding the removal of the existing church committee. Speaking to mediapersons, Apte said, “I was stopped from discharging my duties at St Thomas Church by Bishop of Nashik (CNI) Rev Sharad Gaikwad without hearing my side. The committee at St Thomas Church has levelled false charges against me. The committee members have been troubling me from time to time over the last two years. I have brought this to the notice of Bishop Gaikwad. Even today, when the bishop was at the church, I met him to give my side of the story. However, he did not hear me out.” Rupesh Nikalje, former secretary and treasurer of CNI’s ‘Nashik Dharma Prant’, said Apte should not have been suspended from working at the church. “The inquiry could have been carried out even without suspending him. He was not given an opportunity to present his side,” he said. Speaking to TOI, Bishop Gaikwad said, “The presbyter is in charge of two churches. He was told to stop his work at St Thomas Church owing to allegations of corruption against him. A letter in this regard was given to him on December 7. But he has not been stopped from working at the other church where he is also presbyter. Apte apparently took this step just to avoid the inquiry that has been initiated against him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/presbyter-tries-to-end-life-suffers-minor-burns/articleshow/88377765.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Kolkata||Civic polls: Four bombs, 453 complaints with SEC and 209 arrests in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Bombs were hurled outside polling booths in Taki Boy’s Schoool in Sealdah and outside Khanna High School on Beliaghata Main Road on Sunday. Police said one among the three bike-borne miscreants who hurled two crude bombs at the Sealdah booth have been arrested. CCTV footages are being scanned to trace two others. Three people were injured in this incident — one with critical leg injuries. Across Kolkata, 209 persons were arrested in sporadic incidents, the bulk of which were in central Kolkata. The SEC received 453 complaints. Ward 63 BJP candidate Navin Mishra and five others were arrested after they got involved in a scuffle with TMC workers while poll officials were busy sealing the EVM. The day’s most violent incident was reported from the Government Sponsored School for Boys Taki House at Sealdah around 10.30 am when three bike-borne men — entering from Narkeldanga — allegedly lobbed two crude bombs within 250 metres of the premises. The incident led to senior officers rushing to the spot and men from the combat force swarming the area. The incident triggered a blame game between Trinamool and Congress. One of the injured, Dipu Das — a resident of Kashim Bazar and a driver by profession — claimed he had gone out to buy cigarettes when the crude bombs were hurled near him. Barely 45 minutes earlier, two more crude bombs were lobbed near the Khanna High School on Beliaghata Main Road under Entally police station. “There were allegations of illegal gathering outside the booth and a police team led by an ACP had just reached the spot when the bombs were lobbed. The accused had come on bikes. None was injured,” said an officer. Clashes between TMC and the opposition Congress and BJP were reported from Posta, Burrabazar, Brabourne Road and Maniktala. No major injuries were reported in these skirmishes. “Polling has by and large been peaceful barring a few incidents. Two incidents of hurling of crude bombs outside polling booths were reported,” said joint CP (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar. “We are sending action taken reports to the SEC,” he said. At least five blockades, two of them on road (Baghajatin and Kidderpore) and three outside police stations (Burtolla, Beliaghata and Sinthee) were reported. Police said a major clash was averted at BBD Bag between supporters of Congress and TMC candidates after cops chased down both groups. Cops said they have arrested four persons from Brabourne Road. A scuffle was reported from Marwari Balika Vidyalaya in Ward 23 with TMC alleging BJP candidate Vijay Ojha was indulging in false voting. Ojha claimed the TMC brought outsiders who tried to break the EVM. Ward 35 BJP candidate Girish Kumar Shukla claimed he was assaulted at Narkeldanga. In Kasba’s Ward 67, a CPM polling agent’s mother broke down narrating how she was threatened to bring back her son from poll duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/4-bombs-453-complaints-with-sec-and-209-arrests/articleshow/88378469.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Mayor banks on development, not criticism as poll pitch||CHANDIGARH: Starting his day at 7:30am with a glass of milk, mayor Ravikant Sharma goes for door-to-door meetings with residents of Sector 23. On Sunday, he covered both sectors of his ward (sectors 22 and 23) with around 25 to 30 persons. He carefully avoids any mention of Central government policies or work and limits his pitch to works done in his ward in the last five years. After Sector 23, Sharma reached his Sector 22 office and had a breakfast of puri and pumpkin with workers there. Later, he along with his supporters, started campaigning in Sector 22 through Nukkar Natak (street play). With pamphlets and a small booklet of works done by the BJP-led MC in the ward in the past five years, Sharma sought votes on the basis of his achievements. Thereafter, he started door to door campaign in Sector 22, telling people about his vision and work done in five years. Hands folded, Sharma sought votes only on the basis of development and refrained from criticising opponents. In the evening, he visited the Sector 25 Rally Ground, where Union cabinet minister Anurag Thakur was present to attend a Himachal Pradesh-based cultural event. After a brief meeting with Thakur, Sharma returned to his ward and attended a Nukkar meeting in Sector 22, which ended at around 8:30. This was followed by dinner with his supporters in the election office in Sector 22. There, he started planning for the election. His campaign on Sunday was also marked by a steady stream of ward residents who came to meet him. Residents shared issues of the ward and Sharma assured that these would be resolved if he returned to power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mayor-banks-on-devp-not-criticism-as-poll-pitch/articleshow/88378470.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Kolkata||Kolkata civic polls: Trading hub sees day-long dogfight||KOLKATA: Two veteran opposition councillors in Burrabazar kept up a dogged fight forcing Trinamool’s robust election machinery to hit a wall of resistance amid unprecedented scenes of poll day intimidation where two candidates came to blows in full public view while another veteran woman councillor alleged that her clothes were torn by her opponents. Wards 22 and 45 continued to be on the edge on Sunday where TMC is the challenger to BJP and Congress, which have been winning here for the last 20 and 15 years, respectively. BJP ex-councillor of Ward 22 and former deputy mayor Meena Devi Purohit and Congress ex-councillor of Ward 45 Santosh Pathak kept fighting doggedly to keep the morale of their booth workers from sagging. Action in Burrabazar where BJP is trying hard to hold its only bastion in the city started as early as 8.30 am when Purohit alleged intimidation by TMC supporters in Maheshwari Bhavan near Posta. She was visiting booths in the area when some people, whom she identified as TMC supporters, allegedly attacked her. “A mob charged me near Maheshwari Bhavan when I was visiting the polling booths from where reports of intimidating my agents were coming in. Some of them physically assaulted me and tore my sari,” said Purohit who stationed herself outside Maheshwari School polling booth. Trinamool Congress refuted the charges. An independent candidate, Priyanka Debnath, alleged that Purohit had tried to slap her and so trouble broke out. The poll body has sought a report. Congress’s Pathak was visiting the booth in Jain Vidyalaya where he alleged some “false voters” had entered. “I was complaining to the police when the TMC candidate came and started abusing me,” said Pathak. TMC candidate Shakti Pratap Singh challenged Pathak. It was followed by heated argument as the followers of both candidates started crowding the scene. In a few minutes both candidates were seen coming to blows. Senior officers even rushed to the spot. Cops later resorted to lathicharge and arrested four persons. In 2021 assembly polls, of the 1,978 votes polled, Congress had got 856 votes in the ward . Burrabazar became a prestigious battle since the TMC has failed to win several wards in the business hub despite sweeping rest of the wards in the last two KMC polls. “Most residents here do not support TMC,” said Purohit who kept moving from one booth to another in her SUV throughout the day. In Ward 45, “minor clashes” were reported throughout the day from two polling stations in Jain Vidyalaya and AG Bengal office in Dalhousie. Jorasanko TMC MLA Vivek Gupta said: “People are going to vote for TMC based on the work done in the past ten years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trading-hub-sees-day-long-dogfight/articleshow/88378477.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Pune||Vaccines can be tweaked to fight new variants: AIIMS-Delhi chief Guleria||Pune: AIIMS-Delhi director Randeep Guleria on Sunday said that the current vaccines against Covid-19 could be tweaked to offer protection against newer variants of the contagion. He said the production of a new influenza vaccine every year demonstrates it is possible to adapt existing vaccines to keep up with viral mutations. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, director said that immunologists are concerned about the possibility of accruing further mutations, which could render the vaccines less effective. However, such vaccines could be “tweaked” to overcome this problem. He said that apart from manufacturing billions of doses, the real challenge is the equitable distribution of vaccines to rich and poor countries. Guleria was speaking at the 22nd Dr VS Prayag Memorial Oration 2021, organised jointly by the Association of Physicians of India and Dr Shirish Prayag family at the Yashwantrao Chavan Academy of Development Administration (YASHADA). According to Guleria, the 21st century is witnessing more outbreaks. “We had outbreaks of bird flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), H1N1 pandemic, Ebola, Zika, and Nipah viruses. If observed closely, most of the infections are zoonotic in nature.” A zoonosis is an infectious disease that has jumped from a non-human animal to humans. According to Guleria, the reasons behind the increase in new infectious diseases are growing travel, trade, and connectivity, increasing urbanisation, and encroachment into new environments. “The whole concept of ‘One Health’ becomes very important, wherein animal and human sectors work together to protect health and ensure food safety and security,” he said, adding that human and animal health are interdependent. “Hence, we need to work on solutions at a local and global level to prevent future pandemics keeping in mind: the interconnection of human and animal health, the interconnection of human and ecosystem, and the interconnection of animal health and ecosystem,” he said. Guleria added that the third wave will be decided by the new variant that is more transmissible and can escape prior immunity, and that investing in public health services and pandemic preparedness should remain high on the priority list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccines-can-be-tweaked-to-fight-new-variants-aiims-delhi-chief-guleria/articleshow/88379113.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The results have been reportedly delayed, as MU officials are busy rectifying the errors of undergraduate (UG) results. After much delay, the PG examinations concluded in September, and the results were supposed to be declared within a month. Senior professors have hinted at an abnormal delay, stating that the evaluation work is delayed, as the workforce is busy rectifying errors of UG results. “If everything was in place, the results should have been declared within a month after the examination was held. Currently, it is delayed for more than three months, and may take another month or more to be declared. Evaluation for only a few PG courses has been completed. The chaos is because the varsity adopted MuLinx, an in-house examination software,” said a senior professor. Another professor, requesting the varsity to declare the results at the earliest, said that PG students who have to apply for jobs or plan advanced studies are affected, as they are likely to lose out on opportunities. P S Yadapadithaya, vice-chancellor, Mangalore University, agreed that PG results have been delayed for long. He said, “Currently, the examination section is concentrating on clearing UG results, due to which PG results have been delayed. When the responsibility was entrusted to private firms, the evaluation work of both UG and PG examinations was carried out simultaneously. This time it was not possible.” “A committee constituted to do failure mode analysis has submitted the report. It will be presented during the syndicate meeting scheduled on Monday,” said Yadapadithaya. “MULinx has created a lot of problems for the examination process. I am for changing the software, and will express the same during the syndicate meeting,” stressed Yadapadithaya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mu-pg-results-likely-to-be-delayed-by-another-month/articleshow/88377776.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Although the civic body claims roads are regularly repaired, the matter remains in controversy, both inside and outside of the MC, with councillors and residents raising their voices on the issue. The civic body has stressed the life of every road after recarpeting is five years, but the ground reality is different. In many cases, roads have to be recarpeted after every year after demanded made by both residents and councillors. Besides commercial areas, the residential areas too remain affected with untimely breaking of roads. During the general house meetings in the past, the municipal councillors even sought an inquiry for untimely broken roads. Later, the civic body appointed a consultant to give expert advice but recently, his services were stopped. Now, it is the sole responsibility of the engineers of the MC to ensure proper recarpeting of roads with full strength. The condition of the roads is poor in villages. Since these villages had been transferred to the MC a few years back, overall development is still a major issue there. Some of the public health works have started, but residents are still waiting for road recarpeting. Since there is no representative of the villagers after the merger of the villages in the MC, number of the delegations have met to the civic body authority for multiple works, but nothing much has happened so far. Lack of funds has also hit the work in the past. The UT administration had released special grant for road recarpeting to the MC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/road-recarpeting-a-major-challenge-for-mc/articleshow/88378489.cms||Deepak Yadav

Sen gave a tough fight to his rival Kidambi Srikanth in the semifinals, in which the former was defeated 17-21 21-14 21-17. Srikanth has eventually become the first-ever Indian male shuttler to enter the finals of the world championship. However, at the time of filing of this report on Sunday, Srikanth lost to Singapore’s Loh Kean Yew 15-21 & 20-22. “It is a proud moment for Uttarakhand. He deserves a break as he has achieved a lot at just 20 and is expected to do more for the country. He will receive a grand welcome once he returns to Almora,” said BS Mankoti, secretary, Uttaranchal State Badminton Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/lakshya-sen-clinches-bronze-at-world-badminton-championship/articleshow/88378494.cms||Mohammad Anab

Residents said there are some arteries inside the blocks which perpetually remain dark due to inadequate or dim streetlights. “Quite a few streetlights in and around this locality have stopped working for a long time. In some places, the lights are so dim that it hardly serves the purpose,” said a resident of CE block. On a few stretches like the cross road from Anindita bus stop towards Laboni and near Laboni Island on the road leading towards FD block, streetlights have been out of order for quite a few days. Across the township, the non-functional trident light posts can still be seen on the road medians as they have not been removed. Elderly residents said they feel unsafe coming out of their house for an evening stroll alone due to the dim streetlights. “The streetlights are not very bright in some places. I don’t feel safe to step out of my house after sunset,” said septuagenarian Krishna Chakraborty, a resident of IA block. Residents said though the condition of streetlights have improved in the township, there is scope for further improvement. “Some stretches, specially the canal side roads, need to have proper lighting,” said Tamal Pal, a resident of HB block. Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials said they conduct checks as and when they receive complaints of dysfunctional streetlights to repair or replace them. “Some streetlights are not working on a stretch in CE block as there is an underground cable line fault. The matter has been brought to our notice and would be rectified in a few days,” said a civic official. Civic officials said they have been working to replace all the old sodium vapour lights in the township with LED in phases and that a large area of the township has already been covered. BMC had earlier received an approval of Rs 17 crore by the state government to switch over to LED. Officials said there were about 25,000 sodium vapour lights across Salt Lake and adjacent areas which were being replaced with LED lights. BMC pays a monthly energy bill of about Rs 1.5 crore. “About 60% of the electricity bill will get reduced once all the LED lights are installed,” said a BMC official. In adjacent New Town, NKDA, which has already installed LED lights on the main arterial road, has been working to replace all the old sodium vapour and metal halide streetlights in the inner lanes and cross roads with LED.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/salt-lake-streetlights-in-bad-shape/articleshow/88378510.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Mumbai||Look anew at 1993 Mumbai blast convict’s plea for open prison: SC||MUMBAI: The Supreme Court has directed that prison authorities apply their mind afresh to decide on a plea made by Sardar Shavali Khan, a terror convict spending a life term in the March 12, 1993, bomb blasts case in Mumbai, and see whether he can be sent to an open prison. Khan has served 27 years so far. The Bombay high court bench at Aurangabad had denied his plea to be shifted to open prison—where security is less and inmates have more liberties. The HC in its order in March 2021 had noted the selection committee had rightly rejected Khan’s plea on the grounds that during his tenure as a prison warden, hardened convicts were found using cellphones. The Supreme Court said this reason alone cannot be enough to reject his plea. The SC bench of Justice S K Kaul and Justice M M Sundresh on December 10 said in his 27 years inside, Khan has on 18 occasions been granted furlough leave without any problem. The SC also said, “We may note at the threshold that his role as a warden was not in the open prison.” His counsel said that only after his repeated pleas since 2010 to be sent to one, was the cellphone usage reason was “sought to be created to show” that it was not desirable to send him to open prison. The Supreme Court said that it did find some substance in what the convict’s counsel said and it would desire that the committee itself applies its mind afresh “keeping our aforesaid observations in mind that the finding qua the use of cellphones by hardened criminals having not found favour in the prior proceedings, that cannot be a ground to shut out the option of keeping the appellant in the open prison”. The committee has to decide within two months, said the Supreme Court. Khan was convicted under the erstwhile Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA). Khan, a civil contractor, was held guilty by special TADA court Judge P D Kode in 2006 for allegedly participating in a weapons training programme at Sandheri and Borghat villages in Raigad district and also for attending alleged blast conspiracy meetings in homes of two co-accused in Mumbai. “It has been established that at the instance of Tiger Memon, Khan had surveyed the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation building as a potential target of terror attack in keeping with plans chalked out in conspiracy meetings,” said the trial court judge, while acquitting Khan of charges of landing and transportation of arms smuggled into a Raigad port.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/look-anew-at-1993-blast-convicts-plea-for-open-prison-sc/articleshow/88379127.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Chandigarh||BJP takes on former ally, SAD||Deepak.Yadav@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: After an almost 15-year alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is now criticising the SAD candidate this time, blaming him for ignoring residents. In ward number 30, sitting SAD councillor Hardeep Singh, who was senior deputy mayor in the BJP regime in the current MC term, is being targeted by BJP for not initiating development works in the city. While the SAD has again fielded sitting municipal councillor from the area Hardeep Singh, BJP pitted Shakti Prakash Devshali against him. Devshali is also a sitting councillor but not from ward 30. Since this ward has been an SAD stronghold, it has become a major challenge for the saffron party to clinch this seat. Candidates of both the SAD and BJP have been engaged in hectic campaigning from day one. They have been making door to door visits and organising public gatherings. BJP leaders are also releasing videos targeting the SAD candidate and sitting councillor Hardeep Singh. They seem to have forgotten that BJP sought votes for SAD candidates for the past for over a decade and ensured the victory of SAD candidates. “Earlier, we were in alliance with SAD, but since the party’s leadership decided to contest the MC election separately this time, we are treating SAD as our opponent and thus planning and executing our strategy accordingly. Moreover, this is for the first time that the BJP is contesting the election in this ward on its own symbol and victory has become more important,” a BJP leader said. Box: SAD-BSP alliance For the first time, SAD is contesting the Municipal Corporation election in alliance with the BSP. Both parties have shared their seats and announced candidates accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-takes-on-former-ally-sad/articleshow/88378502.cms||---

In addition to opposition barbs, she also had to respond to criticism on her poll debut. Her husband, the CM’s own brother, kept riding a two-wheeler across the length and breadth of Ward 73 convincing voters to come out and vote on the face of a low turnout. The Trinamool candidate had to battle criticism from rebels within the party, who challenged her nomination over the former councillor, low turnout of voters and an array of allegations from opposition leaders ranging from nepotism to channelizing outsiders to rig polls. “These criticisms don’t matter. I have Didi’s blessings. She has asked me to be cautious,” said Banerjee after casting her vote with her husband Kartick Banerjee and son Abesh at Mitra Institution in Bhowanipore — the same polling station where CM Mamata Banerjee casts her vote. A confident Banerjee said she was not bothered either about Ratan Malakar — the former councillor of the ward whom she replaced as a candidate — or the low turnout. “The low turnout is due to the weather and secondly, people here stay back to fill filtered water from taps till noon. They will come in the afternoon. And about Malakar, he is not even a voter of this ward and it will not have any impact,” Banerjee said. Her husband and Mamata Banerjee’s brother Kartick was, however, busy, riding down the lanes and alleys of Kalighat Road, Patuapara, Harish Chatterjee Street and Rani Shankari Lane asking people gathered at local shops and tea stalls to vote. As the CM reached, she placed her hand on Kajari’s head and walked towards the school. With 21,682 voters, Ward 73 recorded 60% polling by the end of the day — a figure similar to what it had managed in Bhowanipore bypoll three months ago and the Bengal assembly election earlier this year. Though the poll percentage was lower than the 2015 KMC election, when it had recorded 64.5% votes, it was better than the 2010 figure of 53.4%. “People voted in a festive environment. I am also satisfied with polling percentage considering it’s a KMC election,” said Mamata Banerjee. Opposition levelled charges of malpractice against Trinamool. Party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee said: “If they don’t have poll agents, TMC cannot be held responsible. ‘Nachte na janle uthon byaka’.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-special-favours-kajari-slogs-at-cms-ward-on-poll-day-debut/articleshow/88378504.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Civic polls: Sporadic violence reported in south Kolkata||KOLKATA: The day began amid hectic activities for Trinamool candidates and polling agents as they took guard to ward off untoward situations. However, as the day progressed, the ruling party candidates and agents went into picnic in large areas of south Kolkata as reports of stray incidents of violence in some parts of central, north and east Kolkata came in. Barring allegations of booth jamming, intimidation and false voting by Left candidates in Baghajatin, Jadavpur, Garia and Kidderpore, polling in most parts of south Kolkata went peacefully. A TOI team found polling going on without noise and with fewer voters in Ballygunge Place, Jamir Lane, Dhakuria, Golf Green, Southern Avenue, Jodhpur Park, Rashbehari Avenue, Lake Road and Bhowanipore. The calm atmosphere perhaps attracted the elderly to go out to vote. Arun Roy, a 100-year-old in Gariahat, said, “I was worried about a stray incident of bombing in Ballygunge last night. But around noon on Sunday, I decided to go vote when I heard polling had remained peaceful by and large.” CPM supporters staged a road block at Baghajatin where party leader Shamik Lahiri demanded re-poll in some booths of wards 101, 102, 109 and 110. Debasish Kumar, a Trinamool candidate and the president of the party’s south Kolkata district, said, “I had no headache about the management of booths that fall in my own ward.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sporadic-cases-in-south-kolkata/articleshow/88378509.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Delhi||Tailor-made: Business Blaster programme helps students stitch together success story||NEW DELHI: A students’ group from a Delhi government school was able to get seed funding of Rs 1 lakh by pitching their idea to investors about “Silai Mitr”, an app-based stitching service that allows customers to connect with the best tailors. The idea was presented by Afifa, Gulnaaz, Dhruvi and Asghar, students of Sarvodaya Co-Ed Senior Secondary School, Moti Bagh. Their endeavour was through the Business Blasters programme, which is a part of the entrepreneurship curriculum in Delhi government schools where students receive seed money to start businesses. The programme is televised every Sunday where students pitch their ideas to investors. Talking about the venture, team lead Afifa said, “Our app provides one with the option to choose from a variety of design catalogues. We wish to employ homegrown tailors who have the skill, but need a platform to show it.” A business idea called “Tap and Draw”, which made a profit of Rs 26,000 in a month with the initial seed money, received an investment of Rs 25,000 from Tod Fod Jod founder Neeraj Gulati and advance orders of Rs 62,500 from Taniya, the co-founder of Suta, a site selling saris. Another idea, “Mystique Dates”, a drink made from ground date seeds, which was pitched as a healthier option to coffee, was well appreciated. “It smells and tastes like coffee, but is much healthier as it has no preservatives and additives. I’m taking forward my grandfather’s legacy who used to make this as he was against wastage of any kind,” said Sufi, another team member. They received an additional capital of Rs 85,000. The founders of Mystique Dates and two other businesses were felicitated at the 6th Annual Global Convention 2021 of “Entrepreneur Cafe”. Addressing the conclave, AAP MLA Atishi said, “Indian youths getting opportunities by Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft and Google is good, but the Indian economy gains nothing from it. For the Indian economy to benefit from its talented youth, we must work towards developing an entrepreneurial mindset, right from school. Delhi government’s Business Blasters programme is doing just that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tailor-made-business-blaster-programme-helps-students-stitch-together-success-story/articleshow/88379131.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Fever surveys in focus amid Omicron worries||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh has decided to focus on door-to-door fever surveys in view of the Omicron fear. The health department would conduct the 34th round fever survey from December 20, Monday. In an order issued by the state health department, the district officials have been asked to conduct fever surveys for five days a week.  The field-level teams, comprising Asha workers and village/ward volunteers, would visit every household. And the suspected cases would be referred to the medical officers for Covid-19 testing.  State heavily relied on door-to-door fever surveys in both first and second waves due to its strong 2.5 lakh volunteer network. The state conducted the survey for five rounds in the first wave last year to contain the spread of the infection in the community and for early detection of the cases.  The comprehensive door-to-door surveys in the first wave identified nearly 32,700 suspected cases and the state subjected all of them to Covid-19 testing.  The state further intensified the fever surveys during the ongoing second wave. The surveys in the second wave itself identified more than 1.55 lakh suspected cases. These suspected cases are monitored through 104 call centre in the second wave. The state has engaged nearly 5,500 doctors during the ongoing second wave to offer tele-consultation services to patients and other suspected cases through its revived 104 call centre in the second wave. The call centre served all the 1.55 lakh suspected cases identified in the fever surveys in the second wave. Meanwhile, the state has set up helpline centres at all the airports in the state and in the neighbouring states to monitor the Covid-19 testing of foreign returnees in view of the new variant Omicron. Speaking to ToI, director, Andhra Pradesh public health and family welfare department, Dr G Hymavathi, said the state is reasonably well prepared for any eventuality or even the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/fever-surveys-in-focus-amid-omicron-worries/articleshow/88377784.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Primary classes in govt schools to operate even on Saturdays||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand education department has decided to allow government schools to call primary students along with secondary students on Saturdays to make up for the time lost in the current academic year. The decision has been taken in view of the "stable Covid-19 situation" in the hill state. The state education minister Arvind Pandey had ordered schools to open on Saturday, last week itself, but no government order (GO) was issued in this regard. Now, with the GO being issued, the schools will "remain open for six days from this week itself". However, though the order is being implemented from this week on paper, the schools will remain closed on the coming Saturday due to Christmas. The education department, meanwhile, has released its annual holiday calendar for the next academic year. The state-run schools will operate for 244 days in winter prone areas while those located in summer prone areas like the plains, will operate for 243 days. Though, the calendar for 2022 shows that schools will remain closed on Saturday. The principals will have the right to declare upto three holidays in the year for their respective schools. But, they will need to provide prior information to the concerned block education officer. These three leaves will be counted as "discretionary leaves". The same right for discretionary leaves have been given to all district magistrates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/primary-classes-in-govt-schools-to-operate-even-on-saturdays/articleshow/88378508.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Nagpur||CZA clears tiger safari and rescue centre in Tadoba buffer||Nagpur: In a major boost to tourism and help curb man-animal conflict, the Central Zoo Authority (CZA), a statutory body under the ministry of environment, forest and climate change monitoring zoos, rescue centres and safaris, has given green signal to set up tiger safari and rescue centre in Chandrapur. The mega project will come up on 210 hectares reserve forest land near Chandrapur Forest Academy on Mul road. It will include a tiger safari in 44 hectares, bigger than tiger safari area of Gorewada (which is 25 hectares). Other attractions include an entrance plaza and amenities for tourists, a bird park and walking trail, and also a rescue centre in 40 hectares. The proposal was forwarded to the CZA by retired PCCF (wildlife) NH Kakodkar in July. The master layout plan has been prepared by city’s Ashfaque Ahmed Consultancy Services Private Limited, which had also designed the Gorewada zoo safari plan earlier. According to CZA sources, the said plan was deliberated in the 38th meeting of the authority held on November 16, 2021. The approval for the project in the buffer area of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) was given on December 17, under Section 38-H (1A) of the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972, and subject to compliance with the Recognition of Zoo Rules 2009 guidelines. With 160 tigers, excluding cubs, in Chandrapur alone, human-animal conflict has been raging in the district putting pressure on Gorewada Rescue Centre at Nagpur where animals captured or rescued during conflict are shifted for treatment and then kept in captivity. Gorewada’s carrying capacity has already exceeded and hence there was dire need for such a project in Chandrapur. Gorewada divisional manager Pramod Panchbhai says, “It is a welcome move. We have 10 tiger and 20 leopard cells, but have 11 tigers and 23 leopards. This is apart from the ones released in the safari. We have kept some leopards in monkey cells. In emergency, we can adjust some carnivores in small mammal cages.” TATR deputy director (core) Nandkishore Kale said, “The project will be attached to TATR Tiger Conservation Foundation and we will be able to run animal adoption scheme as well and accept donations for animal welfare, which will allow donors to avail tax benefits under 80C or utilize CSR funds.” The rescue centre will have a state-of-the-art animal hospital and 18 tiger cells, 12 for leopards, 12 sloth bear cells, and 28 for herbivores. The centre will also consist of quarantine cells, bird and python enclosures, workshop, housing, and service blocks. “Overall, 126 hectares area will be in use for the rescue centre and safari, while remaining 86 hectares will be kept reserve for future expansion. The rescue centre will also have a unique neonatal care centre,” said Kale. State wildlife board (SBWL) member Bandu Dhotre claimed he had raised the issue of upgrading the Chandrapur transit treatment centre (TTC) in the 16th SBWL meeting held on December 4, 2020, which was agreed upon by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who directed to upgrade the TTC at Chandrapur into a full-fledged rescue centre. “Both the safari and rescue centre will not only ease pressure on Gorewada, but will also go a long way in conservation. Secondly, it will also boost tourism. Some of the surplus Tadoba tourists can be diverted to the tiger safari creating direct and indirect employment for locals,” said Dhotre. He added, “If the said forest land is not put to proper use, it is possible in future it may be diverted for non-forestry purposes or encroached upon.” This will be the third such safari in the state, first being Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) in Borivli and second Gorewada in Nagpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cza-clears-tiger-safari-and-rescue-centre-in-tadoba-buffer/articleshow/88379137.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corportion staff caught for fraud had tapped lapses in the system||Thiruvananthapuram: The cashier at Kazhakootam zonal office who was placed under suspension for fund fraud on Friday had made good use of loopholes in the system to pull off a fraud never heard of in the history of the city corporation. Accepting bribes for a service and non-payment of collection amount in the bank have been the most common forms of malpractice. K Anzil Kumar, who has been suspended, went a step ahead by observing lapses in the system and then twisting it to his advantage. The team led by accounts officer A Jayakumar and six clerks had their task cut out before they could unravel the nature of fraud which could not even have been detected in normal audits. Anzil Kumar was never known to have quick hands in the use of computers. However, he was smart enough to realize that in certain cases people seldom insisted on receiving receipts because it would be a one time service and there was no need for renewal. Being in the cashier's seat for more than two years he discovered the potential for fraud by generating receipts, receiving cash and then cancelling it the same day. This was ably assisted by bulk applications submitted by a common person; often an agent. Cash would be paid, receipt would be generated with the number and other details; it would be sealed and then forwarded to the section concerned. The party would receive the permit for road cutting from that section. In the meantime, while the file would show as cash received and would have a seal, the receipts generated would be cancelled and myriad reasons like insufficient cash from the applicant or licensee, misspelled details would be cited. Ideally a charge officer and a cashier would have different login credentials. The hectic workload has made it a common norm for senior staff to share their credentials. This is done to ensure that routine works go unhindered even if they are away for meetings or any other official purposes. So the cashier who generates the receipt would get it cancelled when it should ideally be done by the superior official. Since the licensees and the applicants got permits after payment of fee, nobody cared to come back to collect receipts. The reverse check to find out whether cancelled receipts matched details of permits which were issued was never in practice.The corporation team believes that a nexus was at work because it was a communication to the corporation office regarding this fraud which led to the disclosure. The team led by an accounts officer took the data of cancelled receipts and then collected data of permits issued for road cutting in 2019-20. Cross-matching both documents showed that money was collected and permits were issued, but it never got credited to the city corporation. The files would however show the receipt number, cash received seal and details of pass issued. The team also found that while receipts were cancelled for a particular period, new receipts with the same details which ought to have been generated were never found in the system. Sources said that details of cancelled receipts for 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 are now being collected and details of licensee/applicant related to each receipt are also being tracked to identify the role of agents in the fraud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corportion-staff-caught-for-fraud-had-tapped-lapses-in-the-system/articleshow/88364370.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Mumbai||Comedian Munawar Faruqui performs in Mumbai with backing from Congress unit, MVA||MUMBAI: Notwithstanding the threats from right-wing groups, stand-up comedian Munawar Faruqui performed at a south Mumbai venue on Saturday night, thanks to support from the All India Professional Congress, a wing of the Congress, and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Faruqui’s act in Mumbai assumes significance as he has faced cancellations at more than a dozen events, mostly in BJP-led states, in the last fortnight. Earlier this month, his shows at Bengaluru and the Gurgaon Comedy Festival were cancelled. He had expressed his dejection over it and indicated that he may not perform hereafter. “Nafrat Jeet Gayi, Artist Haar Gaya (hate has won, the artist has lost). I’m done, goodbye. Injustice,” he had said in an Instagram post. AIPC’s Mathew Antony said, on November 27, he had promised he would ensure Faruqui performs in Mumbai. “We have delivered on our promise and he performed in front of a full house at the Y B Chavan Hall,” he said. Antony said there were a few debates over the decision to support Faruqui. In a statement, the AIPC said the Mumbai event went off without “any element of disturbance”. The statement said: “We wanted to support Munawar as a political stand not for Munawar but for any artist or individual, who should have the creative freedom of mind to perform without fear”. It added that “creative content” and “ruthless criticism of the system” in any manner that enables the mind to “pause and reflect” or any form of art that creates “necessary checks and balances” in the system must be encouraged. The AIPC thanked all the “torchbearers, who believed” in the values of the Constitution, the freedom of expression of the individual and the freedom of choice for the individual to choose the form of entertainment they would like to consume. The AIPC also thanked zonal DCP Hari Balaji, Cuffe Parade police team, environment minister Aaditya Thackeray’s office staff, state home minister Dilip Walse Patil, the Pawar family, state Congress leadership and AIPC chairman Shashi Tharoor and other office-bearers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-comedian-faruqui-performs-in-city-with-backing-from-cong-unit-mva/articleshow/88379139.cms||---

The venue, that organizes the biggest Christmas celebration in the city, is already getting decked up for the festival next week, but Sunday morning was all about the KMC elections for the Bow Barracks residents. Kiosks were set up in the locality to help voters in the neighbourhood find their names and polling booths. Unlike other areas, where political workers set up the kiosks, Bow Barracks residents do it themselves without any party symbols. “Residents of Bow Barracks cast their vote in all the elections, if they are present in the city. Most of them try to cast their vote in the first half to spend time with family and friends for the rest of the day,” said Angela Govindraj, a resident of Bow Barracks. Bow Barracks falls under the Chowringhee assembly segment and has close to 150 voters. “Number of voters has come down drastically because many have passed away, while others have migrated. Most youngsters now stay away from home,” said a veteran of Bow Barracks. Christmas celebrations will start at Bow Barracks from December 21 and will continue till the beginning of January. Lights have already been installed and other decorations will be complete by Monday night. But on Sunday, vote was their first priority. “Most people voted early because Christmas is only a few days away. Everybody needs time for last minute preparations. Several families have guests who have come to celebrate Christmas here and had a Sunday lunch lined up,”said a resident. The dilapidated residences in Bow Barracks were recently renovated by the government after a gap of almost five decades. There are 132 flats most of which are either one room or two room apartments. The layout is influenced from or has similarity with old historic Spanish Colonial town plan. A compact layout having a main ‘square’ and a city grid layout forms the basic aspects of the physical planning. Bow Barracks was built as Garrisons’ mess in 1918 for accommodation of soldiers during World War I, but they refused to move in. When Kolkata Improvement Trust was expanding Central Avenue and roads leading to it, several displaced Anglo-Indian families were rehabilitated in Bow Barracks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bow-barracks-goes-out-to-vote-amid-christmas-preparations/articleshow/88378515.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC dismisses minister Chhagan Bhujbal’s plea against I-T action||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has dismissed a petition filed by Maharashtra minister for food and civil supply Chhagan Bhujbal against assessment proceedings by Income Tax (I-T) department. The I-T office had in March 2019 issued him a notice saying income of over Rs 3 crore for 2012-13 had escaped its notice for assessment. Bhujbal challenged the notice. The HC agreed with the submissions made by counsel for I-T Sham Walve, who said that once Bhujbal had participated in the assessment proceedings, he could not challenge it before court. In his order, Justice K R Shriram said, “The test to be applied is whether there was reason to believe income had escaped assessment and whether the assessing officer has tangible material for the formation of that belief. Once tangible basis has been disclosed, it would not be appropriate for this court to prevent an enquiry. In this case, the reasons indeed disclose that tangible material.” The HC agreed with Bhujbal’s counsel K Gopal that the I-T “commissioner is duty bound to apply his mind... and such power cannot be exercised casually, in a routine and perfunctory manner.” But the HC added, in Bhujbal’s case there is “nothing to indicate that there was non-application of mind.” The I-T department had in September 2019 said that “credible information received” from deputy director of I-T found that “suspect person has defrauded the Maharashtra government by preparing fabricated documents and used them as genuine documents …and gained from developer M/s. K.S. Chamankar Enterprises”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-dismisses-min-bhujbals-plea-against-i-t-action/articleshow/88379154.cms||Swati Deshpande

The officials said in the wake of Omicron scare, it has become necessary to be vigilant. The officials have planned to conduct random tests at the picnic spots. “We do not want to scare the tourists but as part of precautionary measures, we need to conduct tests as large gatherings at picnic spots could lead to mass spread,” additional chief medical officer Sahir Pall said. Pall also said health officials will check if safety norms are followed at the picnic spots. As per records, between the first week of October first week and the second week of December, 290 people tested positive in the district, of which, 30% of them arrived from Bengal. A total 52,196 Covid cases have been reported between May 13, 2020 and December 18 this year, including 51,103 recoveries and 1,062 deaths. Earlier this month, a toddler, who was suffering from sickle cell anaemia, died of Covid, although she had no travel history. “Covid cases have decreased but we are still in the middle of a pandemic and we cannot be casual at this point,” a physician, Dr M K Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/east-sbhum-to-test-picnickers-from-odisha-wb-for-covid/articleshow/88384527.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Ranchi: RMC adopts new tech to track civic violations||RANCHI: The Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) has equipped its enforcement cell with advance communication devices and Point-of-Sale (PoS) machines in order to track civic violations and encroachments across the city in real time and to penalise the violators. The move, which is part of the civic body’s technological upgradation programme, is aimed at ensuring better co-ordination between the enforcement cell’s members and the senior officials. A total of 60 walkie-talkie sets and 17 PoS machines were handed over to the officials of enforcement cell by mayor Asha Lakra and municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar. Talking to TOI, Kumar said: “The move will boost the confidence of our enforcement officials as well as bring transparency in penalizing the violators. The major focus will be on violations related to waste management and unauthorised construction.” He added that the devices will also help in co-ordination among different teams of corporation with the help of communication devices while they will also be able to collect on-spot fine through PoS machines in cases related to unauthorised construction as well as encroachment on roads, among others. Deputy municipal commissioner Rajnish Kumar said, “It will help in creating a communication channel among all the teams, including the senior officials who are looking after the cell. Besides, the radio communication sets will help in mobilizing teams in a specific area as per requirement during our special drives.” Earlier, enforcement teams used to issue a paper receipt to violators and make manual entry in their register for keeping a record. Now with PoS machines, a digital record will be available with date, time and location. “This digital record will prevent violators from denying old penalties,” Rajnish added. Lakra said that the technological advancement is for the citizens and asked the officials not to use them to harass them. “The officials should always keep one thing in mind that if there are some minor violations it should be solved amicably by keeping the law in mind. Penalizing citizens for every little thing isn’t a solution,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rmc-adopts-new-tech-to-track-civic-violations/articleshow/88377902.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Cold winds sweep Jharkhand, minimum temp to dip in southern districts||RANCHI: Winter chill has finally set its foot in Jharkhand with regular northern winds entering the state for the past two-three days. The northern winds that brought down the temperature in northern and central Jharkhand is now expected to sweep through the southern districts in the next 24 hours, pulling the mercury down by 3-4 degrees. During the same period, the temperature in remaining parts of the state is likely to drop by 1-2 degrees. Director of IMD, Ranchi, Abhishek Anand said that the minimum temperature in the central parts of the state fell by around 4 degrees. “Ranchi recorded 7.6 degrees as minimum temperature on Sunday, down by around 4 degrees from 11.5 degrees recorded on Saturday,” he said. Daltonganj in northern part of the state also recorded a fall of 1.5 degrees to record 8.4 degrees, while Jamshedpur in the southern part of state became slightly warmer during the night as the minimum temperature increased from 11 to 12.8 degrees. Despite marked fall in the night and day temperature, Jharkhand is still spared from cold wave. According to meteorological criteria, cold wave sets in when the minimum temperature plummets under 10 degrees Celsius. “But that is not the only criteria as the departure of minimum temperature must be 4.5 degrees or more,” Anand said. Health experts, however, caution against the sudden fall in temperature asking elderly and children to reman protected from cold wind in particular.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cold-winds-sweep-state-minimum-temp-to-dip-in-southern-districts/articleshow/88378307.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||East Singbhum leads in vax coverage||RANCHI: East Singbhum has inoculated the highest number of beneficiaries with Covid-19 vaccine in the state, while the remaining 23 districts are in red category with below 40% coverage. As per the state health department’s latest vaccination data on December 18, out of 16,77,341 estimated beneficiaries in East Singbhum, so far 9,46,589 received their second dose (56%). In other words, over 9 lakh population is fully vaccinated in this district. With 32% coverage, Chatra is last of all the districts and Garhwa is only a notch (33%) better than it. Other districts with below 40% coverage of second dose include Giridih, Latehar, Dhanbad, Gumla, Jamtara, Pakur, Sahebganj, and West Singbhum. Those below 50% include Bokaro, Deoghar, Dumka, Godda, Hazaribag, Khunti, Ranchi, Simdega, Ramgarh, Palamu, Lohardaga, and Koderma. Last week, the health department began colour coding all the districts based on their daily coverage. Below 50% is coded red, pink is between 50-60%, 60-70% is orange, 70-80% is yellow, 80-90% is light green and more than 90% is dark green. In terms of first dose, only East Singbhum and Khunti have over 80% coverage and is in light green category. Rest all are in orange category falling in the range of 60-70 per cent. Overall, out of total 2.41 crore eligible beneficiaries, state’s first dose coverage is 73% and second dose stands at 40%. While Jharkhand has rolled out a month long drive since December 16 to achieve 100% coverage by mid-January next year, health workers on the ground are unsure about achieving it. Health officials have attributed migratory population, lack of proper logistics and manpower and certain degree of hesitancy still prevalent among section of illiterate population as key reasons for the slow rate. Talking to TOI, Chatra civil surgeon Shyam Nand Singh said, “In urban centres like East Singbhum, administrations have lot of organizational support. For example, it has companies like Tata Steel, Tata Motors where majority of the population work. With companies mandating vaccination, people are forced to take them. This apart, there are several other voluntary and social outfits working as an extended hands of the administration. Remote district like Chatra had manpower shortage but we are now roping in people from select schools, hospitals to help us.” He added that the nature of migratory population is also a major reason for slow rate of second dose in many districts like theirs. “Chatra is one of the places from where people migrate to other parts for livelihood. Majority of the districts in our state received maximum of Covishield doses. So, those who took first dose here, would not wait for full 84 days for second dose. Hence, I think many are falling short in second dose coverage,” he said. Agreed his counterpart in Garhwa, Kamlesh Kumar, “We have 54,000 migrants on the record and it is to be seen how many are still in the district. Also, we have immense crisis of health workers on the ground. But from tomorrow, we are getting 58 more ANMs and three more vaccine vehicles along with 18 staff which will pace up the drive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/east-sbhum-leads-in-vax-coverage/articleshow/88377836.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Due to unavailability of an RT-PCR lab, samples collected in Bokaro were either sent to Dhanbad or Ranchi causing delays in getting the report. Health department officials on Sunday, however, said they are trying hard to set up one RT-PCR lab at the earliest here adding that the lab infrastructure is ready at Sector-5 but awaiting installation of the machine. Civil surgeon Jitender Kumar Singh said, “We are making efforts and coordinating with state headquarters to make the RT-PCR lab operational soon.” Minakshi Kumar, an official looking after RT-PCR project here, said, “The infrastructure of the lab is ready but due to budget constraints, the RT-PCR machine is yet to arrive. However, we are now expecting it to come next week.” RT-PCR laboratory in Bokaro was among the six labs that were announced by chief minister Hemant Soren in April this year along with Gumla, Ranchi Sadar, Chaibasa, Jamshedpur, Godda and Deoghar. During the second wave, Truenat machines installed at Sadar hospital, Bokaro General Hospital (BGH) and in sub-divisional hospitals somehow managed the situation. But officials said that speed testing will hold the key for early detection of cases at a time when the Omicron variant is said to be spreading faster. At present, the health department is collecting more than 2,000 swab samples daily of which mostly get tested through Truenat and RAT. Although RT-PCR tests are done in private laboratories here but people suspect the authenticity of the reports. Last year, Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL) agreed to provide land and infrastructure to set up the lab but nothing came of the promise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/over-a-year-since-cov-outbreak-bokaro-awaits-rt-pcr-lab/articleshow/88378236.cms||Divy Khare
---||Ranchi||JMM demands 27% quota for OBCs in govt, private jobs||RANCHI: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), the lead tribal party in the state’s ruling coalition has joined the political bandwagon by passing a political resolution in favour of reserving 27% seats in government and private jobs and educational institutes for the Other Backward Caste (OBC) candidates. The resolution was taken at the party’s 12th general convention here on Saturday. But Congress, its key ally in the ruling coalition, took the move with a pinch of salt. Talking to TOI on Sunday, a senior Congress leader said, “For two years now, our party has been pitching for 27% reservation for the OBC section. Time and again, delegations have met chief minister Hemant Soren and urged him to make a move in this direction. Though he has assured us every time, his government has not shown the intent in doing so.” Another senior Congress leader said, “What is the point of passing a resolution when you already have it in your election manifesto? Being the principal ruling party, the JMM could have simply brought legislation on it. Along with the reservation for the OBC category, the resolution also speaks of reserving 28% for ST and 12% for SC. The writing on the wall is clear: JMM is not very serious about it.” The JMM leadership did not respond when contacted about the issue on Sunday evening. The tribal party’s political resolution on industries, mines and employment generation has also brought concern among the state’s industrialists. In the resolution taken on Saturday, the party favoured returning unused land that are occupied by the industries to the original landowners (Raiyyats). “Many industries acquire land keeping in mind their long-term plans of expansions and other paraphernalia. So, if a patch of land lies unused for some time, it does not necessarily mean that it will not be used,” Philip Mathew, the president of Jharkhand Small Industries Association, told TOI. “However, there are many people who acquire land in the name of setting up industries and then hoard it for selling at higher prices. Instead of a sweeping directive, there should be mechanisms to detect such hoarding,” Mathew said. Expressing skepticism about the resolution, a city-based industrialist said, “On one hand, the CM is urging top tier corporate houses to set up shops in the state and on the other, the JMM’s political resolutions are creating an air of confusion and skepticism about the industrial climate of the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-demands-27-quota-for-obcs-in-govt-pvt-jobs/articleshow/88377870.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The RMC will also propose a fixed rate for rental of hoardings, banners and flags in the upcoming Nagar Nigam Board meeting. “There are many unauthorised hoardings and posters put up at the bypass road and other parts of the city without RMC’s permission. RMC generates income from the agencies which have been given tender to book advertisement space on hoardings. However, some political parties put up posters along the street lights which is prohibited. Hence the notice will be issued to ensure that prior permission is taken from RMC before putting the hoardings or posters,” said deputy municipal commissioner Kunwar Singh Pahan. Nigam is responsible for renting out space for hoardings, banners and flags. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) has put up many hoardings around the city for their general convention. “Every political party puts up hoardings and banners ahead of events. But to safeguard a rule-based order, the RMC is planning to bring this matter into light in the upcoming meeting,” said Deputy Mayor Sanjeev Vijaywargiya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rmc-to-issue-notice-to-pol-parties-over-hoardings/articleshow/88377892.cms||---

The officer has denied the charge and police said no written complaint was filed by his relatives so far. Family members, Prasad, who hailed from Jangi village under sadar block in Chatra district, said he was digging land to plant saplings on Thursday when circle officer Bhagirath Mahto came and asked him to stop. The family alleged that Mahto had also beaten up the elderly person mercilessly. Prasad’s son, Parmanand Dangi, said, “My father was busy digging land to plant saplings on December 16. Mahto came after getting information from some neighbours that my father was trying to grab a "gair mazruwa" land. Mahto lost his cool after reaching the spot and made Prasad sit in his SUV forcefully and beat him.” He added, “The villagers convinced the officer to let go of my father, but by that time he was unconscious. We rushed him to the Chatra district hospital but he was referred to the Hazaribag medical college and hospital, where he died.” The villagers are now demanding action against the officer, failing which they have decided to launch a stir. However, Mahto has denied the charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/stir-over-death-of-elderly-beaten-by-chatra-officer/articleshow/88378327.cms||---

The exams were held in September this year and the preliminary results were published in November and since then, they have been mired in controversy owing to several issues. JPSC aspirants since then have been vehemently protesting against the results and have demanded cancellation of the exams. The BJP has demanded a CBI inquiry on the matter and has even approached governor Ramesh Bais for his intervention. Last week, JPSC disqualified 49 candidates, whom it had initially declared as passed, citing absence of OMR sheets. On Saturday, when Soren was asked during the JMM convention to react to the JPSC anomaly, he allegedly said that that there hasn’t been any major issues with the civil service exams and some forces were deliberately trying to give it a different colour. Criticizing his comments, BJP’s spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said, “We expected the CM to be a sensible person towards youngsters but his comments proved otherwise.” He claimed that instead of listening to the protesters’ issues, the government is attempting to thwart their protest through various means. On Saturday, the cops removed the JPSC aspirants from Morhabadi ground where they were protesting for cancellation of the exam. While speaking about JPSC’s decision to disqualify 49 students, Shahdeo said, “JPSC’s U-turn not only exposed the deep malaise in its examination system but also proved the protestors’ claim that the exam wasn’t held in fair manner. The entire exam requires a detailed probe and it can’t be done without its cancellation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-patronising-corrupt-jpsc-officials-claims-bjp/articleshow/88378225.cms||---

Envoys from 57 Islamic nations and observer delegations participated in the conference in Islamabad, the biggest event on Afghanistan after the fall of the US-backed government in the country. The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in mid-August had prompted the international community to freeze the country's billions of dollars in aid and assets, plunging the nation of 38 million into the worst economic and humanitarian disaster. Pakistani officials said that 70 delegations, including interim Taliban foreign minister Mullah Amir Khan Muttaqi and delegates from the US, China, Russia the European Union and the UN, took part in the event. At the end of the session, a draft resolution was issued that was full of phrases, like the extraordinary session of the OIC council of foreign ministers welcomed the initiative, commended Pakistan's role, recognised the deep-rooted Islamic values that form the ethos of the Muslim society. Moreover, the resolution carried statements, such as the body of Islamic nations expressed deep alarm at the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. It noted with deep concern the breakdown of Afghanistan's health system, disease outbreaks and severe malnutrition. Furthermore, it urged on necessity for continuation of economic cooperation to the country and reaffirmed strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Afghanistan. Speakers also called for a quick opening of the country's banking system. The president of the Islamic Development Bank Muhammad Sulaiman al-Jasser, who attended the meet, offered several concrete financing proposals. He said the IDB can manage trusts that could be used to move money into Afghanistan, jumpstart businesses and help salvage the deeply troubled economy. The OIC also resolved Sunday to arrange for a team of international Muslim scholars to engage with the Taliban on issues "such as, but not limited to, tolerance and moderation in Islam, equal access to education and women's rights in Islam". Pakistan PM Imran Khan, during his keynote address at the meeting, warned the global community that situation in Afghanistan would become the biggest "man-made crisis in the world" if it did not act immediately. Khan said no other country had suffered as much as Afghanistan, adding that 75% of the country's budget was supported by foreign aid before the Taliban had seized control. He urged Washington to delink the Taliban government from the Afghan citizens. "They have been in conflict with the Taliban for 20 years but this concerns the people of Afghanistan," Khan said, reiterating that Afghanistan would head for chaos if the world failed to take immediate action. "Such a situation will not suit the US because chaos means the inability to fight terrorism." He noted that the Taliban had to fulfil the commitments they had made to the international community, which included forming an inclusive government and ensuring women's rights. Earlier, the acting Afghan foreign minister calimed the Taliban government has restored peace and security and done much to address demands for more inclusive government with respect for human rights, including the rights of women.

Of the total number of Covid-19 patients, 208 are being treated in various city hospitals, compared with 153 patients a week ago and 225 patients are currently recuperating in home isolation, compared with 188 patients on November 12. With one Covid-19 fatality reported on Sunday, the month of December has recorded a total three deaths due to Covid-19 so far in Delhi. Seven Covid-19 deaths were reported in November, four in October and five in September. The toll currently stands at 25,101, with a case fatality rate of 1.74%. The new cases recorded in the last 24 hours are from 57,435 RTPCR/CBNAAT/True Nat tests and 4,470 rapid antigen tests. With the new cases, the coronavirus infection tally in the city has reached 14,42,197. Of this, over 14.16 lakh patients have recovered from the disease, the health department bulletin said. Out of the total 8,978 hospital beds reserved for Covid-19 patients, 8,770 are vacant. Out of the total 2,788 Covid ICU beds in Delhi, 2,728 were vacant at 9 pm on Sunday, according to the Delhi government's online Corona dashboard, including 1,366 vacant ICU beds with ventilators out of a total 1,378. According to city hospitals, the rise in admissions due to Covid-19 is significant and most doctors blame it on the lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour among people. Health experts also have an apprehension that the Omicron variant, which is known to be highly transmissible, may cause further spurt in cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-records-over-100-covid-cases-after-6-months/articleshow/88380284.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Lobo told reporters that the state government has received a proposal from a private party to operate and manage the Fort Aguada jail complex which has been redeveloped into a museum dedicated to Goa’s freedom struggle. It also has galleries, performance areas and a cafe. “The private party has offered to pay Rs 1.2 crore per year. I’m saying there is corruption in the proposal because the government can earn Rs 1 crore per month by way of entry charges,” he said. “When this proposal came up in a cabinet meeting, I said I'm opposed to it, and the chief minister had also agreed that the fort jail complex should not be given to a private party," he said. Lobo has said the complex should be given to the Goa Tourism Development Corporation, which can manage all activities there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-demands-restored-aguada-jail-be-handed-to-tourism-corp/articleshow/88379398.cms||---
---||Delhi||3.3°C: Season's coldest morning in Delhi on Sunday||NEW DELHI: The capital woke up to the coldest morning of the season on Sunday with a minimum temperature of 4.6 degrees Celsius at Safdarjung, even as the weather department declared "cold wave" conditions in parts of the city with Jafarpur shivering at 3.3 degrees C and Lodhi Road recording 3.6 degrees, reports Kushagra Dixit. Strong, icy northwesterly winds sweeping across the northern plains for the second day have suddenly brought on harsh winter conditions in the region, with both "cold day" and "cold wave" conditions in parts of the city. Similar weather is likely on Monday, the met department said. North By Northwest: Himalayan Winds To Blame For DecemberHowever, with another western disturbance lurking round the corner, conditions may turn warmer by Tuesday as the wind direction reverses. "Harsh winter conditions are here due to stronger northwesterly winds which flow from the higher Himalayan mountains and are icy cold. Isolated areas of the city have experienced a cold wave, and that may continue through Monday. However, there will be a break thereafter due to a change in wind direction," said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD). The weatherman said cold wave conditions in the region depend directly on the speed of northwesterly winds. When a western disturbance approaches the region, the wind direction changes to easterly and the mercury rises. "Yesterday (Saturday), the wind speeds were 30-40 kmph which led to a cold day and a subsequent cold wave on Sunday at isolated places and quite low minimum temperatures at other places. But the maximum temperatures soared slightly on Sunday comparatively because the wind speed dropped to 10-20 kmph on Sunday. The speed may further drop and there will be a western disturbance, which will also lead to slight clouding on or after Tuesday. This will lead to a rise in minimum temperatures," said Jenamani. A western disturbance (WD) is a flow of moisture-laden winds from the Mediterranean Sea region to the Himalayas that forms a low-pressure area and sometimes leads to rain and snow in northern India. As the WD moves further east, northwesterly winds resume in the region, again leading to a dip in temperatures. According to the IMD, Safdarjung (considered the city's main weather station) recorded a maximum and minimum temperature of 19.2 degrees Celsius, while the minimum was recorded at 4.6 degrees Celsius - both three notches below the day's average. On Monday, the maximum and minimum temperature in the city are likely to hover around 19 and 4 degrees Celsius, with the IMD forecasting possibility of a cold wave. A cold wave happens when the minimum temperature is less than or equal to four degrees Celsius and it's at least four degrees below normal. Meanwhile, city's air quality remained within poor category due to moderate winds that helped flush the pollutants out. The air quality index, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 271 on Sunday, against 291 a day earlier. CAQM likely to further ease restrictions on construction activities:The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) is likely to further ease the curbs on construction and demolition activities in Delhi-NCR in view of a significant improvement in the air quality over the last three days, an official said on Sunday.A decision is likely as early as Monday, he said."In view of the significant improvement in the air quality in NCR over the last three days, the CAQM is likely to further liberalise restrictions in the construction sector," the official said. The commission had on Friday said the restrictions on construction and demolition activities in Delhi-NCR will continue till further orders. However, projects related to public utilities, railways, metro, airports and ISBTs, national security, defence, healthcare, highways, roads, flyovers, power transmission, and pipelines among others had been exempted. The central air quality panel had also allowed authorities in Delhi-NCR to resume physical classes for students in classes 6 and above, colleges and other educational institutions with immediate effect. The commission had also said that physical classes for students up to class 5 can begin from December 27.

---||Hyderabad||Spooked by Omicron, many rush to get booster on the sly||HYDERABAD: With rise in Omicron infections across country, panic-stricken people are taking booster shots illegally at corporate hospitals, some with serious side-effects. This even as experts warn against such actions before a national policy on boosters is released. Flooded with requests for boosters, doctors say some have even taken a cocktail - two Covishield and two Covaxin doses. In one such case, a Hyderabadi businessman took a dose of Sputnik after two shots of Covishield and Covaxin, a hospital source and a doctor confirmed. Politicians, healthcare personnel, policemen and businessmen are on top of the list of those taking booster. Coronavirus live updatesHealth experts said that many in Delhi have taken one booster dose after completing vaccination process. Experts warn that such moves can have serious impact on health. Omicron can evade immunity from prior infection or vaccination and spread rapidly, according to experts. Scientific organisations across the globe are talking about developing a variant-specific booster or a pan-coronavirus vaccine. So, until then, masks, hand hygiene and social distancing are crucial. "We don't yet have evidence that a booster will help against Omicron. The rise of antibodies is not the only protection against the virus. Misinformed people are taking a booster dose, and it's happening mostly because hospitals and companies want to get rid of their stocks before it expires," Dr Sanjay Rai, professor, department of community medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) told TOI. 'Two-dose regimen largely effective so far'  Look at Singapore, South Korea, US and UK. Many cases of breakthrough infections are happening after vaccinations," said Dr Rai, also the president of Indian Public Health Association. Dr JC Suri, director at Fortis Rajan Dhal hospital in Vasant Kunj, New Delhi, said he has asked those who have enquired on the third dose to wait for the policy on boosters.  In Hyderabad, Dr P Raghu Ram, director, KIMS-Ushalakshmi Centre for Breast Diseases, said demand for boosters has reached alarming levels. "Covid-19 vaccines have been brought out in shortest possible time... So, we know very little about its long-term side-effects. It will be prudent to take a booster only if it has been proven beneficial," he said. "Despite the emergence of Omicron, hospitals are not overwhelmed with admissions," Raghu Ram said. "Most importantly, there has been no significant increase in patients with severe disease or deaths. It would be reasonable to assume that the two-dose regimen has largely been effective."  Experts have urged following Covid-appropriate behaviour. "Properly worn masks remain the first line of defence, irrespective of variant," said Dr Anurag Agrawal, chair of WHO's Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 and director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology. Dr NK Arora, co-chair, of Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium told TOI that avoiding large gatherings and wearing masks is crucial at the moment. "At this stage, three things can save us. Wearing a proper well-fitted mask, avoiding crowded areas and complete vaccination," said Dr Saumitra Das, director of the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/spooked-by-omicron-many-rush-to-get-booster-on-the-sly/articleshow/88380342.cms||Bappa Majumdar

---||India||Amid cold wave, strike leaves J&K in the dark||JAMMU: Troubled residents of Jammu and Kashmir took to the streets on Sunday to protest against the total disruption to electricity supply in several parts of the UT, even as the indefinite strike by staffers of the power development department against privatisation and other issues entered its second day despite the administration's request to resume work, officials said. Divisional commissioners of both Jammu and Kashmir requested the Army to assist in restoring the power supply in the affected regions, besides provisioning manpower to man critical electricity and water supply sources, said an official. Jammu divisional commissioner Raghav Langer said Army engineers had begun working on the affected power lines in the regions hit by the crisis and even restored electricity in some areas. On Friday midnight, over 20,000 power sector employees had boycotted work in support of their various demands, including shelving of a proposed joint venture between the Jammu and Kashmir Power Transmission Corporation Limited and the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. With the night temperature dropping to as low as -6˚C in Srinagar after many decades this season, the total blackout has compounded residents' misery by plunging hundreds of J&K localities into darkness for the past two days. Jammu DC held talks with protesting employees even as stalemate continued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-cold-wave-strike-leaves-jk-in-the-dark/articleshow/88380362.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Nagpur||SC notices over HC’s verdict on consumer forum members||NAGPUR: The Supreme Court on Friday issued notices on the special leave petitions filed by central and state governments challenging the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court verdict quashing the provisions of Consumer Protection Rules, which excluded lawyers having less than 15 years experience from appointments to consumer commissions/forums. The HC’s September 14 verdict had come after a city lawyer Mahendra Limaye, through Tushar Mandlekar, had challenged the validity of Consumer Protection Rules, 2020, governing appointments of president and members of the State and District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions. The Nagpur bench led by Justice Sunil Shukre had quashed the provisions of Consumer Protection Rules, terming them unconstitutional and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Praying for a stay, attorney general KK Venugopal contended that the HC struck down the rules on the basis of the SC’s Madras Bar Association judgment which held that lawyers with minimum experience of 10 years should be considered for appointments as members of tribunals. The SC bench comprising Justice L Nageswara Rao and Justice Bhushan Gavai issued notices to the respondents, including Limaye, asking them to reply before January 31. Appearing for Maharashtra government, Rahul Chitnis submitted that another SC bench, led by Justice SK Kaul, had passed directives for the appointment of members of the commissions. Justice Rao and Justice Gavai clarified that it cannot pass an order on interim relief now, but will issue notice on the interim application. The Nagpur bench, also having Justice Anil Kilor, had struck down the provisions of the new Consumer Protection Rules, 2020, which prescribed a minimum professional experience of 20 years and 15 years for adjudicating members to the state consumer commissions and district forums, respectively. The HC had also cancelled the provision that gives the state’s selection committee power to determine procedure to recommend names for appointments in the order of merit to the government to consider. The HC order was pertaining to the New 2020 Rules framed by the Centre under Section 101 of Consumer Protection Act, 2019, for appointments, qualifications, eligibility, removal of members of State Consumer Commission, and District Consumer Forums.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sc-notices-over-hcs-verdict-on-consumer-forum-members/articleshow/88378921.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||Reporter’s Diary: Sexual assault survivor tribal girls pass the test||Nagpur: Journalists get to meet people from all walks of life and experience first-hand their joys, miseries, trials and triumphs. However, the biggest satisfaction comes from helping people in their moment of crisis. For this diarist, one such moment occurred this summer. It was sometime in May this diarist got a call from a remote part of Chandrapur district. The caller was principal of a residential government school which caters specifically to tribal students. The Std X batch of academic session 2020-21 included girls who had been transferred here a year before following a horrific ordeal of sexual assault over a period of time by their previous hostel male staffers. While criminal proceedings are underway against the perpretrators, the survivors were shifted to different groups to new residential tribal schools in the same district. A few of them were relocated to this particular school about an hour’s drive from Chandrapur city. The principal’s concern was that due to CBSE’s marking policy, her entire batch was destined to fail. This year written exams were cancelled, so allotment of marks had to follow a rigourous methodology put in place so that schools don’t “cheat”. However, one or two clauses in this new marking policy meant that these tribal girls would be allotted marks below the pass level. “If my students failed after appearing for the test, I would have accepted it. But here without writing a single word they are failing because of the benchmarking clause,” the principal said. She was concerned that if these girls fail in Std X, then their parents in remote tribal villages of Vidarbha will discontinue their education. “Education is the ticket out of poverty for these girls. At such a tender age some of them have already witnessed the worst crime possible against women, and now getting a “failed” result will simply break their spirit. Please help me to get in touch with CBSE to save these girls,” the principal said. Less than an hour later this diarist spoke to a very senior CBSE official and explained the precarious situation these tribal girls find themselves in. The official was very understanding but stayed firm that every decision shall be taken as per rules only. Soon, the diarist got the official on a conference call with the principal and it was suggested that the school submit an appeal to the central board. This appeal will have all issues written out in detail. Within 24 hours the principal emailed the “appeal” in great detail. A few weeks later, this diarist recieved a call from her. “My girls and I do not have words to thank The Times of India for helping us. All my girls have made the cut and will now move on to Std XI. CBSE was extremely considerate and had it not been for TOI, then these girls would be back in their villages as an extra hand to work in the fields or even be married off,” said the principal. The happiness this diarist felt for the girls cannot be summed up in words. All I knew was that journalism was truly a fulfilling career.

---||Mumbai||Only 4 Maharashtra districts may reach 100% first-dose target by year-end||MUMBAI: Fewer than five of the 36 districts in Maharashtra would be able to achieve 100% first-dose vaccination coverage against Covid-19 before the end of the year. The state has given a single shot to 86% of its population, but 22 districts are below that average. Mumbai (106%) and Pune (103%) are the only two districts that have administered at least one dose to more than 100% of their estimated adult population (the percentages are higher than 100 as people from outside these districts also got vaccinated there). Two other districts that have a likelihood of reaching that end point are Bhandara and Sindhudurg, which have given a single shot to almost 96% of their populations. Bhandara needs to vaccinate 37,000 while Sindhudurg needs to immunise another 26,000 in the next ten days to hit the milestone. In all, 12.77 crore vaccine doses have been administered in Maharashtra since January, of which 7.87 crore have been first doses and 4.89 crore second doses. A break-up shows that 11 districts have reached more than 90% coverage, while another five have achieved more than 80% coverage. Around 16 districts have coverage in the range of 70-78%. Footfall for first dose in dists has fallen, say health officialsThe tribal-populated district of Nandurbar is at the bottom, with less than 70% coverage (69%). Of the state's adult population of 9.14 crore, about 1.26 crore are yet to take their first shots. Dr Sachin Desai, the state's immunisation officer, is hopeful of pulling off 50% vaccination of these 1.26 crore people by the end of the year. "I think districts that are at the borderline of reaching 100% will do so in the next ten days. We have been pushing hard through the 'Har ghar dastak' campaign," he said. At the current rate of vaccination, the state may be able to give first doses to another 60-70 lakh people by December 31. "By mid-January, we are aiming to cover everyone," he said. After hitting a high of 7.6 lakh daily average vaccinations in September, the drive took a major slump in October and November when the average dropped to 5.25 lakh and 5.38 lakh, respectively. It bounced back in the first two weeks of December when the daily average reached 8.8 lakh doses. A district official from Hingoli, however, said that with the year-end approaching, the response has started to slow down. "Many people have gone on holiday. Our health volunteers are finding many locked doors," he said. An official from Gondia said that more than 70% of their daily vaccinations now are second doses. "The footfall for first doses is low," said the official, adding that Mumbai and Pune had the advantage of being big cities with higher volumes of available doses and more eager people to take them. "Districts with rural populations fought with a shortage of doses, hesitancy, and lack of manpower for several months in the beginning," he said. State figures show that daily vaccinations have been in the range of 5-6 lakh for the past few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/only-4-maharashtra-districts-may-reach-100-first-dose-target-by-year-end/articleshow/88380397.cms||---

Congress members Jitendra Singh, Gaurav Gogoi and Gourav Vallabh said Sarma misused his position to transfer government land for the landless to RBS Realtors, which involves his immediate family, illegally. Alleging "high-handedness" and accusing the CM of double speak, Congress said the deprived families have been evicted on grounds of encroachment of government land, but handed over the same to his family members. "We demand that Sarma, who along with his family, is involved in usurping land for the landless people, should be immediately sacked from his position," Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said. "A sitting CM, whose family is directly involved in land grabbing, has no right to remain in power. He must be sacked from his position," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/assam-cm-grabbed-land-says-cong-seeks-his-scalp/articleshow/88380399.cms||---
---||India||Afghanistan, Covid & connectivity focus of India-Central Asia talks||NEW DELHI: Afghanistan, Covid and connectivity dominated the discussions among central Asian foreign ministers and India on Sunday. The third central Asia dialogue will be followed by the residents of all five countries coming as chief guests for India's Republic Day celebrations next month, in a sign that India is deeply invested in closer ties in this part of the world, as "the Afghanistan and China challenge" necessitate such an engagement, feel government sources. Interestingly, most of the ministers skipped the OIC meeting being organised by Pakistan in Islamabad the past weekend. The Uzbek foreign minister, however, registered his presence there before coming to New Delhi. Foreign minister S Jaishankar held a bilateral meeting with his Tajik counterpart on Saturday and with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan counterparts on Sunday. The foreign ministers will call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday before returning. Calling for a representative and inclusive government in Afghanistan, the joint statement said, they supported "a peaceful, secure and stable Afghanistan while emphasising the respect for sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity and non-interference in its internal affairs..." The central Asian nations signed on to a formulation that is normally used by India against Chinese BRI. They agreed that "connectivity initiatives should be based on the principles of transparency, broad participation, local priorities, financial sustainability and respect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of all the countries." India proposed using the Chahbahar port for transit and making it part of the INSTC (International North-South Transport Corridor), which was accepted. The Shahid Beheshti terminal at Chahbahar, built by India, is seen as a viable entrepot to access central Asia via Iran, bypassing Pakistan. Turkmenistan is pushing for a TAPI pipeline to Pakistan and India, though its fate is currently uncertain. Jaishankar said, "The Covid pandemic has resulted in an enormous setback to global health and economy...highlights the inadequacy of the existing multilateral structures to meet new threats. We need diversified supply chains and more regional solutions." Assuring that India would remain a "steadfast partner", Jaishankar said, "Our ties must focus around 4Cs: Commerce, Capacity enhancement, Connectivity and Contacts."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/afghanistan-covid-connectivity-focus-of-india-central-asia-talks/articleshow/88380401.cms||---

His relatives got the same reply at the other medical college, IGGMCH. Both the medical colleges had received 90 ventilators under the PM Cares Fund. However, the officials said these ventilators are not being used as they have only basic functions, switch off suddenly, and no funds were allotted for their maintenance. Former state cabinet minister Anees Ahmed, whom the relatives approached, said the youth passed away after waiting for a couple of days, without getting a ventilator at a government hospital. Ahmed later enquired with the top administrators of GMCH and IGGMCH, who told him that the ICUs were running full due to resumption of regular treatment and increase in emergency cases, resulting in shortage of ventilators. Following the youth’s death, the former Congress minister has written to the president, prime minister’s office, and Union health ministry regarding the defunct ventilators. Ahmed said no information regarding the procurement or fund utilization can be sought as PM Cares Fund is out of RTI Act’s ambit. “Amid the Omicron variant scare, and a projected third wave, it is absolutely shocking to see the apathy of government officials regarding ventilators in government hospitals. Although the number of corona patients is declining, the ICU and ventilator beds in government hospitals seem to be full. Patients are dying due to lack of ventilators. The ventilators received at GMCH and IGMCH under PM Cares Fund are malfunctioning and shut down suddenly, hampering oxygen supply,” he said. IGGMCH officials said they have 270 ventilators, including those received under PM Cares Fund. “The latter were received during the first wave. As there are no Covid patients admitted, the ventilators are not in use. Deploying them requires skilled manpower,” they claimed. GMCH officials said PM Cares ventilators are first generation India-made ventilators. “Previously, India never manufactured ventilators. So, these ventilators were having very primitive settings. When patients decreased, these ventilators, being very primitive, were kept aside because advanced imported ventilators were also available. These ventilators are lying idle rather than not working. But it is true that many machines are not working because maintenance funds are not available. Annual maintenance (AMC) is pending for a lot of machines because of lack of funds,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-90-pm-cares-fund-ventilators-lying-unused-at-gmch-iggmch/articleshow/88379028.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Nagpur||At 45k, Ngp dist tops state in online permits for liquor consumption||Nagpur: The requirement of legal permits for home delivery of liquor during the lockdown seemed to have catapulted Nagpur district to the top slot in the state in procuring online permissions for purchasing, consumption, possession and transport. It is learnt, the state excise department enforced the norms to the maximum extent in Nagpur, which contributed in issuance of high number of permits. State excise department has issued maximum 45,342 online permits for foreign and country liquor in Nagpur between April 2019 and December 16 this year, generating revenue to the tune of over Rs two crore. These permits were issued for either one year or lifetime. Another 1,096 applications are pending. In Mumbai city, 15,692 permits were issued and 29,650 for Mumbai suburban during the period between April 2019 and December 16 this year. Though less than Nagpur in number of permits issued, Mumbai suburban generated more revenue for the state exchequer (Rs2.29 crore). An official said Mumbai suburban is likely to have more number of lifetime permits with higher chargeable fees (Rs1,000) than Nagpur. Deputy divisional commissioner of state excise Mohan Varde said that a pattern of ‘indirect’ awareness campaigning and enforcement policy was followed in Nagpur. “We had told the liquor retailers and bar owners to encourage liquor customers to seek licence which can be procured from home itself. The licence holders were told to deliver, supply and sale liquor to only permit holders or face actions under ‘breach’ of licence conditions,” said Varde adding that the applications were processed quickly. Varde said that the strict norms of home delivery system during the lockdown played a crucial role in Nagpur district filing maximum number of applications in the state. “We had asked the licence holder shops and bar owners to be ready for surprise checks on home deliveries being made and face actions if norms are breached. The number of applicants increased on insistence of the license holders,” he said adding that state excise is the licensing authority which can competently act against breaches and put up cases before the collector for penal actions. SP Pramod Sonone said aggressive awareness campaigns among the stakeholders also went a long way in getting the highest number of applicants for permits. “We have also issued a large number of one-day permit (almost 5,000) through shops and bars,” said Sonone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/at-45k-ngp-dist-tops-state-in-online-permits-for-liquor-consumption/articleshow/88379064.cms||Soumitra Bose

This is the first time civic body staffers have been arrested in the case. Sadar police station PI Vinod Chaudhari told TOI, “Our investigation revealed involvement of two staffers of NMC — Mohan Padwanshi and Mohammed Afaque Ahmed — in the scam. This was also revealed by contractor Padmakar ‘Kolba’ Sakode. Therefore, we registered the same offence against these two NMC staffers and arrested them.” Chaudhari added all four persons will be produced before the court on Monday. “Extension of PCR will be sought for Sakode and his nephew Atul. Also, PCR of Padwanshi and Ahmed will be sought,” he said. Following a complaint from NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar, Sadar police had on December 16 registered an offence against Sakode (55), his wife Sushma (50), elder brother Manohar (70) and nephew Atul (40) under section 420 and other relevant sections of IPC. On December 17, Sadar police arrested Sakode and Atul. But the police are yet to arrest Sushma and Manohar. Padwanshi and Ahmed have been booked under section 420 and other relevant sections of IPC. Chaudhari also said, “Padwanshi was working as clerk in general administration department (GAD) of NMC and generated bills for Sakode on payment module. He also approved bills on payment module using the user ID and password of his head of the department. Ahmed is auditor in NMC’s accounts and finance department, and used to approve the bills for Sakode without any verification.” Preliminary investigations of NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and assistant commissioner Mahesh Dhamecha had found involvement of four staffers, including Padwanshi and Ahmed, and they were suspended on December 15. Two other suspended staffers are accounts officer Rajesh Meshram and auditor SY Nagdive, both from accounts and finance department. A team of Sadar police headed by Chaudhari took Sakode and Atul to the NMC head office and store room situated Gangabai ghat for investigations. Statements of few staffers from health department and accounts and finance department were recorded. NMC sources said Sakode revealed involvement of two more NMC staffers, one from health department and other from solid waste management department. But police did not get any evidence proving involvement of these two staffers in the case. It is also learnt that Sakode had genuine contracts of health, library, birth and death registration departments for supply of various materials, and he prepared fake contracts of the same works. It became easy for him to prepare bogus contracts as he was already engaged in preparing genuine contracts. NMC has blacklisted eight agencies related to him on December 17. On Monday, NMC is likely to suspend clerk Sanis Gokhe, who was served show cause notice a day earlier, for generating and approving bills for Sakode using the user IDs and passwords of executive engineer Naresh Borkar and junior engineer Sanjay Ingale. The civic body is also likely to issue show cause notice to Borkar and Ingale on Monday for sharing their user IDs and passwords with Gokhe. BOGUS CONTRACTS SCAM SO FAR * December 13: NMC lodged complaint with Sadar police station against five firms related to Padmakar ‘Kolba’ Sakode and his family members. TOI was the first to report scam where Sakode prepared 41 bogus contracts worth Rs67 lakh in health department * December 14: Sakode repaid Rs67,08,630 and NMC issued notices to six staffers — chief accounts and finance officer Vijay Kolhe, accounts officer Rajesh Meshram, assistant commissioner (GAD) Mahesh Dhamecha, senior clerk of GAD Mohan Padwanshi, auditor SY Nagdive and auditor Afaque Ahmed * December 15: Departmental inquiry starts against six staffers, four suspended. More bogus contracts came to fore in library and birth and death registration department. Six-member committee headed by additional municipal commissioner Deepak Kumar Meena constituted for detailed inquiry * December 16: Police register offence against Sakode and Atul. Over 90 bogus contracts worth Rs1.4 crore came to fore in health department * December 17: Sadar police arrest Sakode and Atul and obtain PCR till December 20. NMC blacklists eight firms of Sakode and his family members. Congress city president Vikas Thakre writes letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray for high-level inquiry and dissolution of NMC. NCP corporator Abha Pande asks mayor Dayashankar Tiwari for general body meet to discuss scam * December 18: NMC investigation revealed involvement of another clerk from projects department Sanis Gokhe and served show cause notice * December 19: Sadar police booked and arrested Padwanshi and Ahmed, visited NMC with Sakode and Atul for investigations||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sadar-police-book-arrest-2-nmc-staffers-in-bogus-contracts-scam/articleshow/88379114.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The walls of the cabin were clogged with soot and a freak fire is suspected to have caused the death. The incident came to light when the shift change happened. As per forest officials, the deceased Ravindra Kalbande was a resident of Fetri village. “The fire accident occurred at chowky number four, in unit II range of Gorewada project,” a forest official told TOI. This outpost is on the main road and located approximately 400 metres before the tourist entrance gate of Gorewada International Zoo while coming from Nagpur. Upon discovering the body, cops were informed and staff from Gittikhadan police station reached the spot to carry on further investigations. The body was taken for postmortem and report is expected in a day or two. Staff members at the zoo were shocked to hear of the incident, and rumours kept floating as the cause of fire. A forest official, who did not wish to be identified, said, “It seems that the watchman must have lit a small fire inside the cabin to keep warm as the mercury has dropped in the last few days. He must have fallen asleep and the smoke caused asphyxiation.” Some of the ground-level staff said they heard rumours of a “battery” explosion. “We too are not aware what exactly happened, but the smoke and fire thing does not add up. If the smoke level was high, the sleeping man would have got up due to irritability, coughing and dashed outside. It seems the fire was sudden and did not give enough time to Kalbande to come out,” said a staff member of the zoo. All staff members have been ‘unofficially’ advised to ensure that no unauthorized inflammable objects are brought inside as it will risk their lives only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gorewada-zoo-watchman-found-dead-after-freak-fire/articleshow/88379122.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||Worms open up a can of opportunities for Maha farm entrepreneur||Nagpur: A farm entrepreneur from Parner village in Patoda tehsil of Beed has become arguably the first to export live earthworms. A consignment of six tonne was shipped to Oman lately. Beed district in Marathwada region of Maharashtra has been subject to successive droughts. The dry spells had led to Amarnath Andure — the exporter — diversify into making organic manure. The customs department handling the papers was also left baffled when he first approached them. A search revealed that there was no earlier record of any such export. Finally, it was fit into the category of live animals. Sending the container of worms also needed clearance from the state’s animal husbandry department. Amid the entire process, Andure’s Nature Agrotech, having its office in Pune, emerged to what can said to be the first ever exporter of live insects to a foreign country. The deal has opened a number of new opportunities for him says, Andure. The order came from an agriculture tech company in Oman in the Middle East, which has initiated a project in organic farming. A search on the Internet brought the buyers to Andure’s website, he says. Andure does not reveal the company’s name for business reasons. However, he shared the shipping details with TOI. A clipping of an Arabic newspaper shared with him also translated as the first import of live earthworms to Oman, he says. “It began with an inquiry from the company which has taken up organic farming for which vermicompost is needed. Earthworms are the main ingredient. The worms are bred in the waste bio-material, which ultimately turns into vermicompost — an important input for organic farming,” says Andure. “I have 15 acres of land and took up aloe vera farming in 2015 as a recourse to continuous dry spells in Beed. The aloe vera crop easily revives on being watered even after drying up due to lack of rains in a given year. Since it was an organic venture, vermicompost was needed. I did not imagine that I would one day end up getting an export order,” he says. The order is not very big and the profits may be in the range of around Rs4 lakh. More than the money, it is a landmark for the company. The final calculations are yet to be done, he says. Sending the consignment was a challenge and the company ended up spending substantially in the process. The temperature had to be maintained, apart from other measures to ensure that the worms remain alive. Since it was first of its kinds case, the clearance took time adding to the warehouse expenses, said Andure. “It took a lot of paperwork to get the clearance. The key question was about the category in which the worms would fit in. Finally, after routing the case through animal husbandry department, the worms were classified as animals. The animal quarantine rules were applied. This means a certification that the consignment was disease-free was required,” said Govind Hande, agriculture department’s export consultant at Pune, who helped Andure. Andure now plans to go to Oman to provide know-how. Not fully vaccinated yet, the trip can happen only in February. In the meantime, he has got a number of inquiries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/worms-open-up-a-can-of-opportunities-for-maha-farm-entrepreneur/articleshow/88379129.cms||Shishir Arya

Paddy growers of the region often used to suffer losses in recent years, due to perennial blast disease in both the kharif and rabi seasons, from cultivating other varieties of paddy, but this year, over hundreds of farmers in Chamarajanagar district, who have been growing the RNR 15048 rice, are cheering, due to a bumper crop, despite adverse climate like heavy rain, that lashed the district in the last few months. Chamarajanagar KVK has introduced this variety of paddy for cultivation among farmers of Irusavadi in Chamarajanagar taluk and Y K Mole, as well as villages surrounding Yelandur taluk, on an experimental basis, on over 3,000 acres, during this kharif season. “Because of its unique grain size, short, slender shape, high grain yield potential, high head rice recovery, good cooking quality and robust blast resistance, this variety of paddy is being grown by a large number of farmers in recent years,” said Sunil, an agriculture scientist at Haradanahalli Krishi Vignan Kendra in Chamarajanagar. Moved by their success in the cultivation of this new rice variety, a large number of farmers want to cultivate RNR 15048 paddy in neighbouring Mysuru and Mandya districts as well. This variety of paddy is not only disease-resistant, but the crop is ready for harvesting in a short duration of 125 days, with high protein and low glycaemic index, and grows to a height of three to four feet. It is good for diabetics to consume, and can withstand adverse weather. Farmers can reap a good harvest of 25 to 30 quintals per acre, with a minimal cost of production. “As RNR 15048 was tested and found to be having a low glycaemic index (GI), it is ideal for a therapeutic diet, that helps in the reduction of blood glucose and elevation in plasma HDL cholesterol levels in patients with type-2 diabetes, according to various studies,” said Sunil “I have cultivated the RNR 15048 variety of paddy during this season, on one-and-a-half acres, which gave a good yield of nearly 40 quintals of fine quality, short and slender grain. As the price of this paddy variety costs around Rs 1,800 to Rs 1,900 per quintal in the market, it suits all health-conscious consumers, preferably diabetics,” said M Venkataramanashetty, a paddy grower of YK Mole village. Joint director of agriculture, Mahantheshappa, said the state government has already identified and promoted new varieties of rice like RNR 15048, which have a low content of carbohydrates, as well as other nutritious crops. “As this variety is giving a good yield, the government is recommending this crop for cultivation in both the rabi and kharif seasons,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/blight-resistant-paddy-a-rage-among-farmers/articleshow/88378164.cms||---

"While Omicron numbers may increase, it may not necessarily cause a heavy burden on the healthcare system. However, states have to be on the guard," Dr Samiran Panda, additional director-general of the ICMR, said. Against the backdrop of Omicron cases crossing the 100-mark in the country on Friday, Panda said a majority of them are travel-related. This picture emerged from samples sequenced so far and more details on Omicron are awaited, he said. "So, citizens should continue to practice all Covid protocols as preventive measures and be assured that current vaccines are effective," Panda said. The ICMR scientist said the total number of people detected in our country with Omicron mutant is too small to draw any inference on community transmission of this variant of SARS-CoV-2 "All that one may say from such a small reported number of individuals infected with the Omicron variant in the country is that some of these cases had a history of travel and some had history of contact with confirmed cases, no plausible exposure could be identified for the rest. It is also important to appreciate that the number of infected individuals do not necessarily mean the number of symptomatic cases. The terms 'infected individuals' and 'cases' or 'patients of Omicron' are not synonymous," he said. The scientist said this is in conformity with the observed transmission dynamics reported from South Africa and other countries. These nations had started reporting an increased number of infected individuals but not higher utilization of oxygen or ventilators by severely ill individuals or deaths, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delta-still-dominant-strain-circulating-in-india-icmr/articleshow/88380456.cms||Nisha Nambiar

He said that apart from Goa's scenic natural beauty that has made it a popular tourist destination, Goa has now acquired a new identity by achieving excellence in various fields of human endeavour. Speaking at an event to mark the 60th year of Goa's Liberation, Modi said that while the state has secured number one positions in good governance and per capita income, its score on various initiatives such as making the state open defecation-free, providing separate toilets in schools for girls, door-to-door garbage collection, har ghar jal, Aadhar enrollment, food security, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, all-weather road connectivity, (and) birth registration records, has been cent per cent. "...And the list goes on and on. When Goa starts some work, it takes it to a logical conclusion," he said. Modi congratulated the state for achieving 100% first dose vaccine coverage for the eligible population, and expressed satisfaction over the pace of coverage of the second dose. Goa is among the few states which have performed well in vaccination coverage, he said. CM Pramod Sawant came in for Modi's appreciation for leading the state towards development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/goa60-swayampurna-mission-to-help-boost-atmanirbhar-bharat-says-modi/articleshow/88380523.cms||---

Prodded into action by outrage among Sikhs over shrine's sanctum sanctorum being breached, the state government decided to write to the Centre to amend Section 295-A of the IPC and incorporate stricter punishment for acts tantamount to "deliberate and malicious intention to outrage religious sentiments". The deputy CM said Punjab assembly had passed a resolution in 2018 calling for an amendment to the law, but the Centre was still to act on it. DCP (law and order) Parminder Singh Bhandal's brief is to conduct the probe jointly with the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and submit a report within two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/golden-temple-sacrilege-sit-report-in-2-days/articleshow/88380567.cms||---

On November 6, cash and valuables were stolen from the house of timber merchant Mukesh Gupta in Kotwali when the family was away.  A senior police officer said that around 11am that day, Gupta and his son had gone to their office on Hapur road while his wife had left for Meerut along with their daughter for Bhai Dooj. When the mother-daughter duo returned home a few hours later, they found the main door of their house open. “They entered the house and found the cupboards rummaged and clothes strewn on the floor. They checked the almirah and found cash and valuables missing,” a police officer said. “Gupta told us he had bought gold and silver ornaments for his daughter’s wedding. He also lost Rs 10 lakh in cash,” he added. An FIR was registered in Kotwali police station under Section 380 (theft) of the IPC. SP (city 1) Nipurn Aggarwal said the police were suspecting someone close to the family. “Three police teams are working on the case. We will soon get leads in the case,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/no-arrests-yet-in-rs-1-5cr-burglary/articleshow/88379408.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Ganga Jamuna sex workers solicit clients on phone, police watchful||Nagpur: Sex workers at the city’s red-light area, Ganga Jamuna, pushed to the corner for their livelihood due to the ban on their trade by the city police, have started soliciting clients on mobile phones. Meanwhile, cops are planning to install CCTV cameras for surveillance to stop the illegal trade. The usage of mobile phone by sex workers had come to the fore after a client was nabbed by a team of Lakadganj police who had visited one of the brothels. The client is learnt to have solicited with the sex worker over the phone before visiting her. The matter had taken an ugly turn after the customer had shared his bitter experience with the sex worker he had visited of being extorted of Rs 10,000 by an officer of Lakadganj police station after being dragged out of her room. He also claimed to have made the payment through Paytm. Following the intervention of CP Amitesh Kumar, an inquiry was conducted under the supervision of Zonal DCP Gajanan Rajmane. It had come to the fore that the Paytm payment was done to a man in Chandrapur by his elder brother for family expenses. Prima facie, it had no connection with bribery to any police personnel. Senior inspector Parag Pote of Lakadganj police station said an in-depth inquiry into the allegations is under way. “In the near future, the area of Ganga Jamuna would be under CCTV surveillance to rule out allegations,” he said. Activist, Advocate Nihal Singh, said the Supreme Court in its latest order in the case of Buddhadev vs Paschim Bangal has stated that there’s a right to dignity in every vocation while deciding a matter related to sex workers. “Police entering a sex worker’s house to drag a customer out is a blatant violation of the right to dignity, right to privacy which is also related to the right to life,” he said. Singh also raised questions regarding the propriety of the cops raising objections to soliciting, even if it’s on the mobile phone. “Soliciting for sex work as a livelihood is per se not a crime which is projected by the police,” he said, adding, the apex court has also dissociated the police from relief work, including distribution of dry ration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ganga-jamuna-sex-workers-solicit-clients-on-phone-police-watchful/articleshow/88378849.cms||Soumitra Bose

A team of corporators and officials led by deputy mayor Anwar Baig had on Saturday visited the BBMP to learn about the initiative to collect property tax from owners. According to MCC officials, there are 1.92 lakh properties under the corporation limits. MCC has property tax arrears of around Rs 92 crore for the 2020-2021 financial year. MCC had set a target of Rs 140 crore property tax collection for 2021-22. Adding the arrears and the target, the total tax amount which MCC had to collect is Rs 232 crore but it could manage to collect just around Rs 100 crore. As there are around 61 revenue layouts and 31,000 revenue properties in 65 wards under MCC, the authorities and elected representatives have decided to open a B register like the one in BBMP to collect property tax from such properties. BBMP registers such revenue properties under B register for extending civic amenities. Deputy mayor Anwar Baig told TOI that the 25-member team which includes senior corporators, standing committee chairpersons and deputy commissioner MN Shashikumar visited BBMP and held discussions with BBMP revenue department joint commissioner Venkatachalapathy. “BBMP had introduced the B Register for revenue properties in its limits in 2006 and the initiative has been successful. We will also introduce a B register in MCC to collect property tax from revenue properties to provide basic amenities. The decision will be taken up in the coming council meeting,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mysuru-city-corporation-to-open-b-register-to-increase-tax-revenue/articleshow/88378187.cms||---

Party leaders said the event was an effort to reach out to the traders and allay their apprehensions over Goods and Services Tax. Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal, who was present at the event, hailed the contribution of the traders' community in the state's development and said the Centre was trying to simplify the tax process. “Apart from providing many facilities to the traders and entrepreneurs, simplification of GST is being done. The development that is taking place in the state is due to the cooperation of the businessmen and entrepreneurs. The community has a major contribution in running social welfare schemes through their taxes,” he said. Rajya Sabha MP from Ghaziabad Anil Agrawal, meanwhile, said that traders from 29 districts of western Uttar Pradesh were participating in the event. “It was our initiative to bring the community on a single platform and give a positive message to the community. Initially, there were some issues with GST but over the period of time people have realized that it is better,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/cooperation-of-bizmen-key-to-ups-growth-minister/articleshow/88379440.cms||---

---||Nagpur||With only 2 months for term-2 exam, CBSE schools worried about completing syllabus||Nagpur: CBSE schools are now worried about completion of course for term-2, which accounts for 50% of the syllabus, as they get just two months to do it. CBSE has changed the way board exams are conducted, starting from the current academic session. Term-1 board exams were conducted in November-December based on half of the syllabus. Term-2 may be held in March and marks of both exams will be used to tabulate final marksheet. A CBSE school principal said, “Now, term-2 will take care of the other half of syllabus but many of us are lagging behind. In a normal year, Std X and XII syllabus study is completed by December or maximum mid-January. But this year, we did not have all students joining in offline mode, which created lots of problems in conducting classes. Online classes just not have the same impact as we had expected.” For schools in city, it is a double whammy as their reopening happened late. Another CBSE principal said, “For rural areas, schools reopened months ago and they had a head-start. But since bulk of students come from city, physical attendance was not very encouraging. Still, it was better as compared to schools in city which reopened very late.” But with online classes being going on since 2020, one would assume that both teachers and students have got used to it. A senior CBSE teacher said that’s far from the truth. “Getting used to means that it has become accepted as a form of teaching. But that is different from effective teaching. I can stand in front of a camera and just ramble on and complete my syllabus well in advance. But a sincere teacher who wants to ensure that all her students understand what is being taught will have to put in extra efforts. That is very difficult in online mode,” said the teacher. Another concern for CBSE schools is regarding the biggest difference between term-1 and term-2 board exams. A principal said, “Term-1 was an MCQ format exam, while term-2 will be the traditional subjective-type format. Students are not in the habit of writing anymore and this will be a big challenge for them. To sit for two to three hours and write while racing against the clock is not something they are prepared for. Add to this the problem of course completion. It may very well result in poor performance in examination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-only-2-months-for-term-2-exam-cbse-schools-worried-about-completing-syllabus/articleshow/88378880.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The bill to amend the Representation of the People Act seeks to bring in key reforms including voluntary linkage of voter ID with Aadhaar so as to weed out bogus and duplicate entries in electoral rolls. The matter is listed in the legislative business of the Lower House for Monday. The bill also provides that this amendment will not put any voters at any disadvantage as "no application for inclusion of name in the electoral rolls shall be denied and no entries in the electoral rolls shall be deleted for inability of an individual to furnish or intimate Aadhaar number due to such sufficient cause as may be prescribed". Such people will be allowed to furnish other alternative documents as may be prescribed, according to the bill. The amendment will also provide registration of new voters on four qualifying dates in place of the existing January 1 of every year. At present, anyone turning 18 on or before January 1 will be eligible to be registered as a voter. Anyone born after January 1 will have to get enlisted only after a year. According to the bill, along with January 1, there will be three other qualifying dates - April 1, July 1 and October 1 - in every calendar year. The proposed amendments also allow the elections to become gender neutral for service voters. The amendment will help replace the word 'wife' with the word 'spouse' making the statutes "gender neutral". At present, an Armyman's wife is entitled to be enrolled as a service voter, but a woman officer's husband is not. With 'wife' being replaced by the term 'spouse', this will change.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bill-to-link-aadhaar-with-voter-card-to-be-tabled-in-ls-today/articleshow/88380737.cms||---

There’s a cold wave warning for Bhopal and17 other districts. The coldest night ever recorded in Bhopal was 3.1 degrees on December 11, 1966. Sunday was certainly the coldest in a decade as the earlier record was 4.9 degrees in December 2018. Bhopal, in the heart of the country and on the Tropic of Cancer, was nearly as cold as Shimla (3.6 degrees) this Sunday. Morning walkers all but vanished and the streets had never been as deserted on a Sunday evening since Covid lockdown was lifted. There were fewer bikers on the road as well. Laxmi Sharma, 71, says Sunday’s bone-chilling cold reminded her of what it was like on that “freezing night” of December 11, 1966. “A bonfire was the only way to beat the chill 55 years ago. It was tough to survive the 3-degree cold without heaters and geysers. We sat around a bonfire outside our house. Everything felt like freezing,” she told TOI. Night temp in city 7° below normal Day temperature in Bhopal was recorded at 20.7 degrees, 6 degrees below normal, and the night temperature of 4 degrees was 7 degrees below normal. Large parts of Madhya Pradesh recorded their lowest temperatures in a decade on Sunday. Some small towns reported temperatures close to freezing — Madiyahar (Damoh) 0.5°. Kalyanpur (Shahdol) 0.8° and Kurwai in Vidisha 1.0°. In Gwalior, the mercury plummeted to 1.8 degrees, while Naogaon, Umaria and hill station Pachmarhi recorded 2 degrees. Avari in Ashok Nagar was 1.4°C and Rampur Sainik in Sidhi 1.5 degrees. It was the coldest night in 10 years in Gwalior, which sees extremes of temperature in summer and winter. Gwalior’s lowest ever temperature was minus 0.4 degrees on December 26, 1961. Night temperatures dipped below 5 degrees in many parts of the state. There will be no respite for the next few days. Warnings of severe cold wave, cold wave, severe cold day and ground frost persist for several places in the state. The chill may intensify till December 22 when a western disturbance could bring in some warmth, says the met office. Officials of the meteorological department, Bhopal circle, said that snowfall in northern parts of the country and dry northerly cold winds have led to this dramatic plunge in temperatures. The chill will add to the Monday blues. The day may be slightly warmer at 21 degrees Celsius and the minimum may be 6 degrees, but a 16kmph wind could intensify the chill factor. There is a ‘severe cold wave’ warning in Gwalior and Chambal divisions and for Umaria, Chhatarpur, Sagar and Sehore districts. A cold wave warning has been issued for Bhopal, Jabalpur, Ujjain, Vidisha, Raisen, Rewa, Satna, Seoni, Tikamgarh, Damoh, Niwari, Rajgarh, Dhar, Ratlam, Shajapur, Neemuch and Mandsaur. Seoni, Dhar and Ujjain have been warned of a ‘severe cold day’. Umaria, Chhatarpur, Bhind, Morena, Sheopurkalan, Gwalior and Guna districts will see ground frost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/at-4-celsius-coldest-night-in-bhopal-in-decade/articleshow/88380716.cms||Ankur Sirothia

The first incident happened between10pm and11pm on Saturday near Neduntheevu (Delft Island) when 43 men on six boats from Rameswaram were arrested while 12 others on two boats from Thangachimadam were caught on Sunday. Demanding their immediate release in a letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, chief minister M K Stalin said repeated attempts by the Sri Lankan navy to prevent exercise of traditional rights by Tamil Nadu fishermen through intimidatory tactics must not be allowed to continue. Condemning the arrest, 11 mechanised boat owners associations from Rameswaram announced an indefinite strike till the arrested were returned. The six seized boats were among the nearly 570 mechanised boats and trawlers that set off from Rameswaram on Saturday morning and were supposed to return on Sunday morning. They crossed the international maritime boundary line (IMBL) and were fishing near Delft Island, when the Lankan navy chased the smaller mechanised boats. The detained men are aged 19 to 54 years. Sri Lankan navy said that 43 fishermen were arrested in a special operation in the seas southeast of Delft Island, Jaffna, by its northern naval command to check foreign fishermen poaching in their waters. The arrests were made keeping in view the livelihood of the local fishing community and sustainability of fishery resources of Sri Lanka, it said in a statement. The fishermen were taken to Myliddy harbour and handed over to the relevant authorities for legal action adhering to Covid-19 protocols, it added. The boat owners said the fishermen had gone in search of their livelihood. They would hold a mass protest at Rameswaram bus stand on Monday . Earlier, chief minister M K Stalin rang up external affairs minister S Jaishankar and urged him to take steps for immediate release of the fishermen and 73 boats in the custody of the navy. “I would also like to point out that in the year 2021 there were 19 incidents of apprehension and attack of Tamil Nadu fishermen. This is in addition to the two instances of attacks in which five fishermen were killed this year,” he added in his letter later. Tuticorin MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi also urged S Jaishankar to take up the issue with the Sri Lankan authorities immediately. PMK founder S Ramadoss said the stretch of sea on the Indian side is very small along the central and southern coast of Tamil Nadu, due to which it was natural for fishermen to cross the IMBL. AMMK founder T T V Dhinakaran, TMC(M) president G K Vasan and former AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala have also asked the Union and state governments to bring an end to the action being taken by Lankan navy against Indian fishermen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sri-lankan-arrests-55-tamil-nadu-fishermen/articleshow/88380780.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Documentary turns lens on human trade survivors’ plight||KOLKATA: “Malaise of Mankind” – a hard-hitting documentary with interviews of over 35 survivors of human trafficking in Bengal - was recently screened at the Max Mueller Bhawan. Survivors – both girls and boys - share horror stories of their physical abuse and how they are being forced to satisfy as many as 20-30 clients daily.  According to film-maker Abhijit Dasgupta, “We are accused of only highlighting bad news - but at least two survivors who are now helping rehabilitate the ‘victims’ have expressed their anguish at what happens at the ‘homes’.A very active woman police officer narrated her experience of arresting even officers associated with child trade. The Baduria case is a pointer.”  The 94-minute documentary has some chilling accounts of survivors. One who became a slave for three years before being rescued spoke about how she was asked to bathe in turmeric water if her body ached due to incessant sexual and physical abuse. “Bringing me warm turmeric water, they would say: ‘wash it. Why won’t you work? Have I paid for nothing? I paid Rs 2.5 lakh to see your pretty face, eh?’” she said on camera before breaking down while talking about how rolling pins were inserted inside her body to torture her if she refused to attend to 50-55 customers.  An interview of psychiatrist Kedar Ranjan Banerjee, who is the founder of the National Institute of Behavioural Sciences, elaborates the tremendous agony that these girls face. “They too have something called ‘season time’. All the major ‘Puja’ festivals are season time for them. During season time, they have to serve 18 to 20 men in a day. Most of it is during 6 pm and 4 am,” he said.  Agony increases, as the documentary points out, when cops sometimes are less sensitized and fail to follow the correct procedure, leading to low rates of prosecution. Aggrieved parents and survivors, who have been traumatized by this insensitivity, have also spoken on camera. “I went to a police station but didn’t know how to file an FIR. All I knew was what happened to me was wrong and I wanted to punish him. When I went to the police station, I faced stigma from the officers,” said one survivor. She revealed the trauma of being accused of returning from a “dirty place”. “I was told that it was I who had seduced the boy. Even the chair where I was sitting was snatched away. They said: ‘She will dirty the chair too! Move away. Sit outside’,” she said. The ordeal continued when she was taken to do a medical test. The survivor claimed that an officer even accused her of being a “lousy” woman who is hellbent on ruining a man’s life.  The director has also touched upon the challenge of getting compensation for the survivors and how the risk of trafficking increases due to child marriage. “The reality is shocking. I do not want to rely on statistics. It’s a shame even if one girl gets exploited. That’s why awareness and screening the film in villages is so important,” Dasgupta said.  Speaking about his other two recent documentaries, Dasgupta said “E Gari Cholche Aajab Koley” is completely based on Purna Das. It was screened at Nandan recently. “I have done two award-winning documentaries on bauls in 1975 and 1979. Purna Das was featured there. This one is completely on him. It is anecdotal but not chronological. I didn’t want him to sit at a place and talk. So, he is always on the move while being interviewed,” he said. “Naren: Intuitive Scientist” is his fifth project on Vivekananda. “Though commonly referred to as a monk, Swami Vivekananda was also an intuitive scientist. This film is part of a six-part series where I have explored Swami Vivekananda’s ideas on education, religion, commerce and business, among others. The first film follows an eccentric scientist who travels to space in search of his guru who is an intuitive scientist,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docu-turns-lens-on-human-trade-survivors-plight/articleshow/88380745.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||India||Sena compromised on Hindutva agenda for power, says Shah||PUNE: Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday took on the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP combine by accusing it of promoting the culture of corruption and touts since assuming office in Maharashtra. In the same breath, he claimed that Sena ditched BJP and compromised on the Hindutva agenda for the lure of power. Addressing a BJP workers' meeting ahead of the civic polls in Pune, Mumbai and elsewhere in Maharashtra scheduled in February 2022, Shah said: "Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena have given a new meaning to the term DBT (direct benefit transfer). While Congress has taken the 'D' for dealer, Sena has taken 'B' for broker and NCP 'T' for transfer-cut money." He described the MVA government as "an autorickshaw with three punctured tyres - all going in different directions and barely working. It just emits gas and increases pollution". The Union home minister went on to dare MVA functionaries to step down and together fight an election against BJP in Maharashtra. "I was in a power-sharing alliance talk with the Shiv Sena for the 2019 state assembly elections. But BJP was backstabbed by Sena, which was eying the CM's post," Shah claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sena-compromised-on-hindutva-agenda-for-power-says-shah/articleshow/88380821.cms||Prasad Kulkarni
---||Bhopal||IAS officer in Madhya Pradesh orders probe into onion ‘scam’, is shunted out||BHOPAL: Senior IAS officer Kalpana Srivastava, who had taken cognisance of a complaint alleging massive corruption in the horticulture department and ordered an investigation, was transferred on Saturday evening. She has not been given any new posting. An IFS officer, who was posted as commissioner at the directorate, was also transferred at the same time. It took many in the department and bureaucracy by surprise as the orders were issued on a non-working day by the government — that too barely a day or two after the state economic offences wing (EOW) registered a preliminary enquiry (PE) into the alleged onion procurement scam she was investigating. The MP Rajya Karmachari Sangh of the horticulture department has written to the chief minister, opposing the transfer. Srivastava has received several awards for excellence in her professional sphere, say sources. Srivastava had initiated an inquiry into the procurement of onion worth Rs 2 crore after a farmer, Mukesh Patidar, alleged that several norms were flouted. The procurement was made under the National Horticulture Mission. Transfer orders issued on non-working dayThe matter was reported to EOW by Mahesh Pratap Singh Bundela, a senior horticulture development officer. “It was the principal secretary who exposed this scam. Removing such an honest officer this way is uncalled for. It could be a conspiracy to hush up the matter,” Bundela told TOI. The horti directorate is in a mess, he remarked. Be it a breach in the tendering process or leak of budgets, the horticulture directorate has often been in controversy. Recently, a highly confidential document related to the budget of Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) was leaked from the directorate, forcing the higher authorities to suspend all related proceedings. MIDH is a centrally sponsored scheme. A section of officers, who are allegedly in league with some vendors, were said to be involved in the breach. “It started after a proposal for a budget of Rs 34 crore under MIDH scheme was sent to the finance department for approval. Before the finance department could decide anything, a document containing targets to be allotted to various districts and budgets got leaked,” Bundela said. The targets were leaked to vendors so that everything could be planned in advance, say sources. It is also alleged that a closeknit syndicate has been trying to mislead the horticulture department and secretariat. “Early detection of the conspiracy saved the department more embarrassment after the infamous Chinese tiller supply scam. The principal secretary stopped this from happening,” said Bundela. In August, Kalpana Srivastava had ordered an inquiry into an alleged scam in the supply of Rs 100 crore worth of China-made equipment to farmers in the tribal belts. She had asked MP Agro department to probe the matter. Under the scanner was the farm mechanisation scheme between 2017 and 2019, under which power tillers were provided to farmers in 11 tribal-dominated districts by a Chhattisgarh-based company, say sources. It was alleged that 2HP power tillers were supplied to farmers at the rate of 5HP machines. A nexus of IAS officers (now retired) and some other officers at the directorate are alleged to be involved. Not only were the tillers allegedly purchased by a select company without any tender, in many cases, the supply was only on paper. The inquiry committee may undertake a door-todoor survey of the powertiller beneficiaries to verify facts. It’s alleged that the dealers submitted bogus acknowledgement certificates of farmers and got funds credited in their direct accounts. Several tribal farmers filed complaints after which the state government decided to conduct an inquiry. The scheme was meant to increase agricultural productivity in MP through improved agricultural technologies. This case is being investigated by the Lokayukta.

BJP state president K Surendran said the murder of BJP leader and OBC Morcha state secretary Ranjith Sreenivasan in Alappuzha on Sunday was planned and executed by Popular Front of India (PFI) but added that the outfit got emboldened to commit the crime due to the help it was getting from CPM and the police. Addressing media persons in Kozhikode, he said the attack was not aimed at just at BJP and RSS leaders but part of a high level conspiracy to divide people and create communal riot. Surendran said if the police force in the state cannot prevent the atrocities conducted by PFI, then they should make it clear and inform about it to the Central government. Congress too alleged that chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has failed on all fronts. Speaking in Thiruvananthapuram, KPCC president Sudhakaran said Vijayan has been secretly supporting fundamentalist organisations like SDPI and RSS and that CPM had aligned with such forces in the last assembly election to defeat Congress. That is why he is hesitating to take action against the perpetrators of such political killings, he said. The state government has miserably failed in controlling such outfits which are a threat to the society, he said, adding that both SDP and BJP been trying create a communal divide in the state. Under the LDF rule the political killings are increasing in the state and police, whose hands have been tied by CPM leadership, have been remaining as mere spectators, said the KPCC president. State BJP president K Surendran said RSS or BJP had no role in the murder of SDPI leader K S Shan in Alappuzha on Saturday night. "The tension which prevailed there was between SDPI and CPM. BJP had not resorted to retaliation even after three of its activists were killed during the last two months in the state,” he added. He alleged that PFI has been trying to foment communal riots in the state and added that the organisation was engaged in terror related activities and widespread arms training. “ If the chief minister is sincere in acting against communal forces then he should first put an end to the alliance between SDPI and CPM in many municipalities," he said. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said in Kochi the political killings in Alappuzha were committed by those whose aim is to create a divide in the society and alleged that police have been remaining apathetic about nabbing the culprits in cases in which BJP and SDPI workers are the accused. Adding that goons are ruling the roost, he said hitherto unheard of incidents have been occurring in the state. The state government has been supporting both majority communalism and minority communalism which has led to the current situation, Satheesan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/bjp-congress-target-kerala-govt-over-law-order/articleshow/88380857.cms||---

The accused, identified as Sathya Narayanan, and his wife Pushpalatha, who allegedly abetted him, have been remanded in judicial custody. The couple, police said, own a place of worship called ‘Shirdipuram Sarva Sakthi Peedam Sai Baba Koil’ in the city. On April 12, 2016, a police officer said, the girl’s grandmother took her to the temple. She was 16. She was called inside a room to be given sacred ash, but Pushpalatha offered her a glass of juice. Two hours later, when she came to senses, she found herself naked and two men including Sathya Narayanan beside her in a similar state of undress. Later, Sathya Narayanan told her the sex act had been a pooja to remove her many sins. He showed her photos of the act and warned against informing anyone. Her grandmother took her out of the city and she was married off in 2018, the officer said, adding that her husband worked abroad. In March 2020, Sathya Narayanan managed to trace her and called her. He threatened to show her nude pictures to her husband and forced her to visit the temple where he raped her repeatedly, the officer said. In July 2020, after finding that she was pregnant, Sathya Narayanan and his wife threatened to abort the child. The woman attempted to kill herself, but she was saved by her grandmother and she delivered a baby in January this year. In November this year, the woman’s husband visited her and she told him what happened. A complaint was lodged at an allwomen police station in the city. A case was registered and after a thorough investigation, Sathya Narayanan and his wife were arrested on Saturday. They were booked under various sections of IPC including 328 (causing hurt by sedative), 376 (rape) and 506 (ii) (criminal intimidation) and section 5(f) (aggravated penetrative sexual assault), section 11(threatening with electronic images) and section 17 (abetment) of the Pocso Act. Sathya Narayanan owned a YouTube channel named ‘Shirdipuram Naana Baba’ with more than 300 videos of talks and interviews and thousands of views, the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-godman-rapes-girl-in-temple-with-wifes-help-held/articleshow/88380896.cms||---
---||Kochi||KS Shan murder: ‘There was no political tension in the area’||KOCHI: On Sunday, hundreds of SDPI (Social Democratic Party of India) activists gathered at Kalamassery medical college where the autopsy of party state secretary KS Shan, who was hacked to death at Alappuzha on Saturday night, took place. Kochi police was put on high alert since Saturday night after Shan, who was rushed to a private hospital in city, breathed his last at 11.30pm. The body was soon moved to Kalamassery medical college for autopsy proceedings which began on Sunday morning. Police personnel were deployed in areas of the district sharing border with Alappuzha, where Section 144 was declared soon after the back-to-back murders within a few hours. Police teams were deployed at main junctions as well to conduct vehicle checking to avoid further escalation. Workers of SDPI from across central Kerala had come to the hospital in vans and cars which were seen lined-up along the road leading up to the hospital. Over a thousand workers were waiting outside the gates of the medical college while a few others were waiting near the mortuary where the proceedings were going on. Party leaders, who worked closely with the slain leader for years, said that Shan was a popular figure among the public and was actively involved in charity work, including relief work, during floods. “Shan has been a part of the leadership in the party for over 12 years. Before that, we were both in the state leadership of Campus Front. He contested in legislative assembly polls and tried his luck for a Lok Sabha seat from here. He was the SDPI’s district president. He was a popular person who was widely loved by the people,” said PK Usman, state general secretary of SDPI. Usman said that even recently when rains wreaked havoc in Koottickal Shan was at the forefront to coordinate relief works here. Usman said that the murder came as a shock to them as there was no political tension in the area that could have led to such an attack. He alleged that there was a conspiracy behind the incident and claimed that the RSS was behind the attack. “At Mannancherry, where the attack happened, he has done exemplary work for growing the party. A few wards were captured in the local body by the party under his leadership. This has obviously upset other movements like BJP,” said Usman. The body of Shan was taken to Alappuzha from the medical college at 2pm. Hundreds raised slogans as the ambulance carrying the body left the hospital premises. Workers in several vehicles accompanied the ambulance. Police teams, including Ernakulam Rural ASP, accompanied the vehicles. “Attacking the state leader of a political party is unheard of in Kerala. We believe that Shan, a popular leader, was targeted to create a sense of fear across the state. SDPI is a law-abiding organization, and we would go forward with the legal fight on the issue,” said Usman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ks-shan-murder-there-was-no-political-tension-in-the-area/articleshow/88380894.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Delhi cop mastermind of Hry recruitment rackets||Chandigarh: A constable of Delhi Police, currently under suspension, seems to have emerged as the biggest name in the cheating rackets in almost all main competitive offline and online examinations for recruitment as well as for the admissions to various courses. Constable Robin Singh, a resident of Sonipat, had been arrested by Special Task Force (STF) probing the IIT paper leak case last week. After registering a case in October, the STF along with other inter-state agencies had been working on this case. Robin and his gang used to charge Rs 3 lakh to Rs 15 lakh per candidate for clearing the examinations. In his confession before the STF, Robin has also categorically admitted as to how he had paid money through his father Rajpal Singh for getting recruited in Delhi Police, sources added. “They are quite experts in all forms of cheating and would reach out to their probable targets through coaching centres and touts. Robin himself boasted as someone bigger than an MLA in Sonipat district for having a track record of helping hundreds of persons get jobs through competitive examinations,” said an STF officer. “Following his arrest, we are getting valuable information from him,” the officer added. From registration of candidates to the selection of examination centre, the gang used to provide help. There are more than 60 locations across Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh wherein they had either managed to create links with owner of the labs or had set up their own labs to help the candidates, Robin said in his confession. “Some of the labs were directly set up by me, while some other units were set up in the name of a trust or in the name of my father Rajpal Singh who is well-versed with the cash-for-job and cash-for-examination business,” Robin told cops. Notably, Haryana has a history of frauds in online examinations. There had been incidents in the past wherein the frauds were carried out by hacking main computers of the examination centres in Rohtak, Jind, Hisar and Panipat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/delhi-cop-mastermind-of-hry-recruitment-rackets/articleshow/88379182.cms||Manvir Saini

Since then, the woman was held hostage and repeatedly raped by two accused. A few days ago, she somehow accessed one of the accused's mobile phone and contacted her sister in Bhopal after which she was rescued on December 12. Investigating officer SI Arshiya Siddiqui said that the survivor is a resident of Gautam Nagar and works as a cook. She stated in her complaint that accused Majboot Singh, who hails from Vidisha district, used to provide her work in marriage ceremonies. “On October 1, Majboot took her to Intkhedi on the pretext of finding work but instead took her to his native home in Vidisha. The accused then took her to a woman’s home called ‘Amma’ in a village in Rajasthan.” said SI Siddiqui adding that subsequently, Majboot left her telling her that Amma will arrange work for her. The SI said after spending two to three days at Amma’s place, a man named Kishan, resident, took her to his home. After spending two days at Kishan’s home when she protested and said that she would like to return to Bhopal as they are not providing any work, Kishan and his father snatched her mobile and locked her in a room telling that they have bought her for Rs 80,000 from Majboot and Amma. Since then, the duo accused repeatedly raping her, police said. The survivor somehow got the mobile phone of one of the accused and she contacted her elder sister who alerted cops. The survivor’s sister had earlier filed a missing person’s complaint at Teela Jamalpura police station. On December 12, a team of Bhopal police rescued her with the help of Rajasthan police. Acting on the complaint a case of rape, human trafficking, kidnapping and wrongful confinement was registered against four accused including the woman. “All the accused are on the run,” added SI Siddiqui.

With the intention of not giving compensation, the government is making an excuse that it has not yet received the report from the DC offices, Selja added. “As many as 1,05,828 farmers have applied for compensation for the damage of Kharif crop with the agriculture department. These include those farmers whose crop got damaged due to rain and hailstorm,” said Selja. The crops of these farmers have either been completely destroyed or the production has decreased. She said in order to avoid protest by farmers, the state government has ordered a special girdawari under the pressure of the opposition, but its full report has not reached the government till now, she added. She alleged that due to the anti-farmer attitude of the government, the report is lying on the tables of the officers in the districts. The government is not serious about giving compensation, so it is avoiding getting these reports at the headquarters. Because, the government does not want to pay the compensation amount to the farmers in any case, the HPCC chief said. She said this time the farmers of Hisar, Rewari, Fatehabad, Charkhi Dadri, Bhiwani, Sirsa, Jhajjar, Mahendragarh, Jind districts suffered the most.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/selja-attacks-state-govt-over-farmer-aid/articleshow/88379188.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Banned insecticide being used to poison waterholes, kill tigers, says petition in Madhya Pradesh HC||BHOPAL: Endosulfan, an insecticide, is being used to kill tigers and other wildlife in Madhya Pradesh, say activists who have moved an intervening application in high court, seeking implementation of NTCA guidelines. The petition says waterholes are being poisoned and wild animals are falling victim for their organs. The insecticide is being phased out globally, but not fast enough. “A recent investigation has found that a tigress and two cubs died due to poisoning of waterholes and the poison used was the dangerous ‘endosulfan’. It’s banned globally, but its continued use here is a cause of alarm because of the threat it poses to human health, wildlife and the environment. After the tigers are killed, the poachers remove their intestines and wash out other organs, which are then smuggled in the world market,” said advocate Aditya Sanghi, who has filed the petition for social activist Ajay Dubey. The application seeks directives for the constitution of a special tiger protection force (STPF) in MP by implementing NTCA guidelines as “more and more tigers are being killed using rare poisons and electric wires”. Sanghi said the petition is pending since 2016 but has assumed significance as the poaching of tigers and other wild animals has “increased in the past year”. “It is on record that 36 tiger deaths have been reported in Madhya Pradesh. Often, without a proper investigation, the authorities declare that the deaths were due to infighting. The fact is that poachers are involved in poisoning wildlife in the core area and buffer zones of tiger reserves,” he said. Many farmhouses and resorts have been constructed adjacent to the boundary of the core areas of national parks in Madhya Pradesh, he added, pointing out that this is not permissible under the law. According to reports received from the State Forensic Science Laboratory, Sagar, a tigress, two cubs and three deer have died in Pench Tiger Reserve due to “organochloro” insecticides named “endosulfan”. Opening up buffer, core areas to tourism led to rise in tiger poaching, says petitionIn Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, an investigation revealed that electrocution is turning out to be a frequent method to kill tigers but nothing has been done to stop this, Sanghi said. “After the buffer areas were opened to the public, the authorities recommended creating a post of deputy director-buffer but nothing has happened on that count or to control poaching activities in the state. In fact, a highlevel committee has recommended deploying a Special Tiger Protection Force in Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, considering the poaching threat perspective. Unfortunately, more than seven years have passed since NTCA recommended these measures but nothing has happened yet,” says the petition. Opening up the buffer and core areas to tourism has led to a rise in poaching of tigers, the petition suggests. “Unfortunately poaching is rampant and increasing day by day, but for reasons difficult to understand, the authorities are just interested in tourism because it creates funds,” it adds. Dubey has prayed in his petition that wildlife must be protected at any cost and tourism should not be the primary objective. He seeks a direction to the state authorities to coordinate with NTCA and immediately implement its recommendations.

A Nandal-gotra woman of 19 from Rohtak’s Lakhan Majra had married into Chahal-dominated Kamach Khera. The Chahals refused to accept the marriage because the bride’s grandmother is from the adjoining Chahal village of Devrar, by which relations, the Chahals said the bride was like their granddaughter and the community didn’t allow marriages within gotra, an old system to preserve the gene pool and avoid the problems of interbreeding. Mange Ram Khokhar of the affected family from Devrar said: “The Khokhars have five houses in Devrar and seven in Kamach Khera. The Chahals boycotted us on the pretext that the bride’s grandmother was from Devrar. Being dominant, the Chahals have barred us from everything. Our contract farming agreements were cancelled, the dairy stopped giving us milk, the barbers and shopkeepers won’t entertain us, and we can’t take our cattle to the village pond. We will approach the Jind deputy commissioner on Monday."

A team of Hazratganj police nabbed the fraudster, identified as Satyen Dhanji Sanwala, from Mumbai. He allegedly got a bank account opened in the name of a scholarship being provided by the department to the needy students back in 2014. Police investigator, Mahesh Shukla said a girl of Rajajipuram applied for scholarship under the pilot scheme of the state government for students of SC/ST category in 2014. "But the girl did not get the scholarship and so she had to drop her education. During that period, a bank account was opened in Bulandshahar district in the name of the same girl and a cash of over Rs 27 lakh was transferred in the fake account in her name. The amount was later transferred in the bank account of the accused in Maharashtra," Shukla said. He said the girl in whose name the bank account was opened and the accused had no link. His act came to the fore after the department conducted an audit. The case was finally lodged by joint director, Social Welfare Directorate, PK Tripathi at Hazratganj. Shukla also said that involvement of those in the department could not be ruled out and the accused will be questioned on as to how he got the details of the girl applicant. Satyen Dhanji was also jailed for Rs 4 crore fraud with a bank in Mumbai in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-7-years-on-man-held-for-ra-27-lakh-scam/articleshow/88381029.cms||---

They were identified as: Chethan Gowda, president, Kannada Ranadheera Pade; Gurudeva Narayan Kumar, president, central committee of Akhila Karnataka Kannada Chaluvali and their associates Varun, Naveen Gowda, Vinod, Yogesh and Chethan Kumar. MN Anucheth, the deputy commissioner of police (central), said the miscreants smeared black paint on the statue. Sadashivanagar police registered an FIR and multiple teams have been formed to trace and nab other suspects. “Based on clues, we arrested five people on Saturday and two more on Sunday. Efforts are on to nab others involved in the offence,” said Anucheth. Additional forces Police say the incident occurred around 12.30am on Friday. On Friday morning, passersby alerted police, who cleaned the statue and deployed additional personnel to thwart a possible backlash. Police say the suspects confessed to their crime and said they were angry about some Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) activists setting a Kannada flag afire in Maharashtra last week. Preliminary investigation revealed a gang of 13 people arrived in a car, two autorickshaws and a bike to the spot. They had hatched the plan four days earlier. Initially, the gang had zeroed in on another statue of Shivaji near Town Hall, but finally decided on the statue near Sankey Tank. They recced the area on Monday and left a ladder near the statue on Tuesday. They had planned to deface the statue on Wednesday night, but left after finding police near the spot. They finally succeeded on Thursday-Friday night||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/7-arrested-for-defacing-shivaji-statue-in-bengaluru/articleshow/88381030.cms||---

I-T dept's there to help you||NEW DELHI: A few days ago, when some social media users complained of problems in filing returns due to "disk error", the tax department moved quickly and approached them. With the problem persisting, it got its team to hold a video call with some of the taxpayers to resolve the issue. This was not the first time that such a strategy has been used - it is being done regularly. "We get around 9,000 calls daily on our call centre on various issues. We are also using social media to reach out to those who do not call us," explained an officer. With Infosys plugging several gaps that were noticed when the new portal was rolled out earlier this year, the department is making every possible effort to ensure a glitch-free filing experience. It has beefed up its war room, which is set to be a 24x7 effort, with 75-100 members - from the tax departments and teams representing hardware and application vendors - available to resolve issues at the earliest. The number this year is significantly more than the 30-35 people who are on the job usually, said a senior officer. With the filing deadline approaching soon, the systems wing of the department is also closely coordinating with other partners such as UIDAI, GSTN, NSDL and banks to ensure that there is no downtime and the filing process is smooth. While officials said there is no plan to extend the deadline beyond December 31, the department is seeking to answer several of the FAQs over the next few days through video modules. "People have queries and this year, due to Annual Information System, more data is available to them. We will help with the whole filing process," explained an official, adding that the idea is to get taxpayers to file their returns well in time to beat the rush seen during the last few days. Often, taxpayers approach the call centre to get their password or the return form they should use on the last day. "If you do it so late, we may have capacity issues in resolving it quickly. So, it's best to do all that now and file at the earliest," the officer said.

The valuation is a testimony to underserved businesses latching onto newer payment solutions to reduce friction in B2B payments. This is one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian unicorn. Razorpay was valued at $1 billion in October last year, and at $3 billion in April. The financial technology venture has raised $741.5 million to date. The latest funding was co-led by Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital and TCV. Existing investors Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, GIC and Y Combinator also participated. Harshil Mathur, CEO and co-founder of Razorpay, said the funds would be deployed to create a full-stack financial ecosystem for businesses. It will further scale up its business banking suite, RazorpayX, which equips businesses to handle compliance requirements and operations. RazorpayX recently added a tax payment suite, a platform for tax payments needs of small businesses, be it TDS, GST, TCS or advance tax. The RazorpayX dashboard provides businesses a single, transparent view of all disbursals for seamless collaboration between finance teams, external accountants, and business owners. “We want to get to a point where if you want to start a business tomorrow and you come to Razorpay, we want to take care of everything related to managing financials seamlessly–banking, payments, paying salaries, tax payments, credit. And as businesses scale up, we will offer them a larger credit line. We want businesses to spend less time managing compliance and operations and invest more time in creating new products, building on new ideas and thinking scale We also plan to launch payment solutions for import/export services and that’s the roadmap for early next year,” Mathur said. The plan is also to expand into geographies like South East Asia, acquire B2B SaaS companies, and hire 600 people next year, including in data science, AI and cloud roles. Mathur had recently told TOI that the company had clocked total payment volume (TPV) of $60 billion in 2021, an over 300% year-on-year growth for the second year in a row. Buoyed by this performance, the company is targeting $90 billion in TPV for 2022. Razorpay powers more than 5% of IMPS transactions on the disbursement side. It powers payments for over 8 million businesses in India including Facebook, Ola, Zomato, Swiggy, Cred, Muthoot Finance, and Indian Oil, and is on track to reach 10 million businesses by 2022. A new solution, Magic Checkout, automatically prefills information at all stores within the Magic Checkout network for all current and future purchases. This, Mathur said, has reduced the dropout at the payment stage by 40%-50%, and shoppers are able to checkout 50% faster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/razorpays-valuation-up-7x-at-7-5bn-in-just-1-year/articleshow/88381114.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

Under the project, a total of 207.95 million litres daily (MLD) water from Ganga will be supplied to parts of Greater Noida by early next year. According to GNIDA, in the first phase, 125 MLD of Ganga water will be supplied to the populated sectors, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Pi 3 among others, and the trials for the same are likely to commence soon. In the absence of Ganga water supply, residents were supplied treated water from underground Ranney and tube wells. “Recently, we had encountered a problem in laying the pipeline from under the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) as a big stone had blocked the path just three metres before its connecting point to the stretch. However, with the concurrence of the NHAI, the authority completed work on the pipeline through a trenchless method,” a GNIDA official said, adding that senior manager Jal and his team, led by ACEO Amandeep Duli, had put up tents at the site and worked nonstop to complete the task. “The work to connect the pipeline up to Greater Noida has now been completed,” Duli said. According to officials, while the testing of water from Dehra to Bishara was completed earlier, further testing could not be done due to the stone blocking the pipeline path. Now, officials said, the authority will resume the testing on the remaining stretch and the supply to Greater Noida areas will commence in early 2022. Over 15 yrs delay Originally mooted in 2005, the Authority’s Ganga water project did not pick up steam till 2016. Work on the Rs 800-crore project was expedited from 2017 after the deadline to supply Ganga water to Greater Noida areas was set for 2019. However, land disputes with forest and irrigation departments, NTPC and farmers as well as delays in obtaining a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Indian Oil Corporation Limited and GAIL delayed the project. The issues were finally resolved in October 2021 following the intervention of GNIDA CEO Narendra Bhooshan, who held several rounds of talks with the officials concerned to procure the necessary NOCs. While monsoon showers delayed the work in October, the final clog in the wheel was removed on Saturday with the removal of the stone blocking the pipeline path. “All the hurdles in the Ganga water project for Greater Noida have been removed. The pipeline linking the Ganga Canal to Greater Noida has been completed. Efforts will be made to bring Ganga water to the homes of Greater Noida residents very soon, beginning the first phase from early 2022,” Bhooshan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/2-yrs-late-ganga-water-pipeline-now-ready/articleshow/88379392.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Language row, anti-conversion bill likely to take centre stage||BELAGAVI: The second week of the winter session of the legislature may be a stormy one, with Congress likely to continue to press for the resignation of urban development minister Byrathi Basavaraj over the land-grab case and BJP attempting to shift focus to the anti-conversion bill. The bill is likely to be passed by the cabinet at a meeting on Monday, and it will be introduced in the assembly in a day or two. However, a debate on the language row, which has seen violent clashes between pro-Kannada organisations and members of Maharashtra Ekikarna Samiti (MES) is likely to take centre stage when the session resumes on Monday. The clashes have been condemned by members across political lines and the issue is likely to see a united response from all outfits. “Insulting any of our great national leaders in the name of language politics is a disservice to their nationalistic spirit and will not be tolerated,” said chief minister Basavaraj Bommai. “Under no circumstances will we let miscreants disrupt law and order in Karnataka.” The JD (S) is set to play a more active role on the floor of the house as party leader and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy is expected to attend the session from Tuesday. He had skipped the entire first week. While JD(S) functionaries have said they will oppose the anti-conversion bill, the party has often changed tack in the past. A senior functionary has admitted that its stand is not final, even while Congress is accusing it of having a tacit understanding with the BJP. “Our stand, so far, is to oppose the anti-conversion bill, but we will take a final decision on Tuesday when Kumaraswamy chairs the legislative party meeting,” said Bandeppa Kashempur, JD(S) deputy floor leader in the assembly. While the bill will sail through the assembly, BJP lacks a majority in the legislative council and needs the support of the JD(S). Speculation is rife that BJP is urging the JD(S) to help pass the bill by staging a walkout. “We are confident of the passage of the bill in both houses. We have our own strategy for the council,” said Araga Jnanendra, home minister. Congress plans to raise other significant issues such as the 40% kickback charge leveled by contractors, the bitcoin scam and development of North Karnataka. However, JD(S) has accused Congress of waylaying proceedings by sticking to its demand of Byrathi’s resignation. On Friday, Congress members had rushed into the well of the assembly, seeking Byrathi’s resignation before the house was adjourned early. “It is not proper for Congress to hold the house to ransom and not allow the government to reply to the debate on the rain havoc. We are against such moves,” said Kashempur. ‘Won’t tolerate this’Former chief minister BS Yediyurappa said the unrest in Belagavi will be discussed in the legislature when the winter session resumes on Monday. “It’s an unfortunate incident,” Yediyurappa said. “A deliberate attempt was made to create unrest in the border district. We will not tolerate such incidents. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and home minister Araga Jnanendra have taken necessary action to arrest the accused. We will discuss this matter elaborately in the house on Monday and try to find a solution to avoid these kinds of incidents in future.”  KS Eshwarappa, RDPR minister, said: “Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackery should stop blaming Kannadigas. The border dispute was resolved long ago with the Mahajan Commission report. We will raise this issue with PM Modi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-language-row-anti-conversion-bill-likely-to-take-centre-stage/articleshow/88381107.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Revamp of stretches near Delhi-Jaipur highway starts||GURUGRAM: The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has initiated annual road repairs in several sectors located adjacent to the Delhi-Jaipur carriageway of the National Highway 48 (NH48). The stretches, located in Sectors 45, 46, 51, 52, 45, 52, 47 and 49, fall on the left of the NH48 and house several commercial spaces, office buildings, hospitals and gated residential complexes and see high traffic footfall daily. “As part of the maintenance, we will be filling up the potholes using granular sub-base and web mix macadam, and the patches will be repaired using dense bituminous macadam or bituminous concrete. In addition, we will be repairing the footpaths to facilitate pedestrian movement and painting the curbstones. Road markings will also be repaired wherever they are damaged,” a senior GMDA official said. The entire project is expected to cost Rs 1.34 crore. A contractor, officials said, has been hired for a period of 12 months who will have a defect liability for another six months. “We had sought public feedback on the project and floated tenders for it in June. While the work finally started on November 23, it has been impacted by the current ban on construction activities due to pollution. But we hope to finish the work soon and make the commute for people easier along these stretches,” the official said. This is the second road repair project in the city that the GMDA has initiated in the last month. Prior to this, on November 18, the authority had started work for special repairs on a stretch from a toll gate on National Highway 48 (NH48) to the Kapashera border. Several other road repair projects are also in the pipeline, including special repair of the dividing road of Sectors 86 and 90. Other key stretches that are likely to undergo repairs in the coming months include the dividing roads of Sectors 58 and 59, 58 and 61, 60 and 61, 64 and 65, as well as 66 and 67. The five-kilometre-long stretch between IMT Manesar and Pataudi Road, similarly, will also see patchwork.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/revamp-of-stretches-near-delhi-jaipur-highway-starts/articleshow/88378813.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||Gurgaon||Facelift on cards for road linking Sohna Chowk and DDR Chowk||Gurgaon: Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) plans to overlay, repair and revamp the stretch between Sohna Chowk and DDR Chowk on Jail Road by the second half of 2022. The project will cost nearly Rs 91.21 lakh and take four months to complete, according to GMDA. “The project will include repair, overlay, and revamp of the road, as well as installation of reflective road studs, solar cat eyes, and mandatory and informatory signboards,” said a senior GMDA official who did not want to be named. For now, GMDA has floated tenders for the work. The project, according to GMDA, also includes a defect liability cum maintenance period of three years. “We have floated tenders, inviting bids through e-tendering. Once the project gets allotted, work will begin on the ground,” said the official. The approximately 800 metres long stretch is in Old Gurgaon, connecting several prominent government offices, including the office of the police commissioner, the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitaran Nigam (DHBVN) office, and the Public Works Department (PWD) office. In addition, the area houses the Nehru Stadium, Sadar Bazar, Jama Masjid, several hotels, shops, and market complexes. The Civil Hospital is also close. Commuters, who frequent the area, welcomed the plan. “There is no doubt that not just this stretch but several others in this part of Gurgaon need repairs. The number of people visiting the masjid, Sadar Bazar and all the government offices in the area is huge. They all tend to frequent this road, so its up-gradation would be a massive relief,” said Rakesh Sharma, who works at a shop near Nehru Stadium. However, commuters are also apprehensive of GMDA’s ability to complete the project within the stipulated period. “My only concern is the extent to which commuters will get affected while the work is on and how much time it will take to complete it. Authorities here say four months but then take a year to complete the work. If that happens in this case, the whole plan may backfire and exacerbate the problems of commuters here,” Sharma added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/facelift-on-cards-for-road-linking-sohna-chowk-and-ddr-chowk/articleshow/88378823.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||Noida||Road rage: 2 held for attack on couple||Noida: Two youths were arrested for allegedly attacking a couple and their neighbours after an argument over rash driving in Sector 119 on Saturday. The accused have been identified as Amit Kumar (26), and his brother Vikas Kumar (28), residents of Parthala village. On Saturday afternoon, a 32-year-old woman from Eldeco Aamantran had left her society in her car when a biker brushed past against the vehicle near Millennium School. This led to an argument between the woman and the biker, Devender Kumar (62). Vivek Trivedi, the SHO of Phase 3 police station, said Kumar allegedly abused the woman and attacker her. While the woman called her husband, Kumar dialled his sons. “The woman’s husband arrived with two neighbours and the man’s son’s to reached the spot. One of the youths hit the husband’s friend with a rod in the head and also attacked the couple. The friend received a fracture in the head and had to be admitted to a hospital,” Trivedi said. After the woman, a consultant at a private firm, lodged a complaint, a case was registered against unknown persons under sections 279 (rash driving), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 354 (assault of criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. “We have arrested the two brothers involved in the attack. They were remanded in judicial custody. We have also launched a search for Devendra Kumar,” the SHO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/road-rage-2-held-for-attack-on-couple/articleshow/88379425.cms||---

One of the suspects was working at a factory in IMT Manesar. Police recovered stolen goods worth Rs 4 lakh from their possession. The suspects were identified as Chhotu Kumar from Bihar, Praveen Kumar from Delhi and Vijaypal alias Pradeep from Uttar Pradesh. Vijapal worked at the company and he along with his accomplices stole goods from the factory worth lakhs, police said. On the intervening night of December 8 and 9, the three accused broke into the factory and made away with iron channels, copper cables, imported motors of 60 horsepower along with other items. “Vijaypal was familiar with the company and aware about the location of the goods and the exit route,” said ACP (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan. The suspects were identified with the help of CCTV footage installed at the entry gate and other areas of the factory. Vijaypal, who used to work with the company, was identified by his employer. After the theft, Vijaypal stopped coming to office and he became one of the suspects. The suspects, according to police, used to sell stolen items to scrap dealers and divide the money among themselves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/3-held-for-stealing-motor-parts-from-manesar-factory/articleshow/88378839.cms||---

How is ReNew Power doing on the ground?It has been quite a good year for us. We crossed 7.4GW commissioned capacity - adding 1.8GW, of which 1.5GW is organic. We will end (FY22) with 8.2GW. This will be the largest capacity addition in a single year by anybody, certainly from an organic standpoint. Compared to 5.6GW at the start of the year, our capacity will rise by around 45%. What's the expected rollout for next year?Some capacities that were to be added last year got pushed to this year because of Covid. Next year (FY23), we will have a total project pipeline of 10.3GW. So, over and above the 8.2GW, we have another 2.1GW. Most of that will be getting commissioned over FY23. Any acquisition will be over and above that. How is the trend of states arm-twisting developers to renegotiate tariffs affecting the sector? The moment any contract is not honoured in any sector by either of the two parties, it is seen as extremely negative for the entire business environment across any sector and across India as a whole. Our (renewable energy industry's) legal position is very strong: No one can randomly cancel any PPA (power purchase agreement)...I am not worried about it in the most fundamental sense, but it still can cause some degree of disruption in the market. The PPA is a sacrosanct document. Please note that there is a lot of legal precedence for enforcement of contracts. Do investors, especially from overseas, understand this? They do understand at an intellectual level, but nobody would want this kind of disruption to happen. All these things make the sentiment worse from a future investment point of view. It increases your risk premium. What's your view on the rising cost of solar gear and supply chain issues? Basic customs duty will also come in next year and raise costs further...  At Rs 2.50 a unit, solar is still very cheap. There is no real problem for the sector because our product (solar power) will be cheaper than anything else out there. There is enough room within solar pricing today to absorb all of these costs and still be quite attractive to end-buyers. If people have bid aggressive numbers, they will suffer because they will get much lower returns than expected. There is a sense in the industry that many developers are aggressively offering unviable tariffs to grab projects... How does it affect ReNew or any other serious player?Our view is that, given the number of serious bidders, you should now create some barriers so only serious bidders come in. Do you also plan to list in India?We have $1 billion of cash, robust cash flow generation and we are all set by 2025 to get to 18GW of commissioned capacity.  What about your manufacturing plans?We are looking at solar cells and modules and we are putting up a 2GW cell and module plant with a view to supplying to ourselves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/breaking-contracts-hits-biz-sentiment/articleshow/88381155.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||Gurgaon||MCG to probe ‘Rs 50cr’ C&D waste fraud by pvt firm||Gurgaon: A four-member committee has been formed by the municipal commissioner to probe alleged irregularities in the collection, transportation and dumping of construction and demolition (C&D) waste by a private firm hired by the civic body in 2019. It has been alleged that the corruption, which could be “worth Rs 50 crore”, involves senior MCG officials. As part of its probe, the committee will have to find out if an approval had been taken from the government or any other competent authority before handing out the work to the private firm and whether bills submitted by the agency to MCG were justified or not. The company will also have to explain why C&D waste can still be found along various roads of the city. Officials said the probe panel was formed by commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja following directions from the urban local bodies department. The alleged irregularities came to light after an RTI activist lodged a complaint, accusing former and current officials of MCG of being hand-in-glove with the private firm in approving inflated bills. The probe committee has in it Satish Yadav, joint commissioner (3); Thakur Lal Sharma, chief engineer; Vijay Kumar, chief accounts officer; and Savita Choudhry, district attorney. They will have to prepare a report in 10 days. “The executive engineer-SBM will provide the necessary documents and the records thereto to the aforementioned committee. The committee shall examine all aspects of the matter and submit a detailed report within 10 days,” read the order issued by Ahuja. The MCG commissioner did not respond to repeated calls and messages on the magnitude of the alleged corruption. The RTI activist has, however, alleged that the work of the private firm was not monitored by the citizen supervisory committee, and it wrongly showed the dumping sites in zones 1 and 2 when they should have been either the Basai waste plant or any other site in zones 3 and 4. It was also alleged that the company wrongly showed 1,000 entries of vehicles for collecting and transporting C&D waste. None of these vehicles, as mentioned in the entry records, had a Haryana registration but were all from Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, according to the complaint. The activist alleged that not only were the entries of vehicles “forged”, but the weight of the waste they carried was also inflated to manipulate the bills. “A majority of these vehicles are of Rajasthan or Uttar Pradesh according to the registration numbers. By showing forged entries and paying the same by MCG, the company has created a record of largest collection of C&D Waste in India by this C&D Waste contractor collecting more waste per day than garbage collection per day,” the complaint submitted in September read. A copy was also sent to the chief minister’s office. The activist also alleged that at an MCG meeting in February last year, senior officials said there was no need to enter invoices in the measurement book and that the bills submitted by the private firm were sufficient to make payments. According to the complaint, no measurement slip was submitted for 14 months in 2020 and 2021, which included the lockdown period. An MCG official, however, dubbed the allegations baseless. “There are GPS records of the vehicles carrying C&D waste, verified slips of the weighing scale and all other data that needs to be maintained. The papers will be submitted during the probe,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mcg-to-probe-rs-50cr-cd-waste-fraud-by-pvt-firm/articleshow/88378860.cms||Vishakha Chaman
---||Madurai||Madurai as Silicon Valley: City has begun attracting a growing number of tech firms||More and more tech firms from Chennai and Bengaluru have been setting up offices in Madurai in the past one year. What attracts them are operating costs 20% lower than in other tier-2 towns such as Coimbatore and local talent that’s happy to stay on once hired. The region’s evangelists also report an increased interest among professionals from Madurai working in Chennai and Bengaluru to return home and start their own ventures. Engineering and MBA institutes such as Thiagarajar College of Engineering and MEPCO (Sivakasi) are nurseries of talent that they hope to tap into. Chennai-based tech startup GoFrugal recently launched a 15,000 sqft office in Madurai employing 90 people and plans to hire 60 more. GoFrugal founder Kumar Vembu says they wanted to be closer to south TN’s booming business hub. HR tech firm Neeyamo, which has a centre at an Elcot IT park in Madurai, recently opened a 65,000 sqft office and plans to hire around 1,200 staff in the year ahead. “We create cutting-edge products here, same as in Chennai or Silicon Valley. It’s not just data entry or sweatshop work,” says its CEO, Rangarajan Seshadri. “We pay them well enough to stop them from migrating to metros, but we don’t over pay to spoil the market dynamics,” he adds. However, the region’s entrepreneurs say luring investors and clients to the region is an uphill task given poor international air connectivity and public perception of “Madurai’s notoriety”. Madurai also suffers from lack of visibility. Not many know of Great Innovus, for instance, launched by serial entrepreneur Kalyana Sundaram. He shunned a US job to build numerous tech startups (one of whose IPs was acquired by Blackberry) from the garage of his home. The IT services firm now serves more than 300 global clients including Honeywell, BestBuy and L&T with a team of around 150. “I considered different cities such as Chennai and Bengaluru to start up, but the traffic put me off. I can travel anywhere in Madurai in 10 minutes,” says Kalyana Sundaram. “We may not have IITs and NITs, but the tier-2 colleges nurture great talent that can be molded to our needs,” he adds. While the city has long hosted conventional business firms such as Madura Coats, Thiagarajar Mills and the TVS Group, the emergence of IT firms HCL Tech and Honeywell in the mid-2000s as large employers sowed the seeds for tech proliferation. Government agencies kept pace with Elcot setting up two IT parks at Vadapalanji and Ilanthaikulam. In addition, the Gangaikondan IT park in Tirunelveli is a stone’s throw away. HCL Tech currently employs 5,400 people and the Madurai centre serves global customers in Cloud Native, .Net, Full Stack, and other modern tech. Srimathi Shivashankar, corporate VP, HCL Technologies, says they will continue to hire engineers and other talent in the city. For first-time tech entrepreneurs, the city has the technology business incubator (TBI) of Thiagarajar College. Established in 2014, TBI currently hosts 25 tech startups across domains. S Balaji, faculty coordinator, says 18 of these startups were incubated after Covid-19 and that there has been a rise in inquiries from techies who wish to return to Madurai. Sivarajah Ramanathan, founder of Nativelead Foundation, who engages with policymakers, says Madurai needs an image makeover. “More governmentbacked centres of excellence in traditional strengths such as agri tech and in emerging areas will help,” he adds. Ebenezer Daniel, founder of techpowered two-wheeler financier Orange Retail and a native of the region, says “the talent here has the right attitude and a zeal to learn new skills and excel.” But Great Innovus’ Sundaram says finding talent in niche areas is a pain point. “Raising funds is also tricky since most investors ask us to shift to Chennai,” he adds, noting that real estate prices today almost equal Coimbatore’s. I A S Balamurugan, co-founder of Anicut Capital, says Madurai may have missed out on new-age digital ventures but that’s changing. “It is more of a reputation management issue and a question of breaking the shackles,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-as-silicon-valley/articleshow/88381149.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Business||Asian IPO spree may slacken after best year||After a bumper year of stock listings, Asian companies may find it hard to repeat the success in 2022 given the prospect of rising interest rates and China's tightening grip on Big Tech. Thanks to a blistering first half amid a global boom, initial public offerings (IPOs) in the region have reached $190 billion so far this year, already a record and up 31% from the whole of 2020. But the momentum has weakened notably in recent months as Beijing escalated a regulatory assault on private enterprise, putting major deals on hold and injecting uncertainties into next year. Bankers say they expect Asia's IPO market to be less frenzied and more balanced in 2022, as higher inflation erodes valuations of tech firms and tighter US monetary policy reduces the supply of idle cash. The listings landscape may also look more diverse, with South Korea and India charging ahead and industries from clean energy to financial services filling the void left by once-dominant Chinese tech. "Markets in 2022 are going to face a more normalised environment," said William Smiley, co-head of equity capital markets at Goldman Sachs in Asia ex-Japan. "Withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimulus, coupled with expectations for higher inflation may challenge risk assets, including equity markets." Beijing's tight scrutiny of its tech firms, on issues ranging from data security to a loophole long used by companies to list overseas, also is expected to continue to slow the pace of fundraising from the sector. This, plus the secondary market's sluggish performance, have pushed Hong Kong, a popular destination for Chinese tech firms, out of the world's top three listing venues. Several companies, from snack producer Weilong Delicious to Apple's supplier Biel Crystal, have pushed back share offerings in the city, a development set to make the last three months of this year the weakest fourth quarter since 2018 for Asian IPOs. Picking up the slack could be Chinese firms not affected by Beijing's regulatory clampdown or beneficiaries of the nation's development priorities, including new energy providers and EV makers. The subdued presence of Chinese tech will also help make the region's IPO pipeline geographically more balanced, as South Korea, India and southeast Asia maintain a busy issuance calendar. Companies in India, South Korea and Indonesia have all raised record amounts via first-time share sales this year. And there's more to come: Mega deals in the works include LG Energy Solution's $10.8-billion IPO in Seoul and LIC's offering with a valuation as high as $131 billion. Despite expectations for weaker supply from Chinese tech firms as first-time share sellers, an increased number of their US-traded peers will likely seek listings in Hong Kong or Shanghai, a phenomenon known as 'homecoming'. The trend is expected to accelerate amid growing threats from the US to delist Chinese firms there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/asian-ipo-spree-may-slacken-after-best-year/articleshow/88381172.cms||---
---||Business||Unpaid listing fee is not operational debt: NCLAT||MUMBAI: Unpaid listing fees by a publicly traded company to a stock exchange is a 'regulatory due' and not an 'operational debt' under insolvency proceedings, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) said recently. The appellate body's order came in a case between the BSE and Gujarat-based KCCL Plastic, which had not paid listing fees to the bourse since fiscal 2014. Listing fees come under the ambit of 'regulatory dues', which markets regulator Sebi is entitled to recover. The defaulting company, being an entity registered under Sebi, has an obligation to follow the norms prescribed by the regulator for the recovery of its dues, the NCLAT said in its order. "The Insolvency Law Committee suggests that regulatory dues are not to be recovered under 'operational debt'," a two-member NCLAT bench said. The appellate body also upheld the order passed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on December 31, 2020, which had dismissed BSE's plea to initiate insolvency proceedings against KCCL Plastic. "We have carefully examined the pleadings of the case and came to the conclusion that no interference is required in the impugned order. Hence, the impugned order dated December 31, 2020, passed by NCLT - Ahmedabad bench, is hereby affirmed. The appeal is dismissed," said the NCLAT. Ahmedabad-based KCCL Plastic was listed on the BSE on October 27, 1993 and, according to the listing agreement, it had to pay an annual listing fee (ALF) on or before April 30 every year.

Sources said the consortium of banks, led by SBI, agreed to cut the interest rate early this month after a series of negotiations with FCI officials. Both FCI and food ministry's interest outgo for cash credit is around Rs 7,000 crore annually. These banks provide around Rs 1.6-lakh-crore cash credit annually for procurement of foodgrain to FCI and state government entities, which purchase on behalf of the Centre, which bears the entire interest burden. "The new rate effective January 1 will be reduced to 6.68% from 7.73%," said an officer. While the cash credit limit for FCI is around Rs 9,500 crore, it's about Rs 1.5 lakh crore for state government agencies with a guarantee from the Centre. Sources said that the food-credit consortium decided that the pricing for the FCI cash credit limit would be average of one month of MCLR of top five lenders instead of the earlier norm of interest rate average of three months' MCLR of top five banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rate-cut-to-pare-food-subsidy-bill/articleshow/88381187.cms||Dipak K Dash

The filing was made after the antitrust watchdog started reviewing allegations that Apple hurts competition by forcing app developers to use its proprietary system, which can charge commissions of up to 30% on in-app purchases. Apple denied the allegations in its filing to the CCI and stressed that its market share in India is an "insignificant" 0-5%, while Google commands 90-100% as its Android operating system (OS) powers most other smartphones. "Apple is not dominant in the Indian market ... Without dominance, there can be no abuse," Apple said in the submission dated November 16, which was signed by its chief compliance officer Kyle Andeer. Apple and the CCI did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Google declined to comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/apple-asks-cci-to-drop-app-market-case-cites-low-share/articleshow/88381197.cms||---

Despite several complaints, local residents claim, the civic authorities have not initiated any corrective measures. The land, which was supposed to be developed into a multiplex and was auctioned by the HUDA (now HSVP) in 2007 to a former state cabinet minister, who had constructed two storeys and the roof but later surrender the land in 2009. The dense undergrowth and stagnant sewage or rainwater now pose major safety and health concerns for the local residents, Neeru Yadav, RWA president sector 23 A east zone said. “The abandoned building has also become a den of anti-social elements. We have alerted the police several times about the ongoing criminal activities. Illegal vendors have also mushroomed in this area. We fail to understand why the HSVP can’t auction this land,” Yadav said. Bhawani Shankar Tripathi, a resident of the sector, said the commercial land is located in of the prime areas of the city and was worth crores. “If HSVP auctions this land, then it would not only come as a relief for residents but add to the body’s revenue. At least, they should protect their own land so that it does not become a public health and safety hazard,” he said. When contacted, estate officer-1 Vikas Dhanda said they are aware of the matter. “This site is earmarked for a hotel or cinema hall. Now, this land has become a property of HSVP and we are soon going to auction it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/once-a-site-for-multiplex-now-a-garbage-dump-and-criminals-den-but-civic-authority-aloof/articleshow/88378897.cms||---
---||Chennai||Their chemistry brings them juicy returns||They were classmates in school and college and are now partners in life and business. Meet Pritesh Asher and his wife Megha. A trip to a mall in Coimbatore seven years ago gave them their big startup idea and Juicy Chemistry was born. “A salesperson tried to market a ‘natural/organic’ skincare product to Megha and it piqued my interest,” remembers Asher. The couple found that the ingredients list told a different story. “A few ingredients were natural but most were petroleum-based or synthetic. As someone whose family business was in industrial auto lube, these ingredients were familiar to me,” he says. “Seeing them in a ‘natural/ organic’ product was surprising.” The husband-wife team thought about a line of organic personal care products without lab-grown ingredients. Juicy Chemistry is now certified organic by Ecocert France, the largest organic products testing body in the world. With no background in the beauty industry – Pritesh is a business management graduate from Griffith University in Australia and Megha has a degree in journalism from the same university – the couple’s venture had a slow start. Juicy Chemistry was started with a seed capital of ₹5,000 and took five years to be registered, but it is now attracting investor interest. Its first fundraise last year brought in $650,000 in an angel funding round from Amit Nanavati. Since then things have gotten juicier. In March this year, Juicy Chemistry raised $6.3 million (₹45.7 crore) as part of its Series A funding round, which was led by Belgium-based family fund Verlinvest and Manash Lifestyle, the holding company that runs the online shopping portal Purple.com. “We will have a Series B round of around $20 million by Diwali 2022,” says Asher. “We are ramping up products and production as well as retail footprint. Juicy Chemistry’s current annual revenue is ₹35 crore-₹40 crore and we want to get to ₹100 crore in the next 18 months,” he adds. The money could not have come at a better time. Juicy Chemistry’s factory in Coimbatore, which currently makes 1.5 lakh units a month, is being expanded. “Production will hit 7 lakh units a month in the next 18 months,” says Asher. The brand, which currently retails on Nykaa, Purple.com, Amazon and other online platforms, is building an offline presence. “We’re in talks with Nykaa and Purple.com as well as other big retailers for exclusive brand outlets or store-in-store presence,” he adds. That footprint is important as Juicy Chemistry expands its products to include serums and colour cosmetics. “We currently have 100 products and we rely on oilbased phytonutrients. The critical segments we were not present in earlier were serums and actives.” Juicy Chemistry recently launched seven products in the serum category. It is entering the cosmetic segment with ‘certified organic’ eyeliners, eyeshadows, foundation, colour correctors, and lip products. The brand is also present in Australia, Singapore, UAE, South Africa, Nepal and France.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/their-chemistry-brings-them-juicy-returns/articleshow/88381201.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta
