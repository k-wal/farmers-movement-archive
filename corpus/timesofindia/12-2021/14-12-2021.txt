The PSO, Saqib Ahmad Tantry, and his colleague Arif Mir — both natives of Bonipora area — have been reported missing along with their service weapons since Sunday night. Arif was at home on leave, said sources. J&K Police have launched a search operation to trace the duo, said a top officer on Monday. Officials said both are SPO appointees and not regular cops with the police department. Late Sunday, PSO Saqib fled with two service weapons — that of his and Arif’s — from the PWD building in Salkoot where BJP activist Zargar has been staying along with other protected persons. Saqib had come to his Bonipora residence and the two left together, said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-activists-pso-cop-on-guard-duty-go-missing-with-service-weapons/articleshow/88264271.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Early snowfall attracted a large number of tourists to J&K from other states despite Covid restrictions. Stating that the tourism industry in J&K was returning to normalcy, J&K chief secretary Dr Arun Kumar Mehta on Monday asked the tourism department to promote 75 new tourist places by developing comprehensive facilities in an integrated manner with adequate provisions of recreational activities, eateries and restrooms. Mehta asked the department to preserve, restore and promote the cultural and architectural heritage of J&K. He advised the department to raise awareness about these places by organising dedicated travel, trekking-expeditions, mountain bike adventures and stays around the identified sites. He asked the department to promote tourism cooperatives for comprehensive tourism development through collective efforts of locals, youth, PRIs through department-sponsored training, capacity-building and handholding. He further informed that in the winter months, the tourism department will organise the Jammu festival, white water rafting championship, Christmas carnival, Winter Carnival, Gulmarg snow festival, Lohri festival and Mata Vaishno Devi Sangeet Sammelan as part of its calendar of activities under the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/highest-ever-tourist-footfall-in-jk-in-nov/articleshow/88264343.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

While raising the demand in Lok Sabha on today, Kotak pointed out that due to lack of proper facilities in the trains as well as on railway stations, many disabled people have lost their lives in the recent past. He said, "The rail administration should ensure that such mishaps do not occur in future and special attention is paid to provide better services to the disabled commuters during peak hours."  Due to the lack of facilities and overcrowded Mumbai’s local trains, it is virtually impossible for the disabled commuters to travel, especially during rush hours, by the local trains. Last year a disabled girl traveling by the over-crowded local train between Dombivali and Ghatkopar fell down and died. This year in February, a disabled man lost his balance and fell down at Panvel railway station and eventually lost his life, he pointed. "Despite efforts by the rail administration, to make the trains and stations disabled-friendly, no facilities are being provided to the disabled commuters." He further said, "As such I request the railway minister to make a special arrangement for the disabled commuters to board and alight the trains especially during peak hours to ensure safe travel to the disabled commuters." Kotak suggested, "The arrangement should be such that if the disabled commuter wants an assistance then the rail administration should make the arrangement in such a way that the concerned person gets immediate relief.

---||India||Terrorists attack police bus in Srinagar; 2 cops killed, 14 injured||SRINAGAR: At least three terrorists attacked a Jammu and Kashmir police bus ferrying men of the 9th Battalion to Zewan police camp on Monday evening, killing two policemen and injuring 14, some of them critically, a police spokesman said. The attack took place in Srinagar’s Pantha Chowk area. "Credible sources revealed that the attack was carried by Kashmir Tigers, an offshoot of the JeM," IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said, adding, "In retaliatory firing one of the terrorists was injured. The group involved in this attack will be soon brought to justice." The terrorist action, the most daring yet against the police, came two days after militants killed two policemen in Bandipora and just hours after the police killed two LeT terrorists, including a foreigner, in a chance encounter in Srinagar’s Rangreth area. "The police party was coming back to its campus after finishing their duties," the police spokesman said. The two policemen who succumbed to their injuries were ASI Ghulam Hassan and SGC (selection grade constable) Safique Ali, the police said. The injured were shifted to a military hospital in Badami Bagh, Srinagar, for treatment. Sources said the helmet-wearing terrorists flanked the bus on both sides on motorcycles and opened fire. The attack left 16 cops wounded; two of the wounded succumbed to their injuries in hospital, the police said. A tweet from the PMO said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sought details about the attack and expressed his condolences to the families of the policemen "martyred" in the attack. An official said the bus had bloodstains visible on the seats and was punctured by bullets on all sides, especially the front as suggested by pictures on social media. An eye-witness said locals helped the policemen evacuate the injured to hospitals. There was prior intelligence a day before the attack about the presence of terrorists with likely plans to execute an attack on security forces in Srinagar, sources in New Delhi said. However, a J&K government official said the intelligence had not been too specific. While the names of "indigenous-sounding" organisations like The Resistance Force (TRF) and Kashmir Tiger Force crop up after such attacks on civilians as well as security forces, they are fronts for Pakistan-based organisation created to ensure deniability in the wake of global pressure on Islamabad to crack down on the banned outfits. "#Terrorists fired upon a police vehicle near Zewan, in Pantha Chowk area of #Srinagar. 14 personnel #injured in the attack. All the injured personnel evacuated to hospital. Area cordoned off. Further details shall follow," the Kashmir zone police had tweeted earlier. It later confirmed that two of the injured cops had died of their injuries and that 14 wounded were in hospitals. Meanwhile, in a separate incident, the J&K police killed two Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists, including one from Pakistan, in a brief chance encounter in Srinagar’s Rangreth area, near the military airport, on Monday morning. One slain terrorist was identified as Aadil Ahmad Wani, a resident of Daramdoora, Shopian. A police spokesman said the police had laid checkpoints in Wanbal area of Rangreth following inputs about the moment of terrorists from Shopian district. "During frisking at one such checkpoint two suspected persons, on noticing the police party, fired indiscriminately at them. However, the fire was effectively retaliated (sic), leading to a brief encounter … two terrorists were neutralised on spot," the police spokesman said. Both slain terrorists were involved in several terrorist attacks and played a key role in a number of killings, including those of a policeman and a civilian at Warpora Sopore in March 2020, the police said. They were also involved in several grenade attacks, including the one at the Sopore bus stand in which 19 civilians were injured and two cops killed. Arms and ammunition and other incriminating material were recovered from the encounter site. The J&K Congress Committee (JKPCC) condemned the attack in Zewan area and expressed grief over the loss of life and injuries. The JKPCC spokesperson termed the attack as "mindless and inhuman" and urged the government to identify the gunmen for exemplary punishment. "The security situation has deteriorated to a large extent, the government must take measures to contain the loss of life," the spokesperson added. NC leader and former J&K CM Omar Abdullah also condemned the attack, as did West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. J&K Lt-Gov Manoj Sinha said he had directed the authorities to provide the best possible treatment to the wounded and that the "police and security forces are determined to neutralise the evil forces of terrorism".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/terrorists-attack-police-bus-in-srinagar-2-cops-killed-14-injured/articleshow/88264413.cms||M Saleem Pandit

An official from the district election officer informed the media that six cases were detected from Bhiwandi East Assembly seat while 22 from the Belapur Assembly seat following which they have approached the police. The process of revising the electoral rolls was underway and the department had appealed those wanting their names to be included in the same to upload relevant documents online. Accordingly, the applicants were supposed to submit relevant documents along with form number 6 online. “However, the applicants submitted fabricated documents as residence proof wherein they forged their names on someone else's address. We suspected something amiss while scanning the applications and on closer scrutiny, found the documents to be fake. Accordingly, we filed complaint with the police," the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/navi-mumbai-case-against-28-for-submitting-fake-documents-to-obtain-voter-card/articleshow/88263307.cms||Manoj Badgeri

Speaking at an event in Lahore, Khan criticised the western media, saying that instead of giving Pakistan its due credit for the sacrifices it made, the country was accused of playing “a double game” and its reputation was maligned internationally. “Pakistan was held responsible for the shortcomings of the US,” the prime minister said, adding that his country was blamed for wrong reasons by the international community. He went on to say that throughout the war in Afghanistan, Pakistan had to witness the biggest collateral damage as it was the only US ally that suffered more than 80,000 casualties, displacement of millions of people, and a loss of over $100 billion. “The inability of the national leadership to handle the Afghan situation wisely landed the country into two main pro and anti-America divisions,” he said. Earlier, Khan had claimed that Pakistan had paid a very heavy price of siding with the US in its occupation of Afghanistan. He had said that it was hurting when the American politicians blamed Islamabad for its “humiliating retreat” from Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pak-bore-brunt-for-us-mistakes-in-afghan-imran/articleshow/88264694.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

---||India||Gujarat puts Covid toll at 10,099, but clears 16,175 ex gratia claims||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government has informed the Supreme Court that it has received 22,557 applications for ex gratia from the kin of those who died of Covid-19 in the state, of which it has sanctioned payments in 16,175 cases. The official Covid toll in Gujarat, as declared by the government, stands at 10,099 till Monday and the report submitted to the SC indicates that 6,076 “extra or additional claims” have been added, making Gujarat the latest state to add a significant number to its death tally. Most states are reporting compensation payments to the court in keeping with the SC directive which widened eligibility to even include cases of suicide among Covid sufferers. Death due to any cause while a person is suffering from Covid or within one month of contracting the disease has to be counted as a “Covid death”. In an affidavit filed in the apex court on December 9, in response to a litigation filed by Gaurav Bansal on disbursal of Rs 50,000 compensation in Covid death cases, Gujarat’s relief commissioner said, “It is submitted that till date, 22,557 applications have been received for payment of ex gratia, out of which sanction order has been passed for 16,175 cases. It is further submitted that out of the 16,175 cases which have been sanctioned, DBT (direct benefit transfer) has been done for 14,215 cases.” In the past, former chief minister Vijay Rupani had rejected claims of under-reporting of Covid deaths. “The method of recording Covid deaths has been stipulated by ICMR and all states, including Gujarat, are following it. Other states are also not recording the deaths of comorbid patients as Covid fatalities,” Rupani had said. The issue of Covid compensation has been contentious in the state as experts believe that the actual number of people who succumbed to the viral attack could be much higher, which is expected to result in higher claims for ex gratia of Rs 50,000. With the Gujarat government submitting that it is widely giving publicity to the ex-gratia disbursal scheme as per SC directives, the number of claims are likely to increase further. The Gujarat government said that it has started broadcasting an advertisement in this regard on the All India Radio and would soon air this information on FM radios and publish advertisements in local dailies as well, said advocate Pranjal Kishore. He is appearing for applicant Amit Panchal, who questioned the Gujarat government’s notification about Covid-19 death ex gratia, claiming that it was not in accordance with the SC guidelines. On the SC’s directions, the state government has launched a portal on which relatives of Covid-19 victims can file online applications. “The link to the online portal has been provided on multiple government websites of all district collectorates, as well as VCEs (Village Computer Entrepreneurs) of e-gram centres at the village level,” the affidavit reads. The state government also added that on December 4, it had informed the court that it had received 12,718 applications and out of them, 7,145 claims were sanctioned and payments were made in 6,515 cases. The SC had asked all state governments to pay ex gratia in cases in which RT-PCR test was found positive and death of the patient had occurred within 30 days of the testing. As the Gujarat government’s notification introduced more criteria to the SC guidelines, the SC came down heavily on the state government and the notification had to be modified and simplified on three occasions. The SC has posted further hearings on this issue on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gujarat-puts-covid-toll-at-10099-but-clears-16175-ex-gratia-claims/articleshow/88264837.cms||---
---||India||CBSE drops ‘misogynistic’ question after furore in Lok Sabha||NEW DELHI: CBSE expressed regret and said it would set up an expert committee to issue guidelines on setting question papers after a comprehension passage in the Term-1 English question paper, which contained disparaging commentary on the position of women in families, triggered a controversy and was raised in Parliament by opposition leaders on Monday. The board has dropped the passage and awarded full marks to students for the ill-framed question. Raising the issue in Lok Sabha, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi condemned the “blatantly misogynist” and “nonsensical” questions, saying they reflected “extremely poorly” on the standards of education and testing. Experts also feel that standards set by CBSE are now under the scanner as technology-wise, the Board has the capacity to rectify errors even at a late hour. The question paper for Class X exam conducted on Saturday carried a comprehension passage with sentences such as “emancipation of women destroyed the parents’ authority over the children” and “it was only by accepting her husband’s way that a mother could gain obedience over the younger ones”. Earlier this month, in the Class XII sociology paper, students were asked to name the political party under which the “anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat in 2002” took place, a question the board later said was “inappropriate” and against its guidelines. Stating that the Class X comprehension passage was not in adherence with the guidelines issued by the Board, CBSE in an official statement said: “CBSE is committed to equity and excellence in education and promotes inclusiveness and gender sensitivity. CBSE has dropped a passage and accompanying questions which were asked in English term-1 paper for Class X as it was not in adherence with guidelines issued by the board for external paper setters. “CBSE regrets the unfortunate incident and is setting up an expert committee to thoroughly review and strengthen the question paper setting processes to avoid such occurrences in future.” Reacting to the incident, the principal of a private school in Nagpur said: “We have co-ed schools and one of the aims of education is to empower the girl child to be independent in future. Such obsolete ideas finding their way in a board exam paper is shocking. These subtle statements go a long way in planting self-doubt in the subconscious mind of these students.” Another CBSE school principal from Delhi said the board needs to upgrade its paper review policy, before release on exam day. “It’s not like a math or science paper where you can immediately pick out technical errors in questions. Language and social science need greater review because here words mean everything. It seems that pre-exam review is limited to checking if total marks add up, or if every section has questions within the allotted mark category,” she said, while another principal said CBSE has the technology to rectify errors even up to three hours before exam starts as “question papers are now online. Uptil 6am on exam day, CBSE can easily make changes.” Demanding an apology from the government and a review into the “gravest lapse”, Sonia read out excerpts from the paper during zero hour and said: “The passage contains atrocious statements such as ‘women gaining independence is the main reason for a wide variety of social and family problems’ and if ‘wives stops obeying their husbands, that is the main reason children and servants are indisciplined.” MPs from Congress, DMK, IUML, NCP and National Conference also demanded a clarification from the government and staged a walkout when no response was forthcoming. Sonia said the ministry of education must conduct a review of the “gender sensitivity standards of the curriculum and the textbooks” so that such incidents are never repeated. Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi also wrote to Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan seeking an unconditional apology, an explanation on how this passage was cleared and demanding disciplinary action against those who cleared it. “It is astonishing how this passage was able to pass through the scrutiny of ‘subject experts’, which is further checked by the high-powered committee to see if the question papers follow the board’s standards,” she said. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi raised the issue on Twitter. “Most CBSE papers so far were too difficult and the comprehension passage in the English paper was downright disgusting. Typical RSS-BJP ploys to crush the morale and future of the youth. Kids, do your best. Hard work pays. Bigotry doesn’t,” he said. On Sunday, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted an image of the question paper, saying it represented “retrograde views on women”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbse-drops-misogynistic-question-after-furore-in-lok-sabha/articleshow/88264945.cms||---
---||India||SC to hear plea seeking benefits for gig workers||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine the plea of ‘gig workers’ employed with online food delivery (Zomato and Swiggy) and taxi (Uber and Ola) aggregators to extend social security and welfare benefits to them under multiple legislations, including Workmen’s Compensation Act and Maternity Benefits Act. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai issued notice to the Centre, along with Uber India, Zomato, Swiggy and Ola, seeking their response on a petition filed by the Indian Federation of App-based Transport Workers (IFAT), which represents unions of app-based transport and delivery workers across India. The petition alleged that denial of social security like pension and health insurance to them is a violation of their right to life and right against forced labour. Senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing for the petitioner, contended that drivers and delivery men in many other countries are being treated as workmen and they should also be declared workmen here too. She also said that Uber treats drivers as workers in other countries and it also should follow the same principles in India. The petition said the mere fact that their employers call themselves ‘aggregators’ and enter into so-called ‘partnership agreements’ does not take away from the fact that there exists a relationship of employer and employee between them. “At present these workers are not being provided the benefit of social security under any of the labour legislations-organized or unorganised. This defeats the very purpose of the social- welfare legislations, which seek to ensure social security-a facet the right to work and livelihood on decent conditions of work under Article 21 of the Constitution,” it said. “These legislations have been enacted, pursuant to the Directive Principles of State Policy, with a view to ensuring basic human dignity to the workers. The inaction on part of the state in ensuring social security to ‘gig workers’ and ‘platform workers’ notwithstanding the existence of the said laws, is the clearest violation of Article 21 apart from a violation of Article 14 and Article 23 of the Constitution. The Right to Livelihood includes the right to work on decent and fair conditions of work,” it said. The petition submitted that social security is an integral part of the right to work and livelihood and the state is duty bound to ensure that the right guaranteed under the statutes are de-jure and de-facto made available to all working people. “It is the case of the petitioners, herein who are commonly known as gig workers and platform workers, that they are in an employment relationship with the aggregators and hence covered by the definition of ‘workman’ within the meaning of all the applicable social security legislations including: The Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923; The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947; The Employee’s State Insurance Act, 1948; Employee’s Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952; The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961; The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 and ‘Unorganised Workers’ Social Welfare Security Act, 2008’,” it said. “These legislations have been enacted pursuant to the Directive Principles of State Policy with a view to ensuring basic human dignity to the workers. The inaction on part of the state in ensuring social security to the gig workers and platform workers notwithstanding the existence of the said laws, is the clearest violation of Article 21 apart from a violation of Article 14 and Article 23 of the Constitution.

---||India||EC begins exercise for polls in 5 states||NEW DELHI: In a clear indication that announcement of polls in five states – UP, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur - may not be far away, the Election Commission will begin its customary visits to the election-bound states on Wednesday, starting with Punjab, to assess poll preparedness and discuss related issues with the stakeholders before it finalises the poll schedule. Sources told TOI that the Commission, which comprises chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra and election commissioners Rajiv Kumar and Anup Chandra Pandey, is likely to visit Goa and then Uttarakhand next week. Though the timing of the EC’s pre-poll visit to UP is still being finalised, the sense is that it may happen in quick succession of the commission’s Uttarakhand tour. Indications are that the poll announcement may come in early January 2022. EC has already asked the poll-bound states to expedite publication of the updated roll with January 1, 2022 as the reference date. While some states have promised to publish the revised rolls on January 1 itself, UP is expected to publish its rolls on January 5, 2022. EC usually prefers to wait until the revised rolls are published for all the election-bound states, before going ahead with the poll announcement, though this is not obligatory. Election Commission undertakes visits to poll-bound states to gather inputs from the state administration about factors such as local festivals, weather conditions, agricultural cycles, law and order situation along with the requirement of central forces and Covid protocols, and also to hear political parties on election-related concerns. A final meeting is also held with the home ministry brass to assess the availability of central forces for elections. All these discussions help the EC in finalising the dates as well as the number of phases over which polling will be spread. As per indications, actual polling may begin sometime in February and going by the past precedents, the assembly poll in UP may well stretch over nearly 6-8 phases lasting almost a month. The terms of assemblies in the five poll-bound states are expiring between March 15 and May 14 next year. Since it is a standard practice for EC to club polls in states where the dates of expiry of their respective assemblies are close together, the poll panel will be bringing forward polls in UP, due only on May 14, 2022, by a couple of months. EC will look to complete polling for all the states at least a week before March 15, 2020. As per the law, EC can hold polls in a state anytime within six months prior to the end of term of the existing assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ec-begins-exercise-for-polls-in-5-states/articleshow/88265267.cms||Bharti Jain

Even a third dose will not prevent acquisition of Omicron. These vaccines do not prevent infections. They only reduce severity. So, those who have already received the vaccine, even if they get infected with Omicron, it will cause mild disease only. So, the argument that lower efficacy of vaccine caused mild disease does not hold true,” says Samiran Panda, Head of Epidemiology & Communicable Diseases at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Live updates: Coronavirus pandemicAnurag Agarwal, director, CSIR Institute Of Genomics and Integrative Biology, holds that boosters may help even as he suggests high-risk people receiving inactivated virus vaccines may be prioritised first. Other high-risk and high-exposure healthcare workers should be next, while ensuring the pool of fully vaccinated expands.

The Delta variant, first identified in India earlier this year, is responsible for most of the“The inherent transmissibility of Omicron is unknown because in today's world, there is enough immunity (infection, vaccine) that immune escape can explain most of the current advantage against Delta. However, it is likely to be high (transmissible) and comparable to Delta,” Agarwal said that even though there is high immunity post-Delta and vaccination, Omicron may still spread faster due to the changes in spike protein. This highlights the need to comply with Covid-appropriate behaviour.

West Bengal chief minister and TMC boss Mamata Banerjee fumbled while pronouncing the Konkani words for 'khela hobe', but she more than made up for it by tossing a football into the boisterous audience, who lapped up all of Banerjee's theatrics on the stage and cheered. As the lone NCP MLA in Goa assembly, Churchill Alemao, and his daughter Valanka were inducted into TMC, the largely attended public function held on Dando Grounds here was high on optics-footballs on the stage, a cantar (Konkani song) eulogising Banerjee and Alemao, and the thousands of Alemao supporters waving the TMC flag at Banerjee's prompt. "We will win the election," Banerjee said. "Please accept us like your family." The Alemao father-daughter duo, who also run a football club Churchill Brothers, was welcomed into the party by TMC vice president Luizinho Faleiro in the presence of Banerjee and other functionaries. Earlier in the day, Alemao met with speaker Rajesh Patnekar and submitted a proposal to merge the legislative group of NCP, of which he is the sole member, with TMC. In his address at Dando Grounds, Alemao said: "Only Mamata Didi has it in her to become the PM. If she becomes the PM, she will throw BJP out." Banerjee, in her address, took pains to explain how TMC was not an anti-Hindu party as was made out to be by BJP but a party that promotes communal harmony. According to an agency report, Banerjee took a dig at Congress party, accusing it of behaving like a sluggish 'zamindaar', while doing nothing to take on BJP. She said, "I do not want to speak against Congress. If Congress thinks of working to defeat BJP, we have no objection. We have formed an alliance in Goa along with MGP. This is the alternative. You want to join, do that. Just because you are not doing it, no one else will do it, this is not right."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-can-join-tmc-alliance-mamata-banerjee-in-goa/articleshow/88265492.cms||Govind Maad

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and B R Gavai said the issue raised in the petition could be better decided by the high court as it would be aware about the ground situation prevailing in the state and allow the party to withdraw the petition to approach the HC. Senior advocate Maninder Singh, however, pointed out that the SC had agreed to intervene in Tripura civic polls and passed directions to ensure free and fair polls. Singh pleaded that a similar order should be passed in BJP's plea also as party candidates are receiving threats and are being pressured to withdraw their candidature. He said not a single FIR had been lodged on the complaints filed by its candidates.

The question came from Justice PV Kunhikrishnan while considering a petition filed by Peter Myaliparambil of Kottayam seeking a directive that vaccination certificates be issued without the PM's photo on them. "He is our Prime minister, not the Prime Minister of any other country. He came to power through our mandate. Merely because you have political differences, you cannot challenge this. Why are you ashamed of our PM? One hundred crore people don't seem to have an issue with this, so why do you? Everyone has different political opinions but he is still our Prime Minister. You are wasting judicial time," the judge said. The petitioner's counsel, Ajit Joy, submitted that his client had paid for the jab and the state had no right to claim credit by inserting a photograph of the PM in the certificate issued to him. He argued further that no public purpose or utility was served by the PM's photograph on the vaccination certificate. The HC said it will consider the pleadings in detail with an open mind and decide it on merits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-are-you-ashamed-of-pm-pic-on-vaccination-certificate-judge/articleshow/88265595.cms||---

"This is also an important issue," said a bench hearing the matter, reports Rosy Sequeira. The PIL also seeks removal of the national emblem and flag from the website. When the PIL came up for hearing before a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Makarand Karnik, additional solicitor general Anil Singh sought time to file the Centre's reply and asked that the matter be heard after Christmas vacations. The judges noted that the Centre has not replied to the petition since the last hearing. The CJ said, "You (Centre) have not filed your affidavit (in reply). File your affidavit." On October 12, Singh had sought time to take instructions. The judges directed the reply to be filed on December 23 and posted the hearing for January 3 after the court reopens. The PIL was filed by a Congress member Vikrant Chavan. Modi is a respondent as he is chairman of the Fund and settlor of the deed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/important-issue-court-seeks-govt-reply-on-pm-cares/articleshow/88265631.cms||---
---||India||ED attaches assets worth ₹8 crore of UP don, wife||NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate on Monday attached properties and bank balances worth over Rs 8 crore belonging to Atiq Ahmad, a mafia don and former Samajwadi Party MP and his wife in a money laundering case. The don, who is also five-time MLA from Allahabad, is currently lodged in Sabarmati jail, Gujarat. The attachments include the history sheeter's properties allegedly acquired through extortion and illicit activities, many of them registered in his wife Shaista Praveen's name. On Monday, the ED attached a land at Phulpur in Allahabad worth over Rs 7 crore. It is registered in the name of Praveen. In addition, the agency has attached at least 10 bank accounts having a combined balance of Rs 1.28 crore, all in the name of Atiq and his wife. "The probe revealed that Atiq Ahmad, through criminal activities, earned dirty money in cash and deposited them in his relatives' bank accounts. The money came into the accounts through various shell companies controlled by the don," the ED has said. The don, whose career in crime began with a murder in Allahabad at the age of 17, has acquired several properties in UP and other states by extorting money from several businessmen.  ED's Lucknow zone head Rajeshwar Singh said more benami assets belonging to the accused have been identified, which will be attached shortly. Singh said the ED has also identified properties of other big mafia dons in UP, including those of the sitting Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan and history sheeter Mukhtar Ansari, for their attachment in money laundering cases. Like Atiq Ahmad, Mukhtar Ansari is a five-time MLA elected on a BSP ticket and currently lodged in Banda district jail in UP on charges of money laundering and various other criminal charges slapped by the UP Police. On court permission, the ED had questioned Ansari, Azam Khan and Atiq Ahmad in their prison cells between September and October in connection with their network of criminal activities and extortion business, said Singh. Both Azam Khan and his son are currently lodged in district jail Sitapur for more than a year now. The UP government has already moved to reclaim 170 acres of Azam Khan controlled Md Ali Jauhar University in Rampur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-attaches-assets-worth-8crore-of-up-don-wife/articleshow/88265653.cms||---

"The SMART system is a next generation standoff torpedo delivery system designed to enhance the Navy's anti-submarine warfare capabilities. The medium-range supersonic missile carries a torpedo, parachute delivery system and release mechanisms," a DRDO official said. The SMART system, which is just a "technology demonstrator" as of now, has a range "several times" that of the 20-40-km conventional torpedoes. The canister-based missile system, which ejects the torpedo with a parachute near the target, consists of advanced technologies like two-stage solid propulsion, electro-mechanical actuators and precision inertial navigation. "The missile is launched from a ground mobile launcher and can cover a range of distances. A number of DRDO laboratories developed various technologies for this system, while the industry participated in the development and production of various sub-systems," he said. Congratulating the DRDO, defence minister Rajnath Singh said the SMART system's development "is a perfect example of building futuristic defence systems" within the country.

---||India||Spell out policy to revive PSU vax makers, SC tells Centre||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to spell out its policy on revitalising vaccine manufacturing PSUs - many of which were closed during UPA government and which the NDA in 2016 promised to revive after modernisation - that could play a crucial role in making India self-reliant in the $2 billion domestic vaccine market. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna stepped back from issuing notice to the Union government on a PIL filed by former health secretary during Vajpayee government, Amulya Ratna Nanda, and few NGOs, after solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said that the issues raised "fell solely within the Executive's policy domain". But the policy barrier raised by the SG did not deter the bench from asking, "We want to know what is that policy of the Union government towards vaccine manufacturing PSUs?" Mehta said that the Centre would file a detailed response to the PIL and the SC posted the matter for further hearing in January. The petitioners through senior advocate Colin Gonsalves drew the court's attention to a PIL filed in 2009, which had alleged that "the Union government and particular ministers in the central Cabinet were wilfully sabotaging the public sector units manufacturing drugs and vaccines with a corrupt motive to favour private pharma companies. The flimsy excuse given by the Union government in those proceedings was that the PSUs were not good manufacturing practices (GMP) compliant." "This move in case of Covid-19 vaccine (Covaxin produced by private firm Bharat Biotech International Private Ltd) essentially has resulted in the public paying twice for vaccines; private companies taking margins out of public sector manufacturing for the final product, after already taking government grants to develop the product as well as the infrastructure needed for its manufacture," said the petitioners, while remaining silent on vaccine production by Serum Institute of India. The plea said three PSUs - Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals, Bulandshahr; Haffkine Biopharmaceuticals, Mumbai; and Indian Immunologicals, Hyderabad - have been recently chosen to produce Covaxin, making these PSUs contract manufacturers for the private sector because of the flawed policy on vaccine manufacturing by the Union government. Speaking on the issue, officials have previously said that it was the Centre's efforts that resulted in the PSUs being roped in to increase production of Covaxin amid the pandemic. Gonsalves said the GMP standard was to be complied with for export purposes and not for local consumption. "The wife of the (health) minister at that time (UPA government) wife had set up a vaccine park in Chennai to import vaccines while her husband was busy sabotaging the PSUs so that competition would be eliminated."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/spell-out-policy-to-revive-psu-vax-makers-sc-tells-centre/articleshow/88265896.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Bill for enhancing pension of judges gets Rajya Sabha approval||NEW DELHI: A bill that proposes to amend the salaries and services acts of the judges of the Supreme Court and high courts was approved by the Rajya Sabha Monday. The bill was meant to seek clarity over the age of retired high court and Supreme Court judges and determine when they can receive enhanced pension. The bill, which was passed by the Lok Sabha on December 8, will amend the High Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954 and the Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958. "This is a very limited amendment, which we have brought in the said Acts and for a limited purpose. It is not going to affect in any manner the judges' salaries. It is only related to a quantum jump in the pension of retired judges of the Supreme Court and the high courts," said union minister for law and justice Kiren Rijiju. He also said that free legal aid was a right of the people of India and that the Centre had been focusing on the issue. The Rajya Sabha returned the bill to the Lok Sabha after a discussion on Monday since it is a money bill. While replying to the debate, Rijiju also spoke on the issue of fast track courts, saying a total of 28 states and seven Union Territories were engaged in achieving the goal and that only West Bengal was not taking any step in that direction. "West Bengal's performance is not good...There should not be any politics on judiciary," Rijiju said. The bill sought to bring an "explanatory clarification" about the age of eligibility for enhanced pension for retired judges. Accordingly, the additional quantum of pension for retired judges of the HCs and the Supreme Court is being sanctioned on the completion of the age of 80 years, 85 years, 90 years, 95 years and 100 years, as the case may be.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bill-for-enhancing-pension-of-judges-gets-rajya-sabha-approval/articleshow/88265938.cms||---

Most of the opposition parties voiced concerns over the retrospective provisions in the bill . The NDPS (Amendment) Bill, 2021 was passed by a voice vote and some amendments moved by opposition members were rejected by the House. Responding to concerns raised by members that the provision for implementing the law with retrospective effect was in violation of Article 20 (1) of the Constitution, Sitharaman said according to the opinion of the Solicitor General, the amendment could be permitted as it was not substantive, but clarificatory in nature. She said the retrospective amendment was allowed as the government did not want to create a new law but only correct a mistake. Congress, Trinamool Congress, BJD, Left parties and others expressed their fears about the bill allowing implementing agencies powers beyond control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ls-approves-bill-to-fix-errors-in-ndps-act/articleshow/88266031.cms||---

There are 20,607 people from as many as 147 countries holding active Indian employment visas as of the first week of December. Of them, ministry of external affairs (MEA) data shows, 51% or 10,569 are citizens of three countries: Republic of Korea, Japan and China. Philippines (256), Taiwan (237), Malaysia (214) and Indonesia (215) tilt the eastern scales even more. Compared to eastern Asia, the West packs a feeble punch — the US (over 1,000), France (946), Britain (876), Germany (594), Spain (317), Russia (268), Italy (244), Israel (123), and the Netherlands (122). Most people from the African continent are from South Africa (211), Zambia (116) and Nigeria (114) — their weight a little lighter than the group from the neighbourhood: Pakistan (3), Sri Lanka (453), Bangladesh (103), Afghanistan (2), and Myanmar (13). Fun fact: nobody from Bhutan works in India. Data also shows that more than 41.5 lakh foreigners — holding all types of visas — have left India between January 2020 and November 2021. According to immigration experts, the main reason behind China, Japan and Korea having a bigger presence is the nature of business. "There are, for instance, a lot of Japanese companies in the manufacturing sector. Comparatively, Western companies have subsidiaries or back offices that function differently. One needs to look at the various sectors and see which companies are operating in which area. That would give a fair indication," said Vatsal Gaur, partner, Pier Counsel. For industry representatives like J Crasta, Ficci's national executive member, the number for Japan wasn't surprising given the presence of Japanese companies, big proposed investments in manufacturing could have pushed up Korean numbers. They, however, said it's difficult to analyse the Chinese numbers. "...Some Asian jurisdictions prefer that their own managers take leadership positions at group companies and ventures across geographies or bring their support teams, especially while implementing large infrastructure projects. On the other hand, one possible reason for fewer visa holders from the West could be that some US- and Europe-headquartered companies send OCI card holders who do not need employment visas to travel and work in India," said Vikram Shroff, Leader, HR Law at Nishith Desai Associates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/51-of-20-6k-foreigners-on-job-visas-in-india-from-japan-korea-china/articleshow/88266045.cms||Chethan Kumar

The formal launch happened last weekend in Bengaluru, with the opening of 11 outlets. While Tata Cha was run by Tata Consumer Products, Qmin will be run by the Tatas' hotel group, Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL), which operates brands like Taj, SeleQtions, Vivanta and Ginger. When the pandemic disrupted the hospitality and restaurant business, IHCL launched the Qmin app for home delivery of foods from its restaurants. Qmin began in association with chef Sanjeev Kapoor, and served a million doctors and nurses during the pandemic, along with the general public. IHCL later expanded the brand to introduce a lifestyle gourmet store concept, Qmin Shop, along with Qmin On The Move, a food truck which catered to the need of on-the-go meals. These have now evolved into a brand of its own. While Tata Cha served beverages (tea, coffee, coolers), snacks and merchandise in a tea cafe QSR (quick service restaurant) format, Qmin offers a variety of artisanal bakery and confectionery products and a selection of teas and coffees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tata-cha-outlets-to-be-known-as-qmin/articleshow/88266051.cms||Kruthikaa Lakshman

And as such, there was no case for the interim relief. We, therefore, modify the order dated December 9, 2021 passed by the learned single judge to the extent that the election to Bengaluru Urban local authorities constituency to the legislative council shall go on uninterrupted. The nominated members can participate in the election and cast their votes. The result of the election shall be declared, which shall be subject to final decision in the writ petition,” the bench observed.The single bench, while permitting the 15 nominated members of Anekal, Bommasandra and Attibele urban local bodies to vote, had said the result shouldn’t be declared without court’s permission. In the writ appeal, ECI had conended the December 9 order failed to consider the specific bar under Article 329 vis-a-vis interference in electoral matters. Senior advocate Dhyan Chinnappa,who appeared for ECI, argued that Article 243R, relied upon by the petitioner before the single bench, has no applicability to the council election. He added that nominated members had voted in the earlier elections too.On the other hand, counsel for Yousuf Sharif, the Congress candidate who is the petitioner before the single bench, contended that article 243R clearly debars members nominated to municipalities from participating and casting their votes in the meetings of municipalities and can only participate in their day-to-day functioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-modifies-order-says-eci-can-declare-result/articleshow/88266055.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Wary of 600m ‘racing track’, residents of Jayamahal Extension demand speed breaker||BENGALURU: Residents of Jayamahal Extension have written several letters to the BBMP’s traffic engineering cell and traffic police, demanding that speed breakers be laid on the 600m stretch connecting Jayamahal Main Road and Nandidurg Main Road. A resident and member of CIJMA, (Citizens’ Initiative for Jayamahal Area) said, “Ever since the road was whitetopped, the frequency of accidents went up significantly. The 600m stretch was nicely done with no speed breakers, but now it is being used by motorists as a racing track.” An accident that occurred in the wee hours on Sunday spread panic among residents. They said motorists are speeding on this stretch because the roads it connects to are not in good shape. Another CIJMA member said, “It can be really difficult to drive on the road. When motorists turn to 1 Main Jayamahal Extension, they tend to press the accelerator seeing the smooth stretch ahead.” Whitetopping work on this road was completed early this year and since then, residents claimed least four accidents have occurred. “Sunday’s was the second such accident in the last one month, where an overspeeding four-wheeler lost control and went over the pavement. Motorists tend to drive fast on the new road and sometimes, end up with accidents like this. Though no fatal accidents have been reported in recent times, the risk is always there. However, no complaints were filed in both the recent accidents,” a senior traffic police officer said. The primary concern of residents is that the road is used by several senior citizens who enjoy taking their morning walks. With vehicles speeding on the stretch, it can be intimidating for them. “There is a diagnostic centre and a play school on the road. At least for the sake of that, the authorities should seriously think of installing speed breakers. I have two toddlers and I am scared of taking them near our apartment gate as vehicles move at such high speed,” another association member said. Exasperated, residents have approached the Human Rights Protocol Considerations as well traffic police department. The assistant executive engineer, BBMP, said, “Residents have approached the traffic police department. Once they inspect and give the green signal, they will raise a request with the Palike. We can then float a tender. So far, we have received no such request.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/wary-of-600m-racing-track-locals-demand-speed-breaker/articleshow/88266056.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

Suresh Kumar, a resident of Sampangiramnagar, murdered his son Uday Sai by throwing him into the sump outside his rented house and later hanged himself near the railway track in Seshadripuram. The boy’s body was fished out at 11.30am and Suresh’s was found at 6pm, police said. Suresh was married to Lakshmi, who was a private school teacher before she quit to look after Uday Sai. “Since birth, Uday Sai was visually and speech impaired. The couple spent a lot of money to get him cured, but in vain. They paid 12,000 rent every month but after the first wave of Covid-19 in 2020, Suresh ran into financial problems,” a family member said. In November, Suresh fell ill and doctors suggested an operation costing Rs 1 lakh to treat his backbone. Since then, he was upset and often told Lakshmi he and his son were becoming a burden to her, the family member said. On Monday, Lakshmi and her brothers noticed Suresh and Uday Sai were missing. “Initially they thought Suresh had taken his son to Kanteerava Stadium, something he did often. However, Lakshmi grew anxious when they failed to return. Suresh’s mobile was switched off. Then, the family members opened the sump door and found the boy’s body,” a police officer said. By evening, Suresh’s body was found. It is evident he was upset over his health, son’s condition and financial crisis, family sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/driver-kills-disabled-son-hangs-himself/articleshow/88266057.cms||---

I told Bindu to return my money, but got only Rs 5 lakh back,” Somalingappa said.No arrests have been made so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cmo-staffer-accuses-colleague-of-job-fraud/articleshow/88266061.cms||---

Next June, the vice-president will, by default, become president of the club, making her the first woman to hold the post since its establishment in 1868. This is provided nobody decides to contest the presidential election in 2022. If, indeed, there is a contest then the election will decide the next president. Annabelle Manwaring was three when she first walked into Bangalore Club holding the hand of her father Praxy Fernandes, a top bureaucrat and finance secretary in the Morarji Desai government. Since then, she has always called the club her second home. “There are sweet memories at the club and I’m happy I have continued my association with it over the decades,” said Annabelle, who is 69 now. She is a former advertising professional and now pro-vice-chancellor of Delhi Public School in Whitefield. She passed out of Sophia High School before going to Delhi for college and then to the United Kingdom for higher education. While working in London for 35 years, she kept her association with the club and finally returned to Bengaluru in 2006. As an active member since, the sexagenarian was a popular choice to be club vice-president. “It was a physical election and members voted me to victory with a big margin. Without a gender divide, they identified my capability, likeability and sociability based on my work at this prestigious institution,” said Annabelle, whose family is originally from Mangaluru and has now made Hebbal its home. Her agendaThe new VP, who secured 813 votes and won by a margin of 253, said she would work to make the club more attractive to younger members and enhance the culinary experience and events to attract members. “We have over 7,800 members, of which close to 1,000 utilise our facilities on a regular basis. Therefore, my aim will be to attract more members, mainly youngsters, with new facilities, events and a gourmet delight,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bangalore-club-elects-first-woman-vp-in-153-years/articleshow/88266066.cms||Petlee Peter

---||Chennai||Chennai: Sewage, garbage fill lakes at Pammal, Anakaputhur, residents raise a stink||By Meera NairCHENNAI: Water bodies in the southern suburbs of Pammal and Anakaputhur have begun to stink from the sewage flowing into them unchecked. This has also affected the quality of groundwater in the area. Residents say in the absence of a sewage treatment plant (STP) and delayed construction of underground sewers, waste water from houses and commercial establishments is flowing into Pammal’s Thirupananthal lake and Moongil Eri in Anakaputhur. Loads of plastic bottles and bags filled with trash are also floating on the two water bodies as a result of poor disposal of the waste generated by a population of more than 1.2 lakh people. Social activist and local resident T Kandasamy said that groundwater drawn through borewells stinks during summer. "90% of the sewage generated is let into the Thirupananthal lake. It is high time an STP is set up," he said. M Radhika, a resident of Pammal charged that there was no proper waste management system in the locality. The authorities are constructing an underground sewage system including pumping stations at a cost of 162 crores. Moreover, a STP with a daily operating capacity of 27 million litres is also in the pipeline. Official sources said work that started early this year was delayed due to the second wave of Covid-19. But, it had picked up pace in the past one month and will be completed in two years, the sources added. M. Prabhakaran, engineer of Pammal municipality, said tenders for the STP were awaiting approval and that it will be built in six months. "The collector has sanctioned 1 crore for improving the lake and walking track. The waste will be cleared from the lake in a few days," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sewage-garbage-fill-lakes-at-pammal-anakaputhur-residents-raise-a-stink/articleshow/88266070.cms||---
---||Chennai||PTR: TN should aim for net zero carbon emission by 2050||Chennai: If India has targeted to achieve net zero carbon emission by 2070, then a state like Tamil Nadu, which is the most urbanized, should target to achieve it by 2050, said minister for finance and human resources Palanivel Thiaga Rajan here on Monday.“We need to achieve it by at least 20 years ahead,” he said and added when Tamil Nadu was the most urbanized state, it ought to be different from other states in setting and achieving targets. Thiaga Rajan was addressing a panel discussion on ‘Tamil Nadu’s Transition to Net-Zero Carbon Economy,’ organized by the Dravidian Professionals’ Forum.“People in Tamil Nadu have relatively high income and relatively high consumption, when compared to most other states. With a very high per capita consumption, the state also generates lots of waste. We do not have a proper policy on waste management and the clock is ticking,” Thiaga Rajan said. With around 25-26 million two-wheelers and a high percentage of passenger cars on the roads, it generates lots of pollution too, he added.Fortunately, there are advantages too. “We are number one state in renewable energy, with 30% of power generated coming from renewable energy sources on a good day. While we continue to depend on conventional energy sources, we have 38-39% of forest cover and this will be improved to bring in carbon credit,” he said.Speaking on the occasion, former Norwegian minister of environment and international development, Erik Solheim, who is also a former executive director of UN Environment, observed that chief minister M K Stalin’s target to make Tamil Nadu a $ one trillion economy would make it one of the most developed states, surpassing even a few developed nations in Europe.“But it is important for India and states like Tamil Nadu to have short term targets, since year 2070 is way too far. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s push for solar power will make India one of the largest markets for solar power,” he said.DMK MLA from Mannargudi and member of TN Planning Commission, T R B Rajaa said Tamil Nadu needs to start focusing on mobility, which is the biggest guzzler of fossil fuel. “The government is pushing for CNG buses, while e-buses are pricey at present. Sophisticated air-conditioned buses running on CNG would make public transport attractive and reduce the number of private vehicles on roads. But the government will not curtail anyone from buying their dream cars, since it is everyone’s dream. But we can make the dream car a green car,” Rajaa said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ptr-tn-should-aim-for-net-zero-carbon-emission-by-2050/articleshow/88266071.cms||---

---||Chennai||Internet de-addiction clinics set up in all medical college hospitals||Chennai: Internet de-addiction clinics have been set up in all government medical college hospitals in the state. Launching them on Monday, health minister Ma Subramaniam said more and more people, particularly the young, are displaying signs of compulsive use of smartphones and a preference for gadgets to the company of people. Internet usage has increased nearly a thousand-fold since 2001. It is estimated that almost 6% of the population suffers from a range of addictions such as gaming disorder, online gambling addiction and online porn addiction. “They know the consequences of this, but they are unable to resist the use of the internet. Some even show signs of withdrawal symptoms just like in the case of drug addiction,” Subramanian said. After assessing the addiction levels, psychiatrists and nurses will offer therapy and rehabilitation measures, he said. He also launched a cognitive rehabilitation day care centre that will deal with elderly patients suffering from memory-related ailments and a clinic for post-natal depression counselling. Every medical college hospital in the state will set aside 10 beds for these clinics, where besides therapy patients will be engaged with games such as carrom and traditional games such as snakes and ladders and “pallankuzhi”.  New mothers will receive counselling from doctors on personal health, child health, nutrition and healthy living. “Nearly 22% of new mothers suffer from depression. This leads to multiple health issues in mother and child, besides family problems,” he said. The counselling sessions will be conducted in all medical college hospitals.In addition, all newborns will be screened for hearing problems. Data show that more than one out of 1,000 children born in Tamil Nadu have hearing-related issues. Early intervention with hearing aids or cochlear implants will improve outcomes, they said. The state also launched the emergency care and rehabilitation centre for homeless mentally-ill patients in 22 government medical college hospitals. These centres will have 10 beds each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/internet-de-addiction-clinics-set-up-in-all-medical-college-hospitals/articleshow/88266075.cms||---

A Government Railway Police (GRP) team, which examined the body at Tambaram station, found his spectacles broken and blood around the left ear. The deceased, Narayanan of Karaikudi, was part of a 20-member group which was on a pilgrimage to a temple in Vadakara in Kerala and planned to start from a temple in Chennai’s Mannady (Parry’s). The group boarded S2 coach in Silambu Express (Sengottai to Chennai Egmore) on Saturday. After dinner, Narayanan took the upper berth. He is believed to have slipped and fallen to the floor of the coach at Maraimalai Nagar, but the others in the group failed to notice it immediately. After 10 minutes, some people found him lying on the floor bleeding from the ear. His co-passengers tried to help him, as he was unconscious. The authorities were alerted. At Tambaram station, the railway health staff who reached the compartment declared Narayanan dead. The Tambaram GRP registered a case and sent the body to the Chromepet GH for postmortem. Doctors there told police they found blood around the left ear and that a piece from the broken spectacles may have pierced him. He had removed his spectacles and placed them in the pocket on the left side of his shirt, police said. Police said he was allotted berth 57 (lower), but slept on berth 60 (upper). “We suspect he could have swapped seats with someone and slept on the upper berth from where he slipped while he was asleep,” said an investigating officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/72-yr-old-dies-after-fall-from-trains-top-berth/articleshow/88266076.cms||Sindhu Kannan

---||Chennai||Chennai Sangamam to return in different avatar across cities||Chennai: The beats of Thappattam and Oyilattam and the popular folk dance, Karagattam would soon resonate again on Chennai streets, with the DMK government proposing to bring back the Tamil cultural festival Chennai Sangamam. The folk-art forms would be reintroduced to Chennaiites during Pongal – January 14, 15 and 16, but with a different title. The plan is to extend the much-awaited festival to other parts of the state, beginning with Madurai, Trichy and Coimbatore. Art and culture minister Thangam Thennarasu announced the conduct of a cultural festival during the budget session. The department is engaged in fine tuning the seven locations, parks and public places in Chennai where the events would be held. “It will be a celebration of Tamil life, culture and heritage. It will be anchored with folk arts, music and food. More than 500 artists from different parts of the state will participate,” Tourism, Culture, Religious Endowments principal secretary B Chandra Mohan said. Since they are open-air events, the risk of Covid-19 is minimal and all Covid protocols would be followed. The venues that are likely to be part of the fork art festival include, Natesan park, Anna Nagar Tower park, Island Grounds and Tiruvottiyur. The confluence of art forms would include Kaisilambattam of Kancheepuram, Aadhi Melam and Servaittam of Salem, Karagam, Kavadi and Naiyandi Melam, Therukoothu of Thanjavur, Isai Nadagam and Poikkal Kudhirai of Trichy, Marakkal Attam and Devarattam of Madurai, Bharathavar Kazhiyal Attam, Kaniyan Koothu and Villu Pattu, Thorpavai Koothu of Tirunelveli, Valli Kummi Kolattam from Coimbatore and the tribal art of The Nilgiris. Artists would be drawn from other parts of the country as well. “What crowds we drew! We were blessed to see audiences in huge numbers to enjoy our art in various places in the city,” said ‘Kalaimamani’ V Rajanidhi, an expert in Kaisilambattam from Kancheepuram, reminiscing the days of Chennai Sangamam. High-energy beats and the traditional food drew a swarm of people to parks and public places during the Tamil festival. DMK MP Kanimozhi, who was instrumental in introducing the cultural festival in 2007 said, “Like the folk artists, I am happy too.” Many folk artists look forward to the cultural festival considering the loss of livelihood in the pandemic days. A sizable number has taken up other vocations to make ends meet. “Sangamam brought to the fore the art forms which were not known to many people in the town,” said ‘Kalaimamani’ Thenmozhi Rajendran, a Karagattam expert of Thanjavur. In a related development, the tourism department has issued orders to the directorate of trade and commerce, ELCOT, directorate of school, and colleges of all universities to feature folk arts in cultural occasions.

---||Chennai||Chennai: Bus travel remains a pain as MTC yet to run full fleet||CHENNAI: Metropolitan Transport Corporation’s patronage has almost reached pre-Covid levels and buses are overflowing with passengers during peak hours, but there are no expansion plans on the anvil.  According to official data, less than 15 lakh passengers travelled by MTC buses daily when full-fledged services resumed in July after the lockdown. This figure has been on the rise ever since the government announced that women can travel for free by government city buses. Now that educational institutions have reopened, daily footfalls have crossed the 28-lakh mark.  Given that more students are opting for offline classes at their respective educational institutions, the demand for MTC buses is set to increase further. But the question is whether the government has any plans to meet this growing requirement.  During the peak hours, almost all buses are full, and many can be seen risking their lives by travelling on footboards. “Chennai definitely needs at least 5,400 buses to handle the peak hour travel load,” said a senior MTC official, requesting anonymity, referring to existing government norms.  The Union housing and urban affairs ministry has advised metropolitan cities to have 60 buses for every one lakh population. Chennai currently has at least 90 lakh residents.  But the state transport department is yet to even float tenders to procure more diesel or electric buses for the city as announced during the budget session in August.  Regular bus commuters have complained that MTC has diverted most buses along on-demand routes within city limits and reduced operations in suburban areas.

The children, don’t let go of the feet of those targeted until paid. The malnourished monkey is a sad sight, say animal activists, pointed out that using them for begging is not allowed, while others demand action against the racket. “It seems like an organized racket as the children do not leave even if we say no. They hold onto our legs, which is harassment, and there is a possibility of us being accused of manhandling by those behind the racket if we attempt to push them away,” said K Naresh, a regular at the beach. Personnel at the Anna Square and Marina police stations told TOI that while they do not receive written complaints from the public about such incidents, members of patrol teams intervene when informed orally by some beach-goers. On Monday, a team of forest department officials acted on a tip-off and rescued a baby monkey used to seek alms but the children with it managed to the give the slip. A senior wildlife official said a group of north Indian children were involved in this. The rescued monkey belongs to the species Bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata) which is covered under Schedule II (Part I) of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. “People found to possess this animal will face punishment in the form of both penalty and imprisonment. First time offenders can be punished with imprisonment up to 3 years along with a penalty of 25,000, while repeat offenders could get imprisonment up to 7 years along with the penalty,” said the official. Activists said the baby monkeys involved, mostly malnourished, are captured from forest areas in Kancheepuram and Vellore. Another wildlife official said the range office in Velachery used to get such complaints once or twice in a month. Three months ago, they received a call about an adult bonnet macaque being kept in Parry's corner. The animal was found to be chained by an old woman who, however, managed to escape.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/gangs-using-kids-monkeys-to-beg-on-marina/articleshow/88266082.cms||---

Some regular commuters, particularly office-goers, said the crowds especially during peak hours have increased in the last two months and there is barely any space to maintain physical distance. According to latest numbers from CMRL, ridership in metro trains have crossed 90% of the pre-covid daily average of 1.16 lakhs and at times it has touched 1.4 lakhs a day.“Trains from Wimco Nagar already come packed when they arrive at Central metro. Between Central Metro and LIC where I alight every day, there is barely any space to even stand. There is no way to follow any social distancing. On top of that, some people simply lower their mask,” said S Indhu, who travels from Thirumangalam to LIC daily to her workplace. “Either CMRL must restrict crowds or introduce first-class coaches again for people willing to spend double the ticket price and travel with some physical distance,” she added.Many regular commuters said traveling in the first class coach was safer as very few use it and there was space to maintain social distance while on the commute. A few months ago, CMRL converted the first class coach into a women's only coach to provide commuters with enough space to maintain physical distance. But footfalls have gradually increased over the months since services resumed in June 2021, a few months after Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar line opened and ticket prices were slashed. In November, an average 97,000 people traveled daily. An official said the daily numbers have now crossed one lakh average this month and it touched a maximum of 1.42lakh on December 10. With the festive season on, CMRL expects the numbers to increase even further in the coming days.Hema Krishnan, who travels from Shenoy Nagar to DMS station, said he has started reaching the station an hour early to avoid the peak hour crowds. “Earlier I used to get to the station at around 8.45am. Now, I am there at 7.45am itself. Otherwise, the train is packed like suburban services,” he said.A CMRL official said besides extending the peak hour services, special squads have been deployed to ensure passengers adhere to Covid norms. “We cannot restrict crowds by stopping people in the stations. Police personnel deployed at our stations also have a flying squad who check coaches through the CCTV and walk into the train at every station to tell passengers, who take off their masks, to wear them properly,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/bring-1st-class-coaches-back-on-metro-trains/articleshow/88266085.cms||---

This is the second cave-in in the last six months. Metrowater has has barricaded the site. An official from the agency who inspected the area said, “The TNEB had laid underground cables at the spot about six months ago. They didn’t check with us before drilling leading to the formation of holes in the pipes just 3m below. Over a period, the seepage has caused the road to cave in,” said the official. But leakage is not the only issue. “Due to the flooding, the groundwater is now available within 3-5ft in T Nagar. Now, we are de-watering the cavity. Only after that we can check pipeline damage. We will begin rectification work in a day,” said the official. The corporation official said they were in touch with Traffic police and metro water. Lack of coordination between departments is leading to a huge loss in public money, said activist P Nakkeeran of Arappor Iyakkam.Meanwhile the road has been made one-way allowing traffic from T Nagar and Pondy Bazaar.

All were differently abled. Some had won in a frog race, others in candle blowing, spotting the right picture, and sorting colour balls. It was part of the therapy.  The GH, as part of World Disability Day (December 3), has been conducting various activities at its District Early Intervention Centre set up under the National Health Mission. On Monday, the paediatric ward hosted hundreds of kids for various game competitions.  The ward was full of play equipment like swings and trampolines, while the walls were coloured with cartoon characters. Some hospital staff were dressed like teddy bears. The intention was to create an atmosphere of inclusiveness.  Doctors said children with intellectual disabilities like autism and lack of speech development also have motor disabilities. Dr Ganesh, professor of paediatrics, said speech therapy, occupation therapy and physiotherapy were done in creative ways. “By drawing, they get to identify colours, frog jump helps improving walking skills and candle blowing helps in speech therapy,” he said. Parent of three-year-old Yazhini told TOI she could not utter words like ‘Amma’ or ‘Appa’ but through such simple and fun therapies, she got 90% of her speech. Dr Rema Chandramohan, director of institute of social paediatrics, said they had begun training Anganwadi workers to identify differently children in schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/world-disability-day-it-is-therapy-with-play-at-stanley-gh/articleshow/88266088.cms||Omjasvin M D

---||India||Bustard order will hit green push, SC told||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday sought modification of the Supreme Court's April 19 order for putting underground power transmission cables in vast areas of Rajasthan and Gujarat for protection of endangered Great Indian Bustard (GIB), saying it is technically not feasible, cost intensive and will be a huge setback to India's international commitment to move steadily towards renewable energy. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta requested CJI NV Ramana for an urgent hearing on the Centre's plea citing a recent report of technical group comprising experts from transmission and power sector and members from Wildlife Institute of India (WII). The Centre said the cost will work out to Rs 12 crore a km and the aim could be achieved by installing bird diverters. It said GIBs could get effective protection from electrocution by installing bird diverters, as was used on Gwalior-Jaipur line by Power Grid Corporation to protect Indian Vulture and Egyptian Vulture and in Bhuj-Banaskantha line to protect Flamingos and Cranes. It said no bird collision with overhead power cables is reported from these two areas after the installation of bird diverters. He said, "The SC's April 19, 2021 judgment has vast adverse implications for the power sector in India and energy transition away from fossil fuels. Energy transition is essential for reducing emission and controlling climate change. India has made International commitments including under the agreement signed in Paris in 2015 under United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change for transition to non-fossil fuels and for emissions reduction." "India has set a target to achieve installed renewable energy capacity (excluding large hydro) of 175 GW by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030. It is submitted that the area sought to be debarred in Rajasthan and Gujarat is 80,688 sq km (78,580 sq km in Rajasthan and 2,108 sq km in Gujarat), whereas the GIBs dwell in only 1% of this area, and the present habitat of GIBs is protected by enclosures which occupy only 1% of the above 80,688 sq km. GIBs largely migrate inside these enclosures," the Centre. "The area being debarred is bigger than many states of India, and also contains a very large proportion of the total solar and wind energy potential of the country and, in particular, has very high solar irradiance. Undergrounding high voltage power lines is technically not possible. Undergrounding medium/ low voltage lines over such a large area will lead to high cost of RE produced from the area, which in turn, would badly hurt the cause of RE in the country," it said. Terming the SC-mandated undergrounding of power cables over such large areas globally unprecedented, the Centre said, "So far, only a miniscule 3% of the estimated potential of around 263 GW renewable energy of this area has been tapped. If he remaining potential stays untapped, we will need an additional 93,000 MW of coal fired capacity to replace the unutilised renewable energy in future which would cause an adverse direct impact on environment." Implementation of the SC order "shall lead to huge delay in commissioning of already awarded and under-construction renewable energy projects in these states, which otherwise would get commissioned in the next couple of years. Considering the practical and technical challenges in laying the power lines underground, development of future projects in Rajasthan and Gujarat will also be impacted."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bustard-order-will-hit-green-push-sc-told/articleshow/88266120.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

It will also launch a single-window system to facilitate planning permission for layouts and housing plots within 60 days. Making the announcement on Monday, chief minister M K Stalin said the government was prepared to revive the old laws pertaining to the housing and urban development department in tune with the latest technology and with the aim to simplify functioning of the construction sector. Amendments would be brought to the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, based on the current urban growth, he added. “The government is poised to make Tamil Nadu a slum-free state by 2031. Accordingly, 9.53 lakh houses would be constructed for the poor in the next one decade. So far, the Union government has approved construction of 6.2 lakh housing units at a financial outlay of 31,179 crore,” he said. The chief minister made the announcements after inaugurating the Statecon 2021 of developers’ body CREDAI (Tamil Nadu) in Chennai. Moreover, there is a proposal to reconstruct old tenements of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board under the PPP model. Steps are being taken to allow, under the affordable rental housing complex scheme, private firms to construct on their own land dormitories which can then be rented out for beneficiaries for a period of 25 years. This will mainly benefit guest workers from other states, he said. “We are planning to upgrade the Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex to international standards. The mofussil bus terminuses at Kilambakkam and Kuthambakkam will be completed soon and opened for public,” Stalin said.  Later, addressing the gathering on the occasion, industries secretary S Krishnan said that policies for M-Sand and mining are under preparation. “The M-sand policy document is already under preparation and will be ready shortly. We will be in a position to have a policy, which will be more sustainable and at the same time ensuring that the prices are kept at reasonable rates. Similarly, a sustainable mining policy is also being prepared, which includes assessing the total available mining capacity.

This reporter, who raised the issue on Twitter and tagged the civic body on December 10, was responded two days later by the officials. The officials also posted visuals of garbage being cleared out and the area behind 7H bus stop being disinfected with bleaching powder on December 12. However, 24 hours after this social media exchange, all six bins were seen with overflowing garbage and cows nibbling at the strewn waste. The waste at this location is being dumped by door-to-door garbage collection staff. The compactor vehicles that need to immediately shift the waste to the segregation site delay the process leading to rotting of garbage. The mound of trash further grows with residents using the same spot to fling the garbage from their homes. Ambattur zone official said that the compactor vehicle was on duty and its third trip was scheduled for 3 PM. “The vehicle collects the garbage four times a day,” he said. Irked residents question why six bins are placed near temples, schools, apartments and EB offices are there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/garbage-returns-24-hours-after-cleanup/articleshow/88266139.cms||Omjasvin M D

In Zimbabwe, where vaccination coverage for the first dose touched 27%, there has been 157 times increase in cases in the last two weeks. “It is clear we cannot afford to let our guard down,” health secretary J Radhakrishnan said. “We have to deal with caution during the festive season. There will be crowd in shops, places of worship, besides family reunions and parties in hotels and at homes. This can pave the way to a spike in the number of cases. Vaccination and Covid appropriate behaviour are the forefront weapons in the fight against this infection now,” he said.At least 11 of the 38 districts have a test positivity rate above state average of 0.7%. With schools, colleges, work placement, malls, markets, and entertainment places allowing 100% occupancy, next three months are a period of vulnerability, officials said. The health department has recommended that there should be no mass gatherings permitted in containment zones. It has also urged that those showing signs of Covid should not be allowed to travel in trains, buses, and other public transport. The state has asked officials to track close contact, convince them for tests and initiate early treatment for those infected.On Monday, Chennai (114) and Coimbatore (101) reported the highest number of cases, while Chennai (3) and Erode (3) reported the highest number of deaths. While Chengalpet, Tirupur, Kancheepuram, Trichy, Pudukottai and Dindigul reported one death each and 30 districts reported zero deaths. Ramanathapuram and Theni reported zero cases when 21 other districts reported less than 10 cases each. One patient who came from the UAE tested positive for the viral infection.At the end of the day, 702 patients were discharged and 7,666 were still under treatment for the viral infection. Meanwhile 2.5 lakh people took the vaccination on Monday. With this nearly 83% of people have taken the first dose and nearly 52% have completed the course.

---||Chennai||AAI planning to build new ATC complex at Chennai airport||CHENNAI: The Airport Authority of India (AAI) is planning to build a new air traffic control complex so that the space of the existing one can be used to construct more parking bays for planes at the Chennai Airport. The move is a part of a series of work proposed to augment aircraft handling capacity to match the proposed increase in passenger capacity when terminal expansion is completed. The integrated terminal, which will be opened next year along with the new building in place of the old international arrival terminal, will equip the airport to handle 30-35million passengers per year.  An AAI official said that the plan to have a new ATC complex is underway. A new location will be identified, most probably in the space being cleared by removing a portion of the residential colony of the authority. "A new residential complex is being built on the opposite side of the GST road and the space freed up in the existing colony can be used to build the new ATC," he added. There are also plans to move the fuel station to a location adjacent to the second runway where a bigger fuel farm is being planned. This will free up space from the air side of the domestic terminal to the Meenambakkam village. "Around three to four parking bays can be built when land is freed up. This will be designed to accommodate small and widebody planes as part of the multiple apron ramp system. Under this model, bays will be designed for use by planes of different sizes. This helps in managing space in an efficient manner. When there is no cargo or widebody planes, we can use it to handle two narrow body planes," he said. Sources said that the plan was also part of attempts to add facilities using existing space as the second airport was taking time. Though the pandemic has slowed down the need for a new airport because the existing facility can handle passengers for more years with the ongoing expansion, AAI authorities feel that there could be a boom in traffic once the restrictions are lifted. AAI has straightened a taxiway and has made space to park cargo planes by demolishing old cargo terminals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/aai-planning-to-build-new-atc-complex-at-city-airport/articleshow/88266143.cms||V Ayyappan

The IGCC where doctors and paramedical staff are on emergency duty round the clock witnesses the arrival of almost 450 patients from different parts of the state every day. IGCC’s chief casualty medical officer Dr Abhijit Singh said the 200 beds included 60 intensive care units (ICUs). “While 40 ICUs are meant for medical and surgical emergencies, the remaining are for orthopaedic surgery, neurosurgery and plastic surgery,” he added. Singh continued, “A large number of road accident victims and patients with problems like myocardial infarction (heart attack), cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and chronic respiratory diseases visit the emergency department. They are immediately taken care of by a team of doctors that gives them medicines, performs urgent surgeries and carries out necessary pathological and radiological investigations. Once they are stable, they are shifted to the wards concerned.” At present, the entire PMCH is being redeveloped in a phase-wise manner in order to make it a world-class hospital with 5,500 beds and other new features.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-to-virtually-open-igcc-at-pmch/articleshow/88262916.cms||VK Tripathi

The counsel for the high court registrar general, who is the petitioner in this case, N Ashwini Kumar said the affidavit filed by the CBI director lacks merit and details as sought by the high court. Ashwini Kumar said the CBI stated that Punch Prabhakar surrendered his Indian passport and is acting in a manner where he feels he is beyond the laws of this country. He said this conclusion is erroneous as the affidavit speaks about the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with USA. The bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy observed that the real progress in the case was only made in November 2021 and some additional time may be given to the CBI. The high court directed CBI to explain the steps taken under MLAT to apprehend the accused and posted the matter for January 25, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/explain-steps-to-arrest-punch-prabhakar-hc/articleshow/88264025.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Justice K Chandru. Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra. during the hearing on social media case, said the comments made by Justice Chandru were “uncalled for and unnecessary”. The chief justice said Justice Chandru does not hail from this place or belong to AP high court. Describing him as a ‘judicial celebrity’, the chief justice said he gained limelight with the recent movie ‘Jai Bheem’ and seeks to be in that limelight. While speaking at a conference in Vijayawada, Justice Chandru had said the AP high court was acting beyond the scope of its limits and trying to achieve more than justice. He also said the state government was fighting with the high court instead of its political rivals to pass legislations. Reacting to Justice Chandru, Justice Battu Devanand said the former judge’s comments lower the prestige of the high court. Justice Devanand went on to say that if Justice Chandru had any objections to any judge or judgement, he should have confined his comments to that aspect only instead of passing comments on the high court in entirety. Citing the incident of the late Dr K Sudhakar who was suspended from Narsipatnam Area Hospital last year, Justice Devanand said police beat a doctor indiscriminately and in full public view, and if Justice Chandru wanted to fight for human rights, he should speak to the people of Visakhapatnam about Dr Sudhakar. Justice Devanand also questioned how it would be wrong to direct the government to pay bills when contractors who executed works are attempting to commit suicide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/justice-chandrus-remarks-uncalled-for-says-cj-mishra/articleshow/88264046.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Lakshminarayana, who has been under treatment at Hyderabad since the day the Crime Investigation Department (CID) conducted searches at his house, moved a lunch motion petition seeking bail in the case on grounds of his health. Posani Venkateswarlu, the counsel for Lakshminarayana, argued that the CID has given notices to attend for enquiry in the case on Monday. He said Lakshminarayana has been admitted to a private hospital and is presently not in a position to attend the enquiry. As the CID may treat his absence as violation of notice and may arrest him, he sought the high court to grant him bail considering his health. The additional advocate general told the high court that on the day of issuance of notices, the CID was not aware of his health condition and given his present condition, they do not intend to take any coercive steps.

Railways has set February 2022 deadline to complete the work at the stretch of about 11.50km. ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said the Railway Board had sanctioned Rs 159 crore in the 2016-17 fiscal to carry out track doubling work between Patliputra Junction and Pahlezaghat. The project, which entails an expenditure of Rs 3,523 crore, also includes signalling and electrification on the entire route between Patliputra and Sonepur stations. “The two-way traffic flow on the bridge will ease traffic on the route,” the CPRO said, adding the track doubling will prove a boon for the people of Sonepur, Hajipur, Chhapra, Gopalganj, Muzaffarpur, Motihari and Bettiah. According to the CPRO, the Rs 600 crore Patna-Sonepur rail bridge was first sanctioned during 1997-98 fiscal. “However, the project’s cost was revised to Rs 624 crore in 2002 and Rs 1,389 crore in 2006-07 fiscal. It was then decided that the bridge had the utility of both rail-cum-road facility with sharing cost of Rs 835 crore for railways and Rs 554 crore for state,” he said, adding the final estimate of the bridge catapulted to Rs 3,080 crore (Rs 1,681 for railways and the rest for the state). Former PM late Atal Behari Vajpayee had laid the foundation of the bridge on February 3, 2002 while PM Narendra Modi had dedicated this bridge to the country on March 12, 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/track-doubling-work-on-patna-sonepur-rail-bridge-to-be-completed-by-feb/articleshow/88263103.cms||Kumod Verma

At a meeting on Monday, additional chief secretary, mines and petroleum, Subodh Agarwal said the department will start mapping forest land, mineral deposits and land records to expedite the process. “On the lines of Bansi Paharpur, we will divert land in Beri Ganga in Jodhpur and Balsamand area for mining. Also, we will identify mineral resources in forest areas which could be developed for auctioning and mining,” said Agarwal in a release. The Centre allowed mining in Bansi Paharpur of protected forest land so that the prized pink sandstone could be used for construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Earlier, the sandstones were mined illegally. Sources in the mines department said the state government would write to the Centre for approval so that legal mining activities could be undertaken in the forest areas. “Today, in most of the forest areas, mining is happening illegally, creating law order situation while depriving the state government royalty revenues. If mining is allowed legally, many of the problems can be solved, which will also benefit the state government,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-toys-with-idea-of-mining-in-forest-land-a-la-bansi-paharpur/articleshow/88264954.cms||---
---||Kanpur||IIT-K develops first-of-its-kind soil testing device||Times News Network Kanpur: In a Foundation for Innovation and Research in Science and Technology (FIRST-IITK), IIT-Kanpur has developed a portable soil testing device that can detect soil health in just 90 seconds through an embedded mobile application. The device will assist farmers for obtaining soil health parameters with recommended dose of fertilizers. The technology titled Portable Soil Testing Device - ‘Bhu Parikshak’ has been transferred to an agritech company named AgroNxt Services private limited. The invention has been developed by a team of inventors at IIT-K, consisting of Prof Jayant Kumar Singh from chemical engineering department, Pallav Prince, Ashar Ahmad, Yashasvi Khemani and Mohd Aamir Khan. IIT-K claimed that the first-of-its-kind novel invention is based on Near Infrared Spectroscopy technology that provides real time soil analysis report on smart phones with an embedded mobile application named Bhu Parikshak available on Google Play Store. The device can detect six important soil parameters namely -Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Organic Carbon, Clay contents and Cation Exchange Capacity. It also recommends the required dose of fertilizers for the field and crops. The mobile application has been made user friendly through the user interface which is available in local languages. The device can test upto one lakh soil test samples, the highest testing capability of a device. The technology has been transferred to Agronxt with an objective of manufacturing the device through bulk production to benefit farmers. The technology licensing agreement was formally signed between IIT-K and AgroNxt Services in the presence of director IIT-K Prof Abhay Karandikar and director AgroNxt Services Rajat Vardhan on December 11. Prof Amitabha Bandyopadhyay, Prof A R Harish and Ravi Pandey from the institute were also present on the occasion. Professor Karandikar said, “I am delighted for IIT-K team for developing such a novel device that will assist individual farmers in assessing the health of their soil in almost no time. This is another step towards achieving the goal of technology self-reliance that IIT-K thrives for.” The portable and wireless soil testing device requires only 5g of dry soil sample for detecting macronutrients. Once the soil is poured into the 5 cm long cylindrical shaped device, it connects itself with the mobile through Bluetooth, and starts analysing the soil for 90 seconds and the results appear on the screen in the form of a soil health report, which is accessible on Bhu Parikshak cloud service with unique ID.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/iit-k-develops-first-of-its-kind-soil-testing-device/articleshow/88264101.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Amaravati set to be Andhra Pradesh’s judicial capital?||VIJAYAWADA: The government’s decision to clear the proposal for construction of a new building for AP high court in Amaravati may be an indication that chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is thinking of making it the state’s judicial capital. Chief justice Prashant Kumar Mishra laid the foundation stone for the construction of the additional building for the high court on Monday. The new building would come up on the north side of the present complex in three acres. It may be recalled that the government withdrew the three capitals bills in the assembly last month. At the time, the chief minister said the bills would be reintroduced in a better format but did not elaborate. However, he referred to the Sri Bagh pact made after the creation of Andhra state in 1953 from composite Madras presidency, as per which the capital was given to Rayalaseema region, while the high court was to come up in the coastal region. Sources say Jagan is keen to ensure that aspirations of people of all three regions are considered while taking a fresh call on the three capitals. He is believed to be considering the proposal to keep the high court in Amaravati and make it the judicial capital, shift the assembly to Kurnool and make it the legislative capital, while shifting the executive (secretariat) to Visakhapatnam as per his original plans. The government has granted Rs 33.5 crore to construct the additional building at Nowluru in Amaravati, where the high court is functioning now. The shifting of the high court to Kurnool could have been a long and tedious process involving the nod of the central government, the Supreme Court and the President. The high court had also questioned the prerogative of the government in deciding its location while it was hearing the batch of petitions filed challenging the trifurcation of Amaravati. Considering all these aspects, the chief minister is learned to have decided to retain the high court in Amaravati and declare it as the judicial capital, while having the legislature in Kurnool and executive in Visakhapatnam. Sources say the chief minister was advised that the high court would not interfere with the decision of the government on deciding where the executive must sit and where the legislature must meet. It is also understood that the chief minister has asked the law department to prepare the three capitals bills taking these factors and those raised in the courts till now into consideration. The bills are likely to be tabled during the winter session of the assembly in November 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/amaravati-set-to-be-aps-judicial-capital/articleshow/88264010.cms||Gopi Dara

I have got the blessing of crores of people.” Earlier, the newlywed couple was given a grand welcome by the RJD functionaries and workers who could be seen raising slogans, beating drums and dancing at the airport. Even at 10, Circular Road, the official bungalow allotted to Tejashwi’s mother and former CM Rabri Devi, the scene was almost the same. The moment Tejashwi’s car arrived outside the bungalow, party workers, who were waiting anxiously to have the glimpse of their leader’s better half, rushed towards the vehicle. Senior party leaders, including RJD state president Jagadanand Singh and Lalu’s close aide Bhola Yadav had gone to the airport to receive the couple. Sources said the new bride touched the duo’s feet to seek their blessing. Even the Lalu family was all excited to welcome the newlywed couple.

---||Business||Banks, e-tailers scramble to comply with RBI’s card data storage norms||MUMBAI: E-commerce merchants and banks are racing against time to implement the Reserve Bank of India’s mandate on card storage norms. Some e-commerce merchants are finding it a challenge because compliance requires readiness by multiple entities in the transaction chain who are in various stages of preparedness. According to a senior executive in a payment processing company, the industry may seek a relaxation of the deadline. However, the central bank is taking a hard stance and an extension looks unlikely at present. The RBI’s mandate is that from January 1, no merchant can store a customer’s card numbers in its system. Several merchants have started complying, which is why customers are getting an option during payment, asking them whether they would like to store their card in a secured manner. Merchants offering this option are already compliant with the new norms. From January 1, merchants who do not offer this option or customers who do not choose this feature will have to key in the card’s details. Payment aggregators have moved fast to launch a service that enables a merchant to ask banks to store a customer’s card details and receive a token representing the card. This token will enable the merchant to allow customers to make future payments without entering the card number again. According to industry experts there are at least four entities here — the merchant-acquiring bank, the payment network (Mastercard/RuPay/Visa), the payment gateway, and the card-issuing bank. While it is the merchant who is directly impacted, it is the merchant-acquiring bank that has to be ready first. Payment service provider Razorpay was among the early facilitators with the launch of ‘Razorpay TokenHQ’ — a multi-network card-on-file (CoF) tokenisation solution. On Monday, Worldline announced a plug-and-play solution for merchants to enable CoF tokenisation using single integration. The solution is already integrated across payment networks (Visa, Mastercard, RuPay) and has partnered the largest number of banks. According to Worldline VP (products & solution, digital commerce) Jagdish Kumar, the required service termed CoF tokenisation is ready. “Our clients are in advanced stage of integrating and testing the APIs at present. They will be live with the Worldline tokenisation solution well before the deadline of December 31, 2021,” said Kumar. He added that the RBI’s guidelines on tokenisation will help to boost customer confidence in cards as a payment method and encourage the adoption of digital payments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-e-tailers-scramble-to-comply-with-rbis-card-data-storage-norms/articleshow/88264895.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh high court dismisses plea to review fee reimbursement order||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Monday dismissed the review petition filed by the state government seeking to amend the order which directed the government to credit the fee reimbursement amount into college accounts instead of giving the same to the mothers of students. Justice Kongara Vijaya Lakshmi said she is not inclined to review the order. Advocate general S Sriram, arguing on behalf of the state government, said the decision to credit the money in the accounts of mothers of students was taken to fix pilferages and to bring in more transparency and accountability into the scheme. He said the government has put enough safeguards to ensure that the scheme would not get misused, like introducing compulsory attendance sans which the it would be discontinued. On the other hand, the advocates for private college managements said because of non-payment of fees, they are facing lot of financial problems as the government has also put in a rule not to insist on payment of fees from students. As a considerable percentage of students are not paying fees, Jagananna Vidya Deevena should be continued as earlier by crediting the amount to college accounts, they said. Advocate general S Sriram, arguing on behalf of the state government, said the decision to credit the money in the accounts of mothers of students was taken to fix pilferages and to bring in more transparency and accountability into the scheme||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-dismisses-plea-to-review-fee-reimbursement-order/articleshow/88263987.cms||---

Cops recovered gold and silver ornaments worth Rs 60 lakh that were stolen from various temples. Vijayawada police commissioner Kanti Rana Tata said the accused, identified as Angoth Ramulu Naik (63), is a resident of Tukaram Gate in Secunderabad. He was arrested for stealing gold and silver ornaments from a temple at Avanigadda in Krishna district in 2011. He was convicted and in jail for some time. After his release, he started looting temples again. The modus operandi of Ramulu Naik was to carry out a recce in the temples’ vicinity during the day. At night, he used to break open the temple doors with an iron rod and steal silver and gold ornaments. After stealing the valuables, he would bury them at a nearby place to evade the police radar. Later, he would dig out the ornaments, crush them using stones and sell off the pieces when he needed money. Vijayawada police launched an investigation into a theft case reported at Kusuma Harinadha Mandir in One Town police station limits. After analysing clues collected from the crime scene and CCTV footage, they zeroed in on Ramulu Naik. On Sunday evening, they traced him near Prakasam Barrage and apprehended him. They recovered 80 kilos of silver and 225 grams of gold stolen from 18 temples over a span of three years. Ramulu Naik was also involved in 10 cases in Guntur district, three cases each in West Godavari and Krishna district and one case under Miryalaguda police station limits in Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/temple-thief-wanted-in-18-cases-arrested-gold-silver-recovered/articleshow/88263981.cms||---

---||Business||Men now give more time to home chores||MUMBAI: In what could go a long way in smashing stereotypes — and perhaps even bridge gender balance at workplaces — a survey has revealed that 35% of men began contributing more time to household chores after the pandemic. With a hybrid work model now becoming the norm, and a large number of people working out of their homes, a study by Avtar on chore division and dynamics in Indian households reveals a 22% increase in the number of men who spent 4-5 hours performing chores at home. This is a clear sign that the burden of performing these tasks, which otherwise was the sole responsibility of women, is now beginning to get shared. Over 300 professionals (43% from metro cities, and 57% from tier-2 & -3 locations) were surveyed on their contribution to the ubiquitous 3Cs of cooking, cleaning, and caring. The inequalities are, however, still quite stark, especially for working women. Among double-income couples too there is an unequal distribution of time spent on household chores. Among married respondents, 33% women spent 4-5 hours per day on such activities versus 3% men. Age demographics have a big role to play. Up to 83% of the Gen Y population spend equal time (2-3 hours) in household chores along with their partners. However, only 56% of Gen X spend the same time in such activities, which were shared equally with their partners. Organisations have a role to play in ensuring household chores get equally divided between partners. Avtar founder-president Saundarya Rajesh said, “To foster a culture of allyship, it is important that organisations inspire their employees to be allies in all spheres of their lives. And what better time to do this than the post-Covid business recovery phase, when the learnings from the most VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity & ambiguity) times of our lives are still fresh with us.” Allyship is a culture some organisations are building to beat gender stereotypes through workshops and aggressive sensitisation. Ruchi Bhalla, country head & VP HR (APAC) at logistics tech firm Pitney Bowes, said, “The pandemic has impacted us all in different ways while highlighting existing inequities. It has also served to heighten awareness of the ‘power of allies’ and the role organisations can play to amplify everyday allyship and inclusion. A lot of women are finding it harder to re-pivot their careers and claim their right to step out to work. Households have become dependent on them being around. True allyship is about everyday action and inclusion. Allyship at work will help reset at home too.” Bhalla said one of the ways in which organisations can practise allyship is through coaching leaders and people managers to sensitise them to foster an organisation-wide commitment and proactive approach to building an inclusive work culture. “Allies need to be aware of the role that they can play every day to make a difference — in office and at home in their everyday lives. It’s about letting people know that organisations recognise them as a whole — as parents, spouses, and caregivers, beyond their role as employees,” said Bhalla. Aditya Mittal, interim CHRO of Citi India, said, “We support people bringing their full selves to work and so we are focused on making people more sensitive at the workplace, which in turn can translate to their home lives. Building a network of strong male allies enables the institution to tap into the true potential of a diverse talent base.” Inclusive-hiring manager workshops, respect at work and unconscious bias training are all held on a regular basis at Citi for all employees to sensitise and build an inclusive culture. The examples provided in these workshops extend beyond work scenarios, which builds awareness around unconscious biases in daily life. According to the Avtar report, 31% of Gen Y men reported near equal load-sharing at homes, with them spending 2-5 hours on household chores along with their partners. About 91% of the respondents with children said that household chores are not divided based on gender in their homes. Post-pandemic, with the divide between work and home blurring, and increasing awareness on intentional inclusion, Avtar anticipates that the dynamics in chore division in Indian households are shifting, albeit slowly, towards the more gender-equal territory. “Inclusive companies offering creative solutions to further gender parity in their workspaces have seen a rise in the women’s workforce participation. Now when the country is recovering from the after effects of Covid, the Omicron variant is posing a new threat. India today is in need of a gender-positive recovery. We need systems and policies to include men in the conversations by providing equitable care-giving options, upskilling process to boost gender parity at workplaces,” said Rajesh. According to OECD’s data of 2014, the gender chore gap in India was 300 min/day (the average time an Indian woman spends on the 3Cs is 352 mins/day, whereas a man spends 52 mins/day).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/men-now-give-more-time-to-home-chores/articleshow/88264849.cms||Namrata Singh

District agriculture officer Rajesh Pratap Singh said a dedicated market will soon be started at the newly established wholesale vegetable market in Khatopur for the farmers to sell their biofarm produce. “The agriculture department has identified at least five key places across the town, where such vegetables would be sold through dedicated counters,” he said. The initiative is a part of the dedicated biofarming corridor scheme to promote biofarming among farmers. The scheme was launched in as many as 17 districts of the state two years ago. “While the focus initially was on encouraging farmers to switch over to biofarming, the agriculture department is now laying emphasis on giving farmers access to markets where they could sell their produce,” Singh said. As per data available with the district agriculture office, farmers in different blocks have undertaken biofarming on altogether 1663 acres of land under 27 dedicated corridors selected for the scheme. As many as 1779 farmers are involved in it. “To promote the initiative, funds to the tune of more than Rs1.91crore have been distributed among these farmers as input subsidies,” Singh said. According to Gyaneshwar Kumar, in-charge of the biofarming corridor in the district, the farmers under the scheme were advised to not compromise on the quality of their produce as it must carry a qualitative distinctness in order to fetch higher prices in the market. A meeting of all the officials concerned and farmers was held in this regard with the officials of the department last week, giving necessary tips to reap the benefits of their produce. Jaishankar Prasad, a farmer from Tetri-Dandari block, who participated at a national-level bioagriculture fair held in Goa earlier this year, also shared his experiences in the meeting. The officials of agriculture department said apart from the dedicated corridor scheme, biofarming is also planned on 100 hectares of land under five clusters in Nao-Kothi, Garhpura and Bakhri blocks of the district under traditional agriculture development scheme. “Besides, a plan is underway to carry out biofarming on 1500 hectares of land along Ganga river, for which interested farmers are being identified under the district,” Gyaneshwar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dedicated-market-for-biofarm-vegetables-in-begusarai-soon/articleshow/88263134.cms||---

The air quality index (AQI) level of Patna stood at 301 on Monday due to calm wind, haze and other meteorological conditions which are unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants in the air. Track the pollution level in your cityOn Sunday, the city’s AQI was recorded at 304. However, the air quality is likely to improve marginally over the next two days due to winds coming from west. As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin, the overall AQI of 301 for Patna was the average of AQI level at DRM office-Khagaul (363), Eco Park (356), BIT-Mesra, Patna (350), Planetarium (347), S K Memorial Hall (281) and Patna City (108). A “very poor” AQI essentially means that people may suffer respiratory illnesses on prolonged exposure to such air and it may have more pronounced effect in people with lung and heart diseases. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”. Apart from Patna, the AQI of Bettiah rose to 350, Bhagalpur 332, Biharsharif 414, Buxar 359, Chhapra 353, Darbhanga 376, Katihar 343, Kishanganj 355, Muzaffarpur 369, Purnia 335, Saharsa 352 and Sasaram 319. Of 20 most polluted cities in the country on the CPCB list, most were from Bihar. Ankita Jyoti, senior programme officer at Centre for Environment and Energy Development, said the minimum temperature has declined by few notches in Patna, leading to rise in air pollution. “Low temperature and moisture in the air trap pollutants close to the surface. Seasonal sources of pollution, such as farm fires and bonfires also lead to rise in temperature. Besides, other human-made activities lead to smog,” she added. On Saturday, 98 farmers were caught for stubble burning in Patna during a raid by the district officials. So far, 100 farmers have been caught for stubble burning in the district this year. Naveen Kumar, an environment scientist and analyst at Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), said several contributory sources were responsible for rise in air pollution in the region, including sudden drop in temperature, low wind velocity and formation of thermal inversion condition which trapped the pollutants in the air.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/very-poor-air-quality-in-patna-poses-health-threat-to-people/articleshow/88262923.cms||Faryal Rumi

The woman told the CM whenever she approached the BSEB after fulfilling due formalities, the officials always said it had been sent to the headmaster, but the school staff said the letter had not reached them, and it had been going on for the last couple of months. At this, the CM looked for Kishor and when informed by other officials that the BSEB chairman was not around, he got angry and asked the officials concerned if the letter had been sent to him to be present at the janata darbar. Luckily, BSEB secretary Anup Kumar Sinha was present, which saved the situation. The CM referred the woman to him to get her problem resolved. In other cases, the complainants pointed to irregularities that had been committed in the recruitment of schoolteachers. The CM also got upset in the course of hearing the complaint of a student from Gopalganj, who said he had not been able to get educational assistance under the student credit card scheme (SCCS). When asked for the details, the student said he had completed his +2 level studies from Delhi and was doing higher studies at Patliputra University. The completion of the three-year course had taken six years, but he had not yet got the benefit under the SCCS because of the officials concerned. The CM asked the officials to understand the student’s problem and also duly solve it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/janata-darbar-complaints-against-bseb-recruitment-of-schoolteachers/articleshow/88263081.cms||Abhay Singh

As Calorx Education and Research Foundation was refused new recognition to run the school in July on the ground that the school had continued its educational activities even after its recognition was over in April this year. The school argued that the education for the students had to be continued because of the precarious situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and to ensure the interest of the students is secured, the school had even paid Rs 50 lakh fine that was imposed by the government while cancelling the earlier recognition. The school submitted that the education continued to be online and not a single new student was admitted. The school had lost its recognition after the controversy over running an ashram of devotees of Nityananda, and for running the school on a false NOC from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The school trust has removed those trustees, who were facing criminal allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-orders-edu-authority-to-recognize-primary-section-of-dps-east/articleshow/88264235.cms||---

The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Air Force (IAF) had flight-tested the indigenously designed and developed helicopter launched the Stand-off Anti-tank (SANT) Missile from Pokhran on December 11 for the first time. The flight-test was successful in meeting all its mission objectives. The release mechanism, advanced guidance and tracking algorithms, all avionics with integrated software, performed satisfactorily and tracking systems monitored all mission events. The missile is equipped with a state-of-the-art MMW seeker which provides high precision strike capability from a safe distance. The weapon can neutralise targets in a range up to 10km. Official sources said, “The Sant missile has been designed and developed by Research Centre Imarat (RCI), Hyderabad, in coordination with other DRDO labs and participation from industries. This is the third in the series of indigenous stand-off weapons to be tested in recent times after long range bomb and smart anti airfield weapon for strengthening the arsenal of IAF. The indigenous development of various configurations for different applications with advanced technologies is a firm march towards ‘Aatmanirbharta’ in defence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/drdo-iaf-test-anti-tank-missile-again/articleshow/88264965.cms||---
---||Delhi||Submit report on compliance with hybrid hearing: HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Monday asked district judges heading all district courts to submit a report disclosing details of judicial officers who have failed to comply with its direction to conduct hybrid or virtual proceedings at the request of parties. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh passed the order on being told that some of the judicial officers in subordinate courts were not permitting hybrid hearings despite the directions of full court. It called for a report within two weeks, while hearing an application by a lawyer alleging that despite the HC’s directions given to subordinate courts to permit hybrid and videoconferencing hearing facilities when requested, it was not being considered. It sought hybrid hearing facilities in district courts also on physical hearing days because of the Covid-19 threat. The counsel submitted that despite sending email, messages and requests to the staff of the concerned trial court for hybrid hearing, it was neither considered nor responded to and the case was dismissed for want of prosecution. The HC issued notice on the fresh application and also directed the metropolitan magistrate concerned to respond to it, observing that this conduct was a clear and direct contempt of the high court’s orders. It had on November 17 said that subordinate courts are bound to follow the directions passed by its full court, which permitted trial courts to hold hybrid or videoconferencing hearings at the request of parties. The court had earlier said there was an apprehension of a rise in Covid-19 cases and the infrastructure for hybrid hearings in district courts and other quasi-judicial bodies must be in place. It had also directed the Delhi government to take expeditious steps to provide proper infrastructure for the purpose and said it was mindful that the authorities incur huge money on subsidies and advertisements. The court had in March asked its registrar general to assess the infrastructure requirements at the earliest to facilitate hybrid hearings in trial courts and forward the details to the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/submit-report-on-compliance-with-hybrid-hearing-hc/articleshow/88264964.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||Delhi-Dehradun e-way gets NGT nod; panel to enforce green norms||DEHRADUN: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Monday gave a go-ahead to the construction of the Delhi-Dehradun expressway, which is expected to reduce travel time between the two cities to under three hours from the 5-6 hours it takes currently. With the tribunal's nod to the project, around 11,000 trees are set to be axed on a 19-km-long stretch of the expressway from Ganeshpur to Asharodi (NH-72A). "We find it difficult to hold that there is no application of mind by the ministry of environment, forest, and climate change (MoEF&CC) in granting forest cell clearance," said the order passed by a bench headed by NGT chairperson, Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel. The petitioners, Doon-based NGO 'Citizens for Green Doon' had approached the Supreme Court earlier this year to avoid the tree felling. The apex court had referred the matter to NGT. The petitioners contended that being almost 210-km-long, the project should have undergone a mandatory environmental impact assessment (EIA), which it didn't. However, the tribunal ruled that it "wasn't required." "Overall road connectivity cannot be taken to be one project for the purpose," the bench stated.  The tribunal said that the Delhi-Dehradun highway is an important highway that connects Delhi, Haryana and Western UP to Dehradun and higher reaches of Himalayas and hence, "the capacity augmentation of this highway is not only important for connecting the state capital of Uttarakhand with national capital, but is also vital for strategic defence purposes for timely and seamless movement of Army/ warheads to higher reaches of Himalayas."  The order stressed on the need to ensure that mitigation measures are effectively implemented and monitored on-ground by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The NGT set up a 12-member committee comprising government officials from organisations such as the Central Pollution Control Board, Wildlife Institute of India, and the Forest Research Institute to be headed by the chief secretary of Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ngt-gives-nod-for-delhi-doon-e-way-11k-trees-to-be-cut/articleshow/88266167.cms||Shivani Azad

I had written to the disability commissioner in this regard demanding allowances for them,” said Hemant Bhai Goyal, vice-president, Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh. “These people cannot enjoy benefits of any welfare scheme - be it scholarship scheme, special education scheme, reservation, self-employment scheme or scooty scheme - as they require services of a caregiver all the time,” he said. According to Section 24 (3) (i) of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PwD) Act states that care-giver allowance shall be provided to PwDs with high support needs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/give-caregiver-allowances-to-pwds-high-support-needs/articleshow/88264974.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Post Covid ankylosing spondylitis cases on rise||Nagpur: Corporate banker Nitin Todkar contracted Covid-19 infection during the second wave of the pandemic in May this year. He was hospitalized for a week before recovering completely. Recently, he developed severe lower back and buttock pain. The orthopaedist he visited asked him to see a rheumatologist, who detected a rare type of genetic variation known as ankylosing spondylitis (AS). “I had never heard about it. Doctor told me that it’s a rare type of arthritis. There is no cure for this. I have to take medicine and rely on physiotherapy to keep my back strong,” said Todkar. Rheumatologist Dr Parikshit Sagdeo told TOI that the conditions responsible for this type of arthritis are mainly genetic, but its occurrence has increased worldwide especially in Covid-recovered patients. “About 95% of those with AS have a variation of the human leukocyte antigen-B gene (HLA-B). This changed or mutated gene produces a protein called HLA-B27 that increases the risk. However, most people with mutated HLA-B gene don’t get AS. More than 80% of children, who inherit the mutated gene from a parent with AS, don’t develop the disease. But, the prevalence has increased among Covid-19 recovered patients,” he said. Dr Sagdeo said the disease is more common in men because of some lifestyle-based reasons like smoking habit. “Men are more likely to have AS than women, and it strikes them earlier and harder. As we don’t know about the genetic protein make-up, we must not neglect any lower back pain, especially in post-Covid patients,” he said. There’s also no single test to confirm AS. The HLA-B27 test comes positive in more than 90% of people in India. So, doctors rely on symptoms, a physical exam, and blood tests. Rheumatologists treat this disease with medicine, physiotherapy and the final option is surgery. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first step in medication. Qualified rheumatologists also use newer biological drugs for more effective treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/post-covid-ankylosing-spondylitis-cases-on-rise/articleshow/88264953.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Some of the trees around which these plaques have been placed include the Indian rubber tree, baobab, Krishna’s Buttercup, Ghost tree, Lac tree and small Indian oak, among others. The plaque mentions its size, origin, flowering season and scientific name in both Marathi and English. For instance, the drought-resistant Indian Butter tree goes with the scientific name Madhuca Indica and comes from the Sapotaceae family. Its flowering season is from February to April and has a height reaching up to 20 metres.Apart from the existing trees, new species of trees have also been planted at the garden. Dr Sanjay Tripathi, director of the zoo, said a holistic approach was taken when the modernisation of the gardens and zoo was proposed. “These plaques are informative and also educate public about the heritage and history of the garden. Since reopening on November 1, we are seeing 15,000 footfalls on weekends and around 4,000-5,000 on weekdays,” said Tripathi. There are also four large boards placed inside the gardens & zoo giving out nuggets of its fascinating history, the value of the heritage botanical garden and also information on the enduring legacy it has of being known as a people’s park. Hutokshi Rustomfram and Shubhada Nikharge — trustees of the Save Rani Bagh Botanical Garden Foundation — were integral in helping the authorities extract the text, information and photographs for the plaques. “There is no other area in the island city with as many trees or diversity of species. Over 50 Mumbai Botany colleges use the botanical garden as a living laboratory for field study. We therefore felt that these boards would provide visitors with much of the information needed,” said Rustomfram whose foundation has also produced a small awareness-raising video film in English and Marathi on the botanical and cultural aspects of V J B Udyan. Nikharge said there are plans to place 50 more such plaques around trees. “We have also put out names of stalwarts like Jagannath Shankar Sheth, Dr George Birdwood, Sir David Sasoon and Dr Bhau Daji Lad who helped establish this grand project,” said Nikharge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-byculla-botanical-garden-tree-species-get-informative-plaques/articleshow/88265799.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Jaipur||Jaipur to get another leopard safari park soon||JAIPUR: Pink City is all set to become the country’s most sought-after destination for leopard safaris as the forest department is planning to open the Galta region, which is home to 17 wild cats, for visitors. The department has undertaken an exercise to develop the forest block adjoining Jhalana leopard reserve and Galta, spread over approximately 36 sqkm, which has over 60 sub-adult and adult leopards. Head of forest force (HoFF) DN Pandey said, “Plans are afoot to open the safari at Galta. However, dates have been not decided yet. After the management and protection were strengthened at Jhalana, the population of leopards increased. According to the rewilding principles, it is necessary to develop a dispersal corridor between source and sink areas.” Earlier, at Galta and Amagarh forest blocks, there were no routes to monitor the wild cats. Wildlife enthusiast and member of Leopard Monitoring Committee, Dhiraj Kapoor said, “Galta and Amagarh are important forest areas having ravines and nullahs, which is a bit different from Jhalana’s. Nearly eight leopards from Jhalana have marked territories. The protection of this corridor will play a crucial role.” As Jhalana is bursting at the seams, the move will also come as a breather. The Jhalana forest spreads 20sqkm in the southeast of Jaipur. It houses a healthy population of 44 leopards that can be spotted by tourists from 10-20 feet. The extension of Jhalana will be an added attraction for tourists and new routes will be explored. An official said, “At present, there are 44 leopards in the park, including 31 adults and 13 cubs. Apart from leopards, the forest has various attractions such as 132 species of avifauna, 220 species of flora, 20 species of reptiles, to name a few. The same spotting can also be done at Galta as its adjoining." Taking a cue from Project Tiger launched by the Centre in 1973, the state had launched the project to conserve leopards. The CM had allocated Rs 7 crore for Project Leopard in the 2017-18 budget. "The conservation efforts have increased the population of leopards. Now, the adjoining areas are being developed for the leopard habitat. The area lacks a prey base and efforts will be made in this direction. If tourism starts, the gate will open from Galta temple end," said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/city-to-get-another-leopard-safari-park-soon/articleshow/88264975.cms||---
---||Delhi||In Covid times, boarding at IGI goes contactless||NEW DELHI: Indira Gandhi International Airport has introduced an e-boarding facility to ensure “seamless and contactless digital travel” for passengers, its operator DIAL said on Monday. The e-boarding gates have already been set up at Terminal 3 and Terminal 2 while deployment is in progress at Terminal 1, DIAL said. Sources at the airport said five such facilities will be functional each at T2 and T3 and four at T1 in the coming weeks. Videh Kumar Jaipuriar, DIAL’s CEO, said the pandemic has made it more challenging to meet the travellers’ expectations as health and safety concerns have increased. “DIAL has responded to the challenge and set a benchmark with innovative solutions, such as the e-boarding gates that have been installed at the airport. Our team carried out several trials, keeping in view the Covid-19 guidelines issued by various agencies. The sole aim is to keep our passengers safe at any cost,” Jaipuriar said. The contactless e-boarding gates are equipped with card scanners, which allow passengers to flash their physical or e-boarding passes to verify flight details so that they can proceed for security checks, DIAL said in a statement. It added that passengers who get their boarding passes verified by scanning at the e-gates will not need to show their documents again. There are three different lanes at the e-boarding gates — wide, ‘normal’ and dual. A wide-lane e-gate is for passengers carrying heavy luggage or those with reduced mobility. Passengers carrying only hand baggage can walk through the e-gates designated as ‘normal’. A dual option will offer both wide and ‘normal’ lanes. DIAL said the touchless procedure not only minimises the touching of facility surfaces and interaction among people in the times of Covid-19, but also reduces the boarding time. “The cutting-edge technology has reduced 50% of the transaction time, resulting in lower queues, and has also improved the security aspect where boarding card details are verified with airlines back office,” it added. Meanwhile, the operator confirmed that it has also installed e-processing kiosks at T2 entry gates. Over the next few weeks, they would be installed at Terminal 3 and Terminal 1 as well. “This will further reduce the travel documents’ validation time for CISF personnel significantly and offer an end-to-end seamless and contactless digital travel experience to the passengers,” said DIAL.

While the gold was under allowed limit, it was undeclared and investigation is on. “Customs officials intercepted a passenger who landed from Dubai at 1:36am on Monday at Jaipur. On examination of his checked-in baggage in the X-ray machine, unusual dark images of some objects were noticed indicating concealment of some heavy /precious metal like gold. The passenger denied being in possession of any such items. On opening two black pepper packets in his checked-in baggage, two biscuits of fine gold (of 99.99% purity) were found duly wrapped in multiple layers of white plastic and blue carbon paper sheets. The smuggled gold weighing 200 grams, valued at Rs 9,86,000 was seized under the provisions of Customs Act, 1962. Further investigation is on”, said an official statement of the customs department. Just last month, the customs department at Jaipur International Airport seized 1.5 kg of gold valued at nearly Rs 80 lakh which was found concealed under the seat of an Air India flight which landed from Dubai. Three employees of subsidiary firm of Air India were also arrested in this smuggling operation. Acting on specific intelligence, Customs officials of city airport conducted rummaging of the Air India flight which arrived from Dubai on November 16, in the presence of Air India security, engineering and maintenance staff. Prior to this in October, officials seized around one kg of gold worth more than Rs 50 lakh from a passenger who landed from Sharjah. The passenger had hidden the gold in his undergarments as well as cavities made in the jeans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gold-worth-rs-10l-seized-at-jaipur-airport/articleshow/88264981.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||A month on, parvovirus continues to decimate Kolkata feline population||KOLKATA: Adusyanti Chatterjee, a pet lover residing at Shyambazar, lost 18 of her 26 cats in the last five days to feline parvovirus (FPV) which is highly contagious. “Less than 18-month-old cats are highly susceptible to contraction of the deadly virus. I lost all 18 of them which were mostly rescued cats and had missed vaccination,” says Adusyanti. Similar incident happened in Bhowanipore, where six cats died a couple of weeks back. Ranjan Majumdar (73) and Rajat Chowdhury (53), both pet lovers living in the area, rescued 15 cats during the pandemic and lost six kittens to FPV. “During the pandemic we found cats were being abandoned at a park in front of our houses at Ashu Biswas Road. Despite starting treatment for FVP, we lost six of them in a very short period,” rued Majumdar, who believes timely dose of vaccination can save the cats. Feline infectious enteritis (FIE) is a disease caused by infection with FPV, also known as feline panleukopenia virus. The disease does’'t have a treatment and cats usually die within 24 to 48 hours after showing symptoms. However, licensed FVP vaccines can stop the spread of this virus if given to cats when they are 8 to 9 weeks old, followed by a booster dose after 3 to 4 weeks. There should be a top-up of booster dose after 12 months and then every three years. “But even vaccinated cats can contract the virus as it keep mutating and just because a cat has a high serum antibody, these antibodies may not ensure adequate disease protection if the cat is exposed to a virulent strain of disease,” said veterinary doctor Parimal Roy Cat parents should be watchful as symptoms usually start when the cat stops eating, followed by vomiting and blood dysentery, before it finally gets dehydrated and succumbs to the virus. The virus is less deadly for an adult cat. If diagnosed and treated in time, there is possibility of a full recovery. Early consultation with a veterinary doctor and blood tests can help give proper treatment. Other safety measures can be taken by keeping the cat indoors and away from strays. It’s advisable to keep an unvaccinated rescued cat isolated for at least 14 days if there are other pets at home. If the cat has any virus or health issues then it will show signs during this period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sudipto-cats/articleshow/88264263.cms||Sudipto Das

---||Nagpur||Students not getting midday meals ration since August||Nagpur: School students in Nagpur district have not received either entire or partial quota of their midday meals (MDM) ration since August, something which authorities blame on tender contract issues. Ever since the pandemic started, cooked midday meals were stopped and dry rations were handed out on a monthly basis. But the last supply of such a ration kit which school students received was in the month of July. Adarsh Vidya Mandir (Gandhibagh) principal Ashnarayan Tiwari said there was no supply for the last four months. “The ration kit for students includes uncooked rice and lentils. But schools have not received the wholesale supply from August onwards, so we cannot distribute it further to parents. We have been told that there is no supply coming to godowns, from where it is transported to schools,” he said. MDM serves as a major attraction for students from families with very poor economic background to attend school, thus fulfilling the state’s main plan of providing education to all kids. After schools were shut down in March 2020 due to the pandemic, the MDM supply chain too was disrupted. Even as schools remained closed a few months down the line, Maharashtra government took a decision to provide dry ration to students. Schools were supplied foodgrains as per the earlier practice, but this time instead of cooking it, the ration was packed. Students and parents were called once a month to collect their ration kits from the school. But now with no supply coming through, schools are facing the heat from parents. Officials say the problem is a result of “contractual issues”. A senior official who is closely involved with the MDM scheme in district told TOI that there is no vendor to supply the foodgrains in bulk at godowns. “Authorities have told us that tender for supply of foodgrains has not been granted yet. So due to absence of a vendor, the supply has completely stopped. This is all done at the state level, hence we are helpless,” said the official. He added that MDM is distributed through two formats in Nagpur. “The first system is the in-house kitchen in which schools cook their own MDM and distribute it to kids. Second is the centralized kitchen system through which food is cooked in a common location and then transported to schools.” The official said both these systems are now being used for dry ration distribution. “Some schools under the centralized kitchen scheme have received rice but not lentil. Others have not received anything at all,” he said. TOI contacted school education minister Varsha Gaikwad but she did not respond to calls or text in which details of the MDM issue were mentioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/students-not-getting-midday-meals-ration-since-august/articleshow/88264983.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The building houses many shops, a bank and an office of the electricity department. A portion of the slab collapsed around 5-6 years ago and later a portion collapsed about three years ago. The same was repaired on a temporary basis. Now, people have asked the municipality to either construct a new building by replacing the old one or to undertake repairs in such a manner that it will last longer. Recently, the Bicholim block Congress committee members submitted a memorandum to BMC chief officer Kabir Shirgaonkar to undertake instant repairs of this building.

---||Meerut||Sotiganj, top stolen cars market in UP, shut by cops||Meerut: One of India's most flourishing albeit infamous car-breaking and stolen auto-parts market, Sotigan in Meerutj, was shut on Sunday following a massive crackdown by the police. Cops served a notice under section 91 of the CrPC to the shops to submit records and GST documents, which many don't have. The closure of the notorious market that saw cars -- from the most expensive to the cheapest -- being brought in from Delhi, NCR and many other parts of the country came shortly after the arrest of two kingpins of the illegal trade, Haji Galla and Haji Iqbal. The market has over 300 shops and employs over 1,000 people. Traders told TOI on Sunday that all of them were asked to keep stores shut until further orders. “We have identified 100 shops in the market that are involved in the illegal trade. We will not let them access any goods until they submit stock details,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Meerut Prabhakar Chaudhary. The directions were given verbally by the station house officer (SHO) of Sadar Bazaar, said traders. To maintain peace and order after the announcement, which caused wide discontent, over 200 policemen conducted a flag march in the market in the afternoon. “We will talk to the police on Monday. Traders shouldn’t be harassed like this. Many of them are genuine and have all GST and stock details. Few are into illegal trading and the crackdown should only be limited to them,” said Pandit Ashu Sharma, an office-bearer of the Paschim Uttar Pradesh Vyapar Mandal. Some traders are worried about producing documents they say are hard to collect. “The police are asking us to show documents that most of us don’t have. It's essentially asking us to shut shop,” said a trader who didn’t wish to be named. "This will only increase crime in the city as all those employed here will now be jobless.” The Sotiganj market became infamous in the 1990s for trading scrap illegally stolen from dismantled cars, at that time mostly from the NCR region. Operations expanded later. Police have intensified their crackdown on the market over the past three months. The two top kingpins of the illegal trade, Galla and Iqbal, were arrested and their properties attached. The market has ballooned in size over the past few years. Those who own big shops have become owners of multiple properties across the nation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/sotiganj-top-stolen-cars-market-in-up-shut-by-cops/articleshow/88265070.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Mumbai||State board classes 1-7 in Mumbai to open tomorrow||MUMBAI: State board schools in the city are all set to re-open for primary and middle school students (Class I to VII) on Wednesday after a gap of over 20 months. Principals are expecting about 20-25% students to turn up for in-person learning this week. Not more than five cases of the new Covid variant Omicron have been reported in the city, but many parents are still apprehensive about sending students, especially the younger ones, back to school. For now, most institutions are likely to persist with a hybrid model, but without combining online tutoring and offline classes in the same session. Teachers may attend to their online and offline students on alternate days or shifts. ‘Practical’ problems faced by schools in hybrid classThe decision to reopen the primary section in Mumbai state board schools for in-person learning may vary depending on class strength and convenience. Non-state board schools plan to fully re-open for primary classes in January 2022, post winter vacations. Father Jude Fernandes, principal of St Mary’s High School, Byculla, said the school has received consent from parents of barely 20-25% students. “We will start classes as per the BMC directive and review the situation later. There will be problems in running hybrid classes. We may call students in batches twice a week in the beginning,” he added. Don Bosco High School in Borivli too plans to start classes on Wednesday but have got a poor response from parents of students in the lower classes. There are practical difficulties in starting classes with limited attendance, said principal Rohan Bhat of Children’s Academy, an ICSE school. “Since hybrid classes will continue, most parents want to stick with with the online option. And we cannot run bus services for fewer students. Even if there are 10 students in the bus, the running cost will remain the same,” said Bhat, adding that parents have turned reluctant after reports of Omicron cases in the city. The school will re-open for classes I-VII after online exams in January. Anjuman-I-Islam School in Bandra has received consent from over 50% students of classes I-VII. “We had a good response even in the higher classes. While students from SSC and HSC are being called every day, we are calling others on alternate days,” said the principal, Saba Patel. The school has paired classes V and VIII and classes VI and VII and intends to call them on alternate days. BMC education officer Raju Tadvi said parents of 40% of students from BMC schools have given consent. “We have directed all schools to re-open on Wednesday following Covid protocols. So far, there is no change in the directive,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-practical-problems-faced-by-schools-in-hybrid-class/articleshow/88265042.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Delhi||Call for Covid compliance as daily case figure rises in Delhi||NEW DELHI: In the last 12 days, Delhi has recorded an average of 63 Covid-19 cases per day, the highest in the past four months. In August, September, October and November, Delhi recorded, respectively, 48,37, 32 and 35 new Covid cases on average daily. The number of active cases in the city, medical data shows, has also increased significantly — from 348 at October-end to 393 on December 13. Dr S K Sarin, vice-chancellor, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, said the trend was worrisome. “The genome sequencing results available so far (till the end of November) suggest that the Delta variant remains the main cause of Covid infection. However, we need to monitor the results more closely over the next few weeks to assess the cause of the increase in daily cases,” he said, indicating uncertainty over the latest Omicron variant leading to fresh cases. Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine, Max Hospital, Saket, said, “Till about a month ago, we weren’t getting any new Covid cases. Now, for the past few days, I am receiving one or two requests daily for consultation from patients suffering from the viral infection.” Tickoo said it too early to blame the new variant for the increase in cases, but precautionary measures needed to be stepped up. “Most of the Covid patients I am currently seeing are fully vaccinated, but have been infected nevertheless. Thankfully, they have mild symptoms,” revealed Tickoo. The increase in Covid cases is also reflected in the data shared by Delhi government on the occupancy of Covid beds in the city’s hospitals and isolation centres. The latest update shows 164 Covid beds occupied Lok Nayak, Ram Manohar Lohia, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Apollo Indraprastha and Sir Ganga Ram hospitals, among the major medical care centres. “There is no reason to panic,” assured Dr Arun Gupta, president, Delhi Medical Council. “But we cannot be complacent either. It is not just the daily numbers that is on the rise in Delhi in the last few days, but even the positivity rate.” Gupta added that the reasons for the increase were most likely external: arrival of passengers from other countries where the Covid cases continue to be high. “If the reasons were internal — non-compliance with Covid-appropriate behaviour — the cases would increase across India. But that’s not the case,” he explained. On Monday, Delhi recorded 30 new cases of Covid at a positivity rate of 0.06%. No deaths were reported in the last 24 hours due to the disease, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/call-for-covid-compliance-as-daily-case-figure-rises/articleshow/88264988.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Wife seeks cop help to find missing Army jawan||JAIPUR: The wife of an Army jawan has been running from pillar to post to find her husband who has been missing for over a week now. Havaldar Yashpal Singh from Dholpur boarded the train on December 5 to return to his regiment in Kargil after leave of one month. That was the last time his wife Neetu heard from him. When filing a missing person report at the local police station did not help in finding Singh, the family placed posters of Singh in Dholpur and also wrote to Army authorities in Delhi, seeking help. However, till now, none of the attempts have been successful in getting any news about the soldier. Speaking to TOI, a distraught Neetu said, “On December 5, my husband boarded the train and called up around 11:30pm to tell me that he is fine and will call me during the journey. However, after that his phone was switched off and neither he nor anyone else contacted me. I filed a missing person report and on Saturday even sent a letter to Army officials in Delhi for help. I fear that something may have happened to him, I feel helpless.” Singh is from 16 Rajput and was to reach Ambala from where he was to further proceed to his place of posting. “He was supposed to report to Chandigarh, we have informed his unit personnel. We have put posters in the area and even spread the news on social media with a hope that someone might give us some information about my husband. I have two small children and do not know how to find him. He was not under any stress and did not have any personal animosity with anyone. He was carrying just Rs 10,000 for travel,” added Neetu. Meanwhile, Dholpur police has constituted a team to look for the missing soldier. SP Kesar Singh told TOI, “Singh’s mobile phone is switched off due to which we are unable to get his location, but we have formed a team to look for him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/wife-seeks-cop-help-to-find-missing-army-jawan/articleshow/88264987.cms||Yeshika Budhwar
---||Jaipur||Welcome desks will be set up at 63 city thanas to help complainants||Jaipur: In order to facilitate complaints for issues such as verification of tenants and domestic help, complains for missing people, mobile phones and bikes, Jaipur police is coming up with welcome desks in all its 63 stations. These desks will be operational from January 1 and dedicated policemen will be deployed to facilitate the public visiting the thanas. Senior officers of Jaipur police said this was part of the budget announcement by the government. “Whenever a person or a group of persons visit a police station, they are actually clueless on whom to meet and whom to meet. So, these welcome desks will first hear the complainants and guide them whom to approach,” said Ajay Pal Lamba, additional commissioner of police (crime) on Monday. He said for issues such as verification of passports, tenants and domestic help, lodging of missing complaints, etc, the welcome desks will be greatly beneficial. “These desks will have dedicated policemen in shifts besides proper sitting arrangements for visitors,” Lamba added. Senior police officers said the move would ease the burden on police and would properly segregate work. “If a complainant is coming with a rape or murder complaint, he would be guided accordingly,” Lamba added. “At many police stations, we have started to check the response of the public. But this would be launched properly from January 1,” said a senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/welcome-desks-will-be-set-up-at-63-city-thanas-to-help-complainants/articleshow/88264994.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Trial run with imported RT-PCR kits to test for new variant||Pune: The Maharashtra government will now deploy imported RT-PCR test kits that have the S-gene target failure (SGTF) strategy, which will help in speedy detection of probable presence of the Omicron variant. This will be follwed by Omicron confirmation through genome sequencing. “Our aim is to conduct up to 1 lakh Covid tests across the state with specialised RT-PCR kits featuring SGTF strategy and observe the trend in 20 days,” said Dr Satish Pawar, additional mission director, directorate of health services. Besides testing individuals with international travel history, as well as their close contacts, these kits will be used at government-run laboratories for routine tests. Financial assistance to the tune of Rs47 lakh has been sanctioned to every district in accordance with the population to purchase the imported RT-PCR kits and conduct at least 100 Covid tests every day using them to observe the trend of positivity. Big cities such as Pune and Mumbai are expect to conduct more such tests on a daily basis. “The kits’ utility in Omicron detection will be assessed and based on the findings we will decide whether to scale up the kits’ use or reduce it,” Dr Pawar told TOI. At present, only one US-based company that has such kits operates in India. Bulk purchase of a standard RT-PCR kit costs the state Rs19 per kit. The cost for a specialized RT-PCR kit is Rs240.  —Umesh Isalkar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-trial-run-with-imported-rt-pcr-kits-to-test-for-new-variant/articleshow/88265044.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The policy facilitates immediate electricity connections for agriculture pumps across the state. The government also provides relief in interest on electric bill arrears and relief in delayed payment charges (DPC). “In the past, with waiver on DPC and interest, we gave total relief of over Rs 15,000 crore and now if the farmers pay 50% of their pending electricity bill arrears, they will get further waiver and many can bring down their arrears to zero in near future,” the official said. Of the total relief of around Rs 15,000 crore in the past, Rs 10,421 crore was written off while Rs 4,672 crore was waived in interest and delayed payment charges, sources added. The MSEDCL has appealed to all farmers to clear their pending electricity bills at the earliest.

CMHO Dr Kunal Sahu on Monday inspected several hotels and directed their owners to strictly follow Covid guidelines. They were advised to allow guests to enter premises only after thoroughly checking their health statistics. The city hotels are fully occupied from December 22 to January 5. Air connectivity to Jaisalmer from Bengaluru, Mumbai, New Delhi, Ahmedabad and Jaipur has made it easy for all to reach here. Those involved in tourism sector are a happy lot. Dr Sahu has asked hoteliers to maintain records of foreign tourists, getting RT PCR reports and vaccination related details. During the inspection by medical team hotel personnel’s vaccination updates were also noted. Dr Sahu was assisted by district drug centre in charge officer Dr BL Bunkar and Dr Saleem Javed. Despite medical department taking all precautions to prevent the spread of Omicron variant, the tourists were seen venturing out without masks. Also, they seemed least bothered to maintain social distance at tourist spots. This has not gone down well with Jaisalmer’s residents as there are nil cases reported from here. But, they fear that if tourists do not follow Covid guidelines then there may be danger of Covid-19 spreading here as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/health-dept-in-jaisalmer-gears-up-to-check-spread-of-covid-during-tourist-season/articleshow/88264995.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi govt disburses Rs 50,000 to over 21,000 people under Covid scheme||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has provided Rs 50,000 ex gratia to 21,235 people who lost a family member to Covid-19. Another 7,955 beneficiaries are being given monthly financial assistance of Rs 2,500 under Mukhyamantri Covid-19 Aarthik Sahayata Yojana. Social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said as a responsible and caring administration, the Kejriwal government was rapidly working towards dispensing the Covid-19 compensation. “While 21,235 people have received Rs 50,000 ex gratia till date, 1,500 applicants will receive the one-time aid in the few days. Nearly 2,000 have refused to take the compensation. The government has approved 9,484 applications for the monthly pension of Rs 2,500 and 7,955 are already receiving it,” said Gautam, adding that Delhi government had received 25,100 applications under the scheme. Gautam said the government was making every effort to ensure the documentation process was made simple for applicants and teams concerned in the SDM offices had been directed to carry out door-to-door verification. A major section of the refusals came from families that were financially well-off and did not seem to require the aid. Most applications were in the finalisation stage, barring a few that had met some technical problems. These were being worked upon. The Rs 2,500 monthly aid is being given to orphaned children and widows of those who died due to Covid-19, while the one-time ex gratia is for those who lost a family member to the viral disease. Under the monthly pension scheme, 1,120 applications were under verification and the eligible applicants would start receiving the money after the checks were conducted. “Aid has been extended to 1,529 people and the money will be remitted to their bank accounts in 3-4 days. We are clearing all applications as soon as we can. There are some cases where queries have been raised. They will be cleared once the queries are resolved,” Gautam said. “The compensation disbursement process has been streamlined and simplified. We have made every effort to make the documentation burden as light as possible for applicants. The SDMs and their teams have been directed to carry out door-to-door verification,” said the minister. After the devastating second Covid-19 wave rampaged through the capital, Delhi government in July launched the financial assistance scheme aimed at helping families recover from the setback they suffered due to deaths in the family. Many children lost their parents. The government explained that the scheme was planned to support and stand with people in grief. Initially, the progress of the scheme was slow. On October 1, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal expressed strong displeasure over the pendency of applications and directed the officials concerned to disburse the amount claimed by the victims at the earliest. Within a month, things improved significantly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-disburses-rs-50k-to-over-21k-people-under-covid-scheme/articleshow/88264997.cms||AlokKNMishra

According to police, the accused had stolen fuel worth Rs 1 crore from various government pipelines in the last two years. They are likely to be slapped with Gangster Act and National Security Act (NSA), police said. SSP Saharanpur, Akash Tomar, said that the fuel theft incident took place in the city in January and September this year. “As per our records, the arrested accused have over 12 cases of oil theft in Kurukshetra-Roorkee-Nazibabad pipeline of Indian Oil Corporation Limited. They used to sell the petrol in the open market,” the SSP added. The arrested suspects have been identified as Shubham Kumar, Gurmeet Singh, Sandeep Singh, Ajay Singh, Ajit, Udit, Shubham Singh and Bhupendra. They belong to Haridwar, Shamli, Baghpat, Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur and have been booked under IPC sections 424, 307 and 15/16 of the Petroleum Act. The SSP further said that one of the arrested suspects is an owner of a petrol pump in Muzaffarnagar district who had the licence to sell biodiesel, but he used to sell both diesel and petrol. “The man's licence to sell biodiesel expired months ago. He told us that he had a tie-up with people in the district administration who were allowing him to sell petrol and diesel. We have written to the administration and police to identify the other accused and take appropriate action,” the SSP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/thieves-who-stole-rs-1cr-worth-of-fuel-from-govt-pipeline-finally-caught-after-2-yr-chase-may-be-charged-under-nsa/articleshow/88256649.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Kochi||City, West Kochi areas face inundation during high tide||Kochi: The residents of city and West Kochi have been reeling under high-tide induced waterlogging for the past one week. People living on the banks of canals face inundation of their compounds and houses during high tide, especially during night and early morning hours. Areas that have been witnessing inundation for the past one week include Edakochi North, Edakochi South, Karipalam, Mattancherry and Gandhinagar. Though high tide is common in the Malayalam month of Vrishchikam, local people claimed the intensity of the tide has increased this time. Experts feel it is the pre-existing conditions due to irregular climate response during the northeast monsoon that is now compounding problems associated with high tide. “We received pretty heavy rainfall during northeast monsoon due to the impact of climate change. Reaction of waterbodies and the land has changed following this. Groundwater level increased during that period and when the water from the lake enters the interior parts through canals due to high tide, it is not seeped into the underground. Due to heavy rain, many landslides also occurred and the sediments and debris got accumulated in lakes. This resulted in lakes becoming shallow and the tides acting upon water level,” says Balchand A N, visiting faculty at the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (Kufos). He also said external factors like reclamation of waterbodies, encroachments and illegal mining on beaches aggravate the issues. T K Ashraf, corporation health standing committee chairman and councillor from Mattanchery division, said almost all areas of West Kochi have been witnessing inundation due to high tide. “High tide is quite common in Vrishchikam. But this time intensity is high due to climate change. Besides, all waterbodies in the area have been reclaimed over the years. As a result the rising water has no space to seep into the ground. The issue persists till 9am when the water recedes to the sea. The corporation cannot do anything about climate change-induced issues. We have already cleaned the canals in the area,” he said. While Abilash Thoppil, councillor from Edakochi South, said the sediment deposit in the river bed of Vembanad lake has increased and it has reduced the water holding capacity. “Drudging needs to be conducted in the lake to increase its holding capacity. Water rose up to a height of one-and-a-half feet in courtyards of houses in my division during high tide. Three sluices need to be constructed in various parts of Edakochi South to address the issue. However, the issue will persist until the construction of a culvert in Edakochi North division, fund for which was allotted in 2018,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/city-west-kochi-areas-face-inundation-during-high-tide/articleshow/88264291.cms||---

Forest officials said that on Monday afternoon they heard the roaring of lions during their round in the forest near Kutiya I beat. On reaching the spot, they found two lions aged between 5-9 years. One of them was seen holding a cub, not more than a month old, in its mouth. The foresters also saw an injured lioness, probably the mother of the cub, moving away from the two male lions. It is believed that the lions had come from another area of the forest and the cub was killed in infighting between the lioness and the lion to ascertain supremacy. The lion later left the cub at the spot and left.

Talking to reporters during his visit to Nashik on Monday, Thackeray said the ST workers are united without any backing of unions, and it is a fact that they have not received salaries during the past four months. Commenting on the ultimatum given by transport minister Anil Parab to the striking workers to rejoin work, the MNS chief reminded the minister that he is in power to serve the people, and he cannot behave arrogantly with the striking workers. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray should intervene so that the issue is resolved amicably,” he said. Responding to questions, the MNS chief alleged that the MSRTC is not in profit due to alleged corruption. “Instead of privatisation, there is a need to operate the transport utility through a private professional management company. I will soon write to the CM on this issue,” he added. Commenting on the MHADA recruitment exam paper leak, the MNS chief said the voters must take such issues seriously and not forget such incidents while casting their votes during the polls. On the OBC issue, he said that Maharashtra will not get developed until it comes out of casteism. OBC and other caste reservation issues are being used by some people for political gains, he said. The NMS chief also criticised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his remarks that he is Hindu, but not Hindutvawadi. He avoided commenting on possibilities of a BJP-MNS alliance during the coming civic elections. But he said that he had a political discussion with former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, when they recently met.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/raj-criticises-mva-govts-handling-of-msrtc-staff-strike/articleshow/88263503.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jodhpur||Rajasthan: Tahsildar’s driver, two others held for taking bribe||JODHPUR: The Anti-Corruption Bureau has arrested the driver of the tahsildar and a fourth class employee along with a mediator for accepting a bribe of Rs 50,000. The role of the tahsildar is also under the scanner in the matter. According to sources, Madan Singh, the tahsildar’s driver, had contacted the complainant to get his pending work done at the Jodhpur Development Authority (JDA) regarding the issuance of the lease deed of his plot in the Banar area in Jodhpur. DIG (ACB) Kailash Bishnoi said complainant Kewal Ram wanted to build a hotel. "For this, he needed the lease deed of the plot. He contacted the JDA with the application for the lease deed. As it was taking a long time, he moved court seeking legal intervention in the matter," said Bishnoi. The court decreed in his favour in March 2021 directing the JDA to carry out the documentary formalities leading to the issuance of the lease deed. But even the directions of the court continued to be overlooked by the JDA. "Some time back, Madan Singh called Ram and asked him to pay Rs 50,000 to get his work by the tahsildar done. Later, Ram met the tahsildar with a request to reduce the amount, to which he acceded in gestures," said the official. Madan Singh started building pressure on Ram to give the money as soon as possible and a fourth class employee of the tehsil office, Bhopal Singh, also joined him, he said. Bishnoi said Madan called the complainant with money at a cabin near the tehsil office on Monday morning and advised him to hand over the money to one Himmat Singh. "We laid a trap and the moment Ram gave the money to Himmat Singh at the designated place, we caught him and recovered the money from him. Later, when Madan Singh and Bhopal Singh reached there, we caught them also," said the official. He said the trio were arrested and further investigation was under process, which also includes ascertaining the role of tahsildar Deepak Sankhla, who despite court’s orders, ignored the matter. Sankhla had recently been roped in to lead a joint enforcement team to check illegal mining gravel sand in the district and its transportation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/tahsildars-driver-two-others-held-for-taking-bribe/articleshow/88265008.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik: Only online building plan submissions from January 1||NASHIK: Following the directive of the state government, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to stop offline submission and approval of building plans. The builders will have to submit building plans online from January 1. The offline submission and approval of building plans had been started around three to four months ago following some problems with the online software. NMC officials said the state government has directed to start online submission and approval of building plans from the beginning of 2022. On December 2 last year, the state government introduced the unified Development Control & Promotion Regulations (UDCPR) for the entire state. All municipal corporations, councils and nagar panchayats (excluding Mumbai) have been brought under the ambit of the new rule. The state government introduced the unified DCPR to bring uniformity in the width of roads, size of rooms, etc. The state government also developed the software for online submission and approvals of the building plans. This online submission and approval of building plans came into effect from April 1, this year. But builders had to face some technical issues while submitting the building plans online. This also slowed the process for the building plan submission and approval. Hence, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI), Nashik and Maharashtra, had urged the state government to withdraw the online system until the technical problems in the software were sorted out. Instead, the association had demanded the state to start building plan submission and approval offline. Accordingly, the urban development department of the state government had given its nod to start an offline system for the building plans submission and approval from October 1. Now the state government has directed to start an online system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/only-online-building-plan-submissions-from-january-1/articleshow/88263493.cms||Tushar Pawar

State officials said both patients are vaccinated and have no symptoms. Nine of those infected with the variant have recovered and gone home. The count of Omicron cases in the country has crossed 40.  The Pune patient is a 39-year-old woman, while the Latur patient is a 33-year-old man. Both had returned from Dubai, which doesn’t feature in the list of ‘at-risk’ countries. “Both don’t have any symptoms, but we have kept them in institutional isolation,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. He said three contacts each were tested for both the patients. None of the contacts have come positive, Awate added.  The patient from Latur had landed at Mumbai international airport on December 3 and drove to his residence at Ausa taluka in his personal car, confirmed Dr Hanmant Wadgave, district health officer. He said the man’s samples were collected for RT-PCR on December 8 and he was then found positive. He had mild symptoms initially but didn’t get tested or report to authorities. District health officials, however, contacted him as part of their surveillance of all foreign returnees and collected his samples.  Wadgave said the man was admitted to Latur Covid Care Centre after he tested positive. “From the day of his arrival to his testing positive, he had met several people. But he was always wearing a mask and that’s probably why others didn’t catch the infection,” he said. The man’s three high-risk contacts include his two children, who have tested negative. Latur has traced 111 international travellers, of which nine have come from high-risk countries. Of them, 2 have tested positive but only one was infected with the Omicron variant.  Of 20 Omicron cases in the state now, 10 are from Pimpri Chinchwad, 5 from Mumbai, 2 from Pune and one each from Kalyan-Dombivli, Nagpur and Latur. Mumbai has not reported new cases after the initial 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-new-omicron-cases-in-maha-total-is-now-20/articleshow/88265046.cms||---

Members of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), who visited the centre following a tip-off, found that around 380 deer including sambar deer and spotted deer have been kept under pathetic conditions, without the service of a veterinary doctor for the past seven months. Crows were found scavenging on the wounds of the animals. SPCA will file a complaint with the Central Zoo Authority, which granted permission for the centre to function as a mini zoo, Animal Welfare Board of India and the state forest department, which is the custodian of the centre, after preparing a report. “Both male and female deer are kept together in clusters resulting in rise in deer population at the centre. Area of a cluster is only 50 cent. There are only four staff to take care of the deer. As there is no veterinary doctor, there is no one to attend to the wounds sustained during fight between the animals. The deer are also not fed properly. Only 400kg of fodder comprising leaves of jackfruit and grass is given to the animals per day,” said SPCA secretary T K Sajeev. The animal enclosure is untidy. Since the food is inadequate, it is not evenly distributed. Those mighty in the herd get while others are left to starve. The staff is also helpless as they cannot address the health issues of the deer. It is the negligence on the part of officials at the centre. We will write to the authorities concerned, Sajeev said. The SPCA will request the Central Zoo Authority to withdraw the recognition given to the centre, if the latter fails to improve the living conditions of the deer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pathetic-conditions-make-life-hell-for-deer-at-kaprikkad/articleshow/88264300.cms||---

The court was hearing a petition filed by Mohan. The petitioner stated that the agricultural land in Thirupachethi village depends on the water released from Vaigai dam for irrigation purposes. He stated that there are two irrigation tanks in the village - Thirupachethi north kanmoi and Thirupachethi south kanmoi. Both these tanks irrigate a total of 600 acres of agricultural land. The petitioner stated that based on the earlier direction of this court, water sources were regulated through shutters on the branch channels and the village was getting its share of the water. However, farmers are utilizing the water from the north kanmoi and water is not reaching the south kanmoi. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking for a direction to the authorities to build permanent regulator shutters in order to ensure water flow to south kanmoi. The special government pleader submitted an estimate for the construction of dividing wall in north and south tank supply channels in Thirupuvanam taluk has been prepared. The estimate comes around nearly Rs 30 lakh. After approval from the concerned authority, the work would be carried out. Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan disposed of the petition by directing the PWD officials to complete the entire work within a period of six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/finish-work-on-dividing-wall-for-channels/articleshow/88265020.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bagjola revamp work likely to start in Jan||Kolkata: Irrigation department officials have hinted that revamp of lower Bagjola canal may start from January. The department on Monday initiated the process to engage an agency to take up the Rs62.7-crore work of the 28-km stretch, cutting through areas of Rajarhat, Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) area, New Town and other parts of North 24 Parganas. The revamp work that will be conducted for the next one year will consist of thorough excavation and desiltation with the use of pontoon mounted excavators, which can perform dredging and desilting by floating on marshy or wetlands. Officials said a major part of the work is to be completed before monsoon next year so that the canal’s capacity increases and the stormwater does not get pushed back to the main land. Large parts of New Town, Rajarhat and adjacent areas witnessed huge flooding after the heavy rains in September as the overflowing canal failed to flush out excess stormwater. Officials said the canal’s normal water level which used to stay around 1.8 meter and would go up to a maximum of 2.5 meter after heavy rains, had increased to an unprecedented 3.2 meter this monsoon, the highest in recent times. There is huge amount of silt deposition on the canal bed which will be thoroughly scooped out by excavating the water bed. Underwater cameras will be used to oversee the desilting work. Along with excavation and desilting of the canal stretch, the canal’s embankment height will be increased to about four meters so that the canal water does not overflow to the land during heavy rains, officials said. Bagjola canal, which is divided into upper and lower Bagjola, stretches almost 38 km, carrying water all along BT Road before entering VIP Road and Rajarhat. It is the prime drainage outlet for a huge area of New Town, Rajarhat, Sector V, parts of Salt Lake and South Dum Dum along with the entire area off BT Road. Officials said the over 10 km-long Kestopur canal, which is Salt Lake area’s prime drainage outlet, will be also thoroughly desilted. The authorities are also taking up routine cleaning and hyacinth removal work from several canals including, Beliaghata, Bagjola, New Cut and Kestopur canals as part of the dengue malaria prevention measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bagjola-revamp-work-likely-to-start-in-jan/articleshow/88264341.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The CEO on Monday conducted a meeting of the health officials considering the threat of a third wave of covid pandemic. The officer directed the health department to take up several measures to increase vaccination of the people by conducting the camps as per the convenience of the beneficiaries. “The CEO has directed health officials to focus on a village, carry out vaccination of first dose and even second so that the village is completely covered,” Dr Kapil Aher, the district health officer, said. The number of people still to get their first dose is very low and, hence, scattered. They are either very stubborn on not taking any vaccine or they are not finding time to get the vaccine doses. “The responsibility of 100 % first dose vaccination has now been put on the shoulders of the gram panchayat. The health teams will be ready for the vaccination at any time they are called for,” Dr Aher said. The CEO has asked the health teams to visit all the schools in their jurisdiction and check for the health issues among the children which will be addressed immediately. “There is very less physical activity among children and hence, yoga activity will be carried out by the clinics which will also boost the immunity among the children,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-ceo-for-vax-drive-in-villages-for-full-coverage/articleshow/88263518.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Joy was writ large on the faces of the students as they walked into their schools after their parents or vans dropped them at the gates. At many schools the teachers and staff performed aarti as the children entered the school premises. In some schools, drums were played to welcome the students, and at a few others teachers handed roses to the students to welcome them back. Some schools even decorated the classrooms with flowers. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) had okayed reopening of schools for Classes I to VII in the city, and the district administration had allowed schools for students in Classes I to IV to restart in rural Nashik. Apart from the NMC-managed schools in the city, several private English medium schools also restarted classes for students of I to VII. The schools were shut during the initial stage of the first wave of the pandemic sometime in March-April last year. Since then, the schools had been imparting classes online. While the attendance of students in city schools was a bit more than 34%, in the rural parts of the district it was around 60%. Though the attendance was low in the city, 86% of the 442 civic and private schools with Classes I to VII reopened on Monday. Officials of all the schools checked students’ body temperature and provided them with hand sanitisers. Mitali Aher, a Class IV student of a city-based school, said she was thrilled to be back in the classroom. “I was tired of online classes. It was fun meeting my friends after so many months,” she said. Even some parents felt that attending classes physically is better than online lessons. Himgauri Adke, the chairperson of the Association of Nashik Schools — the apex body of 35 CBSE and ICSE schools in the city — said that a bulk of English-medium schools will reopen from January 4 after the Christmas vacation. The Nashik ZP’s education department officials said that classes in the primary section started in over 900 schools. Classes in the remaining 3,000 schools would start in phases. Vinod Sable, the headmaster of a ZP school in Niphad taluka, said the students were welcomed with flowers in his school. “We decorated the classrooms. While handling students of Classes III and IV was not tough, it was difficult to handle younger students in Classes I and II children since they came to the school for the first time,” Sable said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/schools-across-nashik-go-all-out-to-welcome-younger-students/articleshow/88263511.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Monday saw thousands of students from Goa and across India participate in the largest lesson on space exploration. Students built a replica of the giant radio telescope dish antenna following the talk, making it the third consecutive world record in three days. Chief minister Pramod Sawant tweeted his support, “I congratulate the participants who achieved these extraordinary feat at the India International Science Festival 2021.” The Guinness world record for the most people assembling a model rocket kit simultaneously and launching it was accomplished on Saturday. On Sunday, the record for most people assembling rainwater harvesting kits online and at a single venue was completed. A total of 531 Class XI students from 11 schools in Goa assembled a Gaganyan rocket model kit with 20 different components over two hours at the festival on Saturday. These rockets were then tested for launch at the Panaji gymkhana grounds, making it the first-ever attempt to send “the most rocket kits from a single venue”, thus creating a Guinness world record. Of the 531 rockets, 496 were successful in launching. This was accompanied by a talk by ISRO scientists who explained the upcoming Gaganyan mission. Interestingly, nearly 50% of the students were from rural Goa, who were trained to build a rocket from scratch. In addition to this, 940 students of Class VII and VIII from Goa and nearly 3,000 students from 125 cities across India (joined online) built a rainwater harvesting and water purification model on Sunday. This was done using plastic cups and a purification system that had five layers of filtration — a mesh, gravel, sand, charcoal and cotton.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/3-guinness-world-records-in-3-days-at-science-fest/articleshow/88265063.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Ahmedabad||Adopt natural farming, PM Narendra Modi tells Patidar gathering||GANDHINAGAR: Addressing the Patidar community, a majority of whom are engaged in farming, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a strong pitch for adopting natural farming techniques. He was speaking on Monday at the valedictory function of the foundation stone laying ceremony of Umiyadham in Ahmedabad. Maa Umiya is the reigning deity of the Kadva Patidar community. “The urge for higher yield within a short time has forced farmers to use fertilizers and chemicals without any care for Mother Earth,” Modi said. “That has degraded soil quality. I am here to request you not to forget Mother Earth while you serve Maa Umiya.” He added: “The children of Maa Umiya have no right to forget Mother Earth. For us, both are the same.” Modi went on to say: “I would therefore request you to take a pledge in the presence of Maa Umiya that you will take north Gujarat towards natural farming.” Modi said he will speak at length on the subject on December 16. “I request you all to understand, accept, and take natural farming forward with Maa Umiya’s blessings,” he said. He added that such new efforts will contribute to the development of Gujarat. He recalled the days when he was the Gujarat CM and had appealed to people to adopt water conservation through drip irrigation. He also said he had urged Patidars to improve sex ratio, especially in districts such as Mehsana. “In the same way, together, we can make a huge difference by adopting natural farming,” Modi said. He said that if people were not convinced, they can experiment with natural farming on one part of their land and see the results for themselves. He stressed the need to promote skill development at the upcoming complex. Rs 110 cr pledged for Umiyadham complex in 72 hoursOrganizers of the function said that Patidars pledged a sum of Rs 110 crore at the 72-hour event held to mark the foundation stone laying of Umiyadham in Ahmedabad. Donors kept announcing their contribution for the construction of the temple complex and all the major donors were felicitated by the organizers. The entire project is worth about Rs 1,500 crore of which the land is worth about Rs 1,400 crore, the organizers said. The remaining amount has been pledged by donors in just three days, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/adopt-natural-farming-pm-tells-patidar-gathering/articleshow/88265034.cms||---

The Mainline Electrical Multiple Unit (MEMU) service was flagged off by minister of state for railways Raosaheb Danve on Monday through a virtual programme. Jalgaon guardian minister Gulabrao Patil, Dhule guardian minister Abdul Sattar, MPs Subhash Bhamre, Unmesh Patil, Dhule mayor Pradeep Karpe, MLA Mangesh Chavan and others were present at the programme. The eight-coach train covers the 56-km distance between the two towns in 1.05 hours saving 10 minutes. The new MEMU rake has been installed in place of the earlier regular rake, which was powered by the diesel engine. The electrification of the route was carried out during the lockdown period. The train will benefit the people — especially the students and the farmers of both the districts. At the same time, it will also help connect people from Dhule by paying Rs 35 (maximum) for each journey. While the cost of the journey is higher when compared to Rs 15 that was being charged earlier. “The MEMU is being run as a special train and hence, the fare of mail / express class train is being charged. I have requested the railway administration and union MoS Danve as well, to consider re-designating the service as garibrath so that the fare charged is lower,” Chalisgaon MLA Mangesh Chavan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/chalisgaon-dhule-memu-relaunched-service-to-help-students-farmers/articleshow/88263563.cms||Abhilash Botekar

During the course of hearing, the additional advocate general Veera Kathiravan, appearing for the state, submitted the petitioner had posted the tweet questioning ‘Is Tamil Nadu turning into Kashmir under DMK rule? on December 9, which was one day after the army chopper crash in the Nilgiris. He submitted that the petitioner in his tweet has questioned the integrity of the state government alleging that it was supporting the divisive forces. Since the petitioner alleges some conspiracy, investigation has to be conducted in this case with regard to the materials available with him for posting such a tweet. Hence, he opposed the quash of FIR in the initial stage since investigation was necessary in this case. However, the counsel for Maridhas submitted that the petitioner had posted a tweet urging the state government to take action against those who are using smiley emoji for the death of the Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat. He submitted that an FIR against the petitioner is a violation of his fundamental right. After hearing the submissions, justice G R Swaminathan adjourned the case to December 14, Tuesday, since the counsel for the complainant V Balakrishnan sought time to make his submissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/state-opposes-maridhas-plea-to-quash-fir/articleshow/88265032.cms||---

The case was registered at BKC cyber police station in Mumbai on the complaint of the Maharashtra intelligence department against unidentified persons for allegedly tapping phones illegally and leaking certain confidential documents. The alleged tapping of phones had taken place when IPS officer Rashmi Shukla headed the state intelligence department, leading to a furore, with the parties in the ruling alliance in Maharashtra alleging that Shukla tapped phones without permission. In its reply on Friday through advocate Shreeram Shirsat, the ministry of home affairs said the Maharashtra government’s application in the metropolitan court in October had failed to specify which document it wanted and from whom, and sought that the application be dismissed. The matter is likely to be heard on December 18.

Last week, the state’s overall weekly positivity rate (WPR) was 0.8%. All districts had then registered a WPR below 2%. The districts have been asked to try and reduce the WPR to 0.5% by ensuring Covid-appropriate behaviour and speeding up the vaccination drive. The Centre has told all states and union territories to focus on intensive containment, active surveillance, enhanced testing, monitoring of hotspots, more coverage of vaccination and augmentation of health infrastructure following the emergence of Omicron. Experts were of the view that there should not be any laxity towards testing, especially during the winter.  Former director of health services and public health expert Dr PP Doke said the state should not rest till the weekly positivity and case fatality rates declined to below 0.5%. “These two parameters have to be achieved,” he said. — Nisha Nambiar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/daily-covid-testing-now-over-1-lakh-in-maharashtra/articleshow/88265037.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Kolkata||KMC elections: Candidates fight legacy battle as veterans’ shadow looms||KOLKATA: At least two candidates of this KMC elections have stepped into the shoes of their heavyweight family members, who are no longer part of the contest but their larger-than-life image may decide the contestants’ fate. One is Tanima Chaterjee, sister of the late Trinamool minister Subrata Mukherjee and the other is Ratna Chatterjee, estranged wife of former mayor Sovan Chatterjee. Both are apparently banking heavily on the popularity of Subrata and Sovan to win against their opponents. Ratna, who is contesting the KMC polls from Parnasree in Behala (Ward 131), had ostensibly tried to shrug off the “mighty presence” of her estranged husband from Parnasree, initially. But now, she has apparently “reconciled to his presence” and assured the electorate that she would try to fulfil the unfinished work of Sovan. “It is true he has not stepped into Parnasree ever since he decided to shift to a high-rise in Golpark three years ago. But it is not an easy task to obliterate his memory as a civic administrator, who has changed the very face of Parnasree,” Ratna told TOI, sitting at her Behala residence. According to Tanima, Subrata Mukherjee’s younger sister, she is contesting the civic polls only to honour her late brother’s last wish. Chatterjee knows the fight is uneven as she, an independent candidate, is pitted against Sudarshana Mukherjee, a Trinamool candidate and a sitting councillor. But banking on the image of Subrata Mukherjee, she is determined to put up a tough fight. “If my rival has the party by her side, I have my brother’s blessings. I have confidence in the people of Ballygunge and Gariahat for whom my brother had done so much—both as a mayor and as an MLA,” she said. According to Sharmila Ghosh, a Mandeville Gardens resident and a private firm employee, Subrata would certainly become a factor in the civic polls and it remained to be seen who would be able to cash in on the sentiment— a family member or the sitting councillor who was chosen as a candidate (Ward 68) for the KMC polls by Subrata himself in 2015. Ratna conceded that being Sovan’s wife, she has an advantage. “I have spent sleepless nights, standing by locals after Cyclone Amphan struck Kolkata. And the pandemic has helped me mature as a politician. But my advantage is that I have known KMC officers for a long time as the wife of the former mayor and they came to my rescue whenever I sought their help for the residents of Parnasree,” she said. Aware that many residents of Parnasree still admire Sovan for his contribution for the development of the area as a mayor between 2010 and 2018, Ratna has changed her strategy during the campaign. “I have not seen Ratna using a single abusive word against Sovan while out on the streets for campaigning. Perhaps she has nothing to say against Sovan as far as his role as a councillor is concerned,” said Bikash Pal, a retired government official and a resident of Parnasree. Ratna said her first task after the new civic board gets functional would be to finish an under-construction swimming pool, which had been lying untouched ever since Sovan quit from the mayor’s post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/candidates-fight-legacy-battle-as-veterans-shadow-looms/articleshow/88264373.cms||Saikat Ray

Agricultural photovoltaic (Agri-PV), also known as agri-voltaic or agri-photovoltaic, is an evolving practice in sustainable development that combines the production of food and energy. The land is used for both agriculture and solar power generation at the same time. Cial, the world’s first airport fully powered by solar energy, claimed that its agri-voltaic farming was the largest of its kind in the country. Cial had earlier experimented organic farming on one of its solar plants on the premises of the airport. It started the process of scaling up the farming practice by incorporating the modern method of agri-voltaic procedure in July 2021. Cial was able to cover agri-voltaic farming on a total area of 20 acres by December first week. “Cial has eight solar plants on the premises of the airport. The biggest one; near the cargo terminal has an area of 45 acres; of which 20 acres has been used for agri-voltaic practice. The authorities cultivated vegetables like yam, long yard bean, drumstick, mountain ginger, turmeric, cabbage, cauliflower and green chilli. Water used to clean solar photovoltaic panels is being used for irrigating the cultivation. These crops are expected to modify the micro-climates underneath PV modules by reducing the temperature which results in increasing efficiency in power generation,” said a Cial statement. Cial managing director S Suhas said that agri-voltaic practice is a magnificent opportunity for both the solar and agricultural sectors. “Optimum usage of available land and reusage of water are other advantages here,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cial-scales-up-agri-voltaic-farming/articleshow/88264337.cms||---

The body of the woman was recovered from the well on Monday. The deceased woman was identified as R Anjalai, 40, a resident of Sithapatti village in the district. According to sources, Anjalai used to work as a labourer in the agricultural land owned by M Somu in S Sevalpatti village. On Sunday morning, Anjalai went to work but did not return home till the evening. Her husband Rasu went to look for her in the agricultural land and noticed that the motor room building on top of the well had collapsed. When he looked inside the well, he noticed Anjalai’s slippers and lunch bag floating in the water. He informed the police officials and the fire and rescue services. As the officials faced a difficulty in continuing the search operation inside the well on Sunday night due to lack of daylight, they resumed the search on Monday morning. The fire and rescue services personnel removed water from the well and recovered Anjalai’s body and sent it to the government hospital for postmortem. The S S Kottai police have registered a case and are conducting investigations about this incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/woman-falls-into-well-in-sivaganga-drowns/articleshow/88265048.cms||---

The park was constructed by an NGO – Society for Promoting Rationality (SPRAT) — after it got one-year permission to develop the area on a 2,500-sq mt plot earmarked in Vejalpur for garden. The NGO developed the area bit by bit by obtaining funds from various sources and created a space amid densely populated area for recreational activities for children. This park was viewed as an attempt to regain communal amity after the 2002 riots disturbed the social fabric in this area. According to SPRAT, some 13 years after the park was created, AMC issued an eviction notice in 2017. It also offered to continue with the activity as a public-private partnership. As the terms could not be worked out, AMC issued a notice in January 2020 for eviction. The NGO asked for a timeline for vacating the land because it had put up various quipment and it wanted time to dismantle them and shift them to a plot at Matar town. However, in February 2020, AMC sealed the plot and immediately after the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, it bull-dozed the structures on June 4 and evicted the trust from the plot. The trust moved the HC complaining about the high-handed action on part of the civic body despite the fact that the NGO had taken much efforts to build the place. After hearing the case, Justice Biren Vaishnav imposed a cost of Rs 25,000 on AMC for its gesture and kept it open for the NGO to approach appropriate court to claim damages caused by AMC’s eviction drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-fines-amc-rs-25000-for-bulldozing-park/articleshow/88265049.cms||---

After the Covid-19 outbreak, the metro line remained non-operational for 211 days. When services resumed on October 19, Metro One registered ridership of merely 12,738, which gradually grew to over 1 lakh on the weekdays in February-March. Once again, in April-May, due to restrictions imposed during the second wave of Covid, weekday ridership dropped below 50,000. An official from Mumbai Metro One Private Ltd (MMOPL) said, “In the beginning of December 2021, weekday ridership improved to around 2 lakh, with the highest ridership [since the outbreak] of 2,02,536 on December 7.” With schools and colleges reopening, officials expect weekday ridership to cross 2.25 lakh by end of this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-metro-sees-2l-ridership-for-the-first-time-since-covid/articleshow/88265057.cms||Manthank Mehta

The decision comes in the wake of a ‘lukewarm response’ to the ultimatum given by transport minister and MSRTC chairman Anil Parab to workers on Friday. He had asked the striking staffers to resume duty by Monday morning, and had warned of punitive action if they failed to do so. A senior official said only 339 workers resumed duty, responding to the call of the minister. “Over 71,000 employees are adamant on going ahead with the indefinite strike, which has crippled the road lifeline of Maharashtra. We will be issuing showcause notices for dismissal from Tuesday morning,” he told TOI. The government is also examining stringent measures, including applying MESMA (Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act) on striking workers. Under MESMA, workers can be arrested for illegal strike and put in jail for up to a year, said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-msrtc-to-issue-dismissal-notices-to-over-10k-workers/articleshow/88265870.cms||Somit Sen

---||Madurai||Madurai Jn to undergo major redevelopment at Rs235cr crore||Madurai: In a big boost to infrastructure development at the Madurai Junction railway station, railways will undertake a major redevelopment work at a cost of Rs 235 crore. Southern Railway general manager (GM) John Thomas told reporters that the tender for the work is likely to be floated by the end of this month. On completion, the junction will have state-of-the-art facilities at par with an airport. A senior official told TOI that it would take three months for the tender process and the project completion has been fixed at 34 months from the commencement of the work. The project is designed with a futuristic view considering the increase in passenger movement at the junction for the next 40 years. Built area in the main building will increase to 21,500sqm from the existing 7,000sqm. The main entrance building will have separate departure and arrival forecourts with separate lanes for their vehicles just like an airport, to avoid congestion and inconveniences faced by the commuters now. The ground floor will house offices directly relating to train operations and passenger amenities like waiting halls, ticketing and reservation. A 155m-long subway connecting the new Periyar bus terminus and the railway station, near the existing railway mail service office will be undertaken at Rs 4.5 crore. “Madurai Corporation has given in-principle approval for the subway that will run below buses, one end of Ellis Nagar Bridge and Meenakshi Bazar at 11.5ft below the ground level,” an official said. It will be 3.3m tall so that even people carrying loads on their head can make use of it without difficulty and 5.5m wide. The two existing 6m wide foot overbridges will be converted into a 20m wide air concourse, each, to serve as passenger waiting area. Parcel movement will be taken to the Dindigul (southern) end with an exclusive foot overbridge for parcel movement to avert conflict of passenger and cargo movement. The first platform will be reconstructed and the sixth will be extended to accommodate express trains. A multi-level car parking at the eastern and western entrances, three-lane road connecting the underused western entrance and passenger amenities at the western entrance building are among other works to be carried out. Firefighting and evacuation system will be provided and all the six platforms will be uplifted. The existing bus port will be retained while dedicated places including separate bays for taxis and autorickshaws will be established. While train services will not be affected during the project, there would be temporary inconveniences to the public as facilities like waiting halls and other amenities will be unavailable while a few amenities will be temporarily relocated. The construction wing of the SR is the executing agency of the project. Madurai is among the 41 stations across the country and six in SR in the first phase for the major development works. Others are Puducherry, Kanyakumari and Rameswaram, Ernakulam and Kollam in Kerala. Similar development works will be carried out in Katpadi, Tambaram, Chennai Egmore and Tirunelveli stations and two in Kerala in the second phase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-jn-to-undergo-major-redevelopment-at-rs235cr-crore/articleshow/88265059.cms||M K Ananth

Currently, only Std VIII-XII is allowed to open in the city, whereas in rural areas Std I-XII have the permission to reopen. In Mumbai, classes from Std I onwards are set to reopen from December 15 which has given rise to speculation that Nagpur may follow suit. As municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B’s last statement, the reopening plans had been deferred till at least December 15. As per sources, the NMC is expected to take a call on reopening soon. A school principal told TOI that it is high time students are back in classrooms. “Right now, education is for the middle class and above section of society,” he said, not wishing to be identified. “These bureaucrats running the show have completely forgotten about the lower middle class and below section, which actually forms the majority of total students enrolled. In city, we have so many students coming from slums and what you would now term as concrete slums. These unfortunate children are being denied education just because bureaucrats wish to play it safe,” he added. Another principal of a Marathi medium school said, “Our students have gone back a year now. Whenever the government allows them to come back to classrooms, we cannot start with the current class education that they enter. It will have to be two months of learning from previous academic year’s curriculum followed by the regular.” A CBSE school located in the city says high school section has now hit the upper limit allowed. “There is a cap of 50% attendance and every day more students are coming to school. Now, we have breached the upper limit and actually have to tell students to wait for a bit. Right now, we working on a plan to see if all can be accommodated in two separate classrooms with different subjects being taught. The challenge with this experiment will be chosing which subject to webcast for online class option,” the principal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/demand-for-primary-school-reopening-grows/articleshow/88263609.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

At least five NMC workers are likely to be suspended and a few officials asked to show cause.The private contractor, whose name is yet to be officially revealed by NMC, is alleged to have prepared 42 bogus contracts and drawn the amount without supplying any material during the last one year. On Monday, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B held a meeting with the head of departments and asked them to tally approved works with payments disbursed.It’s learnt that the NMC asked the contractor to return the amount. It has taken a cheque of Rs 67 lakh from him but is yet to encash it. The civic chief has directed additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and the assistant commissioner (general administration department) to register an FIR against the contractor and take action against NMC staff who collaborated in the scam. NMC sources said that this is “just the tip of an iceberg”. “The contractor operates five firms and supplies material to different departments — from stationery to computers and heavy materials. The chances of the fraud going on for many years cannot be ruled out,” they said.It is also learnt from reliable sources that the contractor has revealed names of some more contractors who too had fleeced the NMC in a similar fashion.As per civic officials, the contractor had blank new ‘NMC’ files and ‘notesheets’ which are part of official communication. He prepared 42 bogus files with fake signatures of chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar and other officials of the health department. The contractor also prepared bogus work orders to his own firms and acknowledgement letters confirming receipt of materials at the health department. Then, he generated bills with signatures of Dr Chilkar and other officials, and submitted them to the accounts and finance department for approval.In this manner, he had prepared contracts of procurement of stationery, face masks, hand gloves and various materials related to dispensaries and hospitals run by the NMC.What has also come to fore is that the accounts and finance department used to clear the bills within three days when usually it takes months to process them.Dr Chilkar unearthed the irregularity and started a preliminary inquiry. Joshi is doing a detailed inquiry and is likely to submit a report to Radhakrishnan on Tuesday.The civic body had witnessed various scams over the years but the current modus operandi is being used for the first time in 157 years.The NMC has around 24 departments. Information about more such fraud contracts will be known after the departments cross-checks with the accounts and finance department. The annual budget of the NMC is around Rs2,800 crore.HOW THE SCAME CAME TO FORE* Health department received funds for containing Covid from state government under state disaster relief fund (SDRF)* Details of expenditure under SDRF has to be submitted with collector * CMO Dr Sanjay Chilkar sought note from accounts and finance department about expenditure done under SDRF* Expenditure in current fiscal was more than that approved by his office* Inquiry revealed contractor prepared 42 bogus files and drew payment of Rs 67 lakh* Signatures of Dr Chilkar and other officials of health department were forged in 42 contracts||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/firm-prepares-bogus-contracts-no-material-supplied-nmc-pays-rs67l/articleshow/88263624.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Pune||Mhada paper leak: Focus on links with pvt coaching classes||Pune: The city police’s investigation into the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) recruitment exam paper leak case is now focused on establishing links between the arrested and operators of private coaching classes, seen as a source of candidates to be tapped for circulating the question paper for money. Pune cyber police officials are not ruling out more arrests in the case as they go ahead with the custodial interrogation of Pritish Deshmukh (33) — director of GA Software Company, which was tasked with setting the paper — arrested on Saturday midnight along with his friends, Ankush Rambhau Harkal and Santosh Laxman Harkal. Besides, the interrogation is also on for two directors and an official of Aurangabad-based private coaching classes, whose custody was secured in this case after they were arrested earlier in the health department exam paper leak case. Of the four directors and an official of Aurangabad-based coaching classes held in the health department exam case, custody of Ajay Chavan and Krishna Jadhav, directors of Target Career Point and Shaksham Academy, respectively, and official Ankit Chankhore was secured in the Mhada case after their links with Deshmukh and the Harkals surfaced. “We are questioning private coaching class operators as to how they dealt with government authorities and paper setters in their exam paper leak plot,” said deputy commissioner of police (DCP-cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake, adding, “The chain of evidence in both cases is linked with private coaching classes. It is easy to reach out to job aspirants from classes. The authorities of these classes collect original educational documents, blank cheques and other documents from job aspirants and once the candidate gets the job, they take money before returning the documents. We are connecting all the dots.” A senior police officer told TOI, “If a coaching class manages to get more jobs for its pupils, its rating increases, and so do admissions. Their operators generally approach government officials involved in recruitment exam process or private paper setters with money and then a deal is struck. The paper is leaked with the help of middlemen, like the two arrested.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mhada-paper-leak-focus-on-links-with-pvt-coaching-classes/articleshow/88264368.cms||---

As the hundred different cops’ team went through CCTV footage from 250 locations, they came across irrefutable evidence that the entire story had been concocted. On Monday, the girl, a resident of Fetri, approached Kalamna police station and said that she was abducted in a white-coloured Omni van from the tony Ramdaspeth area arond 10am. The girl said she was on her way to music classes in the area when the abduction happened. She also said that the two masked men took her to a secluded place in Kalamna where she was gang raped and left to fend for her own. As cops swung into action, their first port of call was to scan CCTV footage based on the girl’s statements. Police commissioner Amitesh Kumar told the media that the girl had alighted from a bus near Moonlight studio and then took an auto towards Rani Jhansi Square and then on to Mayo hospital where she got off. From that hospital, she took another auto to Chikli (Kalamna) and then went on to Kalamna police station. With solid CCTV footage as their evidence, the girl confessed that she had made up the story. Kumar said that the girl did this because of some “personal issues”. As per sources, the girl had a tiff with her lover, who was planning to marry someone else. The girl is enrolled in a well-known city college located in the heart of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-thousand-cops-go-on-a-wild-goose-chase-as-girl-concocts-rape-story/articleshow/88263612.cms||---

The artist has given his best to recreate those scenes, including one labourer carrying a kid in a briefcase, walking through the roads with luggage and other struggles. “I did the sculpture to mark the miseries caused by the pandemic to guest labourers.

The repair work of the Tillari canal at Dhangarwadi, Maneri in Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra, was completed recently. However, officials from the water resources department of Maharashtra said that the water supply will be halted for a couple of days to give finishing touches to the repaired canal. They said it will take 2-3 more days to complete the lining work of cement and concrete from inside and pitching work of stones from outside to provide support to the canal.  On October 10, the left main canal of the Tillari Dam was breached at Maneri. Due to this, the water supply to Bicholim, Bardez and Pernem talukas and subsequently to entire North Goa was cut off for almost two months to undertake the canal repair work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/water-from-tillari-likely-to-be-released-this-week/articleshow/88265084.cms||---
---||Madurai||Jab certificate compliance far from reality||Madurai: Compliance to produce Covid-19 vaccination certificates at public places that was made mandatory by the district administration, from Monday, was very poor on the first day. Few shops, including a hotel near Mattuthavani bus stand had a tough time in implementing it as the customers gave excuses for not having a copy of the certificate and also picked up arguments with the monitoring staffs. Traders at the Mattuthavani bus stand and the flower market said that they cannot afford to lose customers by asking them to produce their certificate. “Commuters come to us in a hurry to get a water bottle or snacks before their bus leaves and they would go to the next shop if we asked for the certificate,” said a shopkeeper. Most shopkeepers and traders too did not wear masks. “Customers are going to spend only a few minutes in the shop. We don’t feel the need for checking vaccination status. It is not our responsibility to convince anyone to be vaccinated. Such a practice cannot be done in small shops,” said a shopkeeper on Kamarajar Salai. Government officials and people visiting government offices too could be seen without masks or carrying the vaccination certificates. Vishaal De Mall is among the very few public places where verification of vaccine certificates was followed. “It was not easy. We have been checking vaccine certificates from our guests over the last 10 days. We had deputed more staff at the entrance from Monday to make note of the details of the guests,” said a representative of the mall. The mall has a footfall of 7,000 to 8,000 a day from Monday to Thursday and it goes up to 18,000 to 19,000 a day from Friday to Sunday. “Some guests welcomed that we are making note of the details as they feel safe and secure. But nearly half the guests are left fuming as they are not comfortable to produce their certificates or wait till the details are entered,” he added. Health officials said that the responsibility to check lies with the individual establishments. “We gave instructions to all establishments. Officials will conduct random checks at various places to ensure that people are checked for vaccination and compliance to other Covid-19 safety protocols and initiate appropriate action against defaulters,” said S Raja, city health officer. Officials also said that it will take some time for establishments to ensure that the practice of checking vaccination is followed and it is expected to pick up in a few days. In Tasmac and PDS shops, shopkeepers will be responsible for implementing the mandatory vaccination rule. President of Tamil Nadu chamber of commerce and industry N Jegatheesan welcomed the district administration’s effort to increase the vaccination cover and make Madurai safe by making vaccination certificates mandatory at public places. “But the same push should be given to vaccinate those who are left out,” he said. Jegatheesan suggested that college students and employees who have not been vaccinated could be identified by their respective institutions and companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/jab-certificate-compliance-far-from-reality/articleshow/88265066.cms||M K Ananth
---||Madurai||Madurai MP writes to CBSE chief over misogynistic content in Class X paper||Madurai: Observing that the Class X trisemester question paper contained content misogynistic and very regressive thoughts on the structure of family and women’s liberation, Madurai MP Su Venkatesan on Monday wrote to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Chairman, Manoj Ahuja, seeking his intervention. The MP, in his letter, said that the in the particular question paper, the article for the comprehension questions, contained regressive notions about family system. He highlighted two lines from the article, which read, “What people have been slow to observe is that the emancipation of women has destroyed parental authority over children. It was only by accepting the influence of her husband that she (wife) was able to obtain obedience from the young.” Venkatesan condemned that these utterances are shocking which negate the whole history of social development and modern ideas on gender equity. “If social movements were not there, practices of sati, child marriages, devadasi would have continued even now. We know sati was in practice even in 1987 when widowed Roop Kanvar was burnt alive at the age of 18 sitting atop her deceased husband’s funeral pyre. She was married to him just before months of that incident. There are records showing three crore child widows were there in our country in the 1930s. Our children are to be taught the glorious history of struggles of social emancipation of women which put an end to these cruel practices,” he said. Venkatesan added that question framers chose to put regressive ideas before the students instead. The MP also noted that this would spoil the minds of the students and instil wrong notions in their psyche. He has hence requested the CBSE chairman to take stern action on the people responsible. AMMK general secretary T T V Dhinakaran also expressed shock over the content in the question paper. “Why should the board ingrain such thoughts in the minds of growing teenage students and in a way to demean a girl child?” he asked, while urging CBSE to act more responsibly in setting question papers and finalising syllabus for students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-mp-writes-to-cbse-chief-over-misogynistic-content-in-class-x-paper/articleshow/88265071.cms||---

That vacuum which was created at the time of his demise is yet to be filled. At least that is what I feel. Looking at his statue here today, I feel there is need for a leader like him today.” Parrikar’s ethics and principles need to be taken forward, said Lobo, after paying respects at the samadhi. “Everyone who wants to work for Goa, whether he is a social worker or an elected member, they should work to uphold Parrikar’s ethics and principles,” he said. “Everyone used to look at him as someone who would do something for Goa and Goans. An IITian would never think ‘I will become a politician’ and take this small little Goa forward. He filled the vacuum in leadership at that time in Goa, and took Goa towards progress. His thinking was very good, simple and different, which we have to now take forward.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/leadership-void-left-after-parrikars-death-not-yet-filled/articleshow/88265073.cms||---

A bench led by Justice Amjad Sayed, before whom the matter was mentioned by advocate Pradeep Thorat, has posted the hearing on Tuesday. MLC Jagtap’s petition has sought the use of Shivaji Park ground from December 22 to December 28. It has urged that the state government be directed to grant its nod to hold public meetings and necessary permissions, including to erect a temporary stage on one portion of the open space. The petition said on October 7, an application was submitted to the state seeking its permission for a rally in which party leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will also be present. Till date, though, no decision has been taken on it. The petition said the party will adhere to all the norms prescribed by the civic authority and the public health department. On May 5, 2010, HC had directed the park to be declared a silence zone on a public interest litigation by Wecom Trust. The court had then said that programmes can be held only on December 6 (Mahaparinirvan Din of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar), May 1 (Maharashtra Day) and on January 26 (Republic Day). A January 2016 government resolution increased to 45 the number of days the park can be used for non-sporting events. The petition said it is the discretion of the state government that has to take the final decision. Further, out of 45 days of non-sporting events, on 11 days the ground can be given to non-sporting activities to private individuals or organisations. The petition said December 28 is a very important day in Congress history.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-moves-hc-for-nod-to-rahuls-rally-at-shivaji-park/articleshow/88265077.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Bulgarian ran skimming scam from his room at Andheri hotel||MUMBAI: The city crime branch have claimed to have busted a major credit/debit cards skimming racket with the arrest of a Bulgarian national from a three star hotel in Andheri on Sunday.  The crime branch unit 7 on Sunday arrested Fergier Vensislav Donchor (45) who is one of the key members of the skimmer gang. Sources said that while they have arrested Fergier, they are looking for one more Bulgarian national involved in the racket. The Mumbai police suspect that the two are part of an international gang instrumental in siphoning off money from ATM machines through skimming devices. On November 26, officials of Goregaon police station had registered an offence xof cheating, forgery against an unknown person after a local lodged a complaint. The local had stated that though he had not used his debit card, he ended up losing Rs 6,680. It was suspected that someone had siphoned off his money through skimming. The police said that several other people from the same locality had lodged similar complaints of fraud from their bank accounts. The modus operandi of the accused was to secretly install skimming machines at the ATM centres, said the police. He allegedly stole customers’ credit and debit card credentials using skimmer devices. Using that information, he would then create cloned cards and withdraw money from the bank accounts of those people from ATM kiosks. The city crime branch, which was carrying a parallel probe into this, got a specific tip-off that a foreign national was involved in the skimming scam and that this person was residing at a hotel in Andheri. A crime branch team led by inspector Manish Shridhankar and Priya Thorat raided the hotel room from where the police arrested Fergier. The police also seized two mobile phones, and a laptop which used to make duplicate debit/credit cards. “In the Goregaon case, we studied the CCTV footage of the ATM where at least 40 to 50 people lost their money. The CCTV footage matched with the arrested accused. Besides this, we also gathered technical evidence of his tower location among other details.” said a source. The police said that they have seized his passport and have informed the Bulgarian Embassy about the arrest and the other absconding suspect. The police said the accused are also seen in CCTV footage of a case registered at Navghar police station in Mulund.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bulgarian-ran-skimming-scam-from-his-room-at-andheri-hotel/articleshow/88265875.cms||Ahmed Ali

On Parrikar’s 66th birth anniversary, Sawant said the memorial or ‘smrithi sthal’ is nearing completion and will be opened to the public soon. “The memorial is not fully ready, but we offered flowers at the samadhi and at the statue of Manohar ‘Bhai’ Parrikar. The infrastructure development carried out by him and the various social security schemes he introduced continue to benefit and are remembered by Goans. We are taking the state forward in the same direction and working to see Goa progress as he wanted it. There was some delay in completing the smrithi sthal project due to Covid-19. But we will complete it shortly and open it to the public,” said Sawant. The foundation stone for the memorial project was laid on Parrikar’s birth anniversary in 2019. The project is coming up at a cost of Rs 10 crore. Planned as a sort of museum-shrine dedicated to the former chief minister, the memorial is designed to take the visitor along a ‘spiritual journey’ through his life. The sthal will be divided into sections philosophically named ‘Bhava’ (birth the symbol of a new beginning), ‘Seva Yatra’ (a selfless journey of service), ‘Antyesti’ (last rites), and ‘Samsare’ (circle of life). BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade, Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate, and former Panaji MLA Sidharth Kuncalienker were among those present along with the chief minister on Monday while offering tributes to Parrikar. A blood donation drive was held at BJP’s Panaji office in his memory. Goa governor P S Sreedharan Pillai also visited Parrikar’s samadhi later in the day and offered tributes. “He was always seen as a leader who had promise to rise to the national level, and he rose to the occasion. He was one of the best defence ministers the country ever had. In the development of Goa, he had bigger contribution than any other public functionary. I hope he will continue to be an inspiration for the future generations,” said Pillai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-taking-state-forward-in-direction-parrikar-wanted/articleshow/88265065.cms||---

The curriculum has been developed by state’s department of environment and climate change in collaboration with Unicef for standards 1-8 and focuses on four themes -- biodiversity conservation, solid waste management and personal and community health, water resource management and energy, air pollution and climate change.Speaking exclusively to TOI, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said that the curriculum addressing these areas has been developed in the form of lesson plans which go beyond classroom learning. “These activity-based lesson plans focus on learning principles and enhancing cognitive skills of the students. They focus on learning outcomes or green habit to be inculcated, key concepts and questions, related activities, teaching-learning approach, materials and methods as well as FAQs that can guide teachers and students,” added Thackeray.Stressing on the need to introduce subjects like climate change and environment protection from early years of education, the minister told TOI, “Climate change is no longer a theoretical issue or something to wonder about. It is happening in front of our eyes and children are the future generation that will be most affected by it. Therefore, educating them on these subjects at a young age only helps them to better understand what is happening around them. Importantly, it helps them become more responsible citizens who can be proactive about it.”According to him, the absence of these pivotal subjects was a missing component in environmental studies not being mainstreamed into school academics. “Environmental studies in maincourse curriculum is crucial as it it allows young students to make connections between the different aspects of climate change such as natural disasters, emissions, water, temperature and so on. This is also a link to their other subjects in school, giving them a wholesome education,” said Thackeray.Thackeray, who recently attended the international conference on climate change COP26 in Glasgow, said he is hopeful that children will become more aware and motivated to take climate action.The minister has handed over the curriculum to school education minister Varsha Gaikwad who said said that education “is about helping children better interact with their environment”. “Through the Majhi Vasundhara curriculum to be introduced in schools, we hope to prepare young minds to respect, protect and save the environment. A committee comprising senior officials of environment and education department will take this initiative forward in a time bound manner,” she added.BASED ON FOUR THEMES• Biodiversity conservation• Solid waste management and personal & community health• Water resource management• Energy, air pollution and climate change||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-introduces-climate-change-subject-for-std-i-viii/articleshow/88263666.cms||Manka Behl
---||Pune||Online system for doctors’ enrolment likely by January||Pune: The fully online system for the registration of doctors as RTO-certified medical experts for driving licence renewal process is likely to go functional by January next year. The system is being developed by the National Informatics Center (NIC). “Doctors are not ready to visit the RTO offices with their certificates for verification. We have had detailed discussion with NIC and they are in the last leg to develop a fully online system for the doctors to complete the verification process. Once the system goes online, we expect the enrolment process to be in motion from January,” a transport department official told TOI. The authorities had to postpone the initiative of RTO-certified process thrice as merely 177 doctors have registered under the plan as against a targeted 72,000 (200 in each district) across the state. It was to be implemented from September-end. The doctors’ unwillingness to go through what they see as a ‘time-consuming’ process of visiting the concerned RTO establishment, along with their medical credentials, to get themselves enrolled, was seen as a major obstacle in the registration plan. “With the help of the online system, the doctors can simply upload their certificates online and send them to us. We will verify and approve the documents before sending the applicants their special login id and password of the Sarathi portal. This will save the time of the doctors and that of the RTO officials,” the official said. As per the plan, people wanting to renew their driving licences were to go to the RTO-registered doctors, which would upload their medical certificates on the Sarathi portal. It was done to keep the fakes at bay. Sources in the medical fraternity, however, said another major hurdle remained in the process. “As per the plan, doctors have to login into the Sarathi portal and upload the applicant’s medical certificate. This regulation needs to change as no doctor has the time to go through this process. Unless this system is changed, the plan will not succeed,” a Pune doctor said. Currently, a self-declaration of medical fitness, which is approved by a doctor, is required to renew a driving licence, and it is be uploaded by the applicant. “If doctors upload the medical certificate, the system will recognise that it was uploaded from the login ID of a verified doctor,” an official had said. RTO officials had earlier suggested that if doctors were hesitant to come to the office, they would send their inspectors to them. “The process of making the registration process online is in the pipeline. However, doctors should come to the the RTO office to collect their logins for the Sarathi portal. They should bring their certificates that will be verified by the IMA or any recognized medical body. If doctors are hesitant, we would send our inspectors to their location for the same,” Sanjiv Bhor, deputy RTO in Pune, had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/online-system-for-doctors-enrolment-likely-by-january/articleshow/88264378.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Plans begin for girder across Sambhaji Bridge||Pune: After a clearance from mayor Murlidhar Mohol, the MahaMetro has restarted preliminary works to complete the launching girder above Sambhaji Bridge (Lakdi Pul) in Deccan area. A detailed plan is being prepared, the MahaMetro officials said, adding that the work will be executed in coordination with the civic administration and the traffic police will assist with the work. The launching of girder across Sambhaji Bridge had halted for almost three months after Ganesh mandals and some elected representatives objected to the girder claiming that it will restrict the movement of vehicles carrying Ganesh idols during the annual immersion procession. Mohol had ordered a halt to the work and had appointed an experts committee to submit a report on alternatives. However, after finding a cost escalation of up to Rs 70 crore and a delay of two years in executing the changes, he then told MahaMetro to go ahead with the existing plan. Officials from the MahaMetro said, “We have started preparations to launch the girder. Some machinery and cranes are required to place the girder on the viaduct. The work will be completed with minimum disruptions to the traffic.

A significant part of the issues raised during the satyagraha on Monday was the plan prepared for Old Goa in 2016 by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), an organisation pursuing heritage awareness and conservation. Another plan was prepared for the former capital by the Charles Correa Foundation with former chief town planner Edgar Ribeiro, in 2020. “Why have all these masterplans been shelved?” Alton D’Costa from Quepem asked. He was among citizens from Quitol, Fatorpa, Barcem and Quepem who showed solidarity to the ongoing hunger strike. Others were from Arpora, Parra, Calangue and Candolim. The Save Old Goa Action Committee, a group of activists and heritage lovers, has been demanding a masterplan for Old Goa since 2011. Haphazard development continued as the world heritage site was stripped of green cover, impacting the character of the place. D’Costa urged deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar, who holds the town and country planning portfolio, to update the regional plan within a week in order to protect Old Goa. While residents of Calangute wondered about the seriousness of their MLA Michael Lobo’s demand for demolition of the illegal structure in the protected area, they reiterated their stand on getting the site cleared up. Although the Old Goa panchayat has initiated the process for it, it has been progressing at a slow pace, the citizens said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/citizens-question-shelving-of-old-goa-masterplans/articleshow/88265081.cms||---

---||Surat||First Omicron case in Surat, Gujarat tally rises to 4||SURAT: The number of Omicron cases in Gujarat rose to four with Surat reporting the first case of the new Covid-19 variant on Monday. A 42-year-old diamond businessman from Varachha area, who had travelled to Africa, landed in New Delhi on December 4 but tested negative in the mandatory tests. He reached India after visiting Abu Dhabi and Sharjah. When he was tested again during the quarantine period in the city, he was found Covid-19 positive on December 8 and his samples were sent for genome sequencing at Gandhinagar, which confirmed that he had contracted the new variant. None of his family members or those who came in his direct contact tested positive. “The patient is asymptomatic and he is under strict home isolation. He was under isolation at a private hospital after arrival,” said a health official.  The health authorities are likely to shift the patient to hospital after confirmation of the Omicron variant. “None of his family members have tested positive. The patient will be tested again in two days,” said an officer. The Surat Municipal Corporation’s health teams have increased surveillance in the area around the patient’s residence on Ashwini Kumar Road in Varachha. Earlier, three people in Jamnagar, a 72-year-old man and his wife, both who had returned from Zimbabwe, had tested positive for Omicron. The man’s brother-in-law who had gone to receive them in Ahmedabad was also found infected with this variant.  Meanwhile, two more people tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday.

As soon as he spots some police personnel, he quickly exits from the spot. He appears again after some time, shouting: ‘Satara, Purandar, Bhor’, assuring travellers of reasonable fares. “It is my father’s van. Someone gave me the idea to use the van to ferry people and I have been doing it for almost 20 days now. The MSRTC strike has given me the opportunity to earn decent money after a long time,” Sudhakar said on Monday. The ongoing strike has given many like Sudhakar a chance to earn some money. “However, while private buses can charge 1.5 times the fare of a MSRTC bus, as per regulations, there is no control on fares charged by private cars, vans etc. The matter needs to be looked into,” a Pune RTO official said. Passengers said they are often forced to travel in private vehicles paying more as they have no choice. “For a trip to Wai in Satara, private vehicles charge Rs800 for single passenger. For the same journey, MSRTC charges around Rs300,” Srikant Patil, a regular commuter, said. “We will take strict action if anybody is found to be charging unreasonable fares. Passengers can complain to RTO nodal officers or with the police,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/drivers-of-pvt-vehicles-make-most-of-msrtc-strike-as-commuters-suffer/articleshow/88264393.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Nagpur||MoEFCC allows non-forest land mining for projects involving forest land||Nagpur: In yet another move to dilute the Forest Conservation Act (FCA), 1980, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) has allowed user agencies to begin mining operations on non-forest land for mining leases involving forest land too.The decision has been taken on the request of Coal India Limited (CIL) on July 14, 2020, followed by the coal ministry’s letter of August 14, 2020, appealing to the MoEFCC to allow commencement of mining operations on non-forest land where Stage-I approval under the FCA and environment clearance under the Environment Protection Act has been obtained.The MoEFCC, whose objective is to conserve forest and wildlife, acceded to the coal ministry’s request, saying “the matter was considered and recommended by Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) subject to certain conditions in its meeting on October 28, 2021”.The environment ministry issued an advisory in this regard to all the states on December 10, 2021. Even before FCA is proposed to be amended and comments have been invited, MoEFCC has been diluting it.On October 25 it diluted the Act by exempting road development agencies from forest clearance if the right of way (RoW) belonged to them. The same day it issued a circular to the states, designating eco-tourism as a forestry activity by removing the non-forestry tag. Conservation Action Trust executive trustee Debi Goenka said this is yet another example of how the MoEFCC is attempting to dilute the provisions of the FCA through the backdoor. “An Act cannot be amended by a circular, and anyone who adopts the procedure mentioned therein will be in serious trouble,” she said.Goenka added that it is almost impossible to mine coal from the non-forest portion without impacting the adjacent forest areas. “The MoEFCC talks about cumulative impact assessment, but this circular contemplates exactly the opposite by trying to compartmentalize forest and non-forest lands.” Maharashtra state wildlife board member Kishor Rithe said, “Though the FAC recommendation seems like some ground (for proposals on non-forest lands) to consider this request, it will actually be used to put pressure to grant the clearance on forest land too.” Rithe added, “MoEFCC is making it difficult for FAC and Regional Environment Committees to protect the forest lands and forests, especially when the country has already committed to doing away with coal-based projects in the context of climate change response.”The MoEFCC has allowed mining operations in non-forest land of mining leases involving forest with certain conditions, but with major players involved in the coal mining business, it remains to be seen who will monitor whether these conditions are being followed or not.The mining plan for working in the non-forest area within a coal block or lease (which also has forest area within it) shall not involve any forest area in the lease concerned. Such blocks should not have any dependency in the forest area of the same block.Environment lawyer Manish Jeswani said, “Such permissions in the non-forest area when the forest is involved will create fait accompli situations which are in violation of Supreme Court orders.”The MoEFCC says that if any violation over forest area is reported, the matter shall be dealt with as per the provisions in the FCA. However, citing an example of FCA violations by a private power generation company in Tiroda, Gondia district, wildlife conservationists from Gondia said both, the forest department and MoEFCC, have failed to take any action in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/moefcc-allows-non-forest-land-mining-for-projects-involving-forest-land/articleshow/88263677.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||War of words between Cong and BJP ahead of MLC poll result||Nagpur: Ahead of the MLC poll (local constituency) results due on Tuesday, a war of words between rivals BJP and Congress heated up. It all started with BJP’s senior leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule landing the first blow by calling for Congress state unit chief Nana Patole’s resignation over the MLC poll flip-flop. Congress’s candidate Ravindra Bhoyar had crossed over from BJP but failed to garner support from his new party’s cadres. Ultimately, Congress decided to back independent candidate Mangesh Deshmukh.Commenting on this, Bawankule said Patole must resign for this mess. Jumping to the defence of his state party chief, Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe raised the decible a couple of notches. “Bawankule is probably becoming aware of the looming defeat and that’s why such comments. Changing candidates is also a strategy for winning the poll. Your post in BJP is comparable to that of a peon. When your Sandip Joshi lost the MLC poll did you ask for Devendra Fadnavis’s resignation? So, first increase your stature in the party and then talk about Congress,” said Londhe about Bawankule.Cabinet minister Sunil Kedar said that if Bawankule wants to make such suggestions, then he must consider changing the party first. “Bawankule is welcome to join Congress and then make such a demand. And his statements of Patole being under pressure is false, because in Congress we do not have that culture of cornering the state party chief,” said Kedar. BJP’s state secretary Dharmpal Meshram said, “Londhe calling Bawankule chaprasi is uncalled for. They are trying to question Bawankule’s political ability but we all know that Patole jumps from party to party for personal gains. All Congress workers are servants of the Gandhi family, so think about that before targetting Bawankule with such type of remarks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/war-of-words-between-cong-and-bjp-ahead-of-mlc-poll-result/articleshow/88263672.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

A mega cleanliness drive between Godowlia and Maidagin crossings as part of BJP’s eight-day special sanitation campaign in Varanasi came to an end on Sunday. The party leaders are charting a plan to deliver ‘prasad’ at the doorsteps of eight lakh homes. Led by BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh, ministers, party office bearers, leaders, workers and volunteers washed the road from Maidagin crossing. Varanasi Municipal Corporation’s staff also sanitized the areas along the road. Chugh said, “The sanitation drive was aimed at preparing the city for the opening of Kashi Vishwanath Dham by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Party workers washed the road as seers, religious and spiritual leaders would arrive for the expansion of the Kashi Vishwanath temple over 250 years after its construction by Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar.” State co-in-charge of party, Sunil Oza said the entire world is eager to witness the historic occasion of the opening of KVD. UP urban development minister Ashutosh Tandon said the cleanliness drive launched by PM in 2014 has become a mass movement. BJP national secretary Rituraj Sinha, Kashi region president Mahesh Chand Srivastava, ministers Neelkanth Tiwari, Ravindra Jaiswal and Navratan Rathi also took part in the drive. Srivastava said after KVD’s opening, 15,000 BJP workers will start distribution of prasad. We plan to distribute prasad to eight lakh households in the district from Monday evening, said Srivastava highlighting other religious and cultural activities organized by party in past 10 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjps-sanitation-drive-ends-workersto-distribute-prasad-in-8l-houses/articleshow/88245177.cms||---

The notice to Shah has been issued in his capacity as the BCCI secretary. The notice has also been issued to Desh Deepak Khanna, secretary, UT Cricket Association (UTCA) Chandigarh. Justice H S Sidhu issued the notice while taking cognizance of a petition filed by M Shahnawaz Khan, a resident of Chandigarh. The petitioner has sought directions for taking action against them for wilful disobedience of the order dated December 7, 2021, passed by the HC under the Contempt of Courts Act. The petitioner is currently working at Mohali’s Minerva Football Club Academy as CEO and has also worked as head coach of Minerva Cricket Academy in the J P Atray Tournament for the session 2021-22. As per the petition, on November 25, the BCCI in tie-up with UTCA advertised the BCCI Hybrid level-1 coaches’ certification course, which was to start from December 6, 2021, till December 11, 2021, in various newspapers. The teaching faculty of the National Cricket Academy was to conduct the certification course. The last date of application or registration for the course was November 25. According to the petitioner, he had applied on time but for one reason or the other, the BCCI, as well as UTCA, did not allow him to join the certification course. When the petitioner approached the HC on the issue, the HC in its order dated December 7 directed the BCCI as well as UTCA to allow the petitioner to join the course provisionally subject to the outcome of the petition. Despite the specific directions, the UTCA, as well as the BCCI, did not allow him to join the certification course. According to the petitioner, because of the attitude of the respondents, he has suffered a huge educational/ financial loss due to the conduct of the respondents. "It is, therefore, requested that action under Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act be taken against the respondents for wilful disobedience of the order dated December 7, 2021, passed by the HC and the respondents are summoned and sentenced thereof,” the petitioner said. The matter would come up for hearing on December 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-notice-to-jay-shah-utca-secy-on-contempt-plea/articleshow/88265106.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Born out of Covid-19 pandemic, airport budget meals are here to stay||MUMBAI: If food and beverage outlets at airport could speak, the stories they narrate would throw light on the effect the different stages of the pandemic has had on the gastronomic preferences, spending capabilities and collective anxieties of the passengers who pass through them. Like when the migrants thronged the domestic terminals last year to board flights home, food outlets at Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata introduced budget meals. These meals continue to be served to this day, even though passenger profile has changed quite a bit since last year. When domestic air travel restarted on May 25 last year after a two-month ban, a sizeable proportion of passengers were migrants and blue-collar workers, said Gaurav Dewan, COO, Travel Food Services (TFS), which runs F&B outlets and lounges in airports across India. “The pandemic protocol put in place had passengers reach terminals at least two hours in advance. But sales at airport food outlets didn’t pick up. These passengers weren’t buying food at the airports, even though no food was being served on board airlines too. That was when we introduced the ‘paisa vasool meals’,” he said. “The perception is that airport food is expensive. But these meals were priced around Rs 100 and they took off,” said Dewan. Even though the migrant traffic petered off post-Diwali last year, the outlets continue to sell the top-sellers. “Among them are Dal Khichdi with pickle, garlic chutney meal priced at Rs 99 and pav-bhaji for Rs 120. Even at Juhu beach, pav-bhaji is priced at Rs 160,” he said. The food preference varies. While vada pav is popular in Mumbai airport, in Bengaluru and Chennai it’s idli, while chole bhature rules in Delhi and biryani in Kolkata, he said. The F&B outlets themselves are also an indicator of the state of air travel. Pre-Covid, TFS ran 265 F&B outlets and lounges in airports such as Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru, Dewan said. Currently, it has kept only 189 outlets operational in these five airports due to low international passenger traffic due to curtailed operations. “But in many domestic markets, we’ve touched pre-Covid 2019 numbers. Delhi airport recovered the fastest, followed by Mumbai while airports such as Chennai and Kolkata are at 65-70% of pre-Covid numbers,” he said. The return to pre-Covid normalcy is also signalled by the drop in sales of immunity boosters like haldi-doodh, tulsi-pudina shikanji, amla aam panna etc, which made their airport debut last year when wary flyers walked into terminals post-lockdown. “No one wants the immunity boosters now,” he said. In the lounges, with restrictions lifted, boxed meals have gone and buffets are back. “The food preferences have gone back to pre-Covid times. Passengers are spending more time in the lounges and F&B outlets,” he said. On the domestic airport gastronomic scene at least, things then are back to normal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-born-out-of-pandemic-airport-budget-meals-are-here-to-stay/articleshow/88265114.cms||Manju V
---||Mumbai||Give 5% Muslim reservation, AIMIM won’t contest polls: Imtiaz Jaleel||Parliamentarian from Aurangabad and state AIMIM chief Imtiaz Jaleel on Monday said that his party would not contest upcoming polls to the local bodies in the state if the MVA government gives 5% reservation to Muslims. “Every time we raise our voice for the quota for Muslims, ruling party leaders say it’s a poll gimmick. To prove our point, it is our open challenge to the government that we will not contest in any upcoming local poll in Maharashtra if it gives reservation to Muslims,” he told mediapersons. Two days after taking out the Tiranga rally and holding a demonstration in Mumbai, the state unit of AIMIM on Monday demanded a special bill be brought into the winter session of the legislature for Muslim quota. “The ruling three-party alliance has comfortable majority to pass such a bill. Since these parties, including Shiv Sena, claim to be secular, there should not be any hesitation in giving reservation to Muslims,” Jaleel said. Stating that the demand for Muslim reservation was not sub judice, like some other quotas, he said the state government must take necessary steps at the earliest. “In the past, MVA leaders had suggested that Muslims take to the streets if their demand for reservation is not met. The Tiranga rally is just the beginning. We will intensify the agitation if the state government fails to table a bill in support of Muslim reservation,” Jaleel said. AIMIM has also demanded strengthening of Wakf Board to protect its properties in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-give-5-muslim-reservation-aimim-wont-contest-polls/articleshow/88265890.cms||---

A key officer privy to the development said, “The objective of the proposed agro-export policy is to promote production of high quality, high-yielding varieties of export-oriented crops and marine products and to give special impetus to export-oriented units.”  “Under the proposed policy, special financial incentives will be given along with the development of 13 major agro-export clusters. Under the policy, financial incentives worth Rs 1,750 crore will be given to local clusters and industries. The focus will be on creating export support infrastructure in the identified clusters and supporting farmers in raising international quality produce, which can be marketed abroad. The policy draft is in the process of being approved by the government. The action plan has got in-principle approval,” a source said. Thirteen crop clusters have been identified, where the government will set up infrastructure in the form of air cargo complexes at Vadodara, Surat and Rajkot airports, specially-designed packing houses and temperature-controlled warehouse at Mundra, Kandla and Pipavav for agro and food products. For market development, the government will organize fairs and facilitate participation in fairs, events, buyer-seller meets, reverse buyer seller meets, trade delegations etc. for the sector. Besides setting up an export facilitation cell, the government will conduct a detailed study on country-wise requirements of crops and processed foods, carry out qualitative and quantitative analysis of products required and facilitate statutory tests and quality certifications for exports to various countries. Subsidies for setting up agro and food processing units and infrastructure facilities will range from 35% to 60% depending on what percentage of produce is exported, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-govt-framing-new-agro-export-policy/articleshow/88265107.cms||Kapil Dave

Many occupants of municipal properties, who had not paid rent, were asked to clear their dues as part of this special initiative. As per the PMC officials, various departments of the civic body involved with work pertaining to water department, tax department, estate department and the sky sign department participated in the initiative. The PMC resolved 734 cases in one day at the Lok Adalat. As per the data, around Rs7.2crore was collected by the property tax department. The water department collected around Rs85lakh, the sky sign department received Rs15lakh, while the estate department recovered Rs 30 lakh. The PMC had tried the option of Lok Adalat in September, too. A group of elected members had raised objections to using the arbitration route to recover the dues. They claimed that the scheme had been introduced to benefit a few big tax defaulters and ruling party leaders. But after clarification from the civic administration, the elected members supported the move. The PMC took the initiative in December after successful recovery in September. Over 10,000 notices were served to defaulters of different departments. The remaining cases would be resolved in the days to come.

---||Chandigarh||‘Women played major role in making stir a success’||Jind: Freedom fighter Bhagat Singh’s niece Gurjeet Kaur on Monday visited the Jhanjh langar, a major stopover for farmers from Punjab and Haryana. The langar site had started on December 13 last year, and Gurjeet and several other farmers cut a cake to mark the occasion. Addressing the gathering, Gurjeet Kaur said women had played a key role in making the agitation a success. “Sardar Ajit Singh, uncle of martyr Bhagat Singh, had also started a farmers’ agitation in 1907. He was jailed, and the British tried to kill him too, but in the end he was victorious. Women had played a key role in that agitation too. Women should come forward now at every front. During the freedom movement, male revolutionaries used to stay away from home and women worked hard and showed their strength by nurturing their families.” “ I never knew that people from Haryana know so much about Bhagat Singh, but when I had come to Tikri border to take part in the agitation, I saw a photo of Bhagat Singh on every vehicle. Women had camped at Delhi borders and at toll plazas too, which prove that women can play an equal role to make any agitation successful. In this era, women are educated. Therefore, male should encourage them to come forward,” she added. Kaur added, “Religions belong to individuals, but they never teaches us to fight with each other. Time has come to break the caste and religion bar as everyone is equal in this world. Now, everyone should work to establish fraternity among every section of society.”’ Support from overseas A woman named Maria, a native of California, also addressed Haryana farmers at the Jhanjh langar site. She said, “I am an almond farmer and have been supporting Indian farmers in their agitation against the farm laws. When PM Narendra Modi visited America during the protest, local residents raised slogans against him. Even people from various countries, including Germany, Canada, and Australia, held protests in favour of Indian farmers and the whole world was standing firmly with them..”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/women-played-major-role-in-making-stir-a-success/articleshow/88265128.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Recycle, cut down on plastic use, urge activists||Kolkata: Given the huge amount of plastic material used for election campaigns and then, thrown away arbitrarily, environment activists demanded the plastic waste generated ahead of the civic polls on December 19 should be properly disposed of and reused as much as possible. Sabuj Mancha, an umbrella organization for green activists and NGOs, has appealed to the state election commission to develop a mechanism for least environmental degradation during the election process. Campaign materials usually include plastic posters, flexes, flags, festoons and banners, most of which are very thin and tend to choke drains and swear lines, leading to overflowing of waste and stopping inhibit faster receding of rain water. “The environmental degradation of the city is accelerated by the enormous amount of plastic waste generated,” said Naba Dutta, general secretary of Sabuj Mancha. “Our experiences from earlier elections showed that most of the time, party and candidates’ campaigns and the election process caused considerable environmental pollution. We request you to issue appropriate instructions before the polls to all political parties and candidates to follow the environmental rules and guidelines as mandated under law,” stated the appeal. The activists also called for minimum use of plastic materials. Pointing out most campaign materials got mixed with municipal waste and were sent to landfills, environmentalists said, within 24 hours, the plastic waste should be carefully sorted and sent for recycling. We request proper handling and disposal of biomedical waste, the appeal said. They also urged that sound norms be strictly followed, in accordance to the directives of Calcutta High Court, National Green Tribunal and West Bengal Pollution Control Board. Sound limiters should be fitted to microphones during open-space rallies, which should take place within the stipulated hours between 6am and 10pm. Activists have also appealed not to harm trees and plants during campaign. Chopping of trees and driving nails into branches to put up banners and festoons must be prohibited, they demanded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/recycle-cut-down-on-plastic-use-urge-activists/articleshow/88264523.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Mumbai||Two original sets of marksheets issued by Mumbai University||MUMBAI: Mumbai University’s exam section is under the scanner for printing two sets of original marksheets for 90 final-year students of a B Sc (hospitality studies) course. As this is a serious irregularity, the university has initiated an inquiry, even as two colleges involved are playing the blame game. In an unofficial arrangement, B Sc students of the 3-year course from Bhayander’s Mumbai College of Hotel Management were enrolled in the varsity’s record from Kalyan’s Holy Maria College of Science & Technology, as the former had no university affiliation. Fifty students were enrolled to the first year in 2017-18, 40 others in 2018-19 in the same manner. However, the arrangement between the two colleges was called off later as the monetary benefit promised by the Bhayander college was not fulfilled, claimed Maria Fernandes, president of the Kalyan college. In the pandemic, the university’s exam section sent marksheets and convocation certificates for both graduating batches to the Kalyan college. “The principal [of the Bhyander college] cut us off completely after he got affiliation later,” said Fernandes, who did not release the marksheets to students over the pending dues. When a student approached the university, the tie-up between the colleges came to light. In the meantime, the Bhayander college’s principal, Dilip Mahadik, wrote to the university, for the marksheets and a separate set was sent to him too. Mahadik claimed he was the in-charge principal of the Kalyan college. “Mrs Fernandes got the marksheets at her home and did not give it to students. As students were desperate for jobs and visas, I wrote to the university to issue fresh marksheets and gave an undertaking to return the other set. I’ve written to her, asking her to return the documents…,” he said. Fernandes, however, said, “Despite me having the originals, a separate set was issued,” She alleged Mahadik fraudulently used her college’s letterhead to seek the marksheets, and said she reported it to the university. Vinod Patil, director (board of examinations & evaluation) said they have set up an inquiry cand the university will be in a better position to comment once the report is submitted. Senate member Pradeep Sawant said both colleges must be de-affiliated and a case filed. “The varsity must help pupils get admissions elsewhere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-original-sets-of-marksheets-issued-by-univ/articleshow/88265893.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Pune||Maharashtra targets 1 lakh Covid tests in next 20 days with imported RT-PCR kits||PUNE: The Maharashtra government on Monday set a target of conducting up to 1 lakh Covid tests across the state in the next 20 days using imported RT PCR kits for speedy detection of probable Omicron variant of Covid. The objective is to pick up highly probable cases of the new variant using the RT-PCR kit that has the S gene target failure (SGTF) strategy, an official said. Besides testing individuals with international travel history, as well as their close contacts, these kits will be used at government-run laboratories for routine Covid tests. “Our aim is to conduct up to 1 lakh Covid tests across the state with specialized RT-PCR kits having SGTF strategy and observe the trend in the 20 days,” said Dr Satish Pawar, additional mission director, directorate of health services. Financial assistance to the tune of Rs 4-7 lakh has been sanctioned to every district in accordance with the population size to purchase the imported RT-PCR kits and conduct at least 100 Covid tests every day using them to observe the trend of positivity. That simply means the state would be carrying out at least 3,600 Covid tests every day for the next 20 days. Some of the big cities such as Pune and Mumbai are expect to conduct more such tests on a daily basis. “We will observe the trend of positivity using these imported kits and the subsequent Omicron confirmation rate through genome sequencing. The kits’ utility in Omicron detection will be assessed and based on the findings we will decide whether to scale up the kits' use or reduce/stop it,” Dr Pawar told TOI. Compared with the usual RT-PCR kits, the imported ones with the SGTF strategy are quite expensive. At present, only one US-based company that has such kits operates in India. The bulk purchase of a standard RT-PCR kit costs the state government Rs19, including GST, per kit. The cost for a specialized RT-PCR kit is Rs240, including GST. “The RT-PCR kits with the SGTF strategy can primarily help us take up those positive samples in which the RT-PCR test result has shown the S gene drop-out or negative result, but Orf and N gene-positive results,” said Nagpur-based CSIR-NEERI scientist Dr Krishna Khairnar, one of the key researchers in Covid diagnostics in India, said. Currently, there are only a handful of RT-PCR kits that target three or more genes, including the S gene, of the virus. “If a person tests positive through such a specialized RT-PCR kit, we can then take his or her sample for whole genomic sequencing on priority. The chances of the variant detection rise manifold in such cases. This will also save a lot of time and resources in terms of genome sequencing, which is a costly process,” Dr Khairnar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-targets-1-lakh-covid-tests-in-next-20-days-with-imported-rt-pcr-kits/articleshow/88264411.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Varanasi||Kashi Vishwanath Dham: PM Narendra Modi’s vision about temple of Baba Vishwanath realised||VARANASI: The launch of Kashi Vishwanath Dham corridor project is the realisation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision about the abode of Lord Shiva. His bond with the temple and Varanasi goes long back. The connection started much before he became the PM and started representing Varanasi in Parliament. Modi was a regular visitor to Baba Vishwanath and each trip fuelled his desire to restore the city’s lost grandeur. The vision started turning into reality as he laid out the plan for the development and transformation of the Holy City after becoming the PM in 2014. The flagship project on his list of course was the Kashi Vishwanath Dham Corridor that linked the Ganga with Kashi Vishwanath Temple. One of the primary aims of the corridor was to facilitate pilgrims’ entry to the temple which, until now, was punctuated by clogged streets and untidy passage from the Ganga ghats to the temple. With this in mind, the PM asked the architects to create a passage which will fill the pilgrims with joy on their way to Kashi Vishwanath Temple. Not only did PM Modi give the initial briefing to the architects, but also gave constant inputs and insights for the architectural design, including review through the 3D model of the project. His attention to detail was reflected in his inputs on making the area accessible for the differently abled. Modi also played a proactive role in the execution as well. He monitored the progress of the project even during Covid times through video conferencing. This saw completion of the project in record time. “Kashi neither stops nor gets tired even in adversity,” PM had said. Modi’s vision was also to ensure that while the properties clogging the proposed corridor were being removed, existing heritage structures be preserved as well. This foresight came handy when during demolition of the buildings, more than 40 ancient temples like Shri Gangeshwar Mahadev temple, Manokameshwar Mahadev temple, Jay Vinayak temple, Shri Kumbha Mahadev temple were discovered, that had over the years been subsumed in the multi-storeyed buildings along the way. These are no ‘small’ temples; each of them has a history that goes back to a few centuries. These rediscovered temples will further enrich the glorious heritage of the city. This rediscovery of the lost heritage is in sync with the PM's vision and tireless efforts for cultural restoration by bringing back the lost heritage, even from foreign lands. This was recently epitomized through his endeavor to bring back the rare idol of Maa Annapurna Devi from Canada, and getting it installed at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. Besides the KV DHam project, Modi has transformed Varanasi with a slew of welfare and uplift measures. These include Integrated Command and Control (ICC) Centre for traffic and police management; BHU Trauma centre; two cancer hospitals; IMS-BHU upgraded to the level of AIIMS; a trade facilitation centre for weavers, craftsmen and artisans; clean drinking water supply; Manduadih railway station revamped into a world-class station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/modis-vision-about-abode-of-lord-shiva-realised/articleshow/88245180.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 3 minors among 5 injured as SRA building lift crashes from 10th floor||MUMBAI: In the second such mishap in six months in the same SRA building, three school-going teenagers and two women suffered injuries when an elevator crashed to the ground from the 10th floor of 16-storey Mahakali Darshan in Andheri (east) a little after Monday noon. While three of them suffered leg fractures, a mother-son duo had severe bruises and swelling on their legs. Two of the students sustained injuries to knee caps, the surgery for which will cost Rs 4 lakh each. TimesViewWorryingly, cases of lift crashes, some of them fatal, have been occurring frequently in Mumbai, and the latest incident shows that stringent safety standards regarding design, construction and installation of elevators must be strictly enforced. This is the second lift crash in a slum rehabilitation building in the past two months. A thorough inquiry must be conducted, and responsibility fixed.Slum dwellers, who are relocated from shanties into high-rise buildings, must be trained on how to use lifts and ensure their maintenance.Six months ago, Omega Elevators had carried out servicing of both the elevators in the building, after two senior citizens suffered back injuries when the other elevator crashed from the fourth floor. Now, the BMC has instructed the public works department (PWD) to see if the elevators have proper certification and licences. "The victims said though they had pressed the button for the ground floor from the fifth, the elevator zipped up to the 10th and then crashed. They were rescued by breaking the elevator door. They were rushed to hospitals in Andheri east and west," Rakesh Gurav, a resident, told TOI. Lift maintenance firm booked after 2nd crash in six monthsFive people suffered injuries when an elevator crashed to the ground from the 10th floor of Mahakali Darshan in Andheri (East) on Monday. Six months ago, Omega Elevators had carried out servicing of both the elevators in the building following a similar mishap. Residents said the same service team had visited the building for maintenance of elevators in the other wings too. The mishap took place between noon and 12.30pm when the five survivors—Priyanka Panchal (50), Sangita Pawar (42) and her son Abhishek Pawar (15) and his two friends Tushar Chavan (15) and Shubham Gosavi (15) from neighbouring SRA buildings— entered the elevator on various floors. Chavan and Gosavi, both Class 9 students, entered the elevator on the ground floor of Mahakali Darshan to meet their schoolmate Pawar, a fifth floor resident, to go to school together. Panchal, her daughter Vrushali said, entered the elevator on the third floor to head to her workplace at Andheri’s tehsildar’s office. “I was at home when I got a call from building residents who pulled my mother out of the elevator. She suffered a fracture on her left leg below the knee,” she said. Pawar’s elder brother Aniket said he rushed downstairs when he received a call from the former that the elevator had crashed. “My brother and mother suffered severe pressure on their legs. It should ease in two days,” he said. Meanwhile, Gosavi has fractured both his legs. One of the building residents and MNS party worker Prasad Parulekar said the builders and the elevator contract company “hardly provided proper maintenance that led to two mishaps in six months. The mishap was waiting to happen with little being done by the builder to address the residents’ problems”. Another resident, Rakesh Halwai, said those residing on the lower floors rushed out when the elevator crashed and hit the spring on the ground floor with a loud thud. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone X) Maheshwar Reddy said Andheri police probing the case have booked Omega Elevators which had been given the maintenance contract by the builder. Reddy said they will verify if the mishap occurred after servicing was done. A spokesperson for Omkar Builders said Mahakali Darshan SRA building (number 1) was not constructed by them and that they had constructed other buildings (7 to 10). “They have no role in the lift mishap in the building,” said the spokesperson. When TOI called Omega Elevators, an official who identified himself as Vilas said he was unaware about the incident and asked to check with the company’s technical official, one Kalpesh. Despite repeated attempts, he could not be contacted.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Torrent Power seeks to levy regulatory charge||AHMEDABAD: Torrent Power Limited (TPL) has sought to levy regulatory charge for two years from electricity consumers in Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Surat to recover its past dues. The private sector company, however, has not proposed any increase in base power tariff for the financial year 2022-23. TPL has proposed to levy a regulatory charge of 22 paisa per unit from its consumers in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar supply areas. For Surat, the regulatory charge sought to be collected is 17 paisa per unit, states the company’s petitions for the determination of power tariff for fiscal 2022-23, which were filed with the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) on Monday. The company has demanded to charge this regulatory levy for a period of two years to recover its past dues. The company has estimated a revenue shortfall of Rs 349.18 crore for Ahmedabad and Rs 108.74 crore for Surat supply area. These revenue gaps have mainly resulted on account of the past years’ under recovery. Hence, the company has sought the state power regulator’s permission to levy regulatory charge from April 1, 2022 for a period of two years with necessary adjustment of cost due to the deferment of recovery, the power distributor added. If approved, TPL’s consumers will have to shell out more for power their consume. “While any increase in base power tariff continues to remain in force till it is revised further, the regulatory charge demand by the company is for a limited period of two years, after which it is discontinued,” explained people in the power tariff.

The bodies were sent for autopsy and police are yet to register an FIR as no complaint has been lodged by the family members so far. The cow also died in the tragic incident. The electric current, according to sources, had passed through the iron door of Surendra Shukla’s house and their cow got electrocuted as a result. On seeing this, his wife, Bitta Devi, 50, who was offering prayers, rushed to save the animal but also got hit by the live wire. Later, their son Girijashankar, daughter Pooja and Shukla himself sustained burn injuries in a bid to rescue Bitta. By the time the power supply was disconnected, both Bitta and Girijashankar had succumbed. Recalling the moment, their daughter Shilpi said, “I was in the washroom when I heard my mother screaming for help. When I reached there, I found all my family members lying unconscious with severe burns. I looked for help, neighbours came, but it was too late by then.” “Shukla, 54, works as a ‘shikshamitra; at the village school. He also performs 'havan' during festivals and weddings,” Ramdev Verma, a neighbour, said, adding, "The cow was like a member of their family." Speaking about the incident, Sindhauli SHO Jagnarayan Pandey said, “We have recorded the statements of the survivors and neighbours, and further investigation is underway. A team of officials is in the village.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/5-members-of-up-family-come-in-contact-with-live-wire-while-trying-to-save-a-cow-2-dead/articleshow/88263702.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

State additional secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas on Monday told TOI that the administration has gradually increased the daily tests to over 1 lakh tests. “We are closely monitoring the districts that are not testing enough or according to the World Health Organization (WHO) norms,” he said. Last week, the state’s overall weekly positivity rate (WPR) was 0.8%. All districts had then registered a WPR below 2%. The districts have been asked to try and reduce the WPR to 0.5%. The Centre has told all states and Union Territories to focus on intensive containment, active surveillance, enhanced testing, monitoring of hotspots, more coverage of vaccination and augmentation of health infrastructure following the emergence of Omicron. A state task force member told TOI that even when the Covid cases were down, there should be no laxity shown for testing. “While testing of all international passengers is being carried out as per the new protocol of the Centre, testing at the local level should not dip,” the member said. Former director of health services and public health expert Dr PP Doke said the state should not rest till the weekly positivity and casa fatality rates declined to below 0.5%. These two parameters have to be achieved,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/daily-testing-in-state-up-to-over-1-lakh-since-dec-7/articleshow/88275277.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The premier engineering institute has asked all students to return by December end and remain under isolation for at least a week before the offline classes start. The institute is currently holding exams online and offline for different semesters. However, offline teaching has already started for MTech and PhD students. These students will appear for exams offline in December end. The BTech and MSc students have been instructed to report to the institute by end of December. “From January 3, 2022 we will start offline teaching for all the students. We have announced the dates in advance so that they can plan accordingly,” said an SVNIT official. After nearly 18 months the campus will return to normalcy with over 4,000 students attending classes physically. “The institute will ensure that Covid-19 protocols are followed during offline teaching. It is important to start offline teaching,” said the official. The institute had held multiple exams in online mode for the last three semesters. “We tried to hold the online test in the best possible manner but it cannot match the offline exam quality. Offline exams are important to assess the students’ knowledge,” said an SVNIT faculty member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/offline-teaching-at-svnit-from-next-month/articleshow/88264434.cms||---
---||Pune||Experts for close watch on dist-level clusters||Pune: Experts have advised the state authorities to keep a keen watch on any sudden rise in Covid-19 cases, especially at district-level clusters, as directed by the Centre in view of the emergence of the Omicron variant. The daily cases have been at three-digit figure in the state for over a month now. ‘The daily cases are in three digits, while the active caseload is fluctuating between 6,000-7,000. Most districts in the state have registered a weekly positivity rate below the state average of 0.8%. So, even in the wake of the Omicron variant, no sudden spurt in cases has been noticed. However, the state is keeping a close watch on the situation,” a senior state health official said. Districts have been directed to increase testing. State task force member Dr Rahul Pandit told TOI that districts should ramp up testing and monitor sudden spikes. The Centre has asked all the states and Union Territories to focus on areas reporting more than 10% positivity rate or over 60% bed occupancy on either oxygen support or ICU. The health ministry has also raised concern over districts with high positivity rate in three states — Mizoram, Kerala and Sikkim. Maharashtra is registering 0.8% WPR and all its districts are recording WPR below 2%. In its letter, the Centre stated that Mizoram, Kerala and Sikkim have eight districts reporting more than 10% positivity. Besides, 19 districts in Kerala, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Puducherry, Manipur, West Bengal and Nagaland have been reporting positivity rates from 5-10% in the last two weeks. The Centre said 27 districts need to be monitored very closely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-for-close-watch-on-dist-level-clusters/articleshow/88264426.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Lucknow||‘Saudi ban influenced by Western power, Tablighi Jamaat bulwark against terror’||Ayodhya: Days after Saudi Arabia banned the Islamist proselytising movement, Tablighi Jamaat, calling it the gateway of terrorism, top leaders of the Jamaat, the Shura, and leading Islamic seminary, Deoband, have reacted with surprise, anger and termed it a western plot to defame a puritanical outfit with global footprint. Majority sympathisers and followers of the Jamaat, headquartered at Delhi’s Nizamuddin West, said the Saudi decision was dictated by an influential western power, which wants to cripple Riyadh’s centuries-old affiliation to the Muslim Ummah. Spokesperson of Tablighi Jamaat, Nizamuddin Markaz, Sameeruddin Qasmi, defended his members as purists, who reformed deviant Muslims and served as a bulwark against global terror. “It is an unfounded allegation against Tablighi Jamaat. We have no connection with terrorism. In fact, we stop, condemn and disown terrorism. We don't allow our members to speak against any religion, community or country and focus on five pillars of Islam. None of our men has ever been found involved in terrorist activity. The Saudi government has been misled,” he said in a video message from London. Mohammad Miyan, member of the 'Shura', a prominent breakaway Tablighi faction, said, “Our Jamaats are working all over the world and even in Saudi Arabia. We are bringing Muslims to the path of the prophet. The Shura will not comment on the ban, but our Jamaats will continue to work fearlessly in Saudi Arabia.” Leading Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Deoband and the ideological fountainhead of the Jamaat, has condemned Saudi government. Taking Riyadh head on for the first time, chief rector Maulana Abul Qasim Nomani warned Saudi Arabia to desist from wrongdoing and withdraw the ban as it would send a wrong message to Muslims across the world. Talking to TOI, prominent Muslim activist Zafar Sareshwala, said, “I am surprised by the Saudi decision as the Tablighi Jamaat was an antidote to extremist ideas with its strong disapproval of jihadist ideology. Even Taliban have spoken out against the Jamaat. Calling it the gateway of terrorism is unbelievable and unacceptable.” A senior faculty in Darul Uloom Nadwa, Maulana Fakhrul Hasan Khan, said, “We are receiving the news from the media. We will react conclusively after talking to our members in Saudi Arabia.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/saudi-ban-influenced-by-western-power-tablighi-jamaat-bulwark-against-terror/articleshow/88245183.cms||---

L&T and Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) have laid hotmix on both the lanes of the bridge making it ready for use. Construction and completion of the bridge was halted on several occasions due to opposition within certain political circles, paucity of funds and the Covid-19 pandemic. For over a year, work was at a standstill and it resumed only after GSIDC was able to coax L&T to resume the work in November. “The bridge will help cut down the distance to Panaji city by as much as 1.5km and will also reduce traffic in and around the Kadamba inter-state bus stand by providing a direct connection to residents of Mala, Fontainhas, Bhatlem and Taleigao,” an official said. The foundation stone for the three-span prestressed bridge was laid in April 2016 and the cost of the bridge was pegged at Rs 24.2 crore. GSIDC’s initial target was to complete the bridge in 18 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panajis-third-entry-point-linking-patto-complete/articleshow/88265178.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Narhe woman, Latur resident found positive for Omicron||PUNE/MUMBAI: Two Dubai returnees, a 39-year-old woman from Narhe and a 33-year-old man from Latur tested positive for the Omicron variant on Monday. So far, 12 people have tested positive for the Omicron strain of the virus in Pune district. Of them, five have been discharged after the repeat Covid test found them negative for the contagion after a few days of isolations. The Narhe woman, who is an IT professional, had tested negative for Covid after she arrived from Dubai on December 1. Her repeat Covid test found her Covid positive, following which the sample was sent to the NIV for genomic sequencing. All of her family members tested negative for Covid. “She is fully vaccinated and has not developed any illness. She has been isolated at a civic-run hospital in Baner as a precautionary measure,” said Dr Sanjeev Wavare, Pune Municipal Corporation’s nodal officer for Covid-19. The patient from Latur had landed at the Mumbai international airport on December 3, confirmed Dr Hanmant Wadgave, district health officer. He said the man’s samples were collected for RT-PCR on December 8 and was subsequently found positive. The man had mild symptoms initially but didn’t get tested or report to authorities. The district health officials contacted him as part of their surveillance of all foreign returnees and collected his samples for testing. Wadgave said the man was immediately admitted to Latur Covid Care Centre after he tested positive. "From the day of his arrival to his testing positive, he had met several people. However, he was always wearing a mask and that’s probably the reason why others didn’t catch the infection," he said. The man’s three high-risk contacts include his two children, who have also tested negative. As of today, 20 cases of Omicron Variant have been reported in the state, including five from Mumbai, 10 from Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits, two from Pune municipal limits, and one each from Kalyan Dombivali, Nagpur, and Latur. Of these cases, nine have been discharged after a negative RT-PCR test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/narhe-woman-latur-resident-found-positive-for-omicron/articleshow/88264430.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Excise department issues notice to Sameer Wankhede on bar licence||MUMBAI: A week after it was established that Sameer Wankhede had not been eligible for a bar and restaurant licence on the day he secured it, Thane excise superintendent Nilesh Sangde on Monday issued him a showcause notice, asking why it should not be revoked or suspended for misrepresentation of facts. Wankhede, zonal director of the Narcotics Control Bureau, owns Sadguru bar in Vashi. Sangde confirmed to TOI the excise department has invoked the Maharashtra Prohibition Act in the matter. “We have issued a showcause notice under Section 54 of the Act. We expect him to respond to the showcause notice within 15 days. After receipt of his reply, we will decide the course of action. He will have to present his case before the Thane collector,” Sangde said. A senior excise official said Section 54(E) provides for suspension or cancellation of a licence if obtained through wilful misrepresentation or fraud. “Wankhede will have to establish on the day he secured the licence, he was eligible for it.” Following a TOI report that Wankhede had secured the licence at age 17, against the eligible 21, the excise department had initiated an internal probe to verify his age. The official said the committee headed by the then Thane collector Ujwal Uike had approved a proposal for granting a licence to Wankhede.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-excise-dept-issues-notice-to-wankhede-on-bar-licence/articleshow/88265906.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Haryana toll plazas reopen||Karnal: Toll plazas in Haryana, which had been lying non-operational since October last year due to farmer’s agitation, have started charging fee on Monday with revised rates. Bhartiya Kisan Union (Charuni) district President Jagdeep Singh Aulakh along with other farmers made Karnal’s Bastara toll plaza operational by cutting the ribbon. There are two toll plazas under the jurisdiction in Karnal district, including Bastara toll plaza on NH 44 and Pyont toll plaza on NH 709A. The workers and security staff has been deployed at the toll plazas. They were waiting for resuming the operations for a long time. As per sources, at Bastara toll plaza rates have been hiked by Rs 5-10 for heavy vehicles like bus, truck, and multi-axle vehicles. On the other hand, there is also Rs 50 to Rs 275 hike in monthly passes charges for various categories. However, the rates for cars, jeeps, and vans remained unchanged here. Last year, when operations were stopped by the farmers at toll plazas, Rs 440 used to charge from a bus or truck for a one-way trip, while Rs 660 was for a return trip within 24 hours. But now Rs 445 will be charged for a single journey, while Rs 665 will be charged for return trip within 24 hours. Similarly, the toll for multi-axle vehicles has also been increased from the current Rs 705 to Rs 715 for a single trip and from Rs 1,060 to 1,070 for multiple journeys within 24 hours. The farmers have expressed their concern over the traffic jams at the toll plaza and potholes on GT Road and demanded that these issues should be resolved as soon as possible. On the other hand, Bastara toll officials claimed that the rate was usually revised every year based on the wholesale price index (WPI) that was not related to the farmer’s agitation. These rates were to be implemented in September this year, but due to the farmer agitation it could not be done. It is pertinent to mention here that NH-44 is one of the busiest highways as around 40,000 vehicles used to cross Bastara toll plaza in 24 hours and it has resulted in a revenue loss.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-toll-plazas-reopen/articleshow/88265165.cms||---
---||Pune||Since December 1, Pune Municipal Corporation fining 10 a day for flouting Covid rules||PUNE: It has been two months now since the Pune police have stopped collecting fines from people flouting Covid-appropriate behaviour, such as mandatory wearing of face mask, maintaining social distancing and not crowding at public places. “We are waiting for fresh orders from the civic (Pune) chief that would empower us to implement the Covid rules and collect fines,” joint police commissioner Ravindra Shisve on Monday. A somewhat similar case is with the other rule implementing authorities like the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and also the police in the twin towns, despite worries around how the Omicron variant will behave in the days ahead. The experts are repeatedly saying that things should not be taken lightly and people must observe Covid appropriate behaviour. The PMC)barely has any data to corroborate its claim about taking sustained action for implementation of the Covid rules. In fact, civic officials conceded in private that there has been little action since September when the second wave of Covid was understood to have waned and the government gradually started announcing relaxations aimed at securing normal life. The emergence of Omicron has, nevertheless, forced a relook and, in this context, activists and experts are calling for more caution. Since the beginning of December, the PMC has fined barely 130 people to collect total Rs65,000 fine at Rs500 each for flouting Covid norms. However, this translates into an average 10 people fined in the first 13 days of the month, which anybody will say can hardly be called action. Civic officials are now talking about coordinating with the police department to step up action. Health activist Abhijit More said, “The administrations appear to have lost interest in taking actions and curbing the spread of virus. They were creating awareness about the outbreak and precautions during the first and the second waves. But now, civic officials are hardly taking any effort This is a wrong way of handling the situation.” Another activist Sanjay Shitole said, "The civic body should make sure that they have clarity about the action and norms. Some PMC officials make confusing arguments, which lead to further chaos about action. The lethargic approach of civic body should be changed as far as taking action is concerned.” Madhav Jagtap, head of the PMC’s anti-encroachment department, said, “Action is being taken at the ward-level. We have 105 squads across 15 ward office areas (seven teams per ward). The total deployment is around 315 staff members.” Between March 2020 and June 2021, the Pune police and the PMC had collected fine worth over Rs26 crore from people flouting the Covid norms. “As of now, we are urging people to follow all Covid protocols. The state government has eased movement of people after the Covid cases reduced and vaccination increased. People too have started ignoring the masks. But if fresh orders to take action against people are issued, police will take action,” a senior police officer said. Pune district health office’s data revealed that for the week from December 2 to 8, the PCMC did not take any action nor collect any fine. “The main action against errant citizens should be done by the police department. We will have a word with them regarding this,” said PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil. Pimpri Chinchwad police senior inspector Rajendrakumar Rajmane insisted that they were taking action, but had no statistics to corroborate his claims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/since-dec-1-pmc-fining-10-a-day-for-flouting-covid-rules/articleshow/88264438.cms||Gitesh Shelke

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Mercury plunges to 15.1°C, Met spies further drop today||KOLKATA: The city woke up to the first shivers of winter chill on Monday even as the minimum temperature plunged three notches to 15.1°C, the lowest of the season so far. It is set to dip by another degree on Tuesday even as the icy northwesterly winds keep flowing into the state from the snow-capped Himalayan peaks of Jammu and Kashmir. The chill may persist for at least a week since there is no weather system to block the cool winds from keeping the mercury down, said weathermen. “We expect the minimum temperature to slide to 14°C on Tuesday. It may drop further below the 14°C-mark but marginally. With the northwesterly flowing unobstructed, we expect the chill to continue for a week,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director, GK Das. Snowfall occurred in Jammu and Kashmir last week, triggering icy winds across the north Indian plains. They, however, didn’t reach Kolkata or south Bengal due to a low-pressure trough over the Bay of Bengal that generated clouds and moisture. The city remained cloudy till last Saturday and received sporadic drizzles that occasionally got heavier. The cloud cover had brought the maximum temperature down and prevented a slide of the minimum temperature even as the gap between the two narrowed down to just two degrees last Monday. The low-pressure had formed in the aftermath of Cyclone Jawad that fizzled out off the Odisha coast and reached Bengal as a low-pressure system. The maximum temperature, too, dropped two degrees below normal to 25.3°C on Monday. According to private weather forecasting service AccuWeather, the real feel temperature was around 15°C on Monday night even as the temperature touched 16°C. It could be marginally higher than the maximum temperature on Tuesday. Real feel temperature is the measure of how the temperature actually feels on the human skin and is calculated on the basis of multiple weather factors like wind speed, sun ray intensity, humidity, rainfall, cloudiness and elevation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mercury-plunges-to-15-1c-met-spies-further-drop-today/articleshow/88264436.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The accused boy was in heavy debt after playing online games in which the player is expected to pay money through his e-wallet. He had taken loans from various people, including his neighbours after he allegedly became an addict of online games. He allegedly first invited his cousin and later sent a ransom message asking for Rs 5 lakh to the father of the boy. After killing the boy, the accused also buried him near the village. According to the police, the 12-year-old boy went missing from his village on December 8. “While our team was attempting to trace him, we got an FIR by the father of the missing boy. It stated that he received a ransom call through a social media account in which the sender of the message had asked for a ransom of Rs 5 lakh. Our cyber cell team traced the IP address and found that it was within the village from where the boy went missing,” said Nagaur superintendent of police Abhijeet Singh. The technical surveillance team found that the mobile number used to send the message belonged to the 16-year-old boy. “Since the mobile location was in the village and the IP address was also traced, we invited the 16-year-old boy for questioning and told him that the phone used to send the message on social media to the father of the child belonged to him. He confessed to his crime. On Monday, after interrogation, we managed to recover the body of the 12-year-old boy buried near the village by the accused boy on Monday,” Singh added. Police was stunned to know the reason why the 12-year-old boy was killed. “The accused 16-year-old boy was an addict of online games which requires you to have money in your e-wallet to get elevated into various levels. He had taken loans from villagers and shopkeepers. He had asked the 12-year-old boy to come to him. Later, he made a fake social media account and sent a message to the father of the boy asking for a ransom of Rs 5 lakh,” Singh added. The accused boy was detained by the police and is being questioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/online-debt-teen-kidnaps-kills-minor-cousin-for-ransom-in-nagaur/articleshow/88265609.cms||---

She was rescued by child helpline in Churu district on December 10. The minor girl was allegedly sold off to a resident of Kikasar village of Sardarshahar in Churu in exchange for Rs 1.13 lakh. The child helpline volunteers rescued the minor girl near a hotel in Bhanipura police station area of Churu with the police teams from Sardarshahar and Bhanipura. However, no formal complainant has been registered at any police station of Bikaner and Churu districts in this regard by the parents of the alleged victim till now. Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson of RSCPCR told TOI that the commission has sought a detailed factual report from the district authorities regarding the incident. The matter came to light when the child helpline in Churu received a call from the sister of the victim seeking help to rescue the minor girl. The helpline volunteers informed the district police officials and launched a search- said Rukiya Pathan, district coordinator of child help line. Rukiya Pathan, told TOI that the victim in her statement said that a woman- Guddi Devi, in her neighbourhood lured her and her elder sister from Malot of Muktsar district in Punjab on the pretext of employment in groundnut farming in Bikaner and promised them a daily wage of Rs. 300. The woman, later allegedly sold her to one Indraj Nath (37). Surprisingly, the 17-year-old girl, earlier in her written statement (TOI has a copy) to the Sridungargarh police in Bikaner stated that she is 23 years old and was willing to go with the man. The victim and the alleged accused also produced a live-in relationship agreement executed between them on December 7, in Loonkaransar tehsil of Bikaner district. Sridungargarh police questioned the couple on December 8 following an anonymous call. Vedpal Shivran, SHO of Sridungargarh police station told TOI that they received a call about the minor girl’s presence in the area and the police took them in for questioning. The rescued girl has been sent to Balika Grah in Churu and according to the sources she is repeatedly changing her statements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/punjab-minor-girl-sold-in-bikaner-for-rs-1-13-lakh-rescued-from-churu/articleshow/88265166.cms||---

Calangute panchayat, in June 2019, became the first in the state to install a CCTV surveillance system to keep a watch over the village. With the constant flow of tourists in the village, there has been a rise in petty crimes like thefts of mobile phones from parked cars, bags being snatched, pimps, touts, drug peddlers, among others. The CCTV system was to aid the police in crime detection. The system with 60 cameras had been installed at a cost of Rs 90 lakh through the Centre’s ‘Swadesh Darshan’ scheme. However, the system had been damaged during Cyclone Tauktae in May this year, and the repairs were postponed to after the monsoon. “The file (for repairs) is with the BDO and the proposal is expected to be approved in a couple of days,” Martins said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangutes-cctv-system-will-soon-be-functional-sarpanch/articleshow/88265170.cms||---

It was sought in response to a PIL filed by freedom fighter Harendranath Bagchi who had sought “definite information” on the disappearance of Netaji from the Centre. Sarkar, in his PIL, had also demanded that Netaji’s pictures be used on Indian currency notes. In his petition, Bagchi had pointed out that though several inquiry commissions were formed to probe Netaji’s disappearance, the truth never came out. Government funds, he said, have been wasted on these inquiries. The PIL also mentioned that a proposal to put Bose’s pictures on currency notes has already been given to the Reserve Bank of India. He has submitted the related documents to the court.

They had come to offer prayers of thanksgiving for their success in getting the draconian three central farm laws repealed. Senior leader of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), Balbir Singh Rajewal said they also prayed to the Almighty to give them strength to finish their pending tasks. “Waheguru mehar karay, jheray baki rai nai kam assi aisae tarah napray char sakiyae (with God’s blessings, we hope to resolve the unfinished works),” said Rajewal while talking to media persons. However, he did not give any details about their future course of action or their political intent, saying, “We will decide about our future course of action during our January 15 meeting.” In reply to a question about political plans of farm union leaders during the ensuing assembly elections, he replied, “Elections are a routine matter, but our demands are still as they were.” He claimed they had not decided about any political move but the debate was in media only. Senior farmer leader Rakesh Tikait said that despite lifting the morcha, they would be able to build pressure on the government for rest of their demands through dialogue. When asked about their next move, he said people wanted them to continue to talk to the government. About the farmers’ arrests during agitation, the issue was in the court and farm unions were dealing with the issue, he added. On reaching the main entry point of the city at Golden Gate, various political outfits and NGOs accorded the visiting farm leaders a warm welcome. Overwhelmed, Tikait said, the people of Punjab had not only served langar but also showed their love upon them. When told that earlier also they had come to offer thanksgiving prayers, he said, “Earlier was the half victory, and now we are here after full victory.” Punjabi singer Babbu Maan who was also with the farm union leaders said farmers were the backbone of the nation and no government could afford to invite their wrath. “Let any government or the new government in Punjab experiment, they will not be successful without the support of farmers,” he said. He said that the credit of farmers’ success goes to Baba Nanak, who had shown them the way to success. SGPC honour farm union leaders The SGPC organised a special religious congregation after the bhog of akhand path at Gurdwara Manji Sahib Diwan Hall. As announced earlier, the SGPC honoured the farm union leaders. SGPC president Harjinder Singh Dhammi said, “It is a blessing of the Guru, that on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, the Prime Minister announced the repeal of three laws.” Leaders who were honoured by the SGPC included Rajewal, Gurnam Singh Charuni, Tikait, Dr Swaiman Singh, Darshan Pal, Yudhvir Singh, Kulwant Singh Sandhu, Pargat Singh, Buta Singh Burj Gill and Manjit Singh Rai among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/god-gave-us-strength-to-complete-unfinished-task/articleshow/88265187.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Gaddiannaram traders, agents get one month to shift fruit market||HYDERABAD: Stating that a public sector multi-specialty hospital serves a far higher public purpose than a fruit market, the Telangana high court on Monday directed the traders and commission agents at Gaddiannaram to shift their trade to Batasingaram fruit market within one month from now. The traders can continue their business at the existing Gaddiannaram market till then. The bench of chief justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy pronounced this judgment after hearing the pleas of the fruit market traders and commission agents who raised grievance over the way their market committee land was sought to be taken over by the state and also the way they were asked to go to an alternative market. The bench directed the state to make available important facilities like cold storage, a primary healthcare center with a doctor and basic first-aid kits, drinking water, canteen and toilets in the next 30 days. The bench refused to invalidate the transfer of the market committee’s 25-acre land at Gaddiannaram to the state government for raising a super specialty hospital there. It noted the fact that the state has come forward to build a full-fledged market for the traders in a huge 178-acre area at Koheda. As it takes considerable time to build that modern facility, it asked the traders at Gaddiannaram to shift to a temporary facility at Batasingaram. The bench did not relish the attitude of the officials who were forcing the traders to go to Batasingaram lock stock and barrel without providing adequate facilities there. When we give some breathing time to the traders, we expect the authorities to respect our order. It is not for them to decide and force traders, the bench fumed while slapping costs of Rs 2,000 each on state agriculture market committees wing director and the Gaddiannaram market committee’s secretary for acting in a high-handed manner against traders circumventing the temporary relief given to the traders. “Do not repeat such mistakes in future,” the bench warned them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gaddiannaram-traders-agents-get-one-month-to-shift-fruit-market/articleshow/88264469.cms||---

The proposal is expected to be cleared in a meeting scheduled to be held on December 16. “This year, first-year students will take English exam in the open book format,” said Navin Mittal, chairman, SBTET. He said that the proposal will be cleared in the meeting which will be held on Thursday. The open book exams will be conducted for first-year students who joined the polytechnic courses during the academic year 2021-22. “We are starting with English this semester. In the next semester, mathematics will be an open book exam, and next year we are planning to conduct industrial management and entrepreneurship in the new format,” said C Srinath, secretary, SBTET. The official, however, revealed that students will not be allowed to carry as many books as they like. They can carry any two books out of the total five books approved by the board. “We have already taken the feedback of students and faculty regarding the open book exams. We received a positive response for them as they said that it is beneficial for students,” added Srinath. The board has already tried the new format with mid-exams for the first-year students this year. “During the first and second mid-exams, first-year students were allowed to carry books for English exams,” said the secretary of the board. The board will start implementing the open book exams starting from the students who joined in the academic year 2021-22.

In the last few days, the number of daily doses administered has gone up more than the average numbers for the last two weeks,” ZP CEO Ayush Prasad told TOI on Monday. The authorities have also set up dedicated five-member teams of data entry operators in each tehsil for keeping track of those due for their second dose. “The unwillingness to take the second dose among the beneficiaries is the major concern for us. We have pulled out the names of the beneficiaries and given them to the data entry operators to contact eligible beneficiaries,” Prasad said. “We have observed laxity among the citizens who are above 45,” said a senior official from the health department of the ZP. Despite having 100 vaccination centres in Baramati tehsil, only 49% of the beneficiaries have got their second dose, stated the ZP report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2nd-jab-inoculation-picks-up-pace-in-4-tehsils-with-less-than-50-coverage/articleshow/88264476.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Kolkata||Vegetable prices cool off with bulk supply to Kolkata markets from neighbouring states||KOLKATA: The prices of vegetables have cooled off at city markets with the easing of supply lines. A steady transportation of vegetables from neighbouring states is catering to the demand-supply gap that was created due to the loss of standing crops because of untimely rain in early December. There were bumper crops this season in most of the states. Earlier, the fluctuating diesel prices had put brakes temporarily on the transportation of vegetables from other states. Now the situation has improved following a dip in the fuel price and trucks have resumed the transportation of vegetables. Besides, a bulk of vegetables is being brought to the city by trains as well. An official of agricultural market attributed the sliding of vegetable prices to the improvement of supply lines. The price of eggplant, which was Rs 70 a kg last week, slumped to Rs 40 this week. Bitter gourd that had touched Rs 90 per kg is being sold at Rs 60. The price of pointed guard has come down from Rs 90 per kg to Rs 60 while the price of green peas dipped from Rs 100 per kg to Rs 60. The prices of green chillies that reached Rs 120 per kg hover between Rs 80 and Rs 90 across the city’s retail markets, said Gobindo Kundu, a retailer at Jadu Babu’s bazar in Bhowanipore. The bulk supply of capsicum is coming from Uttar Pradesh while green peas and eggplants come from Jharkhand, tomato from Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, carrots from Haryana and drumsticks from Karnataka. Besides, the steady supply of vegetables from the unaffected districts of Bengal proved to be a saving grace. Cauliflower and cabbage are coming from Howrah and Bankura. Eggplants and cucumbers are coming from Nadia. The highlands of these districts were largely unaffected by the rains, said Gopal Sonkar, a wholesaler at Sealdah. However, the cooling off period for vegetable prices may be short lived. The prices may shoot further from the December-end till mid January when the new crops from the rain affected areas would start flooding the wholesale markets once more, said Kamal De, a member of market task force and president of West Bengal Vegetables Vendors Association. “The fluctuating prices of vegetables have left us in great inconvenience. If prices are very high, we also end up with a lot of unsold vegetables that get wasted,” said Bratin Ghosh, secretary of Khidderpore Vendors Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/veggie-prices-cool-off-with-bulk-supply-to-city-markets-from-neighbouring-states/articleshow/88264485.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Makarpura police on Sunday filed a case against the Children Home for Girls under amended Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act 2003 section 295 (A) pertaining to deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings or any class. The move came after the chairman of National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) chairman visited the children’s home in August this year. “He found some anomalies at the institute and wrote a letter to the district collector asking to file a complaint against the institute. So, a committee was formed to investigate the case and it gave a report to the collector. So, I have filed a complaint with the police,” said Mayank Trivedi, social security officer.  Trivedi, however, said that he is not authorized to divulge any more details as the case is about minors. The police said that the institute is accused of trying to convert some young girls and they were asked to wear the cross. Sister Rose Terrassa, working at the institute, rejected all the allegations of the religious conversions at children’s home and said that they only educate the kids. The children’s home looks after orphan kids and those who were rescued from child labour. When asked what led the complainant to believe that the institute was indulging in religious conversion, Makarpura police inspector J I Patel said, “According to the complaint, 13 copies of the Bible were found in the library of the institute. The NCPCR chairman has said that his investigations led him to believe that the institute was resorting to conversion of young girls.” The police added that there were allegations that the girls were asked to read the Bible and marriages of girls from other religions were done as per Christian rituals. City police commissioner Shamsher Singh said, “There are prima facie three things in the social security officer’s complaint. A girl was converted to Christian religion without the permission of the district collector which is mandatory and some of the girls in the institute were given Bible and crosses to wear. We will now investigate the complaint.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/missionaries-of-charity-run-home-booked-for-conversion/articleshow/88264482.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cops announce steeper traffic fines, plan DUI checks as New Year nears||MUMBAI: Increased penalties under the amended Motor Vehicles Act, notified earlier this month by the state with a few tweaks, are to be levied on the roads, the Mumbai traffic police announced late on Monday. Until now, the government had not changed the fines for riding without helmets and seatbelts, reportedly due to political pressure. But the police statement mentions that the seatbelt penalty has been hiked from Rs 200 to Rs 500, while that for speaking on the phone while driving will jump five to well over 10 times from Rs 200. Among the other revised compoundable fines that will be implemented in Maharashtra are Rs 5,000 for underage driving (previous fine was Rs 500), Rs 5,000 for racing (previous fine was Rs 2,000) and Rs 10,000 for driving without permit (previous fine was Rs 5,000). Getting tipsy and taking the wheel will also cost citizens dearly. Under the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act, drunk driving attracts a maximum fine of Rs 10,000 for a first-time offence, much higher than the Rs 2,000 fine previously provided for. For most part of 2020 and 2021, anti-drunk driving drives couldn’t be organised due to the pandemic. The police now intend to restart these drives, though the power to levy fines lies only with courts as the offence is non-compoundable. The amendment has replaced the requirement of a breath-analysis with ‘any other test including a laboratory test’ for drunk driving. Drunk driving usually peaks during New Year’s eve partying. On December 31, 2020, only 35 motorists were found driving drunk in Mumbai, the lowest figure recorded in the city on the last day of the year since 2017. Two key reasons were the absence of breath analysers due to the pandemic and nakabandis being disbanded after midnight. In sharp contrast, 778 motorists had been booked on December 31, 2019, when nakabandis would stretch up to 4 or 5am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-steep-traffic-fines-under-amended-mva-to-be-levied-on-roads-says-police/articleshow/88265197.cms||Nitasha Natu

Around 60% or 29.91 lakh beneficiaries from the 18 to 44 age group are double vaccinated against the target population of 46.86 lakh. The special vaccination drives across colleges, the vaccine on wheels drives are some of the initiatives that are expediting the inoculation. An official from the district health department said that there were a few pockets where they needed to take extra efforts for the vaccination. But, it was picking up pace and eventually the beneficiaries had started responding. According to a district health office (DHO) report, considering the rise in the number of second dose vaccinations in the past few days, the availability of vaccines had been given much importance and the district by December 9 had around 6 lakh Covishield doses and over 2 lakh Covaxin doses in stock. Meanwhile, on Monday, the district recorded vaccination of around 78,508 beneficiaries across the district’s 682 government and private vaccination sites till 8pm. The district has now administered a total of 1.42 crore doses of Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V. Of them, 84.8 lakh are first doses and 57.73 lakh are second doses. The Cowin data showed that the vaccination in the Pune urban area had picked up pace compared to the rural areas. The data showed that the urban areas were administering more doses on a daily basis compared to the urban areas. It added that in the last two weeks, over 10 lakh beneficiaries had been vaccinated across the district. Of them, over 7.5 lakh were second dose beneficiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-health-authorities-aim-at-speedy-two-dose-vaccination-of-18-44-age-group/articleshow/88264489.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Narsingi police said that the court permitted them keep her in custody from from 11am on Tuesday to 11am on Wednesday. Shilpa was earlier sent to judicial remand after her three-day police custody ended on Sunday. Police had cited bank holidays (Saturday and Sunday) as the reason for seeking one more day of custody as they could not get full details of her transactions. Police said that Shilpa and her family members have 6 bank accounts and a locker. So far, she has been questioned on two different occasions by the police after court’s permission. Shilpa was first arrested on the complaint of businesswoman Divya Reddy and till now there has been three complaints against her at Narsingi police station. In all the three cases, victims sent money into the bank accounts of the accused and family members by issuing either cheques or a portion of the total amount through cash.

They also said they will furnish GST records soon. The market's closure on Sunday sent local shopkeepers in a tizzy as it was the source of livelihood for over 1,000 workers. Police had served a notice under section 91 of CrPC to roughly 100 shops, asking them to furnish stocktaking and GST records. “We will submit documents as soon as we can to the police. However, police should let us open our shops since we depend on them to feed ourselves and our families,” said Tahir Pradhan, head of Sotiganj Traders’ Association. He added that the traders tried to meet senior police officials on Monday but couldn’t manage to meet anyone as there was an election commission meeting scheduled at the collectorate. While the shops that sold second-hand spare parts of two- and four-wheelers remained shut, a few offering mechanic services were open. Those selling new auto parts also kept their shops open. The closure of the notorious market that saw cars -- from the most expensive to the cheapest -- being brought in from Delhi, NCR and many other parts of the country came shortly after the arrest of two kingpins of the illegal trade, Haji Galla and Haji Iqbal. Sotiganj has over 300 shops. “We have identified 100 shops in the market that are involved in the illegal trade. We will not let them access any goods until they submit stock details,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Meerut Prabhakar Chaudhary on Sunday. On Monday, superintendent of police (city) Vineet Bhatnagar said, “We are still standing by what we have said. Traders can open their shops after furnishing records of sale and purchase, along with GST documents.” Sotiganj market became infamous in the 1990s for trading scrap and parts illegally dismantled from stolen cars, at that time mostly from the NCR region. Such illegal operations expanded later. The market ballooned in size over the past few years. Those who own big shops have become owners of multiple properties across the nation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/sotiganj-shut-for-2nd-day-traders-say-will-show-documents/articleshow/88263758.cms||Ishita Mishra

The number of cases being reported in the city presently has reached the numbers reported on June 30 earlier this year. With the second wave of Covid-19 ebbing in a dramatic fashion, the number of cases went down from the peak of 989 cases on May 7 to zero on October 19. For four continuous days from October 19 to October 22, the city did not report a single case. On October 23, a single case was reported. Since then the number has been rising steadily. Since December 9, double digit new cases have been reported. Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) officials pointed out that the situation was not very serious yet as there were hardly any serious cases and the hospitalisation was also very low. “Nine patients from Vadodara are hospitalised and there is only one patient on a ventilator,” said an official. VMC’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that so far no case of the Omicron variant had been reported in the city. “The cases are stray and most are either with a travel history or found in contact tracing,” he said. According to Patel, once the first case was reported after nil cases for a few days, it was expected that more people would test positive for Covid-19. “There will be some cases, but these may be mild in nature. We believe that the vaccine is working,” he said.Apart from a patient on ventilator support, a total of 10 patients are undergoing treatment at different city hospitals. These include three in ICU, but none of them are on a ventilator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cases-up-but-situation-not-serious-vmc/articleshow/88264503.cms||Sachin Sharma

Even though health minister Veena George had ruled out any talks with the striking students, the situation in the medical college hospitals worsened on Monday as people were denied of treatment due to lack of doctors. This was the reason why the state government yielded to the demand for a discussion. The health minister, who totally sidelined the striking PG medical students, earlier in the day had called the house surgeons for talks. The house surgeons are on a 24-hour boycott of duties in the medical college hospitals demanding the government to lessen their workload. The house surgeons had alleged that due to the boycott of work by the PG medicos, they were being overburdened with the work. However, this discussion failed as the government was not ready to consider to their demand that they should be withdrawn from the duties which the PG medicos are supposed to do. The 24-hour strike of the house surgeons will end at 8am on Tuesday. With both the house surgeons and postgraduate medical students boycotting duty, the functioning of all the departments in the government medical college hospitals was totally hit. None of the OP and IP wings functioned as there were no doctors for duty. In Thiruvananthapuram medical college hospital, the senior doctors also boycotted the work to support the strike called by the PG students. The patients who had come to the OP wings of the medical college hospitals had to go back since there were no doctors. Only very few doctors were present in the OP wings which resulted in long queues of patients in many departments. Due to the strike many of the elective surgeries were postponed and only emergency cases were attended on Monday. So far the state government took a tough stand against the PG students as the government was of the view that all reasonable demands raised by the PG students have been met, and hence it was not willing to enter into any more dialogue with the striking students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-to-hold-talks-with-pg-medicos/articleshow/88264509.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Retired navy officer loses Rs 10 lakh to cyber fraudster||Mumbai: A cyber fraudster duped a 76-year old retired naval officer, a resident of Vashi in Navi Mumbai, of Rs 10 lakh on the pretext of verifying his bank account. The fraudster used the application of the nationalised bank where the victim has a pension account and within 12 hours availed of overdraft loans against his fixed deposits (FDs), according to police. The Navi Mumbai police on November 29 registered a case of cheating, forgery, breach of trust under the IPC and the Information Technology Act. Even as the victim’s daughter was in touch with the bank officials and was assured that all transactions had been kept on hold, the fraudsters continued to deplete the ex-serviceman’s account of his savings.. The retired navy officer, Vachaspati Sharma, in his complaint to Vashi police said that on November 25, he received a message from a mobile number asking him for tele-verification. A mobile number was mentioned in the message. Sharma told the police that he thought that the message was from the bank and called the number. The fraudster collected information about Sharma’s account, including OTPs, and disconnected the phone. On the same day, when Sharma's daughter, Sameeksha, tried to access internet banking on her father’s behalf, she could not. Next day when Sameeksha went to the Bandra branch of the bank, she was shocked to find that someone had siphoned off Rs 10 lakh from her father’s account. Later, it transpired that the cyber fraudsters had called up the bank and changed Sharma's mobile number registered with the bank. “Due to the sheer negligence of the bank officials, my father lost all his savings in his pension account. After the whole crisis, I was told by the branch manager that I still needed to call the helpline and register a complaint,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-retired-navy-officer-loses-rs-10-lakh-to-cyber-fraudster/articleshow/88265225.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Delhi||Why clamour for reopening schools is growing in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The chairperson of Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, Anurag Kundu, has written to the chairperson of the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining areas (CAQM), MM Kutty, requesting him to allow reopening of schools. Schools have been shut since November 29 due to pollution. This has resulted in the overall closure of schools extending to almost 600 days. With Supreme Court permitting CAQM to take a decision on the curbs, Kundu has made a plea to Kutty. Citing a study by Energy Policy Institute, University of Chicago, Kundu said, “Schools were closed on account of poor air quality to protect children from severe conditions. However, there is absolutely no evidence that school closures achieved this goal. The two-year study by Energy Policy Institute revealed that Delhi’s indoor pollution levels were worryingly high and way above WHO limits. Since there is no marked difference in pollution levels outdoors and indoors, school closure becomes irrelevant and misplaced.” Pointing out that the school closure policy assumed that all families owned air purifiers, Kundu added, “This isn’t the case, except for a fraction of Delhi. Since the families don’t own air purifiers, the school closure policy achieves nothing.” Earlier, over 500 parents had written to Kundu asking him to intervene and make an intervention in Supreme Court to reopen schools. In the letter to Kutty, Kundu pointed out how school closures had led to learning loss, which could have a long-term implication on children, the country’s economy and human development growth. “The closure is problematic for the social, emotional and psychological growth of children, which is possible only in a school environment. Closures lasting several months have adversely impacted the social and emotional well-being of children and their continuance will exacerbate the problem,” said Kundu. A few parents have also petitioned Kutty to allow reopening of schools. “Our children’s education should not be the first victim of the pollution response and schools should be the last to close and first to open. Delhi now ranks second in the world for the longest school closures behind Uganda by only one week as of November 30, based on UNESCO data,” said Tanya Aggarwal, a lawyer and mother of a Class I child. “School closures have caused tremendous learning and developmental losses. While recognising the enormity of the pollution crisis and the risk it poses to our children’s health, we strongly urge the CAQM and Delhi government to permit schools to reopen in the hybrid mode,” added Aggarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-clamour-for-reopening-schools-is-growing/articleshow/88264535.cms||---

Walk into this sari library in Vadodara||VADODARA: Rama Malik, a city-based textile designer, had to attend a wedding this month but she had no time to go shopping for that perfect sari. Rama simply walked into a ‘sari library’ on the Old Padra Road, picked up a few saris she liked the most and, wrapped in them, she wowed everyone at the wedding. “Wedding rituals in our country last for three to four days and women are expected to wear a new outfit for every function. It’s very difficult to take time out from busy schedules for shopping, especially when we are working. The sari library gives us an easy and immediate solution. Also, the process of getting saris is quite simple,” Rama told TOI. The sari library, a first-of-its-kind initiative, was started by eight city women — a mix of entrepreneurs and housewives — around two months ago. The saris that the library has have all been donated and they are rented out for free. “Women love to wear different saris on different occasions. But not all women, especially those from middle class or lower middle class, can afford to buy expensive saris that are worn hardly a couple of times,” said Hema Chauhan of Ashta Saheli Group that has started the library. “Also, there are working women from well-to-do families who can’t shop much due to their busy schedules. So, we decided to start a library where women can get the best of saris as well as dresses for free. They can wear the sari or the dress and return it within a week,” Chauhan added. All that they have to do is pay a deposit fee and take the saris home. Once they return the saris, the deposit is returned and only dry-cleaning charges are taken from the women. “Since it was started, over 200 women from all walks of life have taken home some of the choicest outfits from the sari library. Our library has nearly 300 saris and dresses, all of which have been donated by women,” Chauhan added. She recalled how a widow, working as a maid in the city, had walked in their library and donated her saris some weeks ago. “Our library has some of the best and expensive Banarasi and chiffon saris,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/no-cash-or-time-for-shopping-no-worries-walk-into-this-sari-library/articleshow/88264527.cms||Tushar Tere

The accused bought an iPhone, jewellery and withdrew cash from various ATM kiosks in the city using the stolen debit card. The matter was brought to police after the victim's daughter, who stays in Singapore, found the money deducted from her father's account. The Gamdevi police arrested the accused, Gajendra Nishad. “After quitting the job, the accused had taken a room on rent and was staying in Ghatkopar,” said a police officer. A police source said that the victim, resides at Grant Road and had two domestic helps. The accused Nishad, had joined work a month ago. “One day, the bank sent the victim's debit card to his residence. The accused stole the envelope containing the debit card,” said an officer. The accused also got the debit card’s password. While working at the victim’s place, the accused withdrew cash a couple of times.

---||Visakhapatnam||Covid fluctuations determined Andhra Pradesh's air passenger traffic in last 2 years||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on almost every sector in the last two years including the aviation industry. The new protocols, mobility restrictions and testing criteria posed several challenges to the fliers, disrupting their itineraries. As per an analysis done based on domestic air passenger data from the Airports Authority of India by ‘India Data Portal’, an open data-driven initiative of the Bharati Institute of Public Policy of the Indian School of Business (ISB), the highs and lows in the air traffic in Andhra Pradesh since the onset of the pandemic is in tandem with the extent of the Covid-19 transmission in the community at a particular time. The air traffic has more than doubled at the airports in Andhra Pradesh between May-August 2021 compared to the corresponding period last year. According to aviation industry experts, the recent growth is attributed to the decreasing Covid-19 infections, improving vaccination coverage and easing restrictions. For instance, Andhra Pradesh had only some 14,600 fliers during the first wave in May 2020. This increased to 79,000 in May 2021 despite the unprecedented infection numbers during the peak of the second wave during this month. It further touched the 2.9 lakh mark in August 2021 compared to 1.12 lakh passenger footfall at the airports in the state, as per the ‘India Data Portal’ analysis. From nose-diving to almost zero levels in April 2020, Andhra Pradesh started to witness a gradual turnaround in terms of air traffic ever since the restrictions were eased as part of the unlocking process that began in June 2020. Andhra Pradesh first breached the daily 10,000 Covid-19 case milestone on July 29, 2020. However, the daily infection numbers quickly plateaued by September-end. The state further managed to fully flatten the curve during the first wave by January-February 2021. Corresponding with the lowest infection numbers, the air traffic increased to 3.5 lakh in January 2021 and 3 lakh each in February and March. With the emergence of the second wave, the domestic throughput dipped to 2.2 lakh in April. It further plunged to 79,000 in May 2021- the month which forced the state’s health system to stretch beyond its breaking point. Again, with the improving conditions, there has been a sharp increase in the passenger footfalls in the last few months. However, it is yet to reach the pre-Covid levels.  Amid the fears over the spread of the new variant Omicron, those who booked tickets are now going for cancellations,” said president of Tours and Travel Association of Andhra Pradesh, K Vijay Mohan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/covid-fluctuations-determined-ap-air-passenger-traffic-in-last-2-years/articleshow/88263800.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP’s temple run makes opposition parties play on an ‘unfamiliar’ Hindutva pitch||LUCKNOW: Inaugurating the Rs 900 crore Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pitched the project as another attempt by the BJP government to restore the country’s lost glory while asserting that it is not just a building but a symbol of India’s heritage and spiritual soul. The BJP governments at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh have been constantly making efforts to renovate temples and other places of religious importance. Be it the Ram Temple in Ayodhya or Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi, the issues have had the Hindutva agenda in its core. Read AlsoFor every Aurangzeb, there’s been a Shivaji: PM Modi in Kashi“Whenever an Aurangzeb comes along, a Shivaji rises. For every Salar Masud, there is a brave warrior like King Suheldev to show the world the might of India’s unity,” the PM said from the decked-out courtyard of the shrine that is now linked to the three main ghats of the Ganga by a 400m-long andWhile the BJP leaders have been boasting that they have forced the opposition to talk about Hindus and Hindutva, the opposition has been claiming that the BJP doesn’t have a copyright on issues concerning the majority. The construction and renovation of temples have forced the opposition to play on a bit ‘unfamiliar’ Hindutva pitch ahead of assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh. So, while former Congress president Rahul Gandhi has reignited the Hindu versus Hindutva debate, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav tweeted on the eve of KV Dham’s inauguration that the money for the work was actually sanctioned by his government. The BSP’s approach has also undergone a paradigm shift as its number two leader, party general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra, has been invoking Hindu deities. Read AlsoPM's Kashi day out: A dip in the Ganga, chat with labourersPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday took the ritualistic dip in the holy river before going to inaugurate the Rs 900-crore Kashi Vishwanath Dham (KVD), housing the world-famous Kashi Vishwanath Temple. The PM also met the labourers engaged in the construction of KVD. He showered flowers on themAccording to political analysts, it could be as tough for the opposition parties to compete with the BJP on Hindutva as it is for a cricket team to play on a foreign soil. They said there was a time when opposition parties either remained silent on issues like Ram Temple construction or dubbed the BJP as a communal party for raking up contentious issues. Now, in the face of saffron surge, opposition leaders are trying to prove themselves a better Hindu, they added. “The Opposition has been lacking the conviction with which issues close to majority population should be taken up. Wearing janeu (sacred thread) or running from one temple to another will not suffice to take on the BJP which has been aggressively pursuing the Hindutva agenda,” a political observer said. A BJP leader, on condition of anonymity, said: “Trouble began for the Opposition parties when they remained silent on the narratives of apologetic Hindus for the past over two decades. The BJP, however, chose to take this as an opportunity and became the voice of the majority.” “Be it the Ram Temple issue, Kashmir problem or atrocities on majority population, BJP was seen standing solidly with the Hindus which was not the case with the opposition,” he said. Read AlsoCreation of Kashi Vishwanath Dham was impossible without Shiva’s blessing, will: ModiVARANASI: Reciting the shloka, ‘Sarvashreshtha Bhuprushta Kashi Kshetram Cha Mam’ (In all parts of world, Kashi is my body), pronounced by Lord Shiva in ‘Kashi Khand,’ Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said “creation of Kashi Vishwanath Dham was impossible without the blessings and will of LordIn a similar vein, the PM in his Monday’s address, said: “Jis heen bhavna se Bharat ko bhar diya gaya tha, usse aaj woh bahar nikal raha hai (The country is coming out of the inferiority complex that had crept in).” “Yeh ek bhavya mandir bhar nahin hai, ye prateek hai hamare Bharat ki sanatani sanskriti ka, ye prateek hai hamari aadhyatmik atma ka, ye prateek hai Bharat ki pracheenta ka (This is not just a huge building, it is a symbol of India’s culture, spirituality, pristine glory),” he said. Invoking Hindutva, the PM said, “Yahan agar Aurangzeb aata hai toh Shivaji bhi uth khade hote hain, agar koi Salaar Masud aata hai toh Raja Suheldev jaise veer yodha use hamari ekta ki taaqat ka ehsaas kara dete hain.” AICC secretary Rajesh Tiwari, who is attached to Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, said there was no compulsion for the Congress to adopt Hindutva agenda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjps-temple-run-makes-oppn-parties-play-on-an-unfamiliar-hindutva-pitch/articleshow/88265245.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

A few other women who were with her, recalled that the tiger tried to drag her into the dense forest but she resisted it fiercely. Sharing her experience of the miraculous escape, Leela, who is currently recuperating in hospital, told TOI over phone, “While cutting grass, I could sense that a wild animal was slowly coming towards me. As soon as I turned, it grabbed my head with its jaws and dug its sharp claws on my left shoulder. I was staring at death for sure. And all I could think of was to fight back with all my might. Soon, I realised that I was up against a tiger." She further said, “After striking the tiger a few times on its head with a sickle, I started screaming for help. The tiger then left me and moved a little away, possibly thinking that I may fall unconscious and it would drag me away. But I got up, picked up a stone and stared back at it with the sickle in my other hand." In the meantime, the other women came around and soon, Leela was taken to a hospital. “She suffered multiple injuries and had to get 30 stitches in her head and at least 10 on the shoulder,” said Ghanshyam Latwal, her husband who runs a small tea shop in Mukhani. Forest officials said that since the incident took place inside the forest area and the woman was there to collect fodder which is against rules, they won't be able to provide her with any compensation. However, they added that they are willing to support her medical expenses.

According to police, Kare was last seen at Raghunath Temple in Devprayag, where he is believed to have stayed for a few days. Khare had started out for Dehradun from Delhi on December 8 on the Shatabdi Express. When he did not reach Doon, RSS office-bearers approached railway police regarding his disappearance and a case was lodged in Dehradun. A probe revealed that instead of Dehradun, 64-year-old Kare, who is sangathan mantri of the sangh, got down from the train at Haridwar and went to Devprayag. According to TS Rana, station house officer, government railway police (GRP), Dehradun, Kare took a bus to Devprayag after deboarding the train at Haridwar. During the probe, a local RSS worker Suresh Kotiyal told police that Kare, who was at the Raghunath Temple at Devprayag, asked him where he would get the bus to Rishikesh. Upon getting this input, the GRP team reached Rishikesh. A search operation to trace Kare is currently ongoing in the town. “We have found that on December 8, he had transferred Rs 25,000 to someone’s account via internet banking. Then, on December 10, someone else transferred Rs 50,000 to Kare’s bank account. Prima facie, it doesn’t appear to be a case of a person gone missing. However, we are working on all angles and have intensified the search,” said Rana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rss-leader-goes-missing-while-travelling-from-delhi-to-doon/articleshow/88263829.cms||Kautilya Singh

The temperatures will begin to fall from third week of December. Minimum temperatures are usually recorded during night or early mornings. The probability of this happening is between 35 and 75 per cent for different areas in state. Parts of AP have been witnessing rainfall for the past two months. The minimum temperatures recorded during the past few days range from 20 degree Celsius and 24 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperatures during the winter season will be below normal over Andhra Pradesh. The probability of this happening is between 35 and 65 per cent. Speaking to TOI, director of IMD-Amaravati, Stella S said this time winter is unlikely to be cooler than normal in parts of state. People in coastal Andhra Pradesh region may feel the winter chill only in the coming weeks, she added.  Chintapalle in Vizag Agency recorded a minimum temperature of 9.2 degrees Celsius in November 2020. But, this time, people are yet to experience the biting cold.  It may be recalled that Lammasingi and Tajangi villages in Chintapalle mandal in Vizag Agency have emerged as the coolest places in the state recording around 6 to 8 degree Celsius during the peak winter season.

---||Delhi||Winter woes: Share of external sources in PM2.5 at 22% in first 10 days of Dec||New Delhi: An analysis by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, has determined that the average proportion of PM2.5 from external sources within 200km of Delhi was 22% in December 1-10. With non-local pollutants an important factor in overall winter pollution, experts felt strong action was needed to curb emissions in the airshed for better air in the city. Gufran Beig, SAFAR’s founder-project director, said, “The contribution of external sources to Delhi’s pollution varies from season to season and day to day. The average share of external sources to the city’s PM2.5 in the winter season is 15-30% and may reach 35% on a particular day.” He added, “In contrast to the winter season, the wind speed and mixing layer height remain high in summer, leading to dispersion of pollutants and in monsoons, rain settles down pollutants. In winter, however, local conditions cause stagnation of particles.” SAFAR apportioned the local pollution sources between December 1-10 as 36% to vehicles and transport, 17% to dust, 14% industries, 2% fuel burning and 8%, other pollutant sources. The share of stubble burning in this period was just 1%. Experts said it was not enough just to focus on Delhi’s own generation of pollutants. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, “With substantial external pollution, a regional action plan is a must for controlling emissions in Delhi and the 24 NCR districts. The plan should be multi-sectoral, targeting the industry hotspots, vehicles, dust, power plants and waste management.” The Decision Support System of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, said the emission from 19 neighbouring districts constituted from nil to 10% of the PM2.5 in Delhi’s air on any day. That is why, said Anju Goel, fellow, earth science and climate change, The Energy and Resources Institute, action had to be taken at the airshed level. “The focus should be on shifting coal-based power plants to cleaner fuels, eliminating biomass and fuel burning and ensuring compliance of construction guidelines,” Goel said. Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, noted that SAFAR forecast Delhi's air quality to continue to be in the 'very poor' and 'poor' category for the next two days. She added that on Monday, local dust, transport, and biomass burning for warming needs, and emissions from Gautam Buddha Nagar and Faridabad districts were the primary drivers of pollution in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/winter-woes-share-of-external-sources-in-pm2-5-at-22-in-first-10-days-of-dec/articleshow/88264584.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Suresh Chougle, shopkeeper in Ghorpadi said, “Events and parties are being conducted, people are decorating their homes for get-togethers which has resulted in an increase in sales of the Christmas and New Year related items. Last year the sales went down due to the paranoia caused by the pandemic. We are not getting any products from China yet, and customers are also consciously asking for the products made-in-India.” “Prices for artificial Christmas trees are more or less the same as they were in 2019, since the stock is the same. Rates of the decorations such as baubles, stars, candy canes, and stockings have increased by 20-30%,” said a shopkeeper from Camp. Ajay Dhopate, gift shop owner in Salunke Vihar, said, “At the start of the month there was some apprehension owing to the cases of the new strain of the coronavirus found in the city, but since the last few days customers are pouring in for Christmas items. Trees with inbuilt lighting are a hit among customers this year. Wooden and paper decorations are more in demand than the regular plastic varieties.” Emily Joseph, resident of Khadki, said, “For our family, Christmas shopping is a part of the celebration of the festival, be it for the cake, the decoration or gifts. Last year we could do nothing, so we are making up for it this year. My children have made it their project to decorate our house, buying some decorations as well as making some by hand.” “It is tradition for our extended family to spend Christmas together after the morning service. This year we are able to go to church and after that we will all go to our grandparent’s house in Viman Nagar to celebrate the rest of the day with aunts, uncles and cousins.

Minister for civil supplies, Gangula Kamalakar, reviewed paddy procurement status with officials on Monday. Kamalakar said 42 lakh metric tonnes of paddy worth Rs 8,268 crore were purchased. Out of 4.5 lakh farmers listed on the Online Procurement Management System, approximately 3.75 lakh farmers received payments (OPMS). He said that there will be no shortage of funds for paddy purchase in the state and that paddy will be lifted regardless of the state’s situation. The present procurement is 11 lakh metric tonnes higher than the previous year’s procurement at the same time. According to the minister, current procurement has been completed in 1,280 centres across 13 districts. A total of 6,775 centres have been established around the state so far. The minister went on to say that all of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns were full and that the Centre’s wing is now refusing to lease godowns anymore, causing problems with crop storage. He also said that despite many complaints from the state government on the subject, there had been no response from the Centre or the FCI. He added that there was an issue with paddy stocking because the (FCI) godowns in Suryapet, Siddipet, Sangareddy, Medak, Mahabubnagar, and Nirmal districts were not vacant. The state administration anticipates that overall paddy production will be around 60 lakh metric tonnes this season.

---||Hyderabad||Allow Palamuru lift for drinking water: Telangana to NGT||HYDERABAD: Telangana has filed an affidavit in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) requesting to continue the drinking water component of the Palamuru Rangareddy Lift Irrigation Scheme (PRLIS). The state government contended that fluoride issue in Nalgonda and Mahbubnagar affects the lives of people who lack drinking water supply. PRLIS envisages lifting 90 tmc of floodwater in 60 days during the flood season from the foreshore of Srisailam reservoir on Krishna river at Yellur in Kollapur mandal in erstwhile Mahbubnagar district through five separate stages. Special chief secretary, irrigation, Rajat Kumar said these five stages comprise a reservoir and canals/tunnels between each reservoir for taking the water forward. “The ultimate objective of PRLIS is to implement irrigation infrastructure in phase II on the foundation of the presently envisaged drinking water components under phase I. PRLIS, as currently planned, has no provision for irrigation. PRLIS has been commenced only to alleviate the misery of drought-prone areas to benefit 1,226 villages where about 50 lakh people will get water,” he said. He said the project was extremely important as there was a tremendous shortage of drinking and farm water in Mahbubnagar and Nalgonda districts. “These are fluoride-affected areas. Due to high fluoride content in the drinking water, a large part of the population in these districts is migrating to other parts of the state and country. Drought-like conditions are also causing social problems in the districts,” he said. The project proponent to continue with ongoing works is subject to obtaining environmental clearance in six months. “Project work has been commenced in 2016 and several contracts have been awarded for executing the works relating to drinking water,” Kumar said. PRLIS envisages lifting 90 tmc of floodwater in 60 days during the flood season from the foreshore of Srisailam reservoir on Krishna river at Yellur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/allow-palamuru-lift-for-drinking-water-t-to-ngt/articleshow/88264583.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

In the video, Singh is seen purportedly saying, “If poor people are getting benefits of government schemes, then their vote should also go to the government. This scheme is not for any particular caste, as every poor person is getting free ration.” He was also heard in the video asking the women to tell their kin to vote for BJP, and said, “Irrespective of the advice given by your son or husband… you give your vote to Yogi ji only.” When contacted, Singh stood by his statement saying, “If government is providing free ration to the poor, they should give their votes to it.” He said he also showed images of chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi printed on packets of salt and dal to make them aware about who provides them free ration. This is to make them realise that they should also take care of the people running the government, he added. Vice president of state Congress Upendra Singh said this is “sarkari blackmailing”, and the scheme has been extended till March 2022 in view of the coming assembly elections. “The government wants to take political mileage through government schemes, and it is putting pressure on the public to cast their votes in favour of the (BJP) government,” he said. If the BJP government is really concerned about people’s welfare, it should provide employment to youths, control inflation and reduce prices of petrol and diesel, he added. Free ration was distributed to the poor from April to November 2021 as part of PM Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana after the second wave of Covid-19 hit the nation. After distributing free ration from Ramnavami to Deepawali, the scheme was extended till Holi next year. Over 15 crore ration card holders in UP will get benefit under the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/bjp-leader-asks-ration-card-holders-to-vote-for-yogi-as-govt-schemes-benefit-them/articleshow/88263858.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||Delhi: Lower wind speeds drag AQI back to very poor||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality deteriorated on Monday from being “poor” to “very poor” as the wind speeds dropped, leading to accumulation of pollutants. With not much supportive meteorological conditions predicted, the air quality is likely to remain in the “very poor” category on Tuesday, according to the pollution monitoring agencies. Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to Central Pollution Control Board, the air quality index (AQI), on a scale of 0 to 500, was 337 on Monday as against 254 a day earlier. The particle pollutants, primarily PM2.5, were well above the safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metres. PM2.5 oscillated between 131.4 and 171.6 units, with no improvement and a consistent spike from the morning till the evening. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a central forecasting agency, the air quality may improve after Wednesday when the wind speed increases. “On December 14, winds are likely to be low to moderate. Partially cloudy conditions and moderate mixing layer height (~1.0-1.5km) are likely to keep air quality within the lower end of ‘very poor’ for the next two days. From 15th, air quality is likely to improve due to relatively high wind speeds, but within the ‘poor’ or ‘lower end of very poor’ category,” SAFAR stated. According to the earth sciences ministry’s Decision Support System for Air Quality Management of Delhi, the air quality had been hit by several factors, including local transport (17% of PM2.5), industries across NCR (7%) and neighbouring cities, of which Faridabad and Noida were the major contributors. Other major sources included Delhi’s residential emissions at 4.5%, construction up to 2.15%, and dust over 1%. Faridabad district contributed about 12% in Delhi’s PM2.5, followed by Noida and Greater Noida at 10%, Gurgaon at 7.2% and Ghaziabad at 5%, among others. According to weather analysts, Delhi saw low wind speed — around 5-7kmph — and variable directions due to a western disturbance, affecting dispersion of pollutants. While the wind speed may improve on Wednesday, another feeble western disturbance may bring it down by Thursday, they added. “Only from December 15, wind speeds will start picking up after the western disturbance has passed,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology and climate change at Skymet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lower-wind-speeds-drag-aqi-back-to-v-poor/articleshow/88264597.cms||---
---||Kochi||Why are you ashamed of our PM’s photo, Kerala HC asks petitioner||KOCHI: The high court on Monday asked a petitioner challenging inclusion of prime minister Narendra Modi’s photo on vaccination certificate why he is ashamed of it. Justice PV Kunhikrishnan raised the question while considering a petition filed by Peter Myaliparambil of Kottayam seeking a directive to issue a vaccination certificate without the PM’s photo on it. During the hearing, the court said, “He is our prime minister, not the prime minister of any other country. He came to power through our mandate. Merely because you have political differences, you cannot challenge this. Why are you ashamed of our PM? 100 crore people don’t seem to have an issue with this, so why do you? Everyone has different political opinions but he is still our prime minister. You are wasting judicial time.” Petitioner’s counsel Ajit Joy submitted that his client had paid for the vaccination and the State has no right to claim credit by inserting a photograph of the prime minister in the certificate issued to him. Citing a 2018 Supreme Court judgment (Common Cause vs Union of India), the counsel pointed out that the apex court had laid down guidelines for campaigns using public money. As per the guidelines, no individual can be credited for the launch of an initiative or be celebrated for achievements of a certain policy of the State on government expense, and this includes the prime minister, the counsel argued. Further, he argued that no public purpose or utility is served by the PM’s photograph on the vaccination certificate. The certificate is the private space of an individual with one’s personal details and it is not a place for public campaigning, the counsel submitted. The court said it will consider the pleadings in detail with an open mind and decide it on merits. Producing copies of vaccination certificates issued in USA, Indonesia, Israel, Kuwait, France and Germany, the petitioner has contended before the court that the certificates issued by these countries only contain necessary information and nothing else. The petitioner has to carry the certificate with him to several places and the photo of the prime minister in the certificate has no utility or relevance, the petition had said while alleging that the national campaign against Covid-19 is being converted into a media campaign for the prime minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/why-are-you-ashamed-of-our-pms-photo-hc-asks-petitioner/articleshow/88264592.cms||---

They threatened to start an indefinite dharna and boycott the upcoming assembly elections. However, after getting assurance from the district magistrate and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) department officials, they postponed their protest until next week. "Assi Ganga Valley, which is famous for the Dodital Lake, bird watching, and many other adventure activities, is one of the hottest tourist destinations in the state. However, the main road connecting nine villages and tourist spots to the district headquarters is in bad shape after successive flash floods in 2012 and 2013. This has affected the tourist inflow and local economy. Besides, the damaged road may cause accidents in the region," said Mukesh Panwar, gram pradhan of the Agoda village. Echoing a similar statement, local villager Kamal Rawat said, "Despite repetitive pleas, government agencies have not taken any action to improve the condition of the Gangori-Gajoli road over the past eight years. We have no option but to stage a protest." "The district magistrate of Uttarkashi and PMGSY officials have assured us that they will begin the repair and construction work at the earliest. We have therefore decided to postpone the protest until next week. However, we will re-launch it if the administration fails to fulfill its promise," said Rajendra Panwar, another villager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/villagers-of-assi-ganga-valley-stage-protest-demand-repair-and-construction-of-road/articleshow/88263848.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala

---||Hyderabad||Dalmia Cement says CBI chargesheet lacks proof, wants quid pro case quashed||HYDERABAD: Dalmia Cement Bharat Limited chairman and managing director Puneet Dalmia on Monday urged the Telangana high court to quash the quid pro quo case against them on the grounds that the CBI chargesheet against him and his company was incoherent and lacked evidence. Appearing for Puneet, Supreme Court senior counsel PV Kapoor said the CBI threw certain unconnected issues into its chargesheet and did not even bother to connect them. Justice Ujjal Bhuyan, who heard the case conclusively last week, resumed the hearing in the case on Monday afternoon. Kapoor said the CBI spoke about a pen drive that was allegedly seized from Joy Deep Basu and was relying heavily on the contents retrieved from the pen drive, Kapoor said. Basu is an employee working for Puneet. “A pen drive is not a valid piece of evidence,” he contended. The CBI was using this pen drive as evidence to show that some illicit money was sent into Jagan’s (AP chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy) firms by Puneet, the details of which were stored in the pen drive which was seized from Joy Deep, he said.  “A pen drive is not an admissible evidence before a trial court,” he said. According to Kapoor, the material retrieved from the pen drive speaks about a plan to transfer Rs 139 crore into Jagan’s firms through hawala routes. It revealed that Rs 55 crore had already been transferred. “By the time efforts were on to transfer the remaining amount through the same hawala channels, the CBI came into the picture after it was ordered to register an FIR and investigate the alleged quid pro quo case. So transfer of the balance amount did not take place,” he said. Senior counsel said CBI had made a French company too as an accused in the process. “CBI says we purchased some of these shares at a high premium of Rs 1,450 per share. But, we sold the same to the French company later and made a profit of Rs 145 crore,” Kapoor said. The case will be heard on Tuesday again. In a separate case, Justice Bhuyan adjourned for two weeks a plea filed by YSRCP rebel MP K Raghu Rama Krishna Raju seeking cancellation of bail given to the Andhra Pradesh CM in the quid pro quo case. Raju’s counsel took time saying that their senior counsel would argue the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dalmia-cement-says-cbi-chargesheet-lacks-proof-wants-quid-pro-case-quashed/articleshow/88264599.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

---||Lucknow||KV Dham is a confluence of development and faith: Experts||Lucknow: The inauguration of Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday may well mark the BJP’s decisive bid to route its developmental agenda through assertive Hindu religious symbolism, believe social and political scientists.  Experts categorically cite the example of Ayodhya receiving a development push after PM Modi laid the foundation of the Ram Temple in August 2020, months after the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Ram Janmabhoomi. In June, the Yogi Adityanath government came up with a vision document for development of Ayodhya while focusing on creating employment opportunities, branding local products, and promoting religious tourism.  “Now, both Ayodhya and Varanasi have been put on the global map and would attract a large tourist inflow. Both cities would therefore require fast tracked development,” said director of GB Pant Institute of Social Sciences, Prof Badri Narayan. “It is an apt example of BJP’s politics meeting its objective of development, and religion,” he added.  Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) also considers the KV Dham as a ‘big’ project. “While Ayodhya is now poised to be developed as a spiritual centre, Kashi will come up as an intellectual hotspot,” said VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal.  “The development in the two cities is therefore bound to happen,” he told TOI.  Observers also pointed out how BJP, after coming to power in UP in 2017, put Mathura, another Hindu religious centre, on its priority and constituted UP Braj Teerth Vikas Parishad for preparing a plan for preserving, developing, and maintaining the aesthetics of Braj heritage in all hues — cultural, ecological and architectural — and co-coordinating and monitoring its implementation and evolving harmonised policies for integrated tourism development and heritage conservation.  It was only last month when CM Yogi Adityanath announced that Mathura will also be transformed into a grand pilgrimage city like Ayodhya and every festival will be celebrated on a grand scale as in Ayodhya. In August, on Janamashtami, the UP government had imposed a ban on sale of meat and liquor in Mathura.  Experts also point out how the inauguration of KV Dham comes amid BJP putting PM Modi on the forefront of various flagship developmental projects like Jewar airport and Purvanchal Expressway ahead of the high-stakes UP assembly elections next year.  PM Modi will next visit UP to lay the foundation of 594 km Ganga Expressway on December 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kv-dham-is-a-confluence-of-development-and-faith-experts/articleshow/88265270.cms||Pankaj Shah

Samant said that the Maha Vikas Aghadi government was for offline examinations only. However, in view of the new Covid variant, colleges and universities were advised to conduct examinations in both modes. Samant also ruled out the possibility of reopening the government hostels as they could be required in the future as quarantine centres if Covid cases increased as a result of the new variant, so the decision to reopen was put on hold. The minister also said that all the universities across Maharashtra should conduct the convocation ceremonies in Marathi language. “The future will be for offline examinations only. Online examinations are only a substitute to the impending situation during the pandemic. Hoeever, as the situation improves, we will go back to the offline exams. Students should not remain under the guise of online examinations forever,” Samant said. He added that every district should form an examination committee and hold discussions with the disaster management department of their respective district and also district collector and decide the course of examination.  “We have told all the universities in Maharashtra to think about both the options and if possible give both options — online and offline — to the students,” Samant added. Decision to open hostels put on hold, says Samant Samant said a committee headed by director of higher and technical education Dhanraj Mane had given the nod to reopen the hostels. “However, considering the new Covid variant and infections in the last eight days, we have kept the decision on hold. The hostels may be required as quarantine centres. Hence, it was decided to keep the reopening of hostels on hold,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/conduct-online-or-offline-exams-depending-on-local-situation-min/articleshow/88264606.cms||---

While Telangana says it is a drinking water supply scheme, AP filed a counter-affidavit asserting that it is an irrigation project taken up without seeking the environmental clearance (EC). Telangana irrigation special chief secretary Rajat Kumar in an affidavit said: “As on the present stage of construction, filling of the reservoirs, transporting and storing infrastructure can only be utilised for drinking water and industrial purposes. A separate further plan under next phase as to development of irrigation- related infrastructure would specifically needs to be made.” He said DLIS had been commenced only to alleviate misery of drought-prone areas of Nagarkurnool, Nalgonda, Rangareddy and Yadadri Bhuvanagiri districts. “It will benefit 23 villages in Nagarkurnool, 179 villages in Nalgonda, nine villages in Rangareddy and 13 villages in Bhuvanagiri. A total of 21.6 lakh people from 224 villages will get drinking water,” he explained. He said water will be drawn from the proposed Veeranjaneya reservoir at Yedula (which is part of Palamuru Rangareddy LIS). “This water would be floodwater (drawn during flood season) and therefore it will not interrupt the flow of the water of the Krishna,” he contended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-ap-spar-over-dindi-lift-irrigation-scheme-in-ngt/articleshow/88264611.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

We will have to advertise again for the post of the director, as no one could be appointed from the previous occasion,” said Sayyid Rabeehashmi, the FTII registrar. Kainthola confirmed of receiving transfer orders from the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MI&B). “I have just received my transfer orders. I have been asked to take over as director general of the eastern zone of the Press Information Bureau,” he told TOI. While the term of the director at the FTII generally runs for three years, Kainthola served at the institute for nearly six years and has been granted multiple extensions since 2019. His term coincided with the terms of four chairmen — Gajendra Chauhan, Anupam Kher, BP Singh, and Shekhar Kapur — the latter three of whom were appointed during his time as a director. Kainthola’s tenure coincided with multiple changes at the FTII, including a construction project at that came with the commissioning of new academic blocks, as well as the refurbishment of existing facilities, including its famed acting studios and the shooting floors. He oversaw the institute’s launch of its online courses, after the onset of the pandemic. However, Kainthola had an often-fractious relationship with the institute’s students, with them accusing him of running the FTII with an iron hand and “muzzling” student voices in the governance of the institute, as well as in issues such as academics and screenings. Students also went on strike on multiple occasions during his tenure, over issues such as increasing fees, “disproportionate” sizes of syllabus and visiting faculty members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ftii-gets-new-director-after-nearly-six-years/articleshow/88264629.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

At Rs 6,000 crore, Telangana also has one of the highest healthcare budgets among different states. As per the report tabled in the Rajya Sabha, Himachal Pradesh spends Rs 3,177 per person on healthcare, Kerala spends Rs 2,272 while Telangana spends Rs 1,698. When it comes to out-of-pocket expenditure on healthcare (expense that people have to bear to avail paid services at private health facilities) Telangana is at the 9th position. People in Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana and AP have to spend more on availing private services than in Telangana, as per the report. After formation of Telangana state, the healthcare budget was raised from Rs 3,800 crore (for the entire undivided AP) to Rs 6,000 crore, which gave a boost to healthcare infrastructure like primary health centres (PHCs), basthi dawakhanas, equipment and diagnostic services (Telangana diagnostics). A big component was spent on Aaryogasri scheme. “For a small state like Telangana, Rs 6,000 crore is a good budget. We spend heavily on improving the infrastructure and drugs supply. Also since the health department is essentially an HR-centric department, with a focus on doctors, nurses or paramedics, a lot of expenditure revolves around them. We are also spending very good amount on Aarogyasri, Telangana diagnostics and drugs. Off late, Rs 10,000 crore additional budget is being mobilized for new medical colleges,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health, Telangana.

But it isn’t because of his job as a doctor; it’s to stay updated on what’s happening at the Sri Sarada Niketan Public School — a K-12 institute he built exclusively for orphaned children about 12 years ago. Located thousands of kilometres away from the hand surgeon’s home in Missouri, USA, this residential school in Andhra Pradesh’s Matur area now accepts HIV positive kids too, along with those from troubled homes. Sirisha Nagipogu is one among them. Brought to the school by sisters from a nearby church, after both her parents died, the 14-year-old says the school has given her two things — new friends and an ambition. “I want to become a dancer when I grow up,” said the class 9 student, as her classmate cheered her on. The idea of the school, Dr Polineni says, took roots following a successful surgery.“When people praised me, it took me back to my childhood (he was born in Matur) when I was taken in by my aunt’s family after my mother passed away and my father went missing — he wasn’t very present even before that. I was eight years old and became their fifth child. But I would have ended up working in the fields had it not been for my cousin who put his foot down and insisted that I be allowed to study,” said Dr Polineni, recounting his journey from a private medical college in Karnataka to Maryland — when he cleared the Educational Council for Foreign Medical Graduates test and a hospital in Baltimore handed him a loan to travel to the US to take up the job. “I started with no money and I understand how crippling it can be for someone who wants to get ahead in life. Through this school, I not only want to give students, who have the potential but lack the means, a chance at quality education but also help them build a corpus so that they are not dependant on anybody to get a higher education,” he added.

As a result, intense follow-up of passengers, who had returned earlier but tested negative at the airport screening, is also being carried out. The reason why UK is the top threat for Telangana, as per sources, is that the maximum number of direct flights from the ‘at risk’ countries landing at the airport are from the UK. Repeat tests performed on over 1,000 such passengers after eight days of arrival and completing home quarantine, resulted in one of the UK-returned passengers testing positive in an RT-PCR test. The samples from the patient have been sent for genome sequencing. “We have been monitoring the travellers from the UK as well as other 9-10 high risk countries and regularly following up with them. We are further upscaling the vigil by being in regular touch. We will monitor each flyer for two weeks,” state director public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao said. Health officials were waiting for genome sequencing results of three Covid-19 positive passengers, including the one who tested positive on Monday. Currently, domestic fliers, who might have landed at other airports, were going unchecked. A case of a domestic traveller landing at another international airport and later on testing positive has surfaced in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. “Normally, any incoming passenger will be landing at an international airport within the country and will undergo the mandatory RT-PCR test there. Once they are in home quarantine, they are being monitored,” the state health director added. Currently, domestic fliers who have landed at other airports, were going unchecked.

The drive is mostly focussed on students from class 6-10. The private school managements, who were not keen initially, joined the effort after a series of meetings, officials said. “A mobile van is being used to do the tests in school premises after assembly. It will continue till 1 pm,” Dy DHMO Dr H Raj Kumar told TOI. Initially, the health department conducted RT-PCR testes in private schools in Lal Bazar and Trimulgherry. The samples were sent to Gandhi Hospital and nearly 200 students did not display any symptoms, the deputy DHMO said, adding that the students were mostly following Covid norms and enthusiastic about the test process. “The RT-PCR tests are also being conducted for students of government high schools. We intend to complete this process by the end of this month,” she said. While a private school teacher said, “There’s good response from students and no one refused to do the RT-PCR test.” According to the dy educational officer (Secunderabad) GBS Kumar, there are five government high schools and another half-a-dozen private schools in Secunderabad Cantonment with about 5,000 students in all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-tests-at-all-schools-in-cantt/articleshow/88265317.cms||Sunil Mungara

Persons who can afford the treatment are asking doctors in private hospitals where the therapy is available to prescribe it as a preventative step for them as well though they have not tested positive. Despite the fact that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has not recommended it as a preventive medicine, family members of patients are showing keen interest in monoclonal cocktail treatment. Doctors in the private hospitals claimed there are no side effects, but an official approval from the drug authorities is still pending. Many people are looking for patients who can take one of the two doses provided in the package. A box now costs a minimum of Rs 1.2 lakh, with each dose costing Rs 60,000. If there is only one patient who requires therapy, families and hospitals are looking for another patient who is willing to receive the same treatment. “If two patients are not located, then a patient must pay the entire price. But even then, there is a rush for treatment because many people believe the cocktail treatment is safe,” said manager of a private hospital. “We normally advise tested patients only who arrive in early stages to seek this treatment if they can afford it. Especially, elderly and those with comorbidities,” said Dr Y Sridhar, critical care consultant at Apollo Hospitals. According to doctors, the medication works well in the first few days once symptoms are detected. “However, people who arrive late for treatment are not exhibiting quick results. In such circumstances, those who have comorbidities are hospitalised,” Dr YK Narayana explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/monoclonal-therapy-a-hit-despite-price/articleshow/88265332.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Lucknow||Yogi: Richness of Sanatan tradition re-established on global platform||Varanasi: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath expressed his gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi rejuvenating Kashi Vishwanath Dham which has re-established the richness of Sanatan traditions on global platform. “By inaugurating the KV Dham project, PM Modi has also mitigated the anguish Mahatma Gandhi expressed after seeing its plight when he visited the place 100 years ago,” he said while speaking at the launch of the project on Monday. “With this inauguration, the Ganga, which is believed to be entangled in Mahadev’s hair, gets released to reunite with Baba Vishwanath and a long wait spanning hundreds of years is over. It’s a moment of delight for everyone from Ganga, to Baba Bhairavnath and to the people of Kashi and all Indians residing in all corners of the world,” he said. The CM said that the PM had given a clean and green Kashi to the people, which had also been a dream of Mahatma Gandhi. “Others used Mahatma Gandhi’s name for political mileage while the PM truly followed his ideals and worked towards realizing his dream. Mahatma Gandhi was pained to see the filth in Kashi during one of his visits 100 years ago, but no party paid any heed, except PM Modi,” he pointed out. Yogi said that Kashi has been witness to several attacks from foreign rulers in the past 1000 years, but people from different parts of the country have come forward to contribute to rejuvenation of its heritage from time to time. “Ahilyabai Holkar rebuilt the temple in the 18th century. Later, Maharaja Ranjit Singh donated huge quantities of gold for its domes. And today, thanks to PM Modi’s initiative, the Kashi Vishwanath Dham stands are completed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reintroduced the world to India’s glorious cultural and spiritual heritage through Yoga, Kumbh and now Kashi Vishwanath Dham and Ayodhya,” Yogi concluded. Earlier, Yogi had attacked SP chief Akhilesh Yadav for his claim that the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project was approved during his tenure. “Would Congress or “buaa” (referring to BSP chief Mayawati) have built the Kashi Vishwanath Dhaam? And, whether “babuaa” (referring to SP chief Akhilesh Yadav) could have sung the songs of Lord Shiva?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-richness-of-sanatan-tradition-re-established-on-global-platform/articleshow/88265292.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

KCR, who left for TN on Monday along with family, visited Ranganatha Swamy temple in Srirangam and arrive at Chennai later in the night. Both KCR and Stalin have maintained good ties for the past few years. The TRS chief met Stalin in 2019 as part of his efforts to bring regional parties’ under one umbrella to form a federal front. KCR had then met Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee too, but the plan didn’t take off. “CM will seek DMK’s support over Centre’s discriminatory paddy procurement policy in southern and northern states as well as on other issues against the Narendra Modi government. He will also discuss his demand for more powers to states in agriculture, education and health sectors,” a senior TRS leader said. The pink party has been vocal against the Centre both in Parliament and outside for the past few weeks on the paddy issue. Earlier, in the last week of October, DMK MPs had handed over to party working president KT Rama Rao a letter from Stalin to KCR seeking support on NEET row. But TRS government did not support abolition of NEET exam. KTR had announced he would visit TN to study organisational structure of DMK, with an eye on replicating it in Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-to-meet-stalin-today-in-bid-to-build-federal-front/articleshow/88264644.cms||Koride Mahesh

Asked about the controversy over construction of the Krishna Janmasthan temple, Swamy said a bill was passed during the PV Narasimha Rao-led Congress government that said,“barring Ram temple and Babri mosque, other religious structures will not be demolished”. “The hearing is still pending in the court.

The governor should not compel the government to do that,” Rajendran told reporters here on Monday. “I am the representative of a party, which has an opinion that the governor post is unwarranted. We have foresight when it comes to the behaviour of governors,” he said. Kanam said Khan had exhibited similar inflexibilities on matters concerning CAA and farm laws, but without yielding a result. “But where did his obstinacy take him to? He first refused to convene the house that was supposed to discuss farm laws. But, later he agreed to convene the session and addressed the house,” Rajendran said. The CPI leader said there was nothing wrong in the governor having an opinion that is different from that of the government. But the problem begins when attempts are made to hog the limelight through the media. “The chief minister was forced to respond to his charges openly when the government failed to keep the correspondence between him and the CM secret. If the governor has some doubts, it will naturally end with an explanation from the government,” he said. Seconding the arguments placed by Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday, Rajendran said all the appointments of vice-chancellors were done as per rules. Search committees are set up as per UGC norms and the governor is supposed to take a decision when the panel recommends names. “Here the governor is speaking ill of a decision he himself had taken,” he added. On Monday, CPI’s mouthpiece Janayugom published an editorial criticizing the governor for lowering the stature of his position. The editorial said the governor failed in substantiating his points against the government on earlier occasions. He also failed in garnering public support, it said. Meanwhile, SFI too has come out in support of the state government. SFI national president VP Sanu said the government should not plead before the governor if he is adamant on relinquishing the chancellor’s post. “If he wants to relinquish the post, let him do it. Let the chief minister take over that post. Who is so particular that only the governor should hold the chancellor position? There is no need to ask him to stay back,” he said, adding that If Khan is not ready to hold the position, let the state assembly explore other possible options.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/dont-force-govts-hand-kanam-tells-khan/articleshow/88264657.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Bareilly||19 cyber criminals of Bareilly village involved Rs 300 crore fraud cases||BAREILLY: This nondescript village near Bareilly city became infamous overnight when police in July 2020 busted a gang of 19 cyber criminals who had siphoned off nearly Rs 300 crore over a period of 3-5 years by convincing people into sharing their bank details. All the accused from Dhantia village used to lure their victims with tempting offers over phone, said police, adding that the gang had links with African scamsters, and is also wanted in cases registered in other states. These men are involved in cyber fraud of over Rs 300 crore in the past five years, claimed a member of the team investigating the case. The cases first came to light in July 2020 when a few men from the village were picked up. A total of 19 accused have been named in the matter, said Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan, adding that 18 of them were arrested and sent to jail. Since it took more than 90 days to file a chargesheet, the accused managed to secure bail and are absconding. “We had initially arrested 14 people and recovered 90 mobile phones, 77 sim cards, 127 ATM cards, 140 bank passbooks, cheque books, five luxury cars and a motorcycle. They had siphoned off money from bank accounts of scores of people -- most of their victims were from Jharkhand. We have registered an FIR against 18 people, including gang leader Jamshed Khan, at Izzatnagar police station under various IPC sections of cheating, along with section 67 of the IT Act on July 23. All 18 accused were sent to jail. A chargesheet was filed against 19 after we found the involvement of one more person in October. Efforts are being made to trace them,” the SSP said. Explaining the gang’s modus operandi, SP (city) Ravindra Kumar said, “The accused used to first call their targets and hack their accounts by gathering bank account details by luring them with offers. The gang also hacked bank accounts of victims through phishing by sharing fake customer service numbers on search engines and through emails.” Dhantia village is barely 12 km away from Bareilly city. Earlier, the villagers were mainly engaged in embroidery and farming but their fortune changed in the past few years. Many families turned rich overnight. Jamshed Khan is the son of a rickshaw puller, and he had come in contact with one, Nigerian, Omoridion Uyi Bright, and received training from the latter’s gang members in Delhi about eight years ago. After returning to his village, Jamshed formed a gang with the support of his five brothers. Soon, he started making good money and gradually inducted more youths into his gang.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/19-cyber-criminals-of-bareilly-village-involved-in-online-frauds-of-rs-300-cr/articleshow/88263083.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Expert committee reports submitted before the court have been seeking compensations running to several crores of rupees. In a recent order issued based on the report of the joint committee appointed by it, NGT has asked the state environmental impact assessment authority (SEIAA) to submit an action taken report against the violating company RDS Project (Pvt) Ltd in Kuttur village of Payyannur taluk. The committee submitted that compensation for environmental damage is Rs 1.58 crore and Rs 15 lakh as penalty for mining 21,170 metric tonnes more than permitted quantity. The company had permission to extract granite building stone from an area of 0.9933 hectare from 2018 to 2021. While it had the necessary permissions, the petition filed in the court alleged that the company had violated environmental clearance conditions by conducting excess mining, causing loss to the exchequer and damage to the environment. The four-member joint committee constituted by the director of mining and geology included senior officers from MoEF, SEIAA, Kannur district geologist and sub-collector of Thalassery. The green court had asked the committee to visit the area and submit a factual as well as action taken report. The committee in its report submitted to the court said that under the specific conditions stipulated for environmental clearance, four are fully violated and nine partially and 10 are not violated. Among the general conditions, 13 are violated, nine are partially violated and 30 are not violated. While the state of Kerala was also named respondent, the court expressed displeasure over the non-response from the government. The case will be heard on January 5, 2022. In yet another case, the expert committee appointed by the green court has found that Naveen Mathew Philip, who has a quarry site at Anicaudu village in Mallappally taluk of Pathanamthitta, has violated the rules. They submitted that the penalty for illegal extraction is Rs 13.42 crore and the total interim environmental damage assessed for illegal mining activity is a whopping Rs 158.99 crore (Rs 158,99,95,103) for damages caused to more than 500 acres in eight years. The green tribunal is also hearing a case against Convenant Stone Pvt Ltd in Manikkal and Thekkada villages of Nedumangad taluk of Thiruvananthapuram district. The joint committee has sought environmental compensation of Rs 38.74 crore while the penalty collected is Rs 6.71 crore. A senior advocate appearing for the government before the NGT said that the green tribunal’s strong stand has led to many quarry owners looking at the environmental laws. “Earlier, they would just look at the mining laws and they weren’t bothered about environmental damages,” the advocate said. Most of the cases are likely to come up early next year for final judgment as notices have been issued for action-taken reports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ngt-begins-action-against-quarries-violating-norms/articleshow/88263926.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Lucknow||AAP preparing to go solo in Uttar Pradesh polls||LUCKNOW: The Aam Aadmi party is preparing to go it alone in UP elections after the reported deadlock in its talk with the Samajwadi Party over seatsharing formula. The chance of a pre-poll alliance between the two parties were rekindled recently after AAP MP Sanjay Singh met SP chief Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow on November 24. However, party sources indicated that talks have gotten stuck on seat sharing and AAP, which has already announced candidates on 150 seats, is expected to issue a second list of about100 names within a week. Party state spokesperson Vaibhav Maheshwari said that the party was now preparing to contest all seats in the state, as had been declared by AAP earlier. “We should be able to release a list of about 100 candidates in about a week and another list soon after. With that, names of at least 350-400 candidates would have been formalized by the end of December,” he said. The likely failure of talks between the two parties came to the fore when party members received messages from senior party members, asking them to prepare for all seats. In November, after his meeting with Yadav, Singh had told TOI that the meeting had been positive and they were hopeful of reaching an understanding over a possible alliance for the 2022 assembly polls in order to defeat BJP. The party has started preparations for fielding candidates on all seats.

Looking at backlanes now, it is difficult to imagine that they were meant to make lives easier, not turn stomachs. Persistent negligence has reduced the back lanes to a labrythine network of garbage, debris and horticultural waste. Area residents have been complaining about the state of affairs. In some sectors, there are dedicated back lanes between rows of houses. The situation turns nightmarish when it rains - transforming the mess into a stinking cesspool full of mosquitoes and pests. While designing City Beautiful, Le Corbusier marked the back lanes as ‘service lanes’ in the master plan. Gates opening into back lanes were provided so that people could buy vegetables and fruits from street vendors without disturbing traffic flow on front roads. That may have happened for some time but not for long. Gradually, the innovative solution for public convenience dissolved into chaos. Residents blame the MC for this while the MC blames residents for dumping waste in the back lanes. The messiest back lanes are the ones in sectors 21, 22, 11 and 19. Shalika Goyal, a resident of Sector 21, said, “Construction debris and other waste has been lying in back lanes for weeks and no one picks it up. We have frequently lodged complaints with the MC but no action has been taken.” Back lanes also have sewerage pipelines passing below as the concept was not to give sewerage pipeline in front of houses. Crawfed chairman Hitesh Puri said, “The concept of service lanes was original but it never picked up as it was not endorsed by residents and did not serve any purpose. We are getting complaints that back lanes in sectors 19, 21 and 22 are in very bad condition. The MC is taking pains to clean them.” MC officials claim that they have been cleaning back lanes on a weekly basis. An MC officer said, “We have recently formed a team of 25 staff members for the purpose. I would urge residents not to throw waste here or we will have to start a challan drive.” Demand to sell back lanes to house owners When it was observed that back lanes were not serving any purpose, many residents and RWAs suggested that part of the back lane be sold to each house owner. However, a deadlock ensued when the UT administration said they would charge current land cost while residents demanded that the original cost of land, when plots were sold, be charged||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/service-lanes-go-out-of-service-as-garbage-piles-up/articleshow/88264654.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

While India has detected 36 cases of Omicron so far, there are forecasts that it may replace Delta as the dominant variant in the months to come.  Leading virologists argue that even as evidence is being collected on the need for boosters, how much they will help and how often they have to be taken — the government must begin preparations to roll it out for the susceptible population. They also believe that complete vaccination should be accelerated using all means. Nationally, a little over 50% of the adult population is fully vaccinated against Covid.  Booster dose makes tremendous sense and the time for the government to “act is now”, Vellore-based virologist Dr T Jacob John told TOI. “Why are we being stingy about a dose of vaccine,” he said. According to him, full vaccination with two doses is a misnomer. “Two shots are for priming the immune system, and that priming effect is likely to wane in six months to a year,” he said, adding a booster will increase the immune response exponentially. There are several countries that have started boosters at least three to four months ago.  Echoing Dr John, eminent virologist Dr Shahid Jameel, also the former head of the advisory group to the Indian SARS-COV-2 Genomics Consortia (Insacog) said that immunocompromised must get boosters on priority. “If they have got two doses, they must get a third dose,” he said recently in a webinar organised by Ashoka University. But, boosting somebody with a third dose of the same vaccine they have been immunised with previously may not do much good, he said. Samples from people who were vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine found it could neutralise omicron about 40 times less than the parental virus, he said, underlining why added protection through booster was needed. Upto 90% of the vaccine rollout in India has been with Covishield. “A third dose of Covishield may not do much good as the background vector immunity will not allow the virus to infect very well and raise the spike immunity,” he said. In his opinion, mRNA vaccines (developed by Moderna and Pfizer), are good booster candidates. India could also consider its indigenously produced DNA vaccines, he said. “ZyCov D can be made available as a booster. Even Covaxin can be used as a booster for people who got Covishield and vice Versa,” said Dr Jameel. He added that two other protein vaccines that have undergone clinical trials in India (by serum Institute of India and Biological E) could also be good options. “Data is sitting with the regulator and they must show urgency in giving approvals to those,” he said.  A national policy on boosters is awaited for weeks now. Experts from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the national Covid taskforce have maintained that their focus is on administering first and second doses.  Dr John cautioned that India had vaccines in hand in January 2020. “But we allowed the second wave as we waited for evidence. Evidence is good in the normal course of life not when the house is on fire,” he said.  Omicron is a variant that is more infectious and transmissible, Dr Jameel said. “It’s reducing vaccine effectiveness, which means there would be more reinfections among vaccinated and previously infected people, but it will continue to protect against hospitalisations and severe disease,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/decide-soon-on-booster-dose-to-beat-omicron-experts/articleshow/88244187.cms||---

They are the ones who fired bullets of karsevaks in Ayodhya,” said UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh. Union minister and BJP’s UP election in charge, Dharmendra Pradhan said in a tweet: “If works are driven by honest thinking then those who are used to cut ribbon get distracted. PM Modi’s gift to Sanatan Civilization, country, and Kashi, has shown immense reverence for him. But Jinnahwadis are giving indecent statements after getting perturbed. Shameful!” UP government spokesperson Sidharthnath Singh said that those who are inspired by Jinnah culture can speak this type of language. Cabinet minister Mahendra Singh said,“On one hand, the entire country is seeing the grand form of Kashi Vishwanath Dham. On the other, who is full of ‘Jinnahwadi’ mentality, is shocked to see all this, which is why he made such an unsavoury statement for PM.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhileshs-comment-reflects-his-aurangzeb-mentality-bjp/articleshow/88265299.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Didn’t give legal opinion to Kerala governor on VC appointment: Advocate general||KOCHI: Advocate general K Gopalakrishna Kurup on Monday said he had not given any legal advice to governor Arif Mohammed Khan on the appointment of Kannur University vice-chancellor. He was speaking to reporters after meeting chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan at Aluva guest house for over 30 minutes. The chief minister had, while addressing the media in Kannur on Sunday, said it is learnt that the governor had got legal opinion from the highest legal authority in the state on the matter. The governor had later clarified that the AG’s legal opinion was not meant for him. Kurup said the governor had not sought any legal advice from him. “Why should the governor seek legal opinion from me? That is not the practice. I am bound to give legal advice to the government,” he said. On the meeting with Vijayan, Kurup said it was a casual meeting and the chief minister didn’t discuss anything about the VC appointment or the governor. “The advocate general meeting the CM is very usual. It was not to discuss any particular topic. There are many issues to be discussed or to be provided with legal advice,” he said. External intervention possible: Kodiyeri Meanwhile, CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan termed the governor’s stand on the VC appointment mysterious and said he should clarify if there was any external intervention. He also said the government wanted the governor to continue as chancellor. “The CM had to speak publicly on the issue because the governor made some public remarks; the government had to clarify its stand. It has facilitated everything conducive for the independent functioning of the governor in the state. Any issue or misunderstanding between the government and governor should be discussed and resolved between them... He said he will not allow political pressure on him; we also expect him to not fall for any political pressure,” he said. Balakrishnan said any recommendation for VC appointment is made by a search committee — comprising university, UGC and government representatives — approved by the governor and not the government. “It was the search committee that recommended a name and that too in total consensus. It was to the search committee that the governor said only one name was enough instead of three. I don’t why the governor changed his stand after he approved the appointment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/didnt-give-legal-opinion-to-guv-on-vc-appointment-ag/articleshow/88264664.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: No cold wave in first two weeks of December in last 11 years; this season may not be any different||NEW DELHI: With the minimum and maximum temperatures well below season’s average on Monday, the weather department expects slight rise in the minimum temperature over next few days due to comparatively warmer component of easterly winds in the region. Weather scientists said the mercury would start falling from Friday. They don’t see cold waves any sooner even as December ends its second weeks and called it “normal”. According to scientists at India Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi has not seen cold wave for the first two weeks of December in the past 11 years. The city has also not seen a single event of cold wave during the winters of 2015 to 2017. “There had been no cold wave so far this season and that is completely normal. The cold-wave conditions, when the mercury begins to fall often, start taking shape after December 20. The records also suggest that no cold wave had been recorded prior to December 20 in the national capital, at least since 2011. So not seeing any cold wave yet is not an extraordinary phenomenon and is quite natural,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. The phenomenon of cold wave occurs during the winter after the temperatures recorded fulfil certain criteria, which differs for plains and hills. For plains, a cold wave is declared when the minimum temperature is both below or equal to 10 degrees Celsius along with the departure lesser than 4.5 degrees of the season’s average. The second criteria, if the first one is not fulfilled, is the minimum temperature less than or equal to four degrees Celsius. According to IMD, between 2011 and 2020, there had been total 24 days when cold wave was recorded in December, of which 2018 recorded eight, 2020 six, 2019 three, 2013 two and 2014 saw one event of cold wave, all after December 15. Meanwhile, the minimum temperature remained below the season’s average on Monday. According to IMD, the minimum and maximum temperatures recorded on Monday were 6.8 — two degrees below the season’s average — and 22.4 degrees Celsius — a degree below the season’s average, respectively. The minimum and maximum temperatures recorded a day earlier was 6.4 degrees Celsius and 23.9 degrees Celsius, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-cold-wave-in-first-two-weeks-of-dec-in-last-11-years-this-season-may-not-be-any-different/articleshow/88264660.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Patriarchal BJP did not check crime against women, says Congress||CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh Congress expressed serious concern on sharp increase in rape cases involving minor victims in Chandigarh in the last two to three years. As per NCRB data, 60% of rape victims in Chandigarh were below 18 years of age in 2019. This increased to 75% in 2020, which is highest in the country. Rajiv Sharma, spokesperson, Chandigarh Territorial Congress Committee said such an increase in crime against women, especially minor girls was a direct consequence of the patriarchal mindset of most saffron party leaders, who get upset on the issue of gender equality. Accusing the saffron of having a casual attitude towards the serious problem, he alleged that the Centre government had diverted nearly 80% funds meant for “Beti Bachao Beti Padhao” programme towards media campaigns and advertising as per the report tabled in the Parliament by the Parliamentary Committee on Empowerment of Women. Promising illumination of dark spots, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Delhi MLA Sanjeev Jha on Monday said that the party would implement the Delhi model in Chandigarh after coming to power. Jha was addressing a public meeting in Dhanas with other AAP leaders. Saying that Delhi residents enjoyed good governance by the Arvind Kejriwal government in Delhi, he urged people to vote for AAP in the upcoming MC polls scheduled to be held on December 24. Meanwhile, AAP co-incharge Pardeep Chhabra inaugurated the office of party candidate Anju Katyal (ward no 32). He said that AAP had fielded people’s favourite candidates on all 35 wards and prioritised “politics of work”. He said that the Aam Aadmi Party had the support from city residents which would translate into a landslide victory in the upcoming MC polls. He also accused the BJP of being notorious for false promises and assured that AAP would fulfill all promises from the first day. AAP’s Chandigarh unit president Prem Garg said that a party victory in the MC elections was a certainty as the party had a huge support base. He said that in view of the development works done in Delhi by the Kejriwal government, people had made up their mind to ensure an AAP victory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/crime-agaist-women-has-gone-up-under-bjp-rule/articleshow/88264662.cms||---

The decision on inclusion of new curriculum in Class 1-8 will be taken by the school education department. The state environment department on Monday signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the school education department and the UNICEF for the introduction of the new curriculum which includes biodiversity conservation, solid waste management and individual and community health, water resources management besides energy, air pollution and climate change. Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray handed over a copy of the Majhi Vasundhara curriculum to school education minister Varsha Gaikwad. In a tweet, Thackeray said, “The curriculum is developed with the help of UNICEF to create awareness about climate change and instil responsibility towards our planet in primary school education. The coursework comprises activity-based lessons that go beyond classroom learning.” The state government conducted a year-long tree plantation campaign and claims to have planted 2.2 million trees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-schools-to-have-new-curriculum-on-environment/articleshow/88265690.cms||---

During the workshop, a core team comprising 30 best brains will deliberate on the need of the happiness curriculum, the content and its implementation in schools before finalising the draft. “The entire curriculum and book that will be developed will focus on five values: respect, trust, affection, care and gratitude. The workshop will emphasise on pedagogy, activities, stories and reflective questions and selfexpression, said Shravan Kumar Shukla, a government school teacher from Gorakhpur, who was the core member of the happiness curriculum in Delhi. Shukla, who is the key resource person for developing the happiness curriculum in UP, got international acclaim in February 2020 when the then US First Lady Melania Trump visited a happiness class in Delhi and spent time with children. In UP, the happiness curriculum is proposed to be implemented as a pilot in 150 schools in 15 districts -- Varanasi, Deoria, Gorakhpur, Siddharthnagar, Prayagraj, Amethi, Ayodhya, Lucknow, Moradabad, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Agra, Mathura, Jhansi and Chitrakoot. Officials associated with the project said like any other subject, students will have a happiness period every day. At times when students can be well-versed in subjects like English, mathematics or history, they also need to lead a happy and peaceful life. This happiness curriculum is just a stepping-stone towards establishing a better, positive and vibrant society with happy individuals, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/soon-happiness-curriculum-to-be-part-of-up-schools/articleshow/88265308.cms||Isha Jain
---||Goa||Referees don’t protect players, my action is a result of frustration: Jorge Ortiz||Panaji: FC Goa winger Jorge Ortiz has apologised for his retaliation against Bengaluru FC midfielder Suresh Singh that led to his sending off but said the frustration at lack of protection from referees has been building inside him for quite a while. Last season, Ortiz was the most fouled player in the Indian Super League (ISL) and the Spaniard said he continues to get more of the same treatment this year too. “Before my explosion in the game (on Saturday), I was fouled seven times within the space of 55 minutes,” Ortiz wrote in his reply to the show cause, issued by the All India Football Federation’s disciplinary committee. “As you will notice, a fair few of the challenges have come into the back, while others have been fouls with no intention to win the ball but rather to stop me with body checks. “Bengaluru FC’s players were clearly targeting and consistently fouling us, and nothing is a better representation of this than the fact that seven yellow cards were handed out to them during the course of the game.” Ortiz is reported to have committed an offence by violating Article 48.1.2 of the AIFF Disciplinary Code. If found guilty for ‘violent conduct’, he could face three matches on the sidelines. The Spanish winger believes it will be unfair to single him out for punishment when, throughout his career in India, he has been at the wrong end of tackles. “The referees in India are aware of my style of play and sometimes there is a need to protect players. I don’t believe I have received enough protection from the referees here and hence my frustration has only grown across the past two seasons as I have been the victim of several hard challenges that have gone unpunished, either in the field of play or any subsequent retrospective action thereafter,” said Ortiz. Early this season, the star winger spent more than three months out with a broken ankle after being ‘tackled’ during the club’s opening game in the Durand Cup. “The challenge drew widespread condemnation, but the player only received a yellow card. No further action was taken against him and I’m led to understand by my club that action against him was requested and the player be brought to the notice of this esteemed committee, but the rules did not permit it. “The only person who suffered from a personal perspective in the entire incident was me, despite being the clear victim. And it is with great sadness that I must admit that it was not the first time,” said Ortiz. Ortiz said he has personally apologised to Suresh for his action. He has also drawn the committee’s attention to a similar retaliation from ATK forward Hugo Boumous against Jamshedpur FC and the “exact same referees who officiated our game felt the player only deserved a yellow card and no more.” Ortiz will miss Goa’s next clash against Hyderabad FC on Saturday and will have to wait for the disciplinary committee’s verdict to see if he has to serve an additional ban.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/referees-dont-protect-players-my-action-is-a-result-of-frustration-jorge-ortiz/articleshow/88286036.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The ED said that the actress had in her disclosure statement claimed that she got in touch with Chandrasekhar after he contacted her by spoofing a call and impersonating himself as an official of the Union Home Ministry. The disclosure statement further alleged that Chandrasekhar was in regular contact with Fernandez from February 2021 till he got arrested on August 7, 2021. “During this period, Sukesh Chandrasekhar had provided various gifts to her and her family members, arranged charter flights for her to fly within India, her hotel stay and made payments in cash to a script writer on behalf of Jacqueline Fernandez. All these expenses/payments were made by Sukesh Chandrasekhar out of the proceeds of crime acquired through criminal activities related to a Scheduled offence,” it claimed. According to her statement recorded by the ED, Chandrasekhar had given a loan of USD 150,000 to her sister in the USA, and had transferred the amount to the tune of Rs 15 lakh into the bank account of her brother in Australia. The chargesheet further stated that the exact quantum of proceeds of crime transferred to Jacqueline Fernandez and which vest with her are under investigation along with those transferred to Shan Muthathil (her makeup artists) and Pinky Irani and the quantification with respect to the same is under progress. It further claimed that during investigation under the money laundering Act, it was revealed that Chandrasekhar gifted a high-end car to actress Nora Fatehi in December 2020. “Investigation proves that Sukesh Chandrasekhar was the mastermind of organised syndicate comprising his wife, Pradeep Ramdanee, B Mohanraj, Kamlesh Kothari, Arun Muthu, Avtar Singh Kochar and other known and unknown individuals who are yet to be identified and who brainwashed, isolated, threatened and extorted more than Rs 215 crore from Aditi Singh. The investigation regarding the amount of extorted money is underway. She was constantly threatened, pressurised, harassed in the name of harm to her and her kids and other family members...,” the ED alleged in the chargesheet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/conman-gave-high-end-gifts-to-actor-and-her-kin-claims-ed-chargesheet/articleshow/88264687.cms||---

Congress coordinator for Chandigarh MC polls Abhishek Dutt, who is also heading its social media campaign, said, “We will throw light on many an issue. Residents told us this was not the Chandigarh they dreamt of. We appeal to the citizens to exercise their voting right to bring back the glory of the City Beautiful.” Through street plays, the Congress workers will make direct contact with the public. “They will tell them that despite the BJP governments at the Centre, the city and the MC, the UT suffers on every front,” he added. Targeting BJP, the party has also launched a social media campaign through posters and videos and will cover issues like increase in water tariff, sewerage cess, no solution to leasehold to freehold property, among others. Chandigarh Territorial Congress Committee president Subhash Chawla sent a letter to the State Election Commission, Chandigarh, expressing concern over non-use of VVPAT in the MC polls. The party also objected to the distribution of EVMs to strongrooms scattered all over the city 13 days before the election day. In the letter, Chawla said denial of use of VVPAT machines and the proposed use of outdated EVMs are causing anxiety among voters. “The Congress demands that latest M-3 type EVMs should be used with inbuilt or separate VVAPTs in the polls and all the EVMs be kept in one central strongroom to guard them properly.” Meanhile, senior Congress leaders from Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana have been made coordinators of 35 wards for MC polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/congress-to-take-the-stage-to-corner-bjp/articleshow/88264669.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

They don’t take my advice. They are in ‘ghamand’ (false pride) that they know everything. The inflation rate has been increasing since 2016, but they don’t know what they have to do,” said Swamy, who was in Barsana for the ‘bhumi pujan’ ceremony of an eye hospital. Asked about the construction of the Krishna Janmasthan temple, which is being seen as a major poll issue for the saffron party ahead of next year’s assembly elections, Swamy said a bill was passed during the PV Narasimha Rao government which said that “barring Ram temple and Babri mosque, other religious structures will not be demolished”. “Hearing is still pending in the court.

Opposition leader V D Satheesan said that all the appointments that have come under criticism should be cancelled and a judicial probe should be ordered. He said that the opposition’s concern is not the tussle between the governor and the chief minister, which has happened earlier as well. “Also, there are middlemen in the Centre to resolve the issues between the governor and the chief minister. But the matter concerning the opposition is that the CPM is continuously intervening in the academic and administrative matters, which has been pointed out by the opposition both inside and outside the assembly several times,” he said. Satheesan said that the appointments in Sree Narayana Guru Open University were made by overlooking UGC rules and guidelines, so is the appointment of the vice-chancellor in Kannur University. In his letter to the chief minister, the governor has agreed to the allegations of the opposition regarding the matter. He should now immediately take steps to rectify his mistake, Satheesan said. He further said that the opposition will not allow the universities to be transformed into the extended departments of the AKG Centre. The UDF will undertake protests against the government’s move and even the governor is not beyond criticism, he said. Former opposition leader Rameesh Chennithala said that after the governor wrote to the chief minister, the higher education sector in the state has come to a standstill. “It is learnt that the governor has not gone through any files that have come to him in his capacity as the chancellor, after he wrote to the chief minister,” Chennithala said. He demanded that Kannur University VC Gopinath Ravindran should immediately relinquish the post, and if he is not stepping down on his own, the governor should immediately oust him. Chennithala said that in the case of Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady, the government should publicize the file regarding the appointment of the VC as the governor and the chief minister has come up with contradicting statements. He further said that higher education minister R Bindu, who illegally intervened in the reappointment of the Kannur University VC, should immediately resign from the post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/guv-should-rectify-mistake-says-oppn/articleshow/88264700.cms||---

Both these villages are located near NH 507 that connects Herbertpur to Barkot. "Before every election, politicians promise to build the road and then forget. This year, our village will choose NOTA," said Sardar Singh, former Pradhan of Kharak village, which is located 2 km away from a motorable road. Similar sentiments were echoed by Rakesh Singh Tomar of Melgarh village. “For the past three decades, we have been appealing and pleading with all political leaders to get our 3 km long road constructed, but to no avail. This year, we are not going to vote for any candidate and will choose NOTA,” Tomar said. “The path from the nearest road to our village is very steep and difficult. In the absence of a proper road the sick have to be carried on a chair or makeshift stretchers and on many occasions people have even died before reaching the hospital,” pointed out Bachan Singh Tomar, another Melgarh resident. Locals said that prior to 2019 Lok Sabha elections the residents of both these villages had publicly announced their decision to boycott the polls. “Government officials then rushed to Kharak and Melgarh and pleaded with us not to boycott the polls and that our roads would be constructed soon. But, after the election no one bothered to approach us,” claimed Surat Singh Rawat, a resident of Kharak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-road-no-vote-residents-of-2-villages-in-dhanaulti-to-vote-for-nota-if-roads-not-laid/articleshow/88263965.cms||Anmol Jain

While one group agreed to suspend the strike after senior officials gave an assurance that they would be given one month’s pay this week and issued an order for releasing dearness allowance, another group maintained they will take a decision only once the salaries are credited to their accounts. Teachers and other municipal staff in A, B & C groups have not been issued salaries for the past three months and pensions for four months now. North DMC mayor Raja Iqbal Singh said they have accepted most of the demands of the corporation employees. “Their main demand was related to notification of dearness allowance. North DMC issued a circular regarding this and action is being taken on other demands as well,” he said. In an order, the civic body stated: “All department heads will ensure that DA @31% is drawn and disbursed in the regular salaries of employees from January onwards. They will also submit an arrear bill of pending DA from July (when DA was increased by the central government from 28% to 31%). These arrears will be released/paid along with salaries on the basis of availability of funds.” AP Khan of Confederation of MCD Employee Unions, an umbrella group of civic body unions, said the strike has been deferred for three weeks. “Civic officials assured us the situation will improve from January as they are expecting funds from Delhi government and other sources to be released. They have issued an order to release the pending DA based on availability of funds. One month’s salaries for teachers and other staff will be issued this week, pension in 15 days and in the future, all Group D staff will get salaries along with sanitation workers,” said Khan. However, Kuldeep Khatri of Shikshak Nyay Manch Nagar Nigam said they will wait for salaries till Tuesday evening and warned of a dharna outside the BJP headquarters if no concrete action is taken this week. “We don’t want empty promises. Only when the salaries are received will we decide the course of action,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpn-teachers-protest-some-call-off-stir-after-assurances/articleshow/88264701.cms||---

Tikait also targeted the BJP-led government for raking up the Kairana exodus issue with the state polls around the corner, saying “it was a government-sponsored plan”. “It (the sit-ins) should be considered as the 13-month training for the farmers during which they emerged stronger. This training will help them in future agitations. At least 25 lakh farmers got trained. This is not the end. The struggle will continue as there are still many pending issues, such as high power tariff rates. Just compare it with Haryana. The same party is running both states, but still, there is so much difference in the treatment of farmers. Today, people from UP have to go to Haryana for work. Let me tell you, Kairana palaayan is sarkaari plan (Kairana exodus is a govt sponsored plan),” said the BKU leader. The Kairana exodus had become a burning issue in the 2017 UP polls after local MP Hukum Singh produced a list of 250 families, claiming that all of them had left Kairana because of the deteriorating law and order situation. The issue was later found mentioned in the BJP manifesto and triggered the BJP government’s policy of “intolerance to crime”. Meanwhile, maintaining an aggressive stance on MSP, Tikait said, “The government has agreed to form a committee for drafting a law on MSP. We have made it amply clear to the government that only pro-farmer people should be there in the draft committee, not the products of the corporate university. If the MSP law is implemented, it will directly benefit the farmers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/kairana-exodus-was-govt-sponsored-plan-rakesh-tikait/articleshow/88263974.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Kolhapur||Fuel-driven boats used to catch fish illegally in Jayakwadi bird sanctuary||Aurangabad: Rampant use of fuel-run boats for fishing has been observed at the Jayakwadi bird sanctuary even though fishing in the sanctuary is banned. These boats, which make loud noises and cause high emissions, are posing threat to biodiversity besides posing survival issues to different migratory and local birds. Honorary wildlife warden of Aurangabad Kishor Pathak accused the forest department of not taking any action against such people involved in fishing using fuel-run boats. “Despite fishing being not allowed in Jayakwadi bird sanctuary, several fishermen venture into the water to catch fish using nets. Now these fishermen, in violation of norms, have started using fuel-run boats to reach every nook and corner of the sanctuary. The presence of these boats is one of the reasons behind the dwindling population of birds at the sanctuary,” he said.  Veteran birdwatcher Dilip Bhagat said there was no proper security to keep a check on illegal practices at the sanctuary. “The official apathy has already taken a heavy toll on Jayakwadi Bird Sanctuary. If such neglect continues, the sanctuary will soon become a heaven for fishermen with no presence of birds,” he said, drawing attention towards other nuisances in the form of illegal wetland farming and grazing in sanctuary areas. According to the experts, illegal fishing takes away food meant for many birds besides disturbing their habitats while wetland farming causes ill effects on the roosting and nesting grounds for birds. When contacted, acting divisional forest officer (wildlife) Amit Mishra said more details on the use of fuel-operated boats at the sanctuary would be sought. “We will take action within the available legal framework,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/fuel-driven-boats-used-to-catch-fish-illegally-in-jayakwadi-bird-sanctuary/articleshow/88263178.cms||Prasad Joshi

"Whenever we go to temples to seek God's blessings, we take some pledge. Today, I appeal to you to make three resolutions: Swachchhta, Srijan and Atm-nirbharta," said Modi while addressing the Kashi Vishwanath Dham's inaugural ceremony at Mandir Chowk. He added, "Cleanliness is a way of life and discipline. No matter how much we have achieved on this front, we will have to continue working on it to take the cleanliness to new levels, especially in the Namami Gange Mission." "A long period of slavery has broken our confidence in such a way that we lost faith in our own creativity. Today, I call upon every countryman to go for innovations with full confidence and do it in an innovative way to promote start-ups," he said. He asked the people to make India 'self-reliant' by keeping in mind, "how we want to see this country when it will complete its 100th years of independence". Modi also asked the people to feel proud about domestic products and go "vocal for local". "India is overcoming the inferiority complex injected into it during the period of slavery by preserving the Dharma and also ensuring development," he said adding, "If Somanth Temple is preserved, we are laying optical fibre in sea. If Kedarnath is being rejuvenated, we are also touching milestones in space science. If a temple is being constructed at Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya, medical colleges are also getting opened in each district. If KVT has taken a grand shape, houses are also being constructed." "In all parts of the country, infrastructure and circuits are being developed with focus on pilgrimage sites," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pm-exhorts-people-to-vow-for-swachhta-srijan-atm-nirbharta/articleshow/88265357.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

India should waste no time in banning this organisation,” Poswal wrote. The Tablighi movement had originated in India a century ago. It was led by Mohammad Ilyas Kandhawi, preaching what was termed a “return to pure Islam.” It acquired a global footprint over the years. In India, the Tablighi Jamaat got into the limelight in March 2020, when a huge congregation was found assembled in Delhi allegedly in contravention of Covid protocols. The Saudi government’s decision was followed by sharp reactions worldwide, including that of Deoband Islamic seminary Darul Uloom, which has asked the Saudis to reconsider their decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bjp-wup-v-p-writes-to-prez-demands-ban-on-tablighi-jamaat-in-india-on-lines-of-saudi-curb/articleshow/88263998.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Myriad warnings ignored||AHMEDABAD: An indiscriminate disposal of city’s sewage and industrial waste into the Sabarmati has been turning the river into a cesspool of dangerous drug-resistant bacteria and toxic heavy metals that have contaminated sediments on the riverbed and harmed aquatic life in the Sabarmati. Several private and government-run institutions since 1997 have published research on this toxic effect and warned citizens as well as policy makers of the disaster that the Sabarmati river is becoming. A simple search on “Sabarmati” and “pollution” among academic journals will yield 2,810 research works of which several research works involve government-funded organisations. TimesViewRiver pollution is a complex issue and involves multiple stakeholders. For effective policies towards control of river pollution one requires varied data or research on the problem, contribution from multiple institutions as well as community members who are directly involved or affected by the problem. Incentives to curb pollution also needs to be put in place. For the past three decades, most government policies have failed to curtail the problem. A multi-pronged approach and transparency in dealing with the issue is the need of the hour.The latest research led by IIT-Gandhinagar involved examination of the riverwater during Covid-19 pandemic, where increased consumption of antibiotics followed by its excretion into our civic systems, had also accelerated formation of drug-resistant bacteria in sewage systems that emptied into the river. What worries scientists is human interaction with the bacteria at the riverfront, slums along lakes, and even wastewater farming downstream. Simply put, between 2018 and 2020, the presence of drug-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) or gut bacteria on two locations along the Sabarmati increased from 22% to 46%, while in one of the sewage treatment plants, the drug-resistant bacteria increased from 10% to 26%. The research was carried out by IIT-Gn, University of Ruhuna, Galle, Sri Lanka, Graphic Era Deemed University, Dehradun, NCERT, New Delhi and Encore Insoltech, Randesan, Gandhinagar. Apart from this, the Physical Research Laboratory in 1999 had warned how pollution in the Sabarmati was leading to contamination of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation-run drinking water French wells. Apart from these a number of research, almost 150, concentrated on heavy metal contamination in Sabarmati riverbed sediment as well as their presence in fish between 2012 and 2017. In 2018, the Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH) had found how farmers using Sabarmati wastewater downstream of Ahmedabad were carrying E.Coli home and contaminating their water storage sources at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/myriad-warnings-ignored/articleshow/88265364.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi govt’s yoga campaign: Sign up in groups of 25||New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday launched a campaign aimed at helping Delhiites practise yoga regularly under the guidance of trained teachers. Under the ‘Dilli Ki Yogshala’ programme, yoga instructors certified by the Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University will conduct free classes for groups of people — each group must have a minimum of 25 members — in their neighbourhood. Residents can register themselves for the yoga sessions on dillikiyogshala.com or give a missed call on a number provided by Delhi government. Launching the website at Delhi Secretariat, Kejriwal said prevention is better than cure. “Yoga ensures a healthy body, mind and soul. The hustle-bustle of today’s day and age has made our lives extremely stressful. Yoga can go a long way to help people deal with everyday hassles in a healthier manner,” he added. The CM pointed out that most people do not actively practise yoga for two reasons — either they don’t have anyone to teach them or the classes are very expensive and unaffordable. “Dilli Ki Yogshala will provide classes and teachers free of cost. All you need to do is get together a group of 25 people willing to learn yoga, identify an open space near your house, like a park or a community hall and then give us a missed call on 9013585858. The Delhi government will assign a teacher to you. I believe people will enthusiastically take part in large numbers,” he said. It was the success of the happiness curriculum in government schools that motivated the AAP government to launch the yoga programme, the CM said. “When we launched the happiness curriculum, we did not foresee the extent of transformation we would witness in our students. Every single school carries out happiness classes for 45 minutes every morning in which students are taught meditation. Parents have told us their children have become more peaceful, that they have seen a change. I believe once we start the yoga classes, everyone who participates will move towards a peaceful life and see a significant improvement in their health,” Kejriwal said. The classes will begin in January, the chief minister said. “We are ready with a team of 400 yoga teachers who are available to teach groups. At our current teaching capacity, at least 20,000 people in Delhi will be able to practise yoga,” Kejriwal said. Adding that he hoped the concept will be adopted by other states as well, the CM said, “I hope yoga will reach each and every household in the country through this programme. I believe that a group of 25 friends and family will ensure accountability and mutual pressure to show up.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govts-yoga-campaign-sign-up-in-groups-of-25/articleshow/88264716.cms||AlokKNMishra

The tiger killed another goat on Sunday night following which the forest department intensified efforts to capture it by setting up one more cage trap on Monday, taking the total number of cages deployed to five. With the latest cattle kill, the tiger has killed 13 domestic animals. Most domestic animals killed by the tiger are goats and calves. According to North Wayanad forest division DFO Ramesh Bishnoi, the department currently has set up five cages in the area along with 35 camera traps to track the animal. “We have deployed all our resources, including around 80 staff, for tracking the animal. But the issue we are facing is that as opposed to expected tiger behavior, in which the animal normally comes back in search of the cattle carcass, this tiger is not returning to the site of the cattle kill. We have now put live animals as bait in the cages,” he said. The district administration has declared prohibitory orders under section 144 of CrPC in the area. The forest authorities have also been planning to capture the animal by tranquilizing it, but the tiger have been straying into human habitations from the nearby forests only during night time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/cattle-lifting-tiger-remains-elusive/articleshow/88264729.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He was in the city on Monday to address the students of Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology as part of the induction programme for the first-year engineering students. He said the technical education and teaching were playing a changing role in pedagogy and the students should utilize the opportunities for holistic development. Asking the students not to imitate others, he said they had to select what they want to become in future and use all the available opportunities to get exposure and experience. “Students from humble backgrounds shouldn’t think about what they don’t have, as that would arrest their growth. One could become a successful person at any time. You have to proceed to the next level in life confidentially by making reasons very clear,” the Colonel said. He urged the students to be responsible to the society. “The beauty of life does not depend on how happy you are, but on how happy others can be because of you.” He shared his experience in 1994, when he was an officer with the Indian Army and took the responsibility to take care of 8,200 soldiers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/edu-can-longer-be-pursued-in-isolation-aicte-official/articleshow/88264717.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Their samples, too, have been sent to Delhi for whole genome sequencing. The 20-year-old Italy returnee was retested on Sunday and the report came negative. As per the protocol, if the sample is negative after 11 days of RT-PCR test, the patient is home quarantined. But he is still in the hospital as five of his family have contracted the virus. “The patient is still asymptomatic. But he is under institutional quarantine,” said the UT director, health services, Dr Suman Singh. While five of his seven contacts had tested positive, one was negative and the report of another is awaited. The returnee was fully-vaccinated with Pfizer and had landed in India on November 22. His first RT-PCR test was negative for Covid. After eight days of quarantine, his sample tested positive. The report received on Saturday night confirmed him to be the first case of the new strain here. The public health experts feel that though it is not certain how virulent the new strain is, its transmission is many times higher than the delta variant. “We have been seeing breakthrough infections even with the delta variant. So, vaccination cannot stop the infection totally in any of the strains,” said an expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/samples-of-ve-kin-sent-for-genome-sequencing/articleshow/88264708.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Ahmedabad||Variant of concert: Saptak live, adjusted to corona tune||AHMEDABAD: Tanpuras being tuned till their sound acquires the glow of carefully tended marigolds. A music legend instructing sound technicians and then joking with the audience about the difficulty of these negotiations. And rasikas discussing how the legend’s raga exposition at an earlier edition still haunts their memory like first love. For Saptak regulars, moments like these — which play out even before a concert begins — form the alaap of a monumental musical experience. This year, Covid had forced Saptak online. Technology could transmit great renditions but the monument was miniaturized into a gadget. But in 2022, India’s longest classical music festival will welcome live audiences again. Tabla notable Aneesh Pradhan told TOI: “Though performers do not necessarily tailor their live concerts to suit the perceived demands of audiences, there is no doubt that the immediate response that listeners convey in a live concert context inspires musicians.” Sandeep Joshi, the Saptak secretary, said: “We assiduously studied government guidelines and are monitoring the unfolding situation.” He said that 400 people will be allowed in per day, as stipulated by government regulations. “We encourage those above 65 to watch the live stream,” Joshi said. “As for seating arrangements, social distancing protocols will be strictly followed. Sanitizers will be available.” The organizers will soon announce other details, including the full list of artists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/variant-of-concert-saptak-live-adjusted-to-corona-tune/articleshow/88265360.cms||Kannan Somasundaram
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Aggregator cabs policy awaits nod of cabinet, HC told||Mumbai: The state government told Bombay HCon Monday that it has framed a policy to regulate taxi aggregators on the basis of the Centre’s 2020 guidelines. However, the policy is awaiting cabinet nod. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Makarand Karnik was told by state’s advocate Hiten Venegavkar at a PIL by advocate Savina Crasto in which she cited her travel woes in Uber cabs. She gave two instances of 2020, including when she had to book Uber cabs thrice for her journey one evening. She was dropped off mid-way at a “shady” place. Besides inflated fares and cancellation charges, the entire trip was traumatic. She tried to write to Uber, but its app had no option to lodge complaints. Uber’s reply refuted her allegation, saying it has a grievance redress system with 24x7 helpline. As it objected to her personal grievance in PIL, Crasto said she may seek separate legal recourse. About the PIL, she said Uber’s reply is an “all-is-well situation”. She argued that its customers have to select from issues listed on the app and cannot file complaints beyond what is listed. “What is more disturbing is x there are so many grievances even on social media. Why the need to keep their system so opaque?’’ she said. “State has framed a fresh policy which is pending cabinet approval,” said Venegavkar. The next hearing is on next Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-aggregator-cabs-policy-awaits-nod-of-cabinet-hc-told/articleshow/88265721.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Delhi||Delhi: Singhu, Ghazipur borders to reopen for traffic in phases||NEW DELHI: In what would bring immediate relief to lakhs of commuters, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is likely to allow traffic at the Singhu border in a “regulated” manner in the next 2-3 days, but may take another two weeks to fully restore normalcy in vehicular movement on the stretch occupied by farmer protesters for a year until recently. At Ghazipur border too, traffic may be allowed on the barricaded expressway portion of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway in the next couple of days. Since the farmers are yet to vacate the NH-9 lanes, it will take some more days for NHAI to restore the impacted carriageways. “We will carry out minor repairs and maintenance quickly so that traffic can be allowed at the Singhu border. That will enable us to resume traffic movement in the next 2-3 days. However, we may have to regulate traffic to avoid problems,” said an NHAI official. “The highway portions that require major repair will be ready in 10-15 days.” Another official supervising the Delhi-Meerut Expressway project said that on Tuesday a team would visit the sites vacated by the protesters. “Preliminary observations did not show up any big damage to the carriageways. We may allow traffic on the barricaded lanes in the next couple of days after site inspection. The NH9 lanes will take more time to become functional,” the official added. On Monday, the cops began removing the cemented barricades and the spikes hammered into the road at Singhu to deter incoming vehicles during the protest. A crane was employed to remove the huge cement barricades positioned across the roads. The length of the road, around 100 metres of the border, looked not only damaged but also littered with garbage, and some sweepers had been employed to clean the area. Delhi Police officers told TOI that all the obstructions on the Delhi side of the border would be cleared by Tuesday. “We don’t have any problem opening the road for motorists, but there are huge potholes that can cause accidents,” a police officer said. The inner Singhu village road also needs repair as it bore the load of traffic when the highway was shut down for a year. The cops said they would wait for NHAI to estimate how much time it would need to complete the restoration of the highway segment and accordingly plan the resumption of traffic there. At the Singhu border petrol pump on Monday, TOI saw the employees gearing up to resume business. Shopkeepers who had closed down their stores were also present, getting repairs carried out on their premises. Rajkumar, who has a wholesale inverters and batteries business, said he only came infrequently to clean his shop after the protest-forced closure. “My wholesale business losses have run into crores of rupees,” Rajkumar grumbled. “Now that the protestors have gone back home, I have come to inspect my shop and see if I need to have repairs and cleaning done. The police officers are removing the barricades and I guess the road will be cleaned then. All of us are hoping that by Wednesday, some vehicular movement will be possible on this road. We didn’t have any problems with the farmers who had their reasons to protest. We are happy that they have returned having seen success.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/barricades-going-but-obstacles-stay/articleshow/88264752.cms||Dipak K Dash

As per the data available with the KSEB dam safety wing, the water level on Monday was 2400.42 ft and it was 2,391.84 ft on the same day last year. A dam safety official said that the extra storage would be capable of generating 225mu of additional power. “It’s a healthy storage during the summer season when the state has to purchase power at high prices from outside. It will also help to maintain the peak-time demand,” said a KSEB dam safety official. “In November, the generation in Moolamattom power plant was at the maximum level and it helped reduce the water level on heavy rainfall days. Now the water level is in safe position and the power generation has been changed to moderate level,” he said. Meanwhile, the water level in Mullaperiyar dam has been almost steady in the past five days. TN kept the water level at the upper rule level of 142ft. The number 3 shutter continued to remain open at 10cm while the tunnel discharge was reduced to 700 cusecs. On Sunday at 9pm, TN raised the V3 shutter to 30cm and again limited to 10cm on Monday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/idukki-dam-storage-at-over-10ft-extra/articleshow/88264753.cms||---

A bench of Justice L Nageswara Rao and Justice B R Gavai said the issue in the petition could be better decided by the HC, which would be aware of the ground situation in the state. It allowed the party to withdraw the petition to approach the HC. In a related development, Calcutta HC, which was hearing two PILs related to the civic polls, is likely to deliver its judgement on Tuesday. A bench of Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj indicated this to a lawyer who had sought permission to make written submissions on the issue. Senior advocate Maninder Singh said the SC had agreed to intervene in Tripura municipal polls and passed directions to ensure free-and-fair elections. Singh pleaded a similar order be passed in BJP’s plea also as party candidates were getting threats and being pressured to withdraw their candidature. He said no FIR had been lodged on complaints by BJP candidates. But the bench said the SC should not be the first forum to decide these issues. “We do not have the wherewithal to know the ground situation there and the law-and-order problem in civic polls. The HC is better suited to decide. Once we start entertaining these, there would be no end,” the bench said. The apex court had last month entertained a petition filed by the Trinamool on Tripura local body election as the HC was on vacation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sc-refuses-to-take-up-bjp-plea-for-central-forces-in-kmc-polls/articleshow/88264751.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC grants bail to convict to pay son’s fee||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Monday granted bail for a week to a life convict so that he can pay remaining fees for his son in a private school, obtain his school leaving certificate and secure the child’s admission in a government school. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, more than five lakh students in Gujarat have quit private schools and have been shifted to government schools. In this case, Mitesh Kathiyawadi is serving life imprisonment in a murder case in Surat. His 12-year-old son is studying in a private school in Bhavnagar, the Global Gyan GURU English School. While on temporary bail in October this year, he had paid Rs 7,700 towards his son’s fees for class 6. Kathiyawadi’s wife wanted to shift the child to a government school, but found difficulty in obtaining the school leaving certificate. The school asked for Rs 12,000 more towards remaining fees and refused to issue the leaving certificate without full payment of the fees. The woman approached the high court through advocate Imtiyaz Kureshi for temporary bail of her husband so that he could arrange for the money. It was the applicant’s case that the family cannot afford to pay fee to private school and the child needs to be shifted to a government school. The bench headed by Justice A J Desai posed some queries regarding payment of fees and issuance of the leaving certificate for the child. But when the lawyer submitted that the child is to be admitted in the government school, the judges immediately granted bail to Kathiyawadi for a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-grants-bail-to-convict-to-pay-sons-fee/articleshow/88265377.cms||---
---||Meerut||TET exam paper leak Absconding teacher surrenders in Shamli court||Meerut: A teacher accused in the UP Teachers’ Eligibility Test (UPTET-2021) examination paper leak, Nirdosh Chaudhary, surrendered in a Shamli court on Monday. Since the exam was cancelled on November 28, more than 30 suspects have been arrested across Uttar Pradesh in this regard. Chaudhary’s name had cropped up when an accused from Aligarh’s Hajiapur Tappal area, Gaurav Malaan, 28, was arrested on November 30. He had revealed that a Kasganj-based primary school teacher, Nirdosh Chaudhary, had provided his gang the question paper for Rs 5 lakh. The latter had been on the run since then. “Chaudhary is an important link in the chain of events and had been the supplier of the papers to gangs based in Shamli and Baghpat,” said Brijesh Singh, CO, STF, who is leading the investigation in the case. Meanwhile, it is learnt that the STF has got crucial information of the involvement of one Vikas Kumar, 50, a resident of Elam village in Kandhla town of Shamli. He is a cheating mafioso and has been involved in the trade for the last two decades. “He was arrested by CBI in 2012 for his involvement in an examination cheating case and was out on bail. At present, Kumar is also on the run,” said Brijesh Singh. The UP government had earlier suspended the secretary of the state's Exam Regulatory Authority, Sanjay Kumar Upadhyay. The TET exam was not held last year due to prevailing Covid restrictions and hence, 21,65,181 candidates were set to appear for the exam in the entire state in two shifts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/tet-exam-paper-leak-absconding-teacher-surrenders-in-shamli-court/articleshow/88264048.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Aurangabad||‘Give 5% Muslim quota, will not contest polls’||Aurangabad: City MP and state chief of AIMIM Imtiaz Jaleel on Monday said that his party would not contest the upcoming polls to the local self-governing bodies in Maharashtra if the MVA government in the state gives 5% reservation to Muslims. “Every time we raise our voice for the quota for Muslims, the ruling party leaders say it is a poll gimmick. To prove our point, it is our open challenge to the government that we will not contest in any upcoming local poll in Maharashtra if it gives reservation to Muslims,” he told reporters here. Two days after taking out the Tiranga rally and holding a demonstration in Mumbai, the state unit of AIMIM on Monday demanded that a special bill be brought into the winter session of the state legislature for Muslim quota. “The ruling three-party alliance has comfortable majority to pass such bill. Since all these parties, including the Shiv Sena, claim to be secular, there should not be any hesitation in giving reservation to Muslims,” Jaleel said. Stating that the demand for Muslim reservation was not sub-judice like some other quotas, he said the state government should take necessary steps at the earliest. “In the past, the MVA leaders had suggested that Muslims should take to the streets if their demand for reservation is not met. The Tiranga rally is just the beginning. We will intensify the agitation in the days to come if the state government fails to table a bill in support of Muslim reservation,” Jaleel said. The AIMIM, in a memorandum submitted to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, has also demanded the strengthening of the Wakf Board to protect its properties spread across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/give-5-muslim-quota-will-not-contest-polls/articleshow/88263210.cms||---
---||Patna||Nitish Kumar flays his deputy’s claim, pitches for special status to Bihar||PATNA: While pitching strongly for special category status to Bihar, CM Nitish Kumar on Monday virtually expressed displeasure with deputy CM Renu Devi, who is from the alliance partner BJP. “The deputy CM (Renu Devi) has no knowledge about what the demand is and what it means for the state. We can explain the things involved only if she comes to us to know about it,” Nitish told the mediapersons after the janata darbar when they drew his attention to the Renu’s statements on the matter. Renu, on Saturday, had gone on record, saying the special status sought for did not have justification, as the Centre has been giving more assistance to the state, including with regard to the construction of national highway roads and bridges. “What is Niti Aayog? Niti stands for National Institute for Transforming India. Can you transform India without transforming Bihar?” Nitish asked and said: “Seeking special category status is in the interest of Bihar.” Nitish, taking a cue from the Niti Aayog report with regard to Bihar, also said: “It is clear from the Niti Aayog report that Bihar needs more money and fund for its development. With the special status, the state government will have to spend less money as its share in the centrally sponsored schemes. I will keep placing the demand strongly.” Incidentally, in the last four months, Niti Aayog in its reports issued since September has rated Bihar poorly on the parameters of development defined by it. Last month, the Niti Aayog had put Bihar at the bottom among all other states in sustainable development goals (SDG) targets aimed at improving the standard of living of households. By that token, the Niti Aayog has scratched the Nitish government the wrong way, as the latter had prided itself on having brought the state’s GSDP growth rate to double figures, besides bringing about multifold increase in the state’s per capita income and also writing the Bihar turnaround story since 2005, including in roads, power, construction, health and education sectors. Accordingly, planning and development minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav on Saturday sent a letter to the Niti Aayog, asking it to have a relook at its parameters for assessment and demanded establishment of PSUs in Bihar to create job and work opportunities. He also reiterated the 10-year-old demand for special category status to Bihar to get more central assistance. With regard to the likely third wave of the Coronavirus and the Omicron cases in the state, Nitish said the government has been making all the required arrangements, including with regard to the treatment. “As to the Omicron cases, nothing can be said with certainty, since testing is being done outside Bihar and it takes long time to get the report. The danger of Omicron variant is from travellers who come from outside,” Nitish said. “There are the central guidelines and testing is being done at the airport. No Omicron case has been reported till now, but we are alert, since the number of Covid cases has been rising for the last few days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-flays-his-deputys-claim-pitches-for-special-status-to-bihar/articleshow/88264754.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Industrial waste eroding STPs’ parts||Ahmedabad: For more than a decade, the AMC’s anaerobic sewage treatment plants (STPs) that receive industrial waste from Narol, Odhav, Naroda, and Vatva have been facing a peculiar problem. The mechanical parts of the plants have been corroding and needed replacements in seven years; their lifespan is supposed to be12 years. Moreover, the highly acidic industrial waste is also eliminating a number of microorganisms that are required to degrade organic contaminants in raw sewage. A senior AMC official in engineering department said that it takes 25 to 30 days for the microorganisms to rejuvenate. “Anaerobic treatment is a biological process in which microorganisms degrade organic contaminants in the absence of oxygen,” the official said. “These microorganisms lower the biological oxygen demand (BOD), the chemical oxygen demand (COD), and the total suspended solids (TSS) in sewage. This microorganism balance is getting disturbed.” The official added that the AMC has to invest Rs 1 crore for treating 1 million litres of sewage and owing to the industrial waste most mechanical parts of the STPs require replacements earlier than usual. Meanwhile, the AMC had said that since October 20 it had disconnected 342 drainage lines that carried untreated industrial waste illegally. Thirteen connections had been snapped over the past week. Most of these illegal connections were located in Sardarnagar, Danilimda, Behrampura, and Nikol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/industrial-waste-eroding-stps-parts/articleshow/88265392.cms||---

According to an official source, 56-year-old Peter, a resident of Thirumarai Nagar at Podanur, and 48-year-old Chellammal, a resident of Rangasamuthiram near Pichanur, were nabbed by a team led by Madukkarai taluk supply officer P Ramesh Kumar and special revenue inspector S Sasikumar while doing rounds near Valukkal check post. The team, the source said, was patrolling Velanthavalam, Valukkal and Kumittipathi areas since Sunday late night to check for any incidence of ration rice smuggling. “When the officials spotted the auto with gunny bags in it, they signalled the vehicle to stop. However, Peter, who was at the wheel, sped away. The team stopped the auto after a brief chase at Valukkal check post around 3am on Monday. They checked the vehicle and found 25 bags containing a total of 700kg rice that was meant for the public distribution system (PDS),” the source said. The team subsequently secured both Peter and Chellammal and handed them over to the cops. The officials also seized the auto with the PDS rice. “The two were later handed over to the civil supplies CID police for further investigation,” the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/two-held-for-trying-to-smuggle-700kg-ration-rice-to-kerala/articleshow/88264756.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In their petition, owners of the de-addiction centres have conveyed that it isn't feasible for them to comply with all the SOP guidelines. After hearing the petition, the single bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Tiwari put a stay on the implementation of the SOP and asked Dehradun DM to submit his response in the matter within six weeks. The SOPs, issued on November 13 in the wake of an increasing number of crimes surfacing from de-addiction centres, laid down the following norms -- registration and renewal of all drug de-addiction centres in the district will be done under the Clinical Establishment Act and Mental Health Care Act of 2017; the centres will have to pay Rs 50,000 for their registration and Rs 25,000 for yearly renewal of the facility; after registration, a team constituted by the CMO will inspect the centre; facilities with 20-to-25 beds should at least have a 60 square feet area; all basic facilities should be available; 20% of the beds should be kept reserved for the patients rescued by district legal services authority, district administration and police; not more than Rs 10,000 can be charged from a patient; every facility should have a counselor, medical staff, yoga trainer and security guard and those with more than 20 inmates should also have a physician, gynecologist and psychiatrist; inmates shall be examined every month by a psychiatrist posted in the district hospital; mandatory to submit the audio-video report of the centre in the concerned police station in the month. The petitioners say it is not possible for them to pay Rs 50,000 for registration when they aren't allowed to charge more than Rs 10,000 from a patient. They add that the centres come under social welfare and thus, should be given some relaxation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/doon-based-de-addiction-centres-move-court-against-sops/articleshow/88263220.cms||---
---||Dehradun||NGT allows construction of Delhi-Doon e-way; 11k trees to be axed for road||Dehradun: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Monday gave a go-ahead to the construction of the Delhi-Dehradun expressway, which is expected to reduce travel time between the two cities to under three hours from the 5-6 hours it takes currently. With the tribunal’s nod to the project, around 11,000 trees are set to be axed on a 19-km-long stretch of the expressway from Ganeshpur to Asharodi (NH-72A). "We find it difficult to hold that there is no application of mind by the ministry of environment, forest, and climate change (MoEF&CC) in granting forest cell clearance," said the order passed by a bench headed by NGT chairperson, Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel. The petitioners, Doon-based NGO ‘Citizens for Green Doon’ had approached the Supreme Court earlier this year to avoid the tree felling. The apex court had referred the matter to NGT. The petitioners contended that being almost 210-km-long, the project should have undergone a mandatory environmental impact assessment (EIA), which it didn't. However, the tribunal ruled that it "wasn't required." "Overall road connectivity cannot be taken to be one project for the purpose," the bench stated. The tribunal said that the Delhi-Dehradun highway is an important highway that connects Delhi, Haryana and Western UP to Dehradun and higher reaches of Himalayas and hence, “the capacity augmentation of this highway is not only important for connecting the state capital of Uttarakhand with national capital, but is also vital for strategic defence purposes for timely and seamless movement of Army/ warheads to higher reaches of Himalayas.” The order stressed on the need to ensure that mitigation measures are effectively implemented and monitored on-ground by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The NGT set up a 12-member committee comprising government officials from organisations such as the Central Pollution Control Board, Wildlife Institute of India, and the Forest Research Institute (FRI) to be headed by the chief secretary of Uttarakhand. The committee would ensure no damage is caused to the environment by unscientific muck dumping or obstruction of animal corridors, the green body said, adding that the committee should meet within the next two weeks and thereafter once a month. Since most of the trees being felled are Sal and date back to colonial times, the NGT also ordered the NHAI to deposit Rs 1 crore with the FRI for research on Sal regeneration, in collaboration with the forest departments of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and “any other institution as may be found necessary." After the tribunal’s ruling, the petitioners, Citizens for Green Doon, said they were unhappy with the order and the formation of a committee which did not have an independent expert or environmentalist. General secretary of the NGO, Himanshu Arora, told TOI, " The committee only has representatives of the government who are responsible for the project in the first place. Despite two rounds of litigation, there has been no expert consideration of the issues raised."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ngt-allows-construction-of-delhi-doon-e-way-11k-trees-to-be-axed-for-road/articleshow/88263218.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Kozhikode||For them its fishing & learning too||Kozhikode: While many schools in Wayanad are trying hard to curb dropouts among tribal students, Muthanga GLP School has overcome the same by literally hooking its students to classes by making fishing in the nearby Muthanga River a part of the curriculum. The school, whose student strength is mostly made up of tribal students, came up with this project after finding that its students were dropping out as they were preoccupied with fishing and spending time on the river, which is very much a part of the tribal way of life. The dropout prevention project aptly named, Choonda (Malayalam for fishing hook) was selected by SCERT as one of the best practices in schools. As part of the project, kids are taken on fishing field trips under the supervision of teachers as part of academic activities and lessons are often taught around the theme. The school, located inside the forests, has seen its student strength increase from 56 in 2019 to 76 this year on the back of the excitement created by Choonda project. “When we went to tribal hamlets to know the reasons why students were skipping classes and dropping out, we found that the parents went to forests to collect minor forest produce to earn livelihood and students were more interested in the tribal way of life. They were fishing, plucking arecanut and coffee and this led to dropouts. We decided to use their favourite activities into the curriculum and prepare an activity calendar focusing on such activities to achieve learning outcomes across subjects,” said Abhilash Babu, faculty at district institute of education and training, Wayanad, who has overseen the project. He said the project has helped students relate better to the academic activities. “For instance, students were asked to write songs about fishes, recipes of tribal fish dishes, names of aquatic species they saw in the river. This has got them excited about coming to school and led to better learning outcomes. Once we even served a dish made of fish caught by students,” said headmistress Sainaba Chenakkal. When students were asked to bring wooden fishing rods made to school, they were of varied length and it was used to drive home the concepts of measurement. She added that plans are afoot to restart such activities this academic year once water in the river recedes. Also, the school is planning to expand the scope of activities by including gathering of forest produce and catching crabs from the nearby paddy fields this academic year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/for-them-its-fishing-learning-too/articleshow/88264761.cms||---

Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami and other senior politicians, including ex-CMs Trivendra Singh Rawat and Harish Rawat, cabinet ministers and state Congress chief Ganesh Godiyal, rushed to Kapoor’s Dehradun residence to pay their tributes. Kapoor’s body was taken to the party office on Balbir Road and, thereafter, the final rites were performed at Lakkhibagh crematorium with full state honour. The MLA's son Amit told reporters that his father, 75, had an open heart surgery around six years ago. He had complained of heaviness in chest area, and after attending a wedding on Sunday evening, he did not wake up in the morning, added Amit. Speaker of Uttarakhand assembly from 2007 to 2012, Kapoor held ministerial posts in both Uttar Pradesh and the hill state. Before the creation of Uttarakhand, Kapoor had already served four terms as an MLA in the UP assembly. He continued his winning streak and won four more times once Uttarakhand was formed. His first win in assembly elections came in 1989 and his lone defeat was in 1985. Kapoor's political career graph spanned four decades. He was minister of state for rural development and labour from July 11, 1991, to December 6, 1992, in UP. He also served as the minister of state for urban development from 2001 to 2002 in Uttarakhand. Recently, he attended the three-day winter session of the assembly, which started on December 9. Born on January 7, 1946, Kapoor was known for his simplicity. He was closely connected with the people of his constituency and despite his age, he preferred riding a scooter to reach out to the people. Condoling his death in a series of tweets, CM Dhami wrote: "I have received the sad news of the demise of my senior colleague and former Speaker of the Vidhan Sabha, respected Shri Harbans Kapoor Ji this morning. Soft-spoken Mr Kapoor always lived life with simplicity." Former CM Harish Rawat said, “He was an easily approachable politician.

It has been cited that the changes could have been incorporated within the master plan, since the plan covers the areas originally included under the Kovalam-Vizhinjam area development scheme. Further, a confusion seems to have arisen regarding the categorization of areas under the scheme in terms of coastal regulation zone (CRZ). The proposed set of variations are being pitched by considering the area under CRZ-2. However, the special committee members counter this saying that the areas come under CRZ-3. The town planning department has reportedly told the meeting that relaxations in height and coverage need to be made in Kovalam-Vizhinjam area development scheme and this was proposed citing recent applications for tourism projects. A member of the committee said that introducing variations in a plan for standalone projects do not make sense when the entire changes can be proposed in the master plan for the city. The committee has asked for a detailed note on the recommendations regarding variations. This will be circulated among the councillors before the matter will be presented in the council meeting. The coverage, height restrictions, plot size have been modified as per the new set of variations. The town planning department has also proposed taking away all the architectural controls prevalent in 2010 regulations. While the coverage for buildings under the public and semi-public use was limited to 40% and height below nine metres as per the old plan, the height and coverage will be determined as per the building rules in force, the proposal says. Multiplex complexes have been added to the zoning regulations under ‘uses restricted by chief town planner’. As for buildings under tourism development, the coverage was limited to 30% and the height of the building was below nine metres. This provision has been taken off and proposed variation says that coverage and height restrictions in the 2010 regulations have been modified and it will be governed by Kerala municipality building rules. New relaxations have also been proposed for residential buildings. Residential buildings up to 300 sq m and commercial buildings up to 150 sq m are permitted in both the zones as per compliance with the Paddy and Wetland Act of the state, the proposal says. Architectural controls like control of building height, need to use local, indigenous construction materials, conditions regarding exterior colour, colour continuity have also been taken off in the proposed set of variations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/panel-cites-lack-of-clarity-in-new-set-of-plan-variations/articleshow/88264066.cms||Aswin J Kumar

DCW took cognisance of the objectionable comprehension passage in which the writer claimed that indiscipline and disobedience in children have increased due to increase in freedom and equality among women. The commission has termed the passage to be “infuriating, sexist and offensive against women and children”. Seeing the severity of the matter, DCW has asked CBSE to provide details related to the writer and the people responsible for getting such a patriarchal and regressive article published in the examination paper. The women’s panel has also asked CBSE to provide reasons as to why this passage, which propagates gender discrimination, was chosen and whether it was scrutinised by experts or not. CBSE has been given 72 hours by the panel for providing a detailed action report in this regard. The commission said it was evident from the passage that “the writer is a woman hater and his understanding of women issues and feminism is totally perverted.” Expressing her anger over the controversial passage, DCW chief Swati Maliwal said, “It is unacceptable that CBSE decided to publish this twisted passage in its examination paper for not only such articles attack the independent identity of women and propagate anti-feminism and gender stereotypes but also have a negative impact over the progressive thinking of students, who indeed are the future of the nation. I have given 72 hours to CBSE for taking action against all people responsible and for providing details of the same to the commission.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dcw-notice-to-cbse-over-passage-on-women/articleshow/88264764.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In their bail application, the Pants have alleged that no employee of Max Corporate Services was present either during the Covid-19 tests or at the time of data entry. They added that all testing and data entry work was done under the supervision of local health department officials and asked why everyone kept silent during the Kumbh Mela if things were being done illegally. After hearing the application, the single bench of Justice RC Khulbe issued notice to the state government. Earlier, the STF probe had revealed that Max Corporate Services, which is not approved by the ICMR, had signed an MoU with Nalwa Labs and Dr Lalchandani Labs to become eligible as one of the agencies for conducting Covid-19 tests during the Kumbh. Last month, Mallika and Sharat Pant, owners of Max Corporate Services were arrested in the case. Before this, the chief medical officer of Haridwar, in its police complaint, had said that more than 1 lakh fake Covid-19 tests had been conducted during Kumbh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/owners-of-max-corporate-accused-in-kumbh-scam-apply-for-bail-court-asks-ukhand-to-respond-by-dec-24/articleshow/88263236.cms||---

Since the district shares border with Kerala, the department has asked poultry owners to report the death of birds in their farms. They have also been asked to keep the farm premises clean. The current outbreak was reported from Kuttanad in Alappuzha district in Kerala, where scores of ducks and chicken were infected. While the animal husbandry department officials in Kerala are taking a series of initiatives to contain the bird flu spread, their counterparts in Tamil Nadu have asked poultry farms in the district to keep a close watch on the birds and report unnatural sickness or death. Vehicles carrying poultry products from Kerala are also screened on the inter-state border, before allowing them to enter the district. There are about 1,250 poultry farms of various sizes in the district. Veterinarians with the government veterinary hospitals would visit the farms periodically. Dr Perumalsamy, joint director of animal husbandry department, Coimbatore, said, “There is no incidence of bird flu anywhere in the state so far. If there is an outbreak, it will take six months for it to subside. So, we are taking all precautionary measures to prevent the bird flu outbreak in the state.” The officer said migratory birds were also being watched. Poultry farm owners are also on an alert. They have started spraying disinfectants on all the vehicles entering their farms, while asking the workers to maintain cleanliness. They have instructed the workers to dip their feet in disinfectant before entering the farms and wear gloves to handle the chicks. Animal husbandry officials, however, said the public need not panic and there was no harm in consuming chicken. “Since there is no bird flu incidence in the state, the public need not worry,” said one of the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dist-steps-up-vigil-to-keep-bird-flu-at-bay/articleshow/88264763.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In a statement, JNU said, “The members of the PhD selection committee who conduct the viva voce are not provided the information regarding the categories of the candidates to eliminate bias and prejudice. Observers belonging to the reserved categories are appointed to ensure that no discrimination is done to the candidates.” The administration added that all students from the SC/ST and PwD categories, who qualify in the JNU entrance examination (JNUEE), are called for the viva voce irrespective of the number of seats available, unlike what is done for other categories. “Students from other categories who qualify JNUEE for PhD admissions are called in a particular ratio depending upon the number of seats available. This reflects the concern and commitment of the university to the cause of the students from the marginalised categories in providing an opportunity to every qualified SC/ST/PwD candidate,” the statement read. Meanwhile, JNU Students’ Union and other students’ organisations demanded that the admission branch immediately notify a grievance redressal committee pertaining to the issue. The union also demanded that the weightage of the viva voce be reduced to 15% from the existing 30%. JNUSU also demanded that the administration release the list of selected candidates for the PhD viva voce for the current academic year, along with their respective categories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-discrimination-in-phd-viva-voce-says-jnu/articleshow/88264769.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Biomining waste: NMC pays more than other cities||Nagpur: Despite being aware of low rates fixed by government agencies in other cities, the cash-strapped Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) awarded contract for biomining 10 lakh metric tonne (MT) garbage at a high rate to Zigma Global Environ Solutions Pvt Ltd. Moreover, the civic body was not aware that Zigma itself is working at a low rate in other cities. TOI on December 10 had reported that how the NMC had violated norms by issuing expression of interest (EoI) without approval of standing committee and budgetary provisions. The NMC had incurred financial loss of Rs23 crore in the work which was awarded to Zigma at the rate of Rs1,015 per MT in 2018-19. Total cost comes to Rs101.5 crore. The NMC’s special purpose vehicle for developing Smart City Project — Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) had floated a tender for biomining 6 lakh MT garbage at Bhandewadi dumping yard. Zigma bagged the contract at Rs788 per MT a couple of months ago. MLC and BJP city president Pravin Datke had raised the issue in NMC general body following which mayor Dayashankar Tiwari asked the administration to reply in the next meeting. TOI has a copy of standing committee’s approval given on May 10, 2018, to issue work order to Zigma from NMC. The note tabled by NMC Pench Project Cell before the committee mentioned that a three-member committee collected rates of contracts awarded by other government agencies for biomining garbage. As per the note, the rate is Rs842 per MT for 2.5 lakh MT at Vijaywada, Rs887 per MT for 3 lakh MT at Vadodara. The two contracts are with Zigma. At Tirupati, the rate is Rs953 per MT for 2.7 lakh MT while in Ghaziabad it is Rs1,240 per MT for 5 lakh MT. As per information available from director of Zigma, Nagesh Prabhu, his company bagged second work at Vadodara at the rate of Rs842 per MT. Justifying higher rate in the first contract and lower in the second one for the city, Prabhu said, “The low rate in the second contract is feasible for the company as the machineries are already in place at the site. The work management will be same while customers too are there for products obtained through biomining,” he said. Corporator Sanjay Mahakalkar said, “It is very clear from note put up before standing committee that the NMC was aware of low rates in other cities. Inquiry should be done as to why contract was given at higher rate. Cost increases if quantum is less. NMC gave contract for 10 lakh MT while the quantum is very less in other cities,” he said. NMC officials said detailed explanation has been submitted to the general body. “We also submitted Zigma’s explanation. The company has already completed biomining 6 lakh MT. We cannot comment more as matter pending with general body,” they said. In a nutshell * NMC issued EoI for biomining 10 lakh MT garbage at Bhandewadi yard without approval of standing committee and without budgetary provisions * Note from three-member committee tabled before standing committee mentioned government agencies in other cities gave contract at lower rates * Zigma doing same work at low rates in two other cities, said the note * NMC allotted work for 10 lakh MT to Zigma at cost of Rs1,015 per MT in 2018-19 * Smart City SPV issued tender for biomining 6 lakh MT waste at Bhandewadi * Company got work at cost of Rs788 per MT a couple of months ago * Rates of almost all components have increased in last two years * Difference between two contracts of NMC is Rs 23 crore * Rates go down in case of high quantity * NMC issued contract for 10 lakh MT while in other cities it is less than 5 lakh MT||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/biomining-waste-nmc-pays-more-than-other-cities/articleshow/88264765.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Woman hands over gun found on road to cops, lands son in trouble||COIMBATORE: When 70-year-old Vijayalakshmi, a resident of Annur, handed over a country-made pistol and a pair of gloves that she found abandoned on roadside near Shanthi theatre at Mahalingapuram to the local police on Monday, she had no idea that would land her son in trouble. The Mahalingapuram police have picked up her son, who is a history-sheeter, for interrogation, as they suspect the gun belongs to him. An investigation officer said the pistol did not have live rounds and that they had formed a special team to probe the case. The officer said Vijayalakshmi was staying with her daughter at Mahalingapuram near Pollachi for the past one week. “When she went out for a walk on Monday, she stumbled upon the pistol and gloves on the roadside. She immediately grabbed them and handed them over to us.” Vijayalakshmi, however, gave contradictory statements to police and furnished false details about her son. “She didn’t tell us the real name of her son. We, however, traced him and picked him up for inquiry. He is facing more than five robbery and theft cases. While he has admitted that he was involved in a few crimes, he told us that he was never in possession of the pistol,” the officer said. The Mahalingapuram police have registered a case under Section 102 (power of police officer to seize certain property) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and sent the gloves to the forensic science laboratory for testing. “The pistol will be sent to the armoury for further investigation,” the officer said. He said the special team was collecting CCTV footages from Shanthi theatre premises and nearby commercial establishments to identify the person who abandoned the weapon there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/woman-hands-over-gun-found-on-road-to-cops-lands-son-in-trouble/articleshow/88264766.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covid-19: Relief after UK flyer tests negative for Omicron, Kolkata waits for second report||KOLKATA: The teenager who was kept in hospital isolation as a suspected Omicron patient has tested negative to the variant. The genome sequencing report says the girl has contracted the Delta-plus variant. The UK returnee is expected to get discharged from the hospital on Tuesday. Tests results of another suspect is expected later this week. “We have received the report of the international traveller from the UK. The detected variant is Delta Plus (AY.4.), which is also prevalent in the state. Omicron has not been detected in the sample collected from her,” said director of health services Ajay Chakraborty. This was the first case of Omicron suspect in Bengal. With the girl, a resident of Alipore, testing negative to the highly infectious variant, health officials have heaved a sigh of relief. The sample was sequenced at the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBMG) at Kalyani. Though AMRI Hospital, Dhakuria, where the girl is admitted, had been verbally communicated about the genome sequencing test results by health officials in the afternoon, the hospital got the official communication in the evening. Till late in the evening, the hospital was yet to take a call on her discharge. “The girl had been almost asymptomatic from the first day. She is doing fine. We have been told she is not positive to Omicron. So our doctors will take a call by Tuesday on when to discharge her, keeping in mind all other Covid-19 protocols,” said AMRI Hospitals group CEO Rupak Barua. The 18-year-old flyer, a student, had arrived in Kolkata from the UK via Doha, on Friday. She had been kept in institutional quarantine after she tested Covid-19 on arrival. Her samples were sent to NIBMG on that day itself. The negative report came on Monday. Delta plus is a sub-lineage of the Delta variant that triggered the massive second wave in the country. Health officials said that Delta-plus variant is much in circulation in Bengal as elsewhere in the county and was not of a major concern. “Since this variant is a lineage as that of Delta with one of two mutations, the manifestation will be the same. The fact that this patient is double vaccinated could be the reason for not getting severe disease,” said microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri. Meanwhile, the specimen taken from the 76-year-old Duttapukur resident, the second Omicron suspect, was sent to the Kalyani institute on Monday via the School of Tropical Medicine. He is under treatment at Infectious Diseases & Beliaghata General (ID&BG) Hospital. “The patient is stable and his blood pressure is under control. For better understanding, we have also sent his swab sample to NICED to determine whether he is still positive to Covid-19 or otherwise,” said pulmonologist Kausik Ganguly, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at ID&BG Hospital. He is asymptomatic and is fully vaccinated. Sources said the genome sequencing at NIBMG is likely to take four to five days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/relief-after-uk-flyer-tests-ve-for-omicron-city-waits-for-2nd-report/articleshow/88264067.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Coimbatore||TNAU to conduct re-exam from Dec 22||Coimbatore: The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) would conduct re-examination for the students, who were declared failed in the recent online arrear exam, on December 22. This time, the exam would be conducted offline with a reduced fee. TNAU had failed 48% of the students, who had appeared in the online arrear exam in July, earlier this month. The students had subsequently taken out protests, stating there were flaws in conducting the exam. On Sunday, Dr A S Krishnamoorthy, registrar and acting vice-chancellor of TNAU, had convened a special meeting with the deans of constituent colleges and principals of affiliated private colleges to sort out the issues. TNAU had not conducted arrear exams in the academic years 2018-19 and 2019-20 for the graduate students of constituent colleges who had appeared for the exams in 2017 and before that. K Soorianathasundaram, controller of examinations, TNAU, said, “At least 2,453 students had appeared for the arrear exams in July this year and about 48% of them was declared failed for indulging in malpractices.” Based on the Sunday’s discussion, he said, it was unanimously decided to conduct the special re-exam in Coimbatore from December 22. “Arrangements will be made to correct the answer papers and announce the results at the earliest to help the students, who aspire for higher studies and placements.” The examination fee has been, meanwhile, reduced to Rs 200 from Rs 500 per subject based on the students’ demand. “Boarding and lodging facilities for the outstation students will be made on the university campus. The deans and principals have been asked to ensure distribution of study materials to the students and organize special coaching classes,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tnau-to-conduct-re-exam-from-dec-22/articleshow/88264770.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Aurangabad||Unvaccinated, those skipping second dose to pay Rs 500 fine in Aurangabad||AURANGABAD: Citizens who have not taken their first dose of the Covid vaccine or who skipped the date for the second dose will have to pay a fine of Rs 500 from December 16. The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Monday made a formal announcement to this effect and said that those who do not pay up will face legal action. Legal experts, however, have questioned the basis for the proposed action by highlighting that Covid vaccination is voluntary. “The Nagarik Mitra Pathak — special civic squads that have already been formed in Aurangabad — will be involved in the crackdown on defaulters. Half of the money recovered will go the city police and the remaining to the local civic body,” AMC administrator Astik Kumar Pandey said. The civic administration has warned that those not paying the fine will face action under section 188 of the IPC (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) along with provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005 “The civic body chief is the competent authority (for taking policy decision related to vaccination) as per the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005. Cent per cent vaccination is essential in Aurangabad to tide over the possible third wave of Covid-19,” Pandey said. Despite a slew of measures taken by authorities including invoking vaccination-linked curbs, as many as 4,88,010 target beneficiaries from Aurangabad district were yet to take their first vaccine dose by Sunday. Unvaccinated citizens account for nearly 22% of the target population. On the other hand, the percentage of fully vaccinated beneficiaries is still low at 33% in Aurangabad district with over 14.56 lakh citizens yet to take the second dose. City advocate Chaitanya Dharurkar said the AMC should first spread more awareness about vaccination by roping in local celebrities, among other measures. “The civic body needs to be conscious that a change of heart is more important than any dictatorial or autocratic measure of imposing fines for not taking the vaccine,” he said. Earlier, the Covid district task force, in its meeting held on Monday morning, announced that college-going students from Aurangabad district who are still not vaccinated will have to undergo an RT-PCR test each week whereas students who are partly vaccinated will have to undergo such screening on a fortnightly basis. Among other measures, the task force has recommended sealing of shops where vaccination of the workforce is still not complete and action against government staffers for dereliction of duty, if any. “Cent per cent vaccination is essential in Aurangabad district when the Omicron strain of Covid-19 has already reached Maharashtra. Amid fears over the highly transmissible nature of the new strain, vaccination can offer protection to certain extent,” Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/unvaccinated-those-skipping-2nd-dose-to-pay-rs-500-fine-in-aurangabad/articleshow/88263312.cms||---

Maharashtra has 0.64 million beneficiaries followed by Tamil Nadu with 0.53 million, Gujarat with 0.44 million, 0.31 million in Karnataka and 0.27 million in Uttar Pradesh. The high number of beneficiaries is because Maharashtra is the most urbanised and industrialised state in the country. The state is the automobile manufacturing hub of the country and also a leader in agro and food processing industry. The state has around 47.78 lakh medium, small and micro enterprises. Of these, 47.6 lakh are micro enterprises and 17,000 are small enterprises according to the MSME ministry’s annual report for the financial year 2020-21. The total employment among the state’s small businesses is around 90.77 lakh. The total beneficiaries under the scheme are approximately four million spread across 0.11 million establishments and the total benefits granted as on December 4, 2021 is Rs 2612 crore, Teli said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/atmanirbhar-bharat-state-has-maximum-beneficiaries-in-mumbai/articleshow/88265748.cms||---

This was the message of British cyclist and cancer survivor Luke Grenfell-Shaw, who, at 26, has embarked on a cycle ride from Bristol to Beijing to raise funds for cancer charities. Addressing the gathering during an interactive session at the Advanced Paediatric Center, PGIMER, the Westburyon-Trym resident said, “Receiving a cancer diagnosis can feel like a death sentence. I’m doing this ride to show that it’s possible to live your dreams, even with cancer. The ailment does not have a barrier. But you’ve got to create your own opportunities, no one else will do that for you.” He added, “This expedition would be seriously challenging even for someone without cancer, however I want to show that despite a cancer diagnosis, you can set your own horizons; that you need not be labelled and limited by it, rather it’s your dreams that determine your achievements.” Organized by Prof Amita Trehan of the Advanced Paediatric Center, PGIMER to motivate others battling with the ailment, the session was attended by equally inspiring survivors from PGIMER, including 10-year-old Sukhnaaz, who is being treated for Leukaemia; Dev, a Class X student pursuing cyber security and a survivor of Leukaemia and Ashutosh, a student of Pharmacy from Panjab University as well as a cancer survivor. Recalling the days which brought him face to face with the emperor of maladies, Shaw said, “While teaching English in Siberia in 2018, I noticed an ache in my shoulder. At first, I presumed it was a pulled muscle, but later it was diagnosed as stage IV sarcoma (a rare cancer which had spread from his shoulder blade to his lungs) at the age of 24.” The group of resilient survivors gave the message of hope in troubled times. All of 10, Sukhnaaz captivated the audience with her singing and her fluency with the English language, replete with the ability to juggle accents. The takeaway was that life is worth living for those who want to live.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cancer-survivor-cycles-from-uk-to-china-says-live-your-dreams/articleshow/88264776.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Few takers for poll-special vaccination drive; most already jabbed in Kolkata, say KMC officials||KOLKATA: On Monday, just a handful turned up at the special Covid vaccination camps that the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) had set up for citizens across the city keeping in mind the ensuing civic polls. Acting on a Swasthya Bhawan directive, KMC officials had on Sunday asked borough executive health officers to ramp up the inoculation drive for a week. Accordingly, KMC medical officers took care to ensure that no citizens returned without getting a jab. However, at the end of the day, more than half the vaccine vials allotted for the day had to be returned unused as there were no takers. Health officials believe a large section of Kolkata's adult population has already received both the doses. Some of the vaccination clinics downed shutters by 2pm on Monday. At the KMC Layelka vaccination clinic, the drive was called off for the day at 1.30pm since there was no recipient. The clinic had barely recorded 30 second doses by noon. According to a KMC health department official in charge of the Tollygunge-Jadavpur belt, around 10 vaccination clinics in the region were recording just 40 recipients on an average per day for the past two weeks. “The scene was quite different till a month ago when we had to refuse citizens for want of vaccines,” he said. At a KMC-run vaccination clinic in Garia, the inoculation figure was above average after a group of health workers could successfully woo some reluctant second-dose recipients from the neighbourhood. The clinic recorded 70 doses by the end of the day. KMC coordinator from Bhowanipore, Ashim Bose, had decided to knock a few doors of the neighbourhood on Monday morning where some members of the family were marked absent as recipients of either first or second dose. “Even after persuading a section of the reluctant recipients, the figure didn’t exceed 80 from the mega centre at Bhawanipore Education Society,” said Bose. This mega centre had been administering 500 doses daily during the peak of the second wave. According to municipal commissioner Binod Kumar, the reason for such low attendance was 100% first-dose vaccination coverage. “Thousands had come to Kolkata to get their jabs from the neighbouring districts. Now they are getting their jabs in their home towns. This has created a fall in demand at our clinics,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/few-takers-for-poll-special-vax-drive-most-already-jabbed-in-city-say-kmc-officials/articleshow/88264108.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: 38-year-old man beaten to death by ex-employee||COIMBATORE: A powerloom worker was murdered by his former employer over a previous enmity near Sedapalayam bus stop in Tirupur district on Sunday. Police have arrested the murderer and remanded him in judicial custody. The deceased was identified as M Balasubramanian, 47, from Sedapalayam village near Palladam. He was a bachelor. Police said Balasubramanian was working in a powerloom unit run by Sundaramurthy, 38, of the same area, eight years ago. Balasubramanian instigated other workers, mostly from other states, to leave the unit and find work somewhere else. This had led to a quarrel between Sundaramurthy and Balasubramanian eight years ago, ending in the latter assaulting the owner. Sundaramurthy had lodged a complaint with the Palladam police regarding the matter. Subsequently, Sundaramurthy closed the powerloom unit after facing huge losses. He bought a goods autorickshaw and was supplying LPG gas cylinders in the locality. On Sunday morning, drunk Sundaramurthy found Balasubramanian at the Sedapalayam bus stop and started a wordy quarrel. Suddenly, in a fit of rage, Sundaramurthy assaulted Balasubramanian with a wooden log. Balasubramanian suffered head injuries and was taken to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, where he received 10 sutures on the forehead. Based on a complaint from Balasubramanian’s elder sister Parameswari, the Palladam police registered an attempt to murder case and arrested Sundaramurthy on Sunday evening. He was produced before a judicial magistrate and later lodged at the Tirupur district jail under judicial custody. Meanwhile, Balasubramanian died without responding to the treatment around 11.30pm on Sunday and the police altered the case to Section 302 of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-38-beats-ex-employee-to-death-held/articleshow/88264801.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi riots case: Prosecutor misses hearing for 10 months, court slaps Rs 3,000 fine||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has imposed a fine of Rs 3,000 on the state after the Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) did not appear in a northeast Delhi riots case for more than 10 months. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Arun Kumar Garg said perusal of the file showed that the SPP, representing the police, in the case has not appeared even once since the date of filing of the chargesheet on January 30, 2021. The observations came after a request for adjournment was made on behalf of the police for arguments on charge on the ground that the SPP was not available. The court directed Delhi Police commissioner to conduct an inquiry for fixing the responsibility for imposition of the cost and order deduction of the same from the salary of the person responsible. “Request for adjournment is allowed subject to the cost of Rs 3,000 to be deposited by the state in the court on the next date of hearing. This court is not oblivious of the fact that the burden of the aforesaid cost shall fall on the public exchequer and hence, I deem it appropriate to direct Commissioner of Police, Delhi to conduct an inquiry for fixing the responsibility for imposition of the cost and to order deduction of the same from the salary of the person responsible,” the judge said in an order on December 10. The court further directed the DCP (northeast) and the commissioner to ensure the presence of the public prosecutor in the matter. On December 9, a sessions court had taken a strong note of the absence of the SPPs and said this was the state of affairs with regards to the riots cases, which are very sensitive in nature. The court had also said that this was leading to delay in disposal of the matters. It had directed the DCP to take this aspect seriously and appoint new SPPs to represent the state in riots matters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/prosecutor-misses-hearing-for-10-months-court-slaps-rs-3k-fine/articleshow/88264809.cms||Usha Das

On the basis of the alleged incident, Sethi’s father, B. Sethi, has lodged a complaint with the office of the SSP in Dehradun. “My son has been beaten and abused by the coach. I had informed about this incident to the CAU secretary and he ignored it. Later, my son was called alone in a room by coach, video analyst and manager where he was given death threats. As a parent, I am very worried since he is travelling with the team across the country with these people. Only time will tell what personal animosity they have with my son. As of now, I have given a written complaint to the SSP (Dehradun) and CAU’s office bearers,” alleged the cricketer's father. Speaking on the matter, CAU vice-president Sanjay Rawat said, “This is a matter of grave concern. We will conduct a strict inquiry to address this issue. Our players are the most important asset for us.” Notably, Arya Sethi has made his List A debut for Uttarakhand in the 2018-19 season.

---||Kolkata||CBSE marks promise after outrage over Eng question||Kolkata: There was a sense of relief in city schools affiliated to the CBSE on Monday as the board scrapped a comprehension question that was asked in the English language and literature paper of Class X in the ongoing Term I board exam. The board has retracted the question and, in a public announcement, has said that the question was not in accordance with the guidelines of the board. All candidates who had attempted the question would be given full marks for it. City schools congratulated the board for this step and the refrain was that CBSE had the courage to face mistakes, take responsibility for errors and then take corrective measures. The English exam took place on Saturday and the controversy sparked off immediately thereafter. Women teachers across the city started writing about the “unacceptable” question in their WhatsApp groups. Some schools raised it with the co-ordinators and some even alerted the regional office in Bhubaneswar. Schools said the tenor of the question was unacceptable, especially because modern India is about the rights of women and how children should start appreciating and respecting these from a young age. “I am so happy that CBSE has set an example by scrapping the question. Society is trying very hard to deal with the last dregs of patriarchy to give women the dignity they deserve. Education of every child starts with the mother at home and her dignity at home is of prime importance,” said Meena Kak, director of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. Sushila Birla School principal Koeli Dey added: “ In an age when women have forged ahead and empowerment is every woman's birthright, it was a little disappointing to come across a passage like this in a board examination.” BDMI principal Vijaya Chowdhury echoed: “The incident has made many realise that the citizens have become more aware of the current scenario and rightly educated to raise their voices against the socially constrained norms.” Educationist Amal Mukhopadhyay and sociologist Prashanta Ray were upset that such a question was asked of tender minds. “I smell a rat here. This was orchestrated by an external political force that perhaps believes in fundamentalism. Article 14 of the Constitution is a clarion call towards equality as a fundamental right. Obviously, the question goes against our Constitution,” said Mukhopadhyay. Ray, on the other hand, stressed that such controversial questions have started popping up in public examinations. “Is a greater force that controls the boards trying to plant these questions in an effort to see whether they get absorbed by the education world or whether they run into protests? This is deliberate,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbse-marks-promise-after-outrage-over-eng-question/articleshow/88264125.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The slabs will be decided on the basis of the fee charged and number of students in a school. The primary aim is to provide education at the lowest cost possible. According to education minister Arvind Pandey, the decision is based on the proposed guidelines of the State Schools Standard Authority (SSSA), the establishment of which is suggested in the National Education Policy, 2020. The SSSA will not only have the right to fix the salary slabs for teachers but also have the right to regulate the fee schools charge from students. It will enable education department to fix the minimum student-teacher ratio in private schools. At present, the ratio of 30 students to one teacher is recommended by the education department. The SSSA will also empower the education officers to inspect private schools.At present, they do not much authority over private schools.

TOI on August 9 reported how this club was creating trouble. The station is part of the 5km Ruby-Kavi Subhas stretch that is veering towards a mid-2022 commissioning. RVNL, chasing deadline, is trying to complete construction and related works along the 5km viaduct and the five Metro stations dotting it. Just when it had overcome a roadblock at the same site in front of Passport Seva Kendra (PSK), where one of the four entry-exit points of Hemanta Mukherjee station is supposed to come up, came a fresh hurdle in the form of two single-storey structures. One a political party backed union office and a local club room. Weeks before that, 29 touts who help people with passport forms, had agreed to clear the site after RVNL set up makeshift shacks across the road. The agency had just got everything ready for CESC to divert its cable network to make way for construction of the two entrances. At a meeting on June 15, KMDA, custodian of EM Bypass through which 10km of the 32km New Garia-Airport Metro runs, instructed CESC to make way for the two station entry points and shift its cables along a 3m dedicated corridor on extreme end the eastern carriageway. To create the cable corridor, the club and union room needed to be razed. RVNL approached KMDA and other state government agencie and finally, the structures were dismantled last week. A senior RVNL official said, “CESC can now shift the cables. Subsequently, we shall start construction of the entrance on that side of Hemanta Mukherjee Metro station.” A TMC leader and member, Golpark Shabhya Brinda said, “We are aware that the project was conceived by our chief minister Mamata Banerjee when she was railway minister. That is why we sat down with RVNL and other agencies, so the structures could be pulled down at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/club-razed-to-make-way-for-bypass-metro/articleshow/88264128.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The initiative was taken by the DIG Jhansi range, Joginder Kumar, who, along with other officials, took a ride till Mahila Thana in her auto after the felicitation ceremony. During the ceremony, Anita was handed over with a memento by the DIG, while socialite Neeti Shastri gave a brief of the struggling life of Anita and her journey to become the first woman auto-driver of the city, from a housewife. Anita broke down during the ceremony and answered all the questions from the media persons in a heavy voice, though boldly and frankly. Mother of three, Anita had to start working after her husband, an odd job worker stopped working few years ago. While staying at Talpura, she worked in various factories where she used to go on foot. During covid pandemic, she also lost her job and was clueless about her future. Luck favoured and her brother-in- law taught her how to drive an auto rickshaw. She finally bought an auto in March this year through bank finance after getting her driving licence. “It was a tough decision, but I had no other choice. I learnt driving in three days for which I used to go to highway early in the morning. I have to face regular challenges as I am into a male dominated job. But this does not deters me,” said Anita. She told TOI that she feels more confident now after getting such a warm appreciation from the police. As per her, she usually drives between 4-10am in morning to avoid unruly behaviour of her fellow drivers in the day time. On the other hand, talking to TOI, DIG Joginder Kumar said, “Anita is a true example of woman empowerment. With today’s program, we have not only encouraged her, but also appeal to all those sisters who want to come forward and want to engage in any kind of job, that police is with them for any kind of assistance round the clock. We also want to make it clear to the anti-social elements not to create any kind of hurdles for them or else they will face strict consequences.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/jhansi-police-applauds-the-first-woman-auto-rickshaw-driver-of-the-city/articleshow/88264137.cms||---

An enquiry has been ordered by the district immunisation officer on Monday after the matter came to light. As per the details, the recipient, a 67-year-old woman, had received her first dose in April 2021 and almost after a week she had died. Her son was shocked when on December 9 he received a message on his mobile phone, through which his mother was registered for Covid vaccination, to have received the second dose of her Covid vaccine successfully.

An awareness campaign on driving safely through fog is also being disseminated. On the directions of police commissioner Saurabh Singh, the traffic wing of Panchkula police has started installing reflective tapes on small and big commercial vehicles, especially tractor-trolleys as visibility is reduced on national highways when fog descends.

---||Allahabad||HC seks Govt rely on PIL seekingfast-track courts for police excesses||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Monday directed the Uttar Pradesh government to file reply in response to a PIL seeking the establishment of fast-track police courts in Uttar Pradesh in the wake of the alleged custodial death of 22-year-old Altaf at a Kasganj police station in the state. The PIL suggested that the fast-track courts should adjudicate upon FIRs, complaints and petitions filed against police officers in cases of custodial torture, death, rape and other such offences. It also called for the enforcement of various guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in such matters. Hearing a PIL file by People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), a division bench comprising Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Piyush Agrawal passed the above order. According to the petitioner, one Altaf was called for questioning by the Uttar Pradesh Police and later found dead at the Kotwali in Kasganj district on November 9, 2021. In the petition, the PUCL said that the death of Altaf and other such persons in suspicious circumstances in police custody is viewed by any person of ordinary prudence as an institutional killing. The PIL requested the court to direct the central as well as the state governments to install CCTV cameras in all police stations and other such police offices of CBI, NIA, etc., across the state of Uttar Pradesh as has already been directed by the apex court. It also sought a direction to duly equip the police officers with body-worn cameras and requisite technology for videography during investigations. With regard to Altaf’s case, PUCL requested the court to direct the setting up of a high-powered committee, headed by a sitting or retired judge of Allahabad High Court, to enquire into this case. Besides, it requested that the said committee be comprised of all relevant stakeholders and a panel of experts, to work out and provide for the appropriate, recommendations, mechanisms, modalities and guidelines to fill the gaping legal lacunae, as regards prosecution and punishment of police officers accused guilty of custodial torture/deaths/rapes. In addition, the PIL also requested the court to direct the director general of police (DGP), UP, district magistrate (DM), Kasganj and superintendent of police (SP), Kasganj to ensure full police protection to the bereaved family of Altaf.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-seks-govt-rely-on-pil-seekingfast-track-courts-for-police-excesses/articleshow/88264145.cms||---

The statement was made to a bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal on a petition by Ranaut to quash the November 23 FIR under section 295A of IPC by the Khar police on a complaint by a Sikh body that she had hurt the religious feelings of the community with her November 21 post on Instagram. Her advocate argued that to invoke the charge under section 295A, the offensive comment must be made with deliberate and malicious intent of hurting a particular person or a community’s religious feelings. She said the actor had no such intention. After perusing Ranaut’s post, the judges questioned where the deliberate and malicious intent was. “It has to be the sole and dominant object to hurt religious beliefs,” said Justice Jamdar. The judges asked the state if it intends to arrest Ranaut. Chief public prosecutor Aruna Pai said the Khar police had issued Ranaut a notice to appear for questioning but she did not respond to it. “She is not cooperating,’’ she added. Ranaut’s advocate said her client fears that she would be arrested. At this, the judges sought a categorical statement whether the Khar police intend to arrest Ranaut. The judges said there is another angle to the matter. “Freedom of speech should not be affected, that would have a chilling effect… There is also the larger question of protection of freedom of speech here. Unless the police make a statement of not arresting her (Ranaut), we’ll have to grant some relief,’’ said Justice Jamdar. Ranaut’s advocate said she will appear before the Khar police on December 22. Pai also said “the police will not arrest her until the next date of hearing”. The judges posted the hearing on January 25, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-coercive-action-will-be-taken-against-actor-kangana-till-jan-25-police-tell-hc/articleshow/88265756.cms||---

The bison had charged at villagers after it was chased out of Bhuyewadi village on Saturday night. One youth was killed in the incident. The forest department is now looking for the bison in the Peth Vadgaon, Giroli hill and Sadale-Madale village area. Around 40 foresters and members of wildlife rescue teams are scouting for the bison. Foreste department officials said that the bison would be initially tranquilised and then shifted to its natural habitat. Santosh Valwekar, veterinary doctor with forest department, said, “We have got the order to tranquilise the bison but the decision about it would be taken after observing the health condition of the animal. The animal should not be dehydrated, not should it be tired or injured.” He added that before tranquilising, they would also need to ensure that human interference in the surroundings is minimum. “Even after getting tranquilised, the animal can travel for another 10 minutes and the chances of the animal getting aggressive remain high in this period. We have to act fast in this time.” Range forest officer Ramesh Kamble said, “Yesterday, around 90 staffers and today, 40 staffers carried out the search operation in the Peth Vadgaon, Sadale-Madale, Giroli region. One bison was spotted in Peth Vadgaon region on Monday morning and accordingly, our teams searched the entire farms in the area and found pugmark. The animal was not spotted. Our few foresters are deployed at various locations in the region and the search will continue in night time as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/six-teams-still-looking-for-bison-in-kolhapur-animal-to-be-tranquilised-on-being-spotted/articleshow/88263327.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

In a reply to Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda’s query, the ministry said the detailed project reports (DPRs) after the feasibility study has been received from the NCR Transport Corporation (NCRTC) for Delhi-Gurugram-SNB corridor in December, 2018 and for SNB Urban Complex to Sotanala in June, 2020. The DPR of Delhi-Panipat corridor has also been received from NCRTC in June 2020. Sources said the ministry is likely to put the proposals before the Cabinet before going ahead with the tendering process. The ministry said the NCR Planning Board had prepared a ‘Functional Plan on Transport for National Capital Region (NCR)-2032’ which recommended eight regional rapid transit system (RRTS) corridors to connect Delhi with Meerut, Panipat, Palwal, Rohtak, Baraut, Khurja and Hapur. “Out of these, the task force constituted by the then Planning Commission prioritised three corridors namely, Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut, Delhi-Gurugram-Rewari-Alwar and Delhi-Panipat.

The incident took place in North Delhi’s Lahori Gate area recently. As per data provided by Delhi Police, around 640 attempt to murder cases have been reported in the city this year up to October 31 while last year, the number stood at 480. In most of such cases, police officials said that people attack in a ‘fit of rage’ or over petty issues, like the reason in this particular case. On November 27, police received information from a hospital about a man identified as Dinesh Tamang being brought in with injuries on his neck. He was unable to speak. The victim, Dinesh, was later shifted to LNJP Hospital for treatment. “The accused identified as Parkash Sharma was arrested. During interrogation, he disclosed that the victim was consuming liquor with someone. He asked for wine from the complainant, but the complainant refused the same and he lost his temper. He injured the victim over his neck by using a cutter and ran away from the spot. He is illiterate and vagabond,” said Sagar Singh Kalsi, DCP (North).

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur district sees dip in robberies, but rise in murders||KOLHAPUR: The district has witnessed a drop in the number of several crimes such as dacoity, robbery, forced robbery, house break-in, cheating, fraud and other organised criminal activities. At the same time, there has been an increase in the number of murders and mob violence. Between January and November 2021, just 11 cases of dacoity were registered as against 28 cases registered during the same period in 2019. Similarly, the number of forced robbery cases have come down from 142 to 121, and frauds from 200 to 177 during the same time frame. However, the number of murders has increased from 41 to 47, and mob rampage cases have gone up from 258 to 392. The authorities claim action against gangs involved in organised crimes have helped to bring down the number of such crimes. In the past year, the Kolhapur police have invoked sections of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against three major gangs with total 21 criminals-on-record involved in various organised crimes such as dacoity, threatening, murders, arson etc. District superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawade said more such gangs are on radar and soon they too will face charges under the MCOCA. He said increased efficiency of patrols too has helped to reduce organised crimes and ensure convictions. The police were also effective in busting matka gambling dens. In the current year, till November, 909 dens were busted, as compared to 509 dens busted in 2019. Also, the police have taken action against 2,345 cases of sale, transport and consumption of illegal liquor. It is evident that gambling and illegal liquor sales haves increased. The authorities blame it on youths turning to these illegal activities to make money as they might have suffered economically due to pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-dist-sees-dip-in-robberies-but-rise-in-murders/articleshow/88263331.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Former Kolhapur dist BJP prez joins NCP; to help new party in KMC polls||Kolhapur: Sandip Desai, the former Kolhapur district president of BJP and a close confidant of state BJP president Chandrakant Patil for more than one-and-a-half, has joined the NCP on Sunday on the occasion of party chief Sharad Pawar’s 81st birthday. Desai was welcomed into the party by R K Powar, the Kolhapur city president of NCP, and NCP veteran V B Patil. Before his induction into NCP, Desai took out a motorcycle rally along the major streets of the city with hundreds of his supporters. Chandrakant Patil and Desai had been closely associated for years. Desai’s joining the NCP has, therefore, come as shock to the BJP top brass. “Since I left the post of BJP district president, I was sidelined over the past two-and-a-half years. My joining NCP is more to do with internal strife than it has to do with particular leaders. The NCP leadership has promised me a place of respect in the new organisation,” Desai told TOI. Desai’s joining NCP is likely to help the NCP in the upcoming Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) election. He has announced that he will galvanise support for NCP and will work for the party’s expansion. Desai is from the old city area where, traditionally, Shiv Sena has an edge. Congress too has gained some ground in the old city area after Chandrakant Jadhav won the MLA election. Jadhav, however, recently passed away and Congress is now looking for prospects to retain the gains by electing Jadhav’s wife Jayashri unopposed. With Desai, the NCP too is likely to gain some foothold in the old city. The BJP is on the back foot in the district losing election after election. Upon learning that Desai has joined NCP, state BJP president Chandrakant Patil held a closed-door meeting with all office bearers. According to the sources, the electoral losses in the district has rattled the party cadre, which was clear during the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/former-kolhapur-dist-bjp-prez-joins-ncp-to-help-new-party-in-kmc-polls/articleshow/88263332.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Dumping stopped at Uran mangroves in Mumbai: Maharashtra government||MUMBAI: The state government on Monday told the Bombay high court that the dumping of solid waste on mangroves at Uran was stopped last Friday.  “From (December)10th, dumping of garbage at the site is completely stopped,” advocate general (AG) Ashutosh Kumbhakoni told a bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav. Last week the court had turned to state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray to “intervene” and resolve the “long-standing issue” of a dumping ground for Uran. A petition was filed in December 2018 by Hanuman Koliwada Macchimar Vikas Maryadit saying dumping of solid waste on mangroves was impacting the breeding grounds of fish and affecting the fishing community’s livelihood. Miffed that solid waste was being dumped and even burned on mangroves, the judges pulled up the collector (Raigad), Uran municipality’s chief officer, Cidco and even the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board’s member-secretary for the three-year delay in identifying a dumping ground for Uran.  The AG said that a meeting, chaired by Thackeray, was held on December 9 where decisions were taken. He said steps would be taken to notify the Uran mangroves as reserved forest land. He also informed that the Uran Municipal Corporation (UMC) will float a tender for the “scientific closure” of the dumping site. “A tender will be issued within 15 days and the work will be completed in 30 days,” the AG said, adding that the state government has paid Rs 5.8 lakh for the closure of the site. The minutes of the meeting recorded that Thackeray directed the UMC “to prepare a restoration plan of the existing Boripakhadi site” of the mangroves in consultation with the forest department.  The AG said the UMC will also segregate wet and dry waste as daily eight tons of wet garbage and five tons of dry garbage is generated. The minutes stated that the availability of various government lands with Cidco and the district collector, Raigad, was discussed. However, it was observed that there are limitations, including coastal regulatory zones, airport authority area and nearby water bodies, for identifying and allotting land. It was decided that UMC will utilise Cidco’s solid waste facility at the village Chal in Panvel taluka.  The judges took the minutes in recording, saying they would include it in their order. They will take an update on the matter after the Christmas vacation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/dumping-stopped-at-uran-mangroves-in-mumbai-state/articleshow/88265775.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Delhi||HC disposes of plea against complete ban on crackers||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Monday disposed of a plea, filed in the run-up to Diwali, challenging the complete ban on the sale, storage and use of firecrackers in the city. The court said there is no reason to continue with the petition as the festival is over and added that “we see no reason to continue with the petition.” The plea sought a modification to a September 15 Delhi government order that imposed a ban on all kinds of firecrackers on account of pollution concerns. The petitioners’ counsel had said instead of the absolute ban, the authorities ought to opt for green crackers or a graded regulation. The order imposed the complete ban ahead of Diwali, which was celebrated on November 4 this year. The petitioners said they were seeking a modification of the September 15 order, which imposed a complete ban on the storage, sale and bursting of all kinds of firecrackers during the festival of Diwali on account of pollution concerns. Instead of an absolute ban, the authorities ought to opt for green crackers or a graded regulation, the counsel had earlier said. They contended that the ban was arbitrary, unreasonable and excessive. “The action of the respondent (Delhi government) must be no more intrusive than is necessary to meet an important public purpose,” the petition said.

Shendge said, “The Marathas are our elder brothers. We are not against reservation for them. They have been demanding a separate reservation, which we support. However, the recent demand to include the community in the OBC list is not acceptable. If that happens, all the OBCs will have no option but to fight on the streets.” Shendge was in Kolhapur to address the representatives of various OBC outfits. The OBCs have been upset over the stay granted to the political reservation of 27% in local bodies. The Supreme Court had recently stayed the state government’s ordinance, and had asked it to get the empirical data on OBCs without which the OBC quota for local body elections cannot be fixed. Since the SC stay, there have been voices from within the Maratha community asking that a survey of the Marathas be carried out, and Marathas also be added to the OBC list so that the long-pending demand of reservation can be fulfilled. The OBCs have criticised both the Centre and the state government for failing to protect their political reservation. Shendge said that while the SC has asked the state government to allocate ample funds to set up commission and carry out empirical survey, the state has earmarked only just Rs 5 crore. He alleged that with such meagre funds, the whole excercise to reclaim the political reservation for OBCs will be jeopardised. “We will start mega protest rallies from January 10. The rally will be held in Kolhapur and over a lakh OBC community members will attend it to put pressure on the government to speed up the legal task to reclaim the reservation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/maratha-reservation-under-obc-quota-not-acceptable-shendge/articleshow/88263356.cms||---

In just one day, on Sunday, seven citizens reported that they had been conned out of Rs 13 lakh by digital scamsters. In each case, the modus operandi was different. A Memnagar resident, who was registered on a matrimonial site, told police she was cheated by Dr Devraj Patel out of Rs 2.18 lakh. “After I registered on the site, Patel, who claimed to be from London, contacted me, saying he was interested in marrying me. He then informed me that he had sent a gift through a courier which had got stuck in India. He gave me a number to call. The person, at the other end, asked me to pay Rs 2.18 lakh as courier charges,” said the 41-year-old. When she did not receive the gift even after paying the hefty amount, she realized she had been conned and filed a complaint with Ghatlodia police. In Viramgam resident Hetal Dave’s case, she had received a message in her uncle’s name from an international number, asking her to send money for a medical emergency. “I got the message on April 30. It mentioned an account number. I transferred Rs 98,000 and called my uncle only to find out that he had not sent me any such message,” said the 30-year-old. She later lodged a complaint with Shahibaug police. Sagar Gajjar, a 30-year-old resident of Chandlodia, in his complaint stated that he was promised good returns if he invested in Jamok oil firm situated in Africa. However, after he made an investment of Rs 1 lakh, Amit Sharma and one another unidentified person neither gave him the amount nor the interest, Gajjar told cops. Trupti Trivedi, a resident of Naroda, claimed that she was contacted by Anand, who claimed to be a manager with an e-commerce website. “He offered me a work-from-home job. After my first assignment, I was offered an incentive. However, when I completed my second task, I was asked to pay Rs 1.36 lakh to claim my incentive. I paid the amount but did not get anything in return,” said the 35-year-old who lodged a complaint with Naroda police. Meanwhile, Naroda resident Bipin Patel told police that some unidentified person got access to the online ID of his account with a nationalised and private bank and transferred Rs 3.91 lakh from his account through multiple transactions. Similarly, Suresh Asudani, a resident of Krishnanagar, alleged that some unidentified person made various online transactions totalling Rs 1.95 lakh from his credit card without his knowledge. Kunal Sanghani, a resident of Naroda, in his complaint on Sunday has stated that he received a call from a person who identified himself as representative of a big finance firm. He lured him to invest Rs 55,000 in share market by promising good returns. When Sanghani asked for the money back, he was told to pay Rs 25,000 as GST charges and another Rs 51,000 as security deposit. However, despite paying the amount, he did not get the refund and hence lodged police complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amdavadis-lose-rs13l-to-cybercrooks-in-a-day/articleshow/88264193.cms||---

Environmentalists and the local fishing community have lodged their protest over the landfill, which blocks tidal waterflow to the wetland, a destination for migratory birds and one of the few remaining fishing places in the region. Responding to the complaints of environmental groups, the Raigad collector has asked the Panvel revenue sub-divisional officer (SDO) and Uran’s tahsildar to look into the issue and take action at the earliest. “The Uran tahsildar has been sent to pay a site visit and report back. Meanwhile, the landfill has been stopped,” said Panvel SDO Rahul Mundake. Tehsildar Bhausaheb Andhare said, “The government has not notified this area as a wetland so far. However, the villagers have been ordered to halt landfill activity.” One of the complainants, B N Kumar from NatConnect Foundation, expressed hope that necessary action will be initiated to protect the biodiversity area. “A wetland serves as an urban sponge, absorbing flood and tidal waters.

---||Goa||Lone NCP MLA tries to 'merge' with TMC; no decision yet: Goa speaker||PANAJI: Former CM and NCP’s Benaulim legislator Churchill Alemao’s move to merge his party’s legislative wing, of which he is the lone member, with TMC is yet to be accepted by Goa assembly speaker Rajesh Patnekar. “I have received his resolution. But I have not taken any decision on Alemao’s plea as legal opinion is awaited,” Patnekar told TOI. “The only member of the Nationalist Congress Party in the Goa Legislative Assembly, Churchill Alemao, does hereby resolve and agree to merge with the entire legislative group of NCP... with the All India Trinamool Congress and shall in future constitute the legislative group of AITC in the Goa Legislative Assembly,” said Alemao in his letter to Patnekar. With Patnekar yet to decide on Alemao’s plea, the Benaulim lawmaker remains an NCP MLA till the time the legislative assembly issues a notification. Alemao has also requested the speaker to “take note of the merger” and allot a seat in the house for the TMC legislator. Alemao claimed that the NCP legislature group met on December 9 to pass a resolution in favour of the merger. Alemao’s resolution was accompanied by a TMC letter that said they are accepting the offer and the resolution of NCP’s legislative wing to “subsume the entire legislative group” into TMC. Though Patnekar is yet to decide on the merger plea, Alemao went ahead and formally joined TMC at a public meeting in Benaulim. He said that he will contest the 2022 assembly election on the TMC ticket. As soon as Alemao announced his decision, questions were raised about the constitutional sanctity of the move and whether it stands the test of the law. Advocate Radharao Gracias, who accompanied Alemao, said that the merger is valid. “Para 4 of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution says two-thirds of the MLAs can split or merge. Now he is one person and therefore he is 100%. So consequently, the NCP legislative group is the TMC legislative group and the speaker will be issuing a notification on this count in due course,” he said. The argument did not convince legal experts and political commentators. While former advocate general Carlos Alvares Ferreira termed Alemao’s move as unconstitutional, former member of Goa State Law Commission Cleofato Coutinho called it the “theatre of the absurd”, which does not bode well for Goa’s politics. Both Coutinho and Ferreira said the Supreme Court needs to clearly interpret the Xth schedule of the Constitution to prevent party-hopping and defections by MLAs, who change political affiliations claiming a split in the party. “This is unconstitutional but now the question is who will challenge it given that there is no time. By claiming to have merged, Churchill enjoys his term till the end and has access to perks. And at the end of the day, the 10th schedule provides for disqualification but does not prevent you from contesting again,” said Ferreira. Coutinho said the merger of a legislature party has to be as a result of a split in the parent party. “But a national party like NCP, Congress or BJP can never split at the regional level. This point has to be answered at some point by the highest court. I would say that as far as the present merger is concerned, it is highly academic,” he said. “This is not just a theatre of the absurd but it’s worse. First, we used to talk of defections after the election results but here we are talking of defections before the elections,” said Coutinho. For the Benaulim MLA, who is known for his party-hopping ways, this is not the first foray into TMC. In March 2014, Alemao had resigned from the Congress after his daughter was denied a ticket and joined Trinamool Congress to unsuccessfully contest Lok Sabha election from South Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/churchill-tries-to-merge-with-tmc-no-decision-yet-speaker/articleshow/88264903.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Delhi||Okhla sanctuary water undergoing health check||New Delhi: In a bid to assess the wetland health, the forest department has collected water samples from Okhla Bird Sanctuary and sent it to the lab for testing, officials told TOI on Monday. According to the Gautam Budh Nagar forest department, Uttar Pradesh that manages the sanctuary, one of the major bird sanctuaries and protected sites in NCR, the water samples were last assessed in March 2020, which showed presence of harmful chemicals, metals, oil and grease — something that hampers birds’ health. “We have sent the water samples for testing to a private lab in Ghaziabad. The assessment is being done to assess the pollution in the water, which often hampers the health of wetland and, thereby, hundreds of migratory birds that arrive here,” said P K Srivastava, divisional forest officer of GB Nagar. According to Srivastava, the major findings of the tests will allow them to chalk out a plan to clean and maintain the wetland, which is at the receiving end of the Yamuna’s pollution from Delhi. “There are no source of pollution in the sanctuary but the water that comes from Delhi. We look for presence of metal, oil and grease in the water, which is the major concern,” added Srivastava. Last time, the water samples had presence of oil and grease at 4mg/litre as against the standard of 0.1mg/l. There were also presence of metals and other chemicals in the water. The biochemical oxygen demand at the sanctuary was 14mg/l as against the minimum limit of 3mg/l while dissolved oxygen was 2mg/l as against a minimum requirement of 4mg/l, according to the last test report in March 2020. The sanctuary, mostly over the Yamuna and its banks, spreads over 400 hectares, of which about 80% is a waterbody. The sanctuary is home to a number of migratory birds, which, according to different censuses, are dropping over the years from 12,212 birds in 2019 to 8,776 in 2020. Birders had, too, complained about the degrading wetland health at the Okhla sanctuary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/okhla-sanctuary-water-undergoing-health-check/articleshow/88264920.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Goa||Khell zatlo, says Mamata as she takes on BJP||MARGAO: “Khell zatlo.” West Bengal chief minister and TMC chairperson Mamata Banerjee fumbled while pronouncing the Konkani words for ‘khela hobe’, but she more than made up for it by tossing a football into the boisterous audience, who lapped up all of Banerjee’s theatrics on the stage and cheered. As Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao and his daughter Valanka were inducted into TMC, the largely attended public function held on Dando grounds, Benaulim, was high on optics—footballs on the stage, a cantar (Konkani song) eulogising Banerjee and Alemao, and the thousands of Alemao supporters waving the TMC flag at Banerjee’s prompt. “We will win the election,” Banerjee said. “Please accept us like your family.” Speaking further, she also offered an invitation to opposition parties to enter into an alliance with her party. “If anybody wants to come into our alliance, you are welcome. But we won’t allow BJP to win,” she said. The Alemaos were welcomed to TMC by its vice-president, Luizinho Faleiro, in the presence of Banerjee and other TMC functionaries. “Only Mamata didi has it in her to become prime minister,” Alemao said in his address. “If she becomes prime minister, she will throw BJP out.” In her address, Banerjee took pains to explain that TMC was not an anti-Hindu party as was made out to be by BJP, but a party that promotes communal harmony. Hitting out at BJP, Banerjee called into question what she called BJP’s “only narrative” of Hindu pride. “(They should understand that) a Hindu is one who has a big heart and has humanity in his heart.” She said that the scale of social reforms she has undertaken in West Bengal can be compared to no other state, and termed BJP’s propaganda against her party for unleashing violence as downright false. “There’s no violence in West Bengal. Those are all lies. All those videos are fabricated by BJP. BJP is a feku party. Doing wrong things and speaking falsehood is what BJP is known for,” she said. Accusing BJP of being intolerant, Banerjee said that the general mood of the people across the country was to defeat BJP. “Everybody wants BJP to go, not only from Goa but from UP, from Punjab, from India,” she said. “Everybody has seen their performance. Only (unleashing raids on its rivals by) CBI, ED, Income tax, and forcefully evicting people, they are trying to finish the country, democracy, constitution and heritage, and are trying to change the country’s history.” TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and its Goa in-charge Mohua Maitra also spoke.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/khell-zatlo-says-mamata-as-she-takes-on-bjp/articleshow/88264918.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

The woman also alleged that her husband, whom she married when he was posted in the Chiloda camp in 2012, threatened to kill her with his licensed revolver and dispose of her body in a jungle in Himachal Pradesh. After this, she left his house in June with her daughter and went to her parents’ place in Raysan and has been living with them ever since. In her complaint, the woman stated that her husband and in-laws had earlier also assaulted her over dowry and giving birth to a girl. She said that as she was pregnant with their first child in in 2016, her husband and in-laws sent her to her parents’ place. After she gave birth, her husband and in-laws, aggrieved about the birth of the girl, did not take her back to Solan. She said that they demanded Rs 5 lakh to keep her and their daughter with them. Her father then gave them money and they kept her with them. In June 2021, when her husband came home on leave, she found pictures of several girls on his phone. She said that he also had obscene chats with these girls and had nude pictures of them. She told her husband that he could be honey-trapped and told him not to enter relationships with such women. This did not go down well with him, and he thrashed her and threatened to kill her. She was kicked out of the house, after which she boarded a train to Ahmedabad. She approached police on Saturday and filed a complaint for domestic violence and criminal intimidation against her husband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cautioned-about-honeytrap-armyman-thrashes-expels-wife/articleshow/88264209.cms||---

According to the FIR filed with Chiloda police, Disha Prajapati, now 22, had fallen in love with Vipul Thakor, now 25, around four years ago. They decided to get married and went to the marriage registrar’s office at Gheekanta three years ago, where they signed a marriage pact but decided not to tell anyone about it. According to the FIR, they decided they would first convince their families and only later they would disclose their marriage. Around a year and a half ago, Prajapati told Thakor he was very domineering and she could not stay with him. She told him she wanted to end their marriage and would not maintain any relationship with him. Around eight months ago, Prajapati’s family found another groom for her and their wedding was fixed for Monday. Thakor came to know about this and began calling Prajapati and pressuring her to continue their marriage. As Prajapati was fed up with Thakor, she blocked his phone number, but he continued to call from another numbers. Later on Sunday night, Thakor appeared at Prajapati’s wedding venue where he began screaming her name and singing songs in an inebriated condition. Scared that he would ruin her wedding, Prajapati approached police and filed a case of criminal intimidation against Thakor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/legally-wed-husband-booked-for-intimidation-at-wifes-wedding/articleshow/88264210.cms||---

The woman, 28, a resident of Vavol in Gandhinagar, in her FIR with Sector 7 police said she works for a private medical college as an assistant professor and married to a man from Vavol eight months ago. On Saturday morning, she was performing puja to a goddess and was using her phone to do the proper rituals for her fast. Her husband then came there and asked for her phone. She told him she was using it to puja and would give it him later. This did not go down well with her husband and mother-in-law, and they began abusing her, the FIR says. She alleged that her mother-in-law then objected to her using the phone as an aid to doing puja and scolded her for it. She said that first her mother-in-law thrashed her and then her husband also hit her. Aggrieved with this, she rushed to the bedroom and ingested poison to commit suicide. As she began vomiting due to the poison, her husband took her to Gandhinagar Civil Hospital where a medico-legal case was filed. Sector 7 police later registered a case of causing hurt and domestic violence against her husband and mother-in-law. The FIR also bears dowry charges, as her husband and in-laws used to demand dowry and harassed her for getting money from her parents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-thrashed-for-using-phone-to-do-puja/articleshow/88264215.cms||---
---||Goa||Lobo calls for CM probe into cash-for-job allegations||Panaji: Science and technology minister Michael Lobo said on Monday that CM Pramod Sawant should inquire into allegations of corruption in government job recruitment, and that he should “bring the inquiry to its logical conclusion”. “Jobs should be given based only on merit. The process to set up a staff selection board should be expedited,” he said. “As we have a PWD minister, the CM has not directly got involved in it. His involvement is needed now. If it is only an allegation, then too it should be cleared by the CM. It is very important,” said Lobo. Monserrate had alleged that Pauskar has been demanding Rs 25-30 lakh during recruitment. “It is very important to set up a staff selection board as soon as possible, as had been envisaged by former CM Manohar Parrikar. If I am in the next government, a staff selection board will be established immediately. The smaller posts can be filled by the individual departments. The higher posts should be filled by the board,” said Lobo. “No such scope for allegations should be left when it comes to recruitment. Jobs have to be allocated purely on merit. A meritorious youth should not feel injustice has to be done to him or her,” said Lobo. Meanwhile, BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade refused to comment on BJP’s Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate’s allegations against PWD minister Deepak Pauskar. Tanavade said that he has not yet been able to discuss the facts of the matter with the CM. “I did not get the time to discuss it with the chief minister. I was in Sattari yesterday and the CM was in Salcete. He has left today for three days to Varanasi. The issue comes under the purview of the government, and before talking about something related to the government, it is best to find out the facts first. There is no party connection with recruitments. I will discuss it with the CM and the MLA who has made the allegation,” Tanavade said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-calls-for-cm-probe-into-cash-for-job-allegations/articleshow/88264922.cms||---

The Harsul police have registered a case of accidental death. The incident took place on Sunday around noon. About four to five girls resided in each room of the ashram shala. On Sunday, the roommates of the deceased girl had gone out of the ashram shala and they had invited the girl to join them. However, the girl refused, said assistant police inspector Ganesh Varule. When the other girls returned, they found the door to their room locked from the inside. The girls knocked on the door several times and got no response. They then called the ashram shala employees and the door was broken open. The Class IX student was found hanging from the ceiling fan of the room. Varule said a few hours before the incident, the girl’s mother had come to meet her and they had an argument over her studies. The other students also saw them arguing. “This could have led the girl to take the extreme step,” said Varule. The girl comes from a poor tribal family. She had been studying in the ashram shala since Class I. Her sister and a cousin also study at the same place, said the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/15-year-old-commits-suicide-at-ashram-shala-in-trimbak-taluka/articleshow/88263401.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Fresh module for anganwadi centres to improve nutrition||JAIPUR: The state education department has developed a fresh module for anganwadi centres (AWC) to improve nutrition and learning outcomes among children aged 3-5 years from the next academic session. The Rajasthan State Council of Educational Research & Training (RSCERT) developed a manual that says every AWC will have at least one teacher with a certificate or a diploma course in nutrition. The state has 60,000 AWCs that are responsible for the healthcare and early childhood education of children. “The AWCs are undergoing a major transformation in the state as they are merging with schools at all possible places. It means that they will have better infrastructure and have the advantage of utilizing resources of schools,” said Kamlendra Ranawat, public relations officer at SIERT. The manual says health check-ups of children will take place digitally to maintain records and allow the central data centre monitor real-time data. The purpose is to provide real-time help or intervention required by children of the centre. Otherwise, the health check-ups maintained manually take weeks to reach even the district authorities. The curriculum of early childhood is going to see learning based on the activities and concepts. The idea is to introduce children to an understanding of colours, family, animals and things around them. “All the reforms will be introduced in a phased manner so that children learn to communicate and express. The larger outcome being expected is children under the AWC will be fully prepared to adjust to the curriculum of class I,” said Ranawat. A special provision of the toy room or section and library has been included in the AWCs. “This has been the recommendation for long to have the toy bank and the book section for these children who generally come from disadvantaged groups and economically weaker sections,” said KB Kothari, former policy planner, UNICEF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fresh-module-for-anganwadi-centres-to-improve-nutrition/articleshow/88264926.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: ‘New’ Chandni Chowk, but old habits die hard||NEW DELHI: The bane of road digging has not spared even the revamped and recently inaugurated Chandni Chowk area. The pedestrian walkway and some spots on the roads on the 1.3-km stretch connecting Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid are already showing signs of this urban blight. On Monday, TOI saw the footpath near Moti Cinema being dug up, while tiles were missing on the pavement opposite Central Baptist Church and the corner of Esplanade Road, with some concretisation undertaken. Two more locations on the main square opposite Dariba Kalan and Fountain Chowk, had been dug up earlier, but had since been repaired. “Surprisingly, digging is being done so soon after the road and pavement were redeveloped after detailed planning among multiple agencies,” said Sanjay Bhargava, president, Chandni Chowk Vyapar Mandal. “I have shared the information and photos with the agency concerned on WhatsApp. Our apprehension is that if such digging recurs frequently, the tiles will be dislodged. In other words, after such a strenuous effort to revamp this place, it will lose its sheen quickly.” A PWD official disclosed that permission to dig the road was given to a power distribution company and a telephone company after disruptions in their services due to faults. “They tried resolving the problem through the regular manholes, with no success,” the official explained. “But we will restore the spot and lay the same tiles when the work is completed. But in future, to avoid such frequent road digging, we might take some undertaking from such utilities.” On Monday, there were PWD workers sweeping and collecting garbage from the public spaces. Civil defence personnel were enforcing Covid-appropriate behaviour, including the prohibition on spitting. But the planters, bollards and pillars bore ugly tell-tale stains of betel spit. “Despite the fact that spitting is strictly banned due to the Covid pandemic, you can’t find a single space that isn’t marred by spit splotches,” said a shopkeeper. A Delhi government official said that people violating Covid norms were being booked, but spitting was an offence that should be acted against by the municipal corporation. Meanwhile, the conditions in the market are chaotic, complained traders, with a huge influx of hawkers despite their pleas for action against encroachments. They cited continuing illegal vending on Subhash Marg, SP Mukherjee Marg, outside Chandni Chowk metro station and some other areas. “In spite of several past orders and this last order on December 6, it is regrettable that the City-SP Zone is burdened by massive encroachments,” said Bhargava. “In a letter to the commissioner of Delhi Police and North Delhi Municipal Corporation, in addition to other civic officials, we have requested action against squatting and hawking and clearing of encroached locations.” On being questioned about these new problems at Chandni Chowk, Jogi Ram Jain, chairman of the north corporation’s standing committee, said that violations are being acted against. “And the civic body will also coordinate with police on fresh action. However, it will be the responsibility of the cops to clear encroachment and prevent them in the future,” Jain said.

---||Ranchi||Protests for jobs, livelihoods dominate year of employment||Ranchi: The year 2021, which was declared a year of employment by the coalition government in Jharkhand, is ending on discordant note with different outfits now increasingly taking to streets mainly for jobs, livelihoods and better wages. Besides fighting Covid-19 pandemic, chief minister Hemant Soren is also confronted with a series of protests and agitation from different quarters, which is only growing louder, as the government is nearing to celebrate its second anniversary on December 29. The government is currently running an ambitious mass connect campaign — Aapke adhikar, aapki sarkar aapke dwar since November 16 with Soren himself leading it by addressing divisional-level rallies. But unending restiveness among youths and jobseekers visibly resonating on the ground as at least in two places — Hazaribag and Palamau — Soren faced severe protests during his public addresses in the past one week. To further make things difficult for the government, JPSC aspirants have now decided to intensify their nearly two-month-old stir demanding cancellation of JPSC’s seventh to 10th civil service exams citing anomalies in results. Thousands of para-teachers, too, are likely to take on the government after its alleged U-turn to regularize their jobs. Paryatak Mitras (contract workers at tourist sites) last week announced to go on a strike from later this month if their wages which are pending since 9 months are not paid at the earliest. A few other unhappy groups which are soon expected to start agitation include Poshan sakhis — grassroots workers at anganwadi kendras battling no pay for months, ANS/GNMs, who are awaiting hike in remunerations, e-managers (contract workers at block and district levels) fighting for abrupt cancellation of their work contracts et al. Dayamani Barla, a noted tribal rights activists, who will lead a protest march to Raj Bhavan on Tuesday over attempts to grab land in tribal pockets, non-implementation of PESA Act among others, said, “People hit the streets only when they run out of all options to wake up the government and remind it of its promises. But nearly 18 months went into tackling the pandemic for the two-year-old government. Jobs have dried up and there are no new avenues for employment with the central government resorting to privatization of everything.” The Opposition BJP, however, dubbed the growing trend of dissent as a testimony to Soren’s growing unpopularity. “The Soren government came to power by blatantly making false promises. Now, it has exposed itself in two years and it is the people who are fighting this unpopular government more than the political parties. Whenever people take up the fight, biggest governments have crashed,” said Pratul Shahdeo. While the ruling JMM’s general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharjee couldn’t be contacted for comments, its ally, the Congress’s state president Rajesh Thakur said their government is committed to the promises made to voters. Citing some of the fulfilled promises, he said, “Despite Covid-19 pandemic, resource crunch and non-cooperation from the central government, Jharkhand’s Covid management was one of the best in the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/protests-for-jobs-livelihoods-dominate-year-of-employment/articleshow/88263925.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||As govt makes U-turn on promise, para-teachers dig in for a fight||Ranchi: With the state government taking a U-turn on its promise to provide the para-teachers with service conditions along the lines of the ones existing in Bihar, the Ekikrit Para Sikshak Sangharsh Morcha (EPSSM) has decided to continue with their fight for the fulfilment of their demands, including their demand for pay-scale. In a virtual meeting on Monday, EPSSM members expressed their dissatisfaction over the government’s decision and resolved to agitate in a democratic manner. Recently, the government had framed a set of draft rules for para-teachers’ services and started circulating them among the teachers. The rules stated that all the teachers would serve up to the age of 60. The trained para-teachers would get 50% increment in their wages while the untrained ones will get a hike of 30%. The untrained teachers would get a further hike of 10% if they pass an assessment examination. The rules will be applicable from January 1 next year. In Bihar, the trained para-teachers have a pay scale of Rs 5,200-Rs 20,200 per month and have provident fund and annual increment. “Our demand for pay-scale will continue,” said para-teacher Rishikant Pathak. State education minister Jagarnath Mahto said that there is a technical hindrance in awarding pay-scale. “The difficulty arose as the para-teachers have not been appointed under the roster system. But we promise to bring in several changes in the future to improve their service conditions,” he added. Pathak said, “The minister should have studied all the details before making such promises. Besides, there are several anomalies in the draft rules which should be amended.” The para-teachers even claimed that that there are several provisions in the draft service rules which put their future in danger. A delegation of para-teachers is planning to meet Mahto and request him to reconsider the decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/as-govt-makes-u-turn-on-promise-para-teachers-dig-in-for-a-fight/articleshow/88263931.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Opposition BJP anchored its resources in over 500 centres at the mandal-level in the state, dispatching party workers to host the special celebrations as part of its Divya Kashi, Bhavya Kashi campaign. While former chief minister and BJP legislator Babulal Marandi was present at Madhuvan temple in Giridih, the party’s national vice-president and ex-CM Raghubar Das led the celebrations at Surya mandir in his hometown Jamshedpur. Ranchi MLA C P Singh and his Hatia counterpart Navin Jaiswal with hordes of people were present at Vishwanath temple in Piska More in the state capital. Talking to TOI, BJP’s senior spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo, who was at the Shiv temple in Doranda near the high court campus, said, “It was a historic moment for the entire nation as this is for the first time that any prime minister has worked so actively for the overhaul of a site which is immensely important to the Hindus. BJP chose to celebrate the day at the temples. Besides holding puja and live screening, we also felicitated priests, temple heads across every mandir today.” Prior to the puja, the party workers had on Sunday organized a special cleaning drive across all the temples as part of the preparations. For example, state BJP president Deepak Prakash, along with his team, cleaned a temple in Argora in the morning. The construction of the Kashi corridor began in 2019 with an investment of Rs 339 crore, informed a statement from Press Information Bureau.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-organises-special-puja-across-500-temples-in-jkhand/articleshow/88264184.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Exam row: Guv seeks explanation from JPSC||Ranchi: After issuing a summon to the Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) chairman on November 24, the Raj Bhavan has once again stepped in seeking an explanation from the commission over the allegations of irregularities in 7th to 10th JPSC combined civil service examinations levelled by the aspirants. “Since the protesting candidates want JSPC to be transparent, they approached the governor and subsequently a letter has been sent to the secretary of JPSC to clarify their position about the allegations levelled against the examination conducting body,” said an official of the Raj Bhavan. The letter from the governor’s office has asked the JPSC to furnish point-wise reply at the earliest, appending the documents furnished by the protesting candidates. Earlier the governor had summoned JPSC chairman Amitabh Choudhary on November 24. The chairman’s meeting with the governor resulted in JPSC coming up with a five-page explanation the next day. The commission in its explanation had admitted that around 57 candidates were declared provisionally qualified, even when their OMR sheets were not available with the commission. JPSC said that since the candidates were not at fault so they were declared pass, subject to a scrutiny. The commission, however, never clarified that who was held accountable for the missing OMR sheets or which agency is going to conduct the inquiry. The fresh letter from Raj Bhavan was issued after JPSC came up with another explanatory note on December 11 on its website, stating that out of 57 candidates, eight were disqualified earlier for different valid reasons and remaining 49 were found to have not secured qualifying marks, hence they were also disqualified. The explanation failed to cut ice with the protestors as they have been demanding publication of the OMR sheets and marks sheets of every candidate. One of the protestors Kahkashan Kamal said that the JPSC admitted loss of OMR sheets of 49 candidates only after the agitation. “May be the sheets of several other candidates have also been lost and they have been disqualified,” she said stressing that this doubt can be resolved only when the commission releases the OMR sheets and marks sheet of all the candidates, irrespective of the fact that they have been qualified or disqualified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/exam-row-guv-seeks-explanation-from-jpsc/articleshow/88264116.cms||---

Talking to TOI, Hatia Mazdoor Union president Bhawan Singh said, “We are starving today and going without wages since June this year. This payment of 50% of June 2021 wages is just a drop in the ocean. The workers would work 24x7 to ensure that all pending work orders, which under various stages of completion, are executed if at least two to three months’ wages are paid.” The workers are on an indefinite strike since 8am of December 2. Following the strike, all work at the three HEC plants has come to a complete halt, adversely affecting the execution of work orders from railways, defence, space, steel, coal and other sectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/50-of-hec-staff-get-their-june-salary/articleshow/88263976.cms||Tapas Biswas

The programme is a pan-India initiative launched from Jharkhand. The online resource centre will function nationally. The centre can be accessed at www.digitalshakti.org. “We started from Ranchi and now operating from Delhi, Hyderabad, etc. We have a special focus on Jharkhand for this programme because of the increasing number of cyber crime cases reported from the state,” said Vineet Kumar, founder and director, Cyber Peace Foundation. The resource centre has launched a WhatsApp helpline number (9570000066) to reach out to women in distress. “We address the complaints by helping the victims. For instance, in cases of stalking or fake profile on Instagram, we immediately reach out to the service provider and ask them to remove such content. We work with tech companies in order to assure that the cases are resolved,” Kumar said. “Majority of the crimes are happening in cyber space targeting women. We are also launching some assessment so that anybody who reports to us can be connected to a counsellor and then provide care and support to the victims. Resource centre will have a lot of material on cyber security and online safety. Final version of the site will be ready by January 31.” The programme was launched as Digital Shakti in 2018 with the aim to raise awareness among women across the nation on the digital front. Version 3 of the programme was rolled out in March in Ladakh. On December 9, NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma and Jharkhand governor Ramesh Bais jointly launched an online resource centre to ensure women safety in cyber space in collaboration with Facebook and Cyber Peace Foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tech-driven-solution-launched-to-help-victims-of-cyber-crime/articleshow/88263951.cms||---

The driver has been sent to jail while the girl has been sent for medical examination by Jharia police on Monday. The matter came to light after a written complaint was filed by the mother of the 13-year-old girl, a Class VII student, with the Jharia police station on Sunday. The girl was not able to complain as her father had threatened to kill her if she told anyone. According to her complaint, the mother said she caught her husband in the act last week and rescued her daughter. She then warned him but he brought a pistol-like weapon and threatened to kill both of them if they reveal the incident to anyone. On Saturday night, he again forced himself on the girl after which the mother decided to lodge a written complaint. On Sunday, when the father went out, both the mother and the girl went to the Jharia police station and narrated their ordeal. “His excesses are increasing by the day and he can do anything to us,” they told the police. Later, the police set up a team to search him and nabbed him late on Sunday night. “The police have lodged a case under Section 376(f) of the IPC and Section 4 of the Pocso Act,” inspector Pankaj Kumar Jha of the police station said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/man-held-for-raping-daughter-for-3-months/articleshow/88264148.cms||Anil Ashutosh

The scheme aims to include children suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM). The government has decided to introduce fortified rice in the “hot-cooked meals” provided to children in the anganwadi centres (AWC) and in the ration given to pregnant and lactating women. “We are working on the high-intensity fortified food programme which focuses on the kids and pregnant women. It will be launched by the end of this month,” said A Dodde, director, Directorate of Women and Child Development, Jharkhand. “The aim is to introduce fortified rice in the rice component in a concentration fortification ratio (1:100) decided by the government of India on the advice of dietitians and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). It will be supplied by the government agency, Food Corporation of India (FCI). The government has also included protein-rich food like eggs, lentils, chana and groundnut to deliver adequate amount of protein, carbohydrate and fat to the kids and pregnant and lactating women,” said Mrutyunjaya Nayak, a Unicef volunteer. Moreover, children suffering from severe acute malnutrition will also be included in the programme. “Earlier, there were no provisions for these children. The identified children will get the required protein and fat-rich diet,” Nayak added. The government has also taken initiatives to reach out to the beneficiaries by keeping track on the anganwadi workers through a system of “Poshan tracker”. Developed by the ministry of women and child development, the Poshan tracker app enables real-time monitoring and tracking of all AWC, anganwadi workers (AWWs) and beneficiaries. “The idea is to provide an incentive of Rs 500 to AWWs once they have delivered the ‘take home ration’ (THR) to the respective beneficiaries,” Nayak added. The step was taken as various reports pointed out that THR distribution was highly uneven in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/fortified-food-scheme-by-month-end-in-state/articleshow/88275366.cms||---

In Bokaro, authorities have decided to roll out camps at panchayat levels to ramp up the vaccination coverage in rural areas. In the urban areas, over 90% beneficiaries have received the first dose and 55% taken the second shot. Deputy commissioner Kuldeep Chaudhary said efforts are on to speed up the inoculation drive. “We have activated over 120 vaccination sites where both the doses are administered. We are working out plans to increase the sites to intensify the jab drive,” he said. He said they are regularly reviewing block-wise trends to take corrective steps. “Checks have begun at panchayat levels to ascertain if all eligible people are vaccinated or not. Mukhiya and panchayat representatives too are being asked to work on a war footing for 100% vaccine coverage in their areas. We are close to achieving the target for first dose. There is more focus on second doses. Every day more than 12,000 people are being vaccinated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bokaro-races-to-reach-100-vax-target/articleshow/88264166.cms||Divy Khare

The patient, Navin Soni, was admitted in neurology department of RIMS on December 7 . According to his relatives, Soni went missing on December 8. They informed the Rims management and also the Bariyatu police about the incident. They also searched each ward of the hospital but failed to locate him. On Sunday evening, the Rims management informed the relatives of Soni about an unidentified patient who was brought to the hospital on December 10 and died on Sunday and asked them to identify it. On reaching the hospital, the relatives found the body to be of Soni. Santosh Prasad, a relative of Soni, said, “Why didn’t the RIMS management inform us earlier about the patient? We want complete details of how the patient was brought back and by whom. They have shown us his dead body all of a sudden.” Commenting on the situation, PRO, Rims, Dr D K Sinha said that in all likelihood the patient may have just walked out of the hospital without informing anyone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/patient-goes-missing-from-rims-dies-day-after-readmission/articleshow/88264195.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Khaunte said that he would consult his close supporters and his core committee before deciding on whether to join a political party or try his luck for the third time as an independent MLA. While criticising Congress for humiliating his workers and supporters who had joined the party, Khaunte said that he does not agree with the policies of either Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) or All India Trinamool Congress (TMC). “I have to make a firm decision in the interest of Goa and time has come to take a firm political decision, keeping in mind the development of the constituency for the next five years,” Khaunte said while speaking at a ‘Mahila Melava’ for nearly 200 Self Help Groups (SHGs) from Porvorim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/call-on-poll-strategy-by-end-of-week/articleshow/88265124.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Omicron may cause mild disease for Covid recovered, fully vaxxed: Docs||Nagpur: The city’s first Omicron patient is a case of Covid reinfection. The 40-year-old man, a resident of Dighori, had first got infected during the second wave in April and suffered mild infection. He remained unvaccinated since he was not eligible at the time of leaving the country for West Africa on an official tour in June. Possibility of the man getting infected with the Delta variant earlier can’t be ruled out as the strain accelerated new cases then. Doctors in the city said that natural immunity from prior Covid infection works like a vaccine and such reinfection patients are more likely to remain asymptomatic or mild. The Omicron patient has remained asymptomatic for nine days now and is likely to be discharged on Tuesday if his RTPCR report is negative. OCHRI director Dr Anup Marar said, “If the patient had been asymptomatic or mild earlier, the antibodies may not be long lasting. Antibody response depends on severity of illness. Omicron is a slightly different variant. It might be possible to get reinfected.” He said that people with Covid history can still get Omicron infection. “But second infection is generally not severe. In the next 3 to 4 weeks, we will better understand the Omicron strain. At this point of time, it is supposed to cause mild infection but has more transmissibility,” said Dr Marar. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said the reinfection rate from Omicron has increased. “Delta had 9% reinfection rate whereas Omicron has 25%. A higher reinfection rate is seen is South Africa. But it is expected to be mild, especially among fully vaccinated with Covid history,” he said. Dr Shinde added that the risk is negligible for people with hybrid immunity – vaccine and infection induced. “Natural infection shall work as vaccine for Omicron. In this situation, patients may not need hospitalization,” he said. Pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat said, “Now or in future you are not safe from virus. Only thing is severity or complication will be less. Continue with wearing mask, sanitization, vaccination and avoid crowding,” he said. Critical care specialist Dr Imran Noor Mohammad said, “Chances of virus harbouring among people is always there during this season. If you are not using a mask, the chances are more. Previous Covid antibodies are likely to keep the disease mild. As per available information, chances of Omicron causing severe disease look less.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/omicron-may-cause-mild-disease-for-covid-recovered-fully-vaxxed-docs/articleshow/88264367.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka MLC election results to be out today||BENGALURU: The counting of votes polled in the legislative council elections on December 10 for the 25 MLC seats will be taken up on Tuesday. Results of some seats might get delayed since preferential votes will come into play because of a tight contest. Any candidate securing 50 per cent of the total valid votes plus one first-preference vote will get elected in the first round itself. If that doesn't happen, then counting will begin for second-preference votes, and then the third, and the exercise may go into a second day. However, all three political parties are upbeat about their prospects. While BJP is eyeing victory in at least 12 seats, Congress is citing numbers in the range of 9 to 11. Meanwhile, JD(S) is hoping to win at least three to four seats. At least 13 of the 25 seats have to be won for the ruling party to gain majority in the upper house, while Congress needs to bag at least 10 to 11 seats for a good outing. The JD(S), which has been looking to retain its relevance in the upper house, needs a minimum of three wins to play the "balancing" act in the council. Meanwhile, all eyes will be on the Belagavi triangular fight where Lakhan Jarkiholi from among the Jarkiholi brothers, who has contested as an independent candidate, is expected play spoilsport for either Congress or BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-mlc-election-results-to-be-out-today/articleshow/88266410.cms||---

Tanavade said that during the last five years the state government had received good support from Alemao on various issues. “Alemao shares good relations with everyone. He told us that he is going to join another national party. Over the last five years, he has supported the BJP government in the state in all decisions which he felt were good. He has also said often that chief minister Pramod Sawant is doing good work. He has supported us many times and when he had to stand with the opposition for political reasons, he has done so by telling us that he is bound by some compulsions,” he said. Alemao being a very senior leader, must have made the move to TMC taking into account various political factors, Tanavade said. Later he also denied that there was any move to bring independent MLA from Porvorim Rohan Khaunte into BJP fold. “When elections are nearing, there is always some movement. Whoever wants to join the party, we have to welcome them. So far, no discussion or decision regarding him has come to me at least,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tanavade-alemao-has-supported-bjp-govt-over-last-5-yrs/articleshow/88265154.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Barring Nagpur, no sample from Vid found Omicron +ve||Nagpur: After a Covid-19 patient admitted in Nagpur tested positive for the Omicron variant, people from other districts in the region are also a worried lot. However, as far as the samples sent from Amravati, Akola, Buldhana, Yavatmal and Bhandara for genome sequencing are concerned, no district has received Omicron positive report so far. “Samples from Amravati, Akola and Yavatmal along with a few from Gondia and Bhandara were sent for genome sequencing in the last two weeks. Most of them were of Delta variant,” said state surveillance officer Dr Pradip Awate. As per the practice, respective district administrations shortlist samples and send them for genome sequencing. In case the sample comes positive, the state department of public health announces it through release and informs the respective collector. Samples sent from Vidarbha in the first week of December were negative, confirmed the officials. However, the results of five samples sent from Amravati are still pending and expected in the next two days. As per government’s guidelines, Vidarbha is expected to send 1,100 samples for genome sequencing every month. However, the region is not reporting so many positive cases for the last 4 months. As a result, most district administrations are sending all positive samples for genome sequencing. “All samples we have sent for genome sequencing are of Delta variant, which is still prevalent in Vidarbha. We can send up to 100 samples a month. Hence, we have decided to send every positive sample for genome sequencing,” said Dr Apurva Parate of Akola GMCH. Epidemiologist Anand Thatte said the genome sequencing exercise is to confirm the variant and has no impact over treatment protocol. “The treatment for all variants is the same. There is nothing like separate treatment protocol for Omicron or Delta. Even the preventive Covid-appropriate behaviour is the same. So, common people should not think much about it and continue to follow the preventive measures,” he added. GENOME SEQUENCING PLAN Vidarbha can send 1,100 samples every month (100 from each district) Region has not reported overall 1,100 cases a month since August 2021 August (932), September (779), October (419) and November (350) cases have been reported After Omicron was discovered, most districts are sending all positive samples for genome sequencing Only 1 from Nagpur has so far tested positive, patient was unvaccinated and had travel history No patients from any other district has tested positive so far||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/barring-nagpur-no-sample-from-vid-found-omicron-ve/articleshow/88264381.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nagpur||Rising cases & recoveries hint at weakened virus||Nagpur: Most districts in Vidarbha are reporting a small but sure rise in the number of new Covid-19 cases in the last two weeks. However, majority of the patients are recovering without complications. Experts say this is an indicator of decreased virulence of the virus. Instead of numbers, the administration and people should focus on the rate of hospitalization, location of new cases, deaths, and test positivity rate henceforth, said doctors. The curve of new cases, which was constantly going down in the last 12-14 weeks, has been stable in the second half of November. The first two weeks of December have, however, seen a small northward movement. As the Omicron variant has been discovered and some cases have been detected in Maharashtra too, people may assume that new cases coming in the last two weeks could be due to it. However, experts made it clear there is no need to panic as the current trend could not be an early indicator of onset of a new wave. “Cases will keep coming. There is no need to panic till the test positivity rate is under control,” said Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease specialist. “We must focus on hospitalization rate, deaths, and location where the cases are coming from,” he added. Dr Shinde said the second wave was triggered in February 2021 and we must wait until February 2022 now. If cases keep on coming at the same pace till February, and there is no surge in deaths or hospitalization rate, the pandemic will move towards endemic. “Present conditions in Vidarbha vividly indicate that the virus is becoming weak,” said a senior member of Covid-19 task force. “Though, majority of cases are of Delta variant, the severity has gone down. Vaccination has worked in Vidarbha so far. Good vaccine coverage may ensure very good control soon,” said the doctor adding the task force has advised the administration to go ahead with the steps towards bringing normalcy to life and not to hold on just because of the fear of Omicron. NEW PHASE OF PANDEMIC In last two weeks (Dec 1 to 13), Vidarbha reported 208 new cases and 149 recoveries Two weeks before that (Nov 16 to 30), region had reported 198 new cases, 215 recoveries 2 deaths were reported in last two weeks, while 4 deaths had reported in a fortnight before that Majority of patients are asymptomatic, those having mild symptoms recovering fast Cases will continue to be detected for months and years to come, say doctors Focus must be on positivity rate, deaths, hospitalization data and not on number of cases now||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rising-cases-recoveries-hint-at-weakened-virus/articleshow/88264395.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Business||Spyware firm NSO mulls shutdown of its Pegasus unit, sale of company: Report||NSO Group, the scandal-plagued spyware company that’s in danger of defaulting on its debts, is exploring options that include shutting its controversial Pegasus unit and selling the entire company, according to people familiar with the matter. Talks have been held with several investment funds about moves that include a refinancing or outright sale, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. The prospective new owners include two American funds that have discussed taking control and closing Pegasus, one of the people said. Under that scenario, the funds would then inject about $200 million in fresh capital to turn the know-how behind Pegasus into strictly defensive cyber security services, and perhaps develop the Israeli firm’s drone technology, one of the people said. A spokeswoman for Herzliya-based NSO declined to comment. Pegasus software can track a user’s mobile phone, and its misuse has landed NSO at the centre of high-profile privacy abuse cases. The product allegedly was supplied to governments that used it to spy on political dissidents, journalists and actvists. The firm has said it sells the technology to law enforcement and government agencies to prevent crime and terrorism. The US commerce department nevertheless blacklisted NSO. Apple too has sued NSO, seeking to bar it from using its products and services. The US curbs put added pressure on NSO, which needs to pay back about $450 million in debt, just two years after a management buyout that valued it at about $1 billion. A shutdown of Pegasus could leave NSO as a much smaller and potentially less valuable company, because the unit accounts for about half of NSO’s revenue. It expects to record about $230 million in sales this year, one of the people said, 8% less than in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/spyware-firm-nso-mulls-shutdown-of-its-pegasus-unit-sale-of-company-report/articleshow/88266412.cms||---
---||Goa||Speaker is protecting Alemao’s ‘undemocratic’ act, says NCP||Panaji: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has rubbished Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao’s claim that he has merged NCP with All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) party and said that they will approach speaker Rajesh Patnekar asking for Alemao to be disqualified. NCP office bearers said that Alemao’s decision is illegal and that the speaker is protecting Alemao’s “undemocratic” act. A furious Jose Philip D’Souza, the state NCP chief, said that Alemao has no authority to merge NCP with TMC or any other party. “Churchill Alemao cannot merge NCP. He has no authority to merge the party,” D’Souza said. “Our executive committee met today and we have taken a resolution today to approach the speaker directly and ask him to take action against the MLA as per the anti-defection law.” Immediately after Alemao announced his decision and moved to join TMC, NCP state executive committee went into a huddle to decide the party’s next course of action. The party claimed that they had overlooked Alemao’s misadventures till now, but that the latest move has to be condemned. “Churchill’s statement is wrong. He cannot merge NCP, he may have taken a decision, but the final decision has to be taken by NCP. The high command will take a decision now,” D’Souza said. Alemao had served an ultimatum to NCP’s high command asking for a decision on his daughter’s claim for the Navelim seat and a decision on an alliance, immediately. With no decision forthcoming, and talks of an alliance with Congress yet to bear fruit, Alemao decided to switch over. “Just because the decision is taking time, Alemao should not have taken such a hasty decision. He should have at least resigned from the party,” D’Souza said. He said the party cannot stop an MLA from leaving.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/speaker-is-protecting-alemaos-undemocratic-act-says-ncp/articleshow/88265185.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||City’s 1st dose coverage 6k short of target, calls to reduce Covishield gap||Nagpur: Nearly 11 months after starting with just five centres and later grappling with shortage of doses during the second wave of Covid-19, the Nagpur city is now poised to achieve the target of vaccinating all its eligible population of 19.73lakh with the first dose anytime by Tuesday or Wednesday. As on Monday afternoon, the city had completed 19.67 lakh first dose while 12.44 lakh 18+ population is fully vaccinated. Though the state government had, in a bid to speed up the drive, set November deadline, none of the districts in Vidarbha could achieve the target of first dose completion. Nagpur district as a whole still has 2.20 lakh unvaccinated eligible 18+ beneficiaries. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had bigger share in the district's target of 37.44 lakh eligible population. The city limits have also witnessed higher number of Covid cases and mortalities since the pandemic started. The focus of NMC has now shifted to early completion of second dose for the remaining 7.28 lakh people. Except for around five centres where Covaxin is available, most of NMC centres offer Covishield doses. Amid vaccine shortage, the government had revised the gap between two doses of Covishield to 84 days from just 4 weeks. Immunization officials said since centres are witnessing poor footfall and plenty of doses are available, the gap between two doses of Covishield must be reduced amid threat of Omicron. Vidarbha Hospitals Association convener Dr Anup Marar said, “Although it is good to know that first dose of vaccination is done for all citizens in NMC limits, it is a bit delayed. Expected target was to fully vaccinate all by December-end. Considering the delay, it would be prudent for authorities to contemplate on reducing the 84-day gap for Covishield to four weeks so that we can hasten full vaccination before the third wave projected by January.” Among those partially vaccinated, 18 to 45 years group forms the chunk of the population. The drive was started with healthcare workers getting the first jab on priority on January 16 this year. Nagpur rural had 17.70 lakh target but till date it could complete only 15.53lakh first dose, leaving over 2.16lakh still unvaccinated. Zilla Parishad CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar said migratory population could be one of the reasons for rural parts still not being able to complete the target. “Many city centres and private organization also held vaccination for rural pockets. Possibly those numbers were not added to Nagpur rural data. Yet, we had 90% achievement record and people are still coming for the first dose. Special camps are also on,” he said.

---||Goa||Workers of Priol BJP unit oppose Gaude’s entry||Ponda: Resentment is brewing within BJP in Priol constituency after most of the prominent party workers have distanced themselves from BJP-backed MLA and minister Govind Gaude. Pitching for a local candidate at the next state assembly elections, the disgruntled party workers have formed a local group ‘Swabhimani Priolkar’, and have threatened to field their own local candidate against Gaude. In a bid to mount pressure on the party leadership, the group had even rallied at Mardol on Sunday under the leadership of a Ponda-based construction company owner Sandip Nigalye, who is a native of Keri village of the constituency. Consisting of over 2,000 people, the rally had around three former block presidents and a current block president of BJP’s Priol unit. BJP state president Sadanand Tanavade blamed Gaude for the delay in joining the party, which according to him has led to these problems. “Since last month, I have been asking him to join the party. I wanted to induct him in the presence of the party’s Goa election in-charge and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and chief minister Pramod sawant. But, he has been postponing it,” Tanavade said. Satish Madkaikar, a former BJP block president from Priol, who was at the frontline at Sunday’s rally, said that their constituency has been represented by ‘outsiders’ since the past fifteen years, and hence they want a local candidate. “We have already informed our party that we want a local candidate this time. It may be Sandip Nigalye or anyone other than Gaude who will contest from Priol constituency. We will not work for Gaude, and if the party fields him as its candidate, then we will field Nigalye as an independent candidate and work for his victory,” Madkaikar said. Madkaikar recalled that they had supported Gaude in 2017 because they wanted to defeat Pandurang ‘Deepak’ Dhavalikar. “But it’s unjustifiable that we could not create a local leader despite having around 33,000 electors. Nigalye is a native of Priol constituency and over 60% BJP workers are with him,” Madkaikar claimed. When contacted, Gaude said that he cannot take an immediate decision to join BJP. He said that has to consult his supporters. The protest by Priol BJP workers follows a similar revolt by former members of BJP’s Saligao mandal after ex-MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar’s induction in the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/workers-of-priol-bjp-unit-oppose-gaudes-entry/articleshow/88265206.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

Participating in a protest here on Saturday against seers who have opposed the government's move to give eggs in schools in the backward districts of Kalyana Karnataka and Vijayapura districts, Anjali, a student of MNM Higher Primary School for Girls, Gangavati, said children are suffering from malnutrition in the state. "It's question of our survival. We have parents and teachers to teach good things. If seers oppose this scheme, we will rush to the mutts and eat eggs there. Mutts are being run by donations offered by devotees. Even though we are poor, we donate to mutts. Seers should allow us to consume eggs. You say children are God. So fulfill the wish of the gods," she added. Seers of various mutts have threatened to launch a stir from December 20 if the government refuses to withdraw its decision on eggs in midday meals.

---||Goa||Cong meets guv, wants job scam to be probed by CBI||PANAJI: Goa Pradesh Congress delegation on Monday met governor P S Sreedharan Pillai and submitted a memorandum demanding a CBI inquiry into recruitment scam. While Congress has been alleging corruption in recruitment since the last one month, it sharpened its attack against the BJP government after two ruling MLAs led by Panaji MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate accused Public Works Department (PWD) minister Deepak Pauskar of “selling jobs”. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat told reporters after submitting the memorandum that Congress has sought the governor’s intervention to suspend recruitment at various departments and want a “full-fledged inquiry through CBI”. While state Congress president Girish Chodankar has been highlighting the corruption in recruitment for the last month, the three ruling MLAs have also alleged that recruitment of engineers in PWD was being done by accepting bribes of Rs25-30 lakh for each position and that the scam was worth about Rs70 crore. “It is a serious allegation levelled against the government by its own MLAs,” said Kamat. He added that hiring was done even as the staff selection commission was constituted after a Bill was passed in the Goa legislative assembly in 2019. The staff commission was formed with finance secretary Puneet Goel as chairperson but its functioning was kept on hold. “No efforts were made to carry out any recruitment through the staff selection commission and during the March session of Goa legislative assembly a small amendment was introduced to suspend functioning of the Goa Staff Selection Commission Act, 2019 for two years thus allowing departments to carry out recruitment directly,” said Kamat. “It is loud and clear that the BJP government headed by chief minister Pramod Sawant has adopted malicious practice in the recruitment process of various departments,” Congress’ memorandum read. It has alleged that recruitment in the departments of legal metrology, PWD, health, GMC, police have been under the scanner with reports of illegalities, favouritism and corruption in the recruitment process. “It is shocking that the kith and kin of the ministers of the departments concerned have scored 100 out of 100 marks superseding qualified and intelligent candidates,” the party stated in the memorandum. Kamat warned that Congress will paralyse functioning of the state administration if their demand was not met.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-meets-guv-wants-job-scam-to-be-probed-by-cbi/articleshow/88265257.cms||---

AAP functionary Amit Palekar on Monday said BJP’s own MLAs have raised the recruitment scam and the government doesn’t have to go anywhere. Panaji MLA has publicly said he has the proof that huge money was demanded for jobs, he said. Palekar alleged that two government polytechnic college members were involved in the manipulation of government jobs where there have been 316 appointments by the PWD so far, of which no one was allegedly appointed on merit. “The government refuses to provide any information as to why recruitment is not conducted through staff selection commission. Ministers even meddled with the Goa Board of Secondary Education. Blank papers are being checked, blank papers are being filled in, and failed people have been given appointments,” he alleged. “One of the biggest scams happened while hiring PSIs and police constables. Here, manipulation happened in terms of candidate’s height. Candidates who did not meet the requirements reached the third stage of the recruitment process,” he alleged. “If CM Pramod Sawant doesn’t initiate the action against it, then he has to admit that he is also involved in the matter and should resign from his position as a CM. Favoritism in giving jobs is injustice to the Goan youth,” he said. The party held a parivartan yatra in Navelim, Curhcorem, Cuncolim, Benaulim and St Andre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/initiate-judicial-probe-into-job-scam-aap/articleshow/88265265.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Religious converts likely to lose government benefits & quota||BELAGAVI: People from backward communities and Scheduled Castes may lose benefits of the government's welfare schemes and reservation in education and jobs if they convert to Christianity or Islam if the anti-conversion law comes into force in Karnataka. The proposed law reportedly envisages treating converts as religious minorities. Currently, Hindus belonging to backward classes and SCs are eligible for reservation even after converting to another religion and also get benefits of welfare schemes. This may change if the Anti-conversion Bill is passed in the assembly and council during the ongoing winter season in Belagavi. "There are laws to address coercive religious conversion, but they do not specify punishment. Also, the government finds the need for stringent clauses. We'll look into these issues while scrutinising the draft bill," law minister JC Madhuswamy said. CM Basavaraj Bommai on Monday said the cabinet will approve the bill after the law department completes its scrutiny and it will be tabled in both houses. "There will be different views about a new law. But, we must protect the interests of people despite the resistance of some sections," he said. Officials involved in drafting the bill said it's largely modelled on the Unlawful Religious Conversion Act enacted by UP last year. While the law prescribes stringent clauses such as 10 years imprisonment for coercing people for religious conversion, its salient features include denial of quota benefits to converted Christians. If someone wants to convert to another religion, he has to forgo benefits of the previous religion," said KS Eshwarappa, minister for rural development and panchayat raj. Some BJP functionaries are reportedly suggesting a policy according to which the caste certificate of the converted should be modified and he will be mandated to declare his new religious status. Officials, however, said discussions are still at the nascent stage. "According to different rulings of the Supreme Court, a person's original caste will not change by religious conversion. While the government cannot deny benefits, his children may not be eligible since they acquire new religion by birth. These issues are being discussed," said an official. They said the new law mandates the person seeking conversion to declare he's taking the step on his own and the declaration must be ratified by the deputy commissioner. "All religious conversions will be registered like marriage registration. The list of those seeking conversion will be published and objections from relatives and other stakeholders will be invited before clearing applications," said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-religious-converts-likely-to-lose-government-benefits-quota/articleshow/88266502.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
