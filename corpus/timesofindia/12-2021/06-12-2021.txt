On November 29, apex court bench of Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari in two special leave petitions filed against the HC ruling said, “We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned judgment(s) passed by the high court. Special Leave Petitions are dismissed.” Maharashtra had issued three government resolutions dated 30th May, 2015, 30th June, 2015 and 3rd September, 2015, increasing the age of superannuation of the district health officers, civil surgeons and superior officers working in the public health department, from 58 years to 60 years on the ground of non-availability of medical officers and senior officers at General Hospitals, Sub District Hospitals and Rural Hospitals. Doctors who were medical officers and superior officers in state public health department, had challenged the age extension before Aurangabad bench of Bombay HC. A petition filed by Dr Sanjay Kadam and six others before the HC in 2018 argued that the age enhancement adversely affected the legitimate right to promotion of other deserving candidates.  They also alleged that the age extension was issued to “benefit some officers who are nearer and dearer, ministers and higher officers working at the Mantralaya.” They also had argued that for many years, the state had taken no effective steps to fill in the vacancies though they were available for promotion and a large number of candidates are available for fresh recruitment. More importantly, they had argued that the Maharashtra Civil Services (Pension) Rules 1982 prescribes the age of retirement, but does not empower the state government to increase the age limit of retirement of a government servant from 58 to 60 years merely via a GR. Before the SC, Advocate Shivaji Jadhav for SLP petitioner Dr Y S Chavan had questioned the HC order saying it had “created a bias and ambiguity by adversely affecting the career of the Petitioners and other similarly situated persons who were also not a party to the proceedings (before HC) and adverse order has been passed without even affording them an opportunity of hearing.” But senior counsel Vinay Navarre with advocate Shirish Deshpande for the original petitioner Dr Kadam and others--before the HC-- said that the HC had rightly held that such blanket decision could not, under the law, be taken as an executive fiat via a GR. For state counsel, S U Lalit and Rahul Chitnis appeared. The HC bench of Justices S V Gangapurwala and A S Kilor in a judgment on March 20, 2020 declared all three GRs to be invalid and set them aside but declined to interfere with officers already appointed under the age extension regime. “We are not inclined to unsettle the medical officers, civil surgeons and superior officers in public health department who are benefited by the said government resolutions, in view of the fact that they are not party before us and in view of present situation which has arisen because of Covid-19. However, we make it clear that the state government shall not grant further extension by way of executive instruction without the authority and power under the statute,” the HC had held. HC had also said, “Considering large vacancies in health department, it is expected that the state government should take necessary steps to fill in the vacancies expeditiously, in public interest." Dr Radhakrishna Pawar, president, district health officers' association, welcomed the SC order and said the state must fill in all vacancies. "There is a lot of frustration among officials who are working hard but have been denied promotions and growth. All 23 posts of deputy directors are currently vacant and senior officials are holding additional charge. This affects the overall efficiency and morale of the department," he said. Another district health official said that the GR for age extension was completely illegal, as held by the court, adding that “only 192 officials benefitted from the extension, not the public at large||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sc-dismisses-plea-against-nixing-of-two-years-age-extension-for-maharashtra-public-health-officers/articleshow/88109839.cms||Swati Deshpande

In a rare visit by senior Pakistan government officials, a delegation arrived from Islamabad Sunday to participate in a cyber security conference of SCO countries that India will host on December 7. This follows a visit to Pakistan by an India delegation in October for an anti-terror SCO exercise that sought to promote cooperation between the member states. The cyber security conference is being organised by India's National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) that had recently also hosted a regional meeting of NSAs on the Afghanistan situation. The 4 central Asian countries which are also full members of SCO had participated in India's Afghanistan conference that reflected, according to the government, regional consensus on major issues of regional stability and security. Except for China and Pakistan, all full SCO Members, including Russia, had attended the conference. Official sources said the invite to Pakistan for the conference was in keeping with the SCO Charter. In their efforts to tackle security threats and challenges, the SCO countries are currently considering establishing an SCO Information Security Centre in Kazakhstan. While India continues to maintain that Pakistan has done little to check cross-border terrorism, and has accused Islamabad of raising bilateral issues at SCO, it has simultaneously pledged, along with other Members, to conduct joint anti-terror exercises. The SCO conference will follow PM Narendra Modi's summit meeting with visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday. India believes that Russia, unlike China, has been sensitive to India's concerns related to cross-border terrorism. While Russia maintains that it is for India and Pakistan to resolve their differences, it also believes that the SCO forum should be used for what remains one of the organisation's main goals - strengthening mutual trust and neighbourliness among the member states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-hosts-pakistan-delegation-for-sco-meet/articleshow/88111226.cms||Sachin Parashar

A total of 127.93 crore doses have been administered across the country till Sunday, with over 85% of the 18+ population covered with at least one dose.

TheThe next month, the government stepped up its immunisation campaign by allowing anybody above 18 years to be vaccinated. The programme was affected by limited availability of vaccines in May and June but picked up thereafter. The country was severely hit by the second wave in April-May at a time when coverage was low. The coverage expanded rapidly with Centre bringing in new policy and supporting the industry to rapidly ramp up vaccination production. Currently, states have a stock of over 21 crore unutilised doses of Covid vaccines with them. Recently, the Centre again launched an intensive door to door vaccination campaign 'Har Ghar Dastak' aimed at maximising first dose coverage as well as ensuring that those who are due for second dose are vaccinated at the earliest. The coverage of both first and second dose of Covid vaccine have increased reasonably by 5.9% and 11.7%, respectively till end of November. The campaign started from November 3. Estimates show only 55% of the world population has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine so far.

One of the G-23 members who had recommended an organisational rehaul in Congress, Azad’s comments, in an interview to News18 channel, were directed at the “current generation” of leadership in Congress – Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra— rather than interim Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, with who he said he enjoys good relations. The charge of intolerance against Gandhi siblings is sure to annoy the leadership, which was already engaged in pushing back against TMC chief' Mamata Banerjee’s suggestion that Rahul Gandhi, abroad often, cannot claim to be the natural leader of an anti-BJP front. Azad left little doubt that his problem is only with the younger leadership whose working style, he suggested, was at odds with what was the practice under former PM, Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv. “When Rajiv ji joined politics, Indira Gandhi called both of us and told Rajiv ji that Ghulam Nabi can even say no to me, but that NO doesn’t mean disobeying or disrespect, that’s for the good of the party. Today, no one is ready to listen to that no. For saying ‘no’, you become nobody today,” he said. Read AlsoNot launching party but cannot predict future, says Ghulam Nabi AzadAmid his ongoing rallies in Jammu and Kashmir, and the speculations they have spawned, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said he is not launching a new party but cannot predict the future- a comment that leaves suspense about his future plans.The Congress veteran who said he is a “staunch Congressi” also said it hurts him (and other leaders) when their advice is not heeded. “We give suggestions for the overall improvement of the party. None of us wants any posts in the party. All we want is that the performance of the party should improve…This is a time when the ruling party is strong and the opposition is weak. A weak opposition benefits the ruling party,” Azad said. In the headlines for his recent comments about Congress not likely to win 300 seats, Azad said the only time the party won a large mandate such as that was when Indira Gandhi helmed the party, or under the stewardship of Narasimha Rao. “It is for everyone to see,” he said, about the Congress’ subsequent decline. The Congress veteran also expressed concerns over the lack of “time limit” for holding organisational elections in recent years, saying elections which were once held every year, then extended to two and five years, and are now pushed forward endlessly.

It also asked the tribes to hoist black flags in morungs (men’s dormitory) at the festival.

The 1958 law gives extra-judicial powers to security forces during anti-militancy operations, including “shoot to kill”. It is in force in J&K, Nagaland and parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Manipur. The law, according to human rights activists and politicians, has allowed soldiers to commit with impunity excesses like “massacre, torture and rape”. Immediately after the killings, the chorus against AFSPA became louder, with several groups calling for its withdrawal. Posters went up at Nagaland’s signature annual event, the Hornbill Festival in Kohima demanding withdrawal of the law. The “draconian” AFSPA has given security forces the “licence to kill” and no soldier involved in killing civilians have ever been charged or put behind bars, Binalakshmi Nepram, the founder of Manipur Women Gun Survivors’ Network and Global Alliance of Indigenous Peoples, told PTI. Saturday’s shooting brought back memories of the killing of 10 civilians at Malom Makha Leikai in Manipur capital Imphal in 2000. The ‘Malom Massacre’ prompted a 28-year-old Irom Sharmila to begin a 16-year hunger-strike against AFSPA. The law was extended to the whole of Nagaland for six more months from June 30 this year. Home of India’s longest running insurgency, Nagaland has been quieter than before since its most influential outfit NSCN (IM) began peace talks with the Centre and signed a ceasefire in 1997. “Notwithstanding the ongoing Indo-Naga political dialogue, violence against the Nagas continues unabated. This is unfortunate,” the outfit said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-killing-of-civilians-chorus-against-draconian-armed-forces-law-gets-louder/articleshow/88111730.cms||Prabin Kalita

Shah said his party will never try to destabilise the state government while exuding confidence that it will come to power with a two-third majority in the state in the 2023 Assembly polls. He also called upon party leaders to “overthrow” the “useless and corrupt” Congress government in the state. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot had earlier accused BJP of the bid to destabilise the state government after his former deputy Sachin Pilot rebelled against him in July last year. “They are always in fear that their government will collapse. Who is going to topple the government? No one…but why are you doing this; that your own people are running away,” Shah said at a meeting with party leaders here. The home minister targeted the state government over several issues, including law and order, corruption and unemployment. He alleged that the state government has stopped several public welfare schemes introduced by the previous BJP government led by Vasundhara Raje and creating hurdles in the implementation of central schemes.

Addressing an Indian Ocean conference in Abu Dhabi, Jaishankar said, “A world of more decentralised globalisation obviously offers greater opportunities to many more nations. These would be accentuated by a stronger desire to foster localisation and promote regionalism.” He added, “Whether it is the Indo-Pacific, Afghanistan or the Gulf, we are seeing more players, greater localisation and arrangements of pragmatism. We are now entering a world of greater plurilateralism, one that recognises the shortcomings of multilateralism, the limits of bilateralism and the untenability of unilateralism...” The Quad, AUKUS, the new West Asia Quad, Indian Oceans Initiative and even the Abraham Accords, he said, have opened the door to greater international cooperation within smaller groupings and within regions. Making a case for multipolarity, he said the US’ “changed strategic posture” has made it a more realistic power, more amenable to partnerships. But “American withdrawal from Afghanistan … leaves both the immediate and extended region grappling with serious concerns about terrorism, radicalism, instability, narco-trafficking and governance practices.” On the other hand, China’s extraordinary growth has given the world a superpower challenger in more ways than one — one that is deeply embedded in the global economy but showcasing an internal system that is very different.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indo-pacific-afghanistan-show-we-are-entering-a-world-of-plurilateralism-jaishankar/articleshow/88111801.cms||---

India recorded 61,149 new cases of the virus during November 29-December 5, the lowest weekly count since May 2020. The week saw cases fall by 3.3% over the previous week, when 63,267 infections were recorded. Last week, Covid cases in the country had declined by 12%, falling below the 70,000 mark for the first time since the last week of May last year. In the current week, states still reporting a relatively large count of fresh cases continued to record a fall in numbers, which led to the overall tally coming down. Among these states, Kerala recorded only a slight drop of 1.5%, with this week’s cases, at 32,212, nearly the same as the number last week (32,705). Maharashtra logged 4,930 new cases, a drop of 15% over the previous week (5,803) while Bengal reported 13% less cases this week (4,390) than in the preceding seven days (5,022). Tamil Nadu too saw infection decline by 2.8%, with 5,049 cases reported during the current week. However, in a worrying sign, as many as nine states and UTs posted a rise of 10% or more in weekly cases. Karnataka recorded a 25% increase in numbers, with cases rising from 2,001 last week to 2,499. Neighbouring Telangana also saw numbers rise by 26%, rising from 1,059 to 1,329. Delhi logged a 146% increase in new infections during the week, although the overall numbers were still low at 492. Last week, the capital had posted 200 fresh cases. At 309, Gujarat posted a relatively small number of new cases, but this was a 53% jump from the previous week’s tally of 202. Likewise, Uttar Pradesh’s weekly tally was just 101, but the number was twice the tally reported in the preceding seven days (50). Other states and UTs that saw numbers rise in the current week were Goa (up 50%), Sikkim (122%), Jharkhand 12% and J&K (10%). Overall, Kerala continued to dominate Covid numbers, accounting for 53% of all cases recorded in the country during the week. In the previous week, the state had reported a 18% fall in cases. Meanwhile, the country reported 4,746 deaths during the week, a 64% rise from the previous week’s toll of 2,887. However, nearly half of the numbers this week, more than 2,200, were old fatalities added to the toll by Bihar. Kerala too continued to report a large number of old deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/weekly-cases-still-falling-but-9-states/uts-report-a-spike/articleshow/88111821.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

There is “intense pressure” on security forces to deliver after Colonel Viplav Tripathi, his wife, son and four soldiers were killed in a well-planned ambush — the deadliest in the last six years — by insurgents in Manipur on November 13, officials said on Sunday. Read Also1. 15 dead in Nagaland as security operation goes awryAt least 13 tribal villagers were killed by special security forces in the Tiru-Oting area under Nagaland's Mon district in a tragically botched operation late on Saturday. That triggered a mob retaliation in which a jawan was also killed. Another civilian died in the district on Sunday when forcesThe Army’s 3 Corps and Assam Rifles said the “specific” operation on Saturday was mounted on the basis of “credible intelligence of likely movement of insurgents” in a truck on the Oting-Tiru road. The Mon district, which shares the porous border with Myanmar, is the stronghold of Yung Aung faction of the banned NSCN (K). A top home ministry official will visit Nagaland on Monday to hold meetings with all stakeholders, even as defence minister Rajnath Singh, home minister Amit Shah, Army chief General M M Naravane and others were briefed about the incident. “It looks like a case of mistaken identity,” said an official. “The security forces probably had faulty intelligence, which was not properly corroborated and verified in the rush to lay the ambush. There is also the possibility that the civilians on the truck unfortunately came into the ambush zone before the insurgents. Things do sometimes go wrong in such situations,” added another officer. A poster at the venue of the hornbill festival in Nagaland’s Kisama on Sunday seeks the withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act The probe by the state government’s special investigation team (SIT) and the Army’s court of inquiry, however, should quickly establish how the operation went awry, along with the exact sequence of events, and fix responsibility for strict action against those responsible. Otherwise, said an official, the incident could trigger another round of high-intensity militancy in the region. As it is, Chinese-made illegal weapons like AK-47 assault rifles, machine guns, anti-tank mines and grenades are flowing in from across the Myanmar border.

The state said it had “no knowledge of any conversation having taken place” between him and incumbent director general of police Sanjay Pandey, and only learnt of the alleged exchange when Singh filed the petition. Singh is no whistleblower, contrary to his claim in the SLP, the state said, adding that it has approved initiation of disciplinary proceedings against him under the All-India Service (Discipline and Appeal) Rules of 1969, and issued him the charges of alleged misconduct or misbehaviour and lists of documents and witnesses.

Singh earlier avoided two ED summons while he was inThe SC bench of Justices S K Kaul and MM Sundresh will hear the SLP on Monday. The state said the Bombay high court order of September 16, which Singh seeks to challenge before the SC, is correct. It added that HC’s dismissal of Singh’s petition against two preliminary enquiries against him in April-—to be conducted by Pandey—were on grounds of maintainability. The state said validity or allegations of ‘malafides’ of its orders to conduct preliminary enquiries falls within ambit of ‘service matters’ which can be challenged before the Central Administrative Tribunal, as held by the HC. Singh, in a letter to the CBI on April 19, had alleged that Pandey had offered to mediate and had advised him to withdraw his March 20 letter to the chief minister against then home minister Anil Deshmukh. The affidavit by V M Bhat, joint secretary of state home department, said such conversations, if any, are of “a purely personal nature” and “not at the instance” of the state. In any case, the state said, CBI is investigating the conversations as is evident from the summons it had issued on September 18 to the DGP, hence rendering the SLP infructuous. The state’s affidavit, settled by its advocate Rahul Chitnis, made it clear that this contention is “without prejudice” to its petition pending before the HC where it has sought transfer of the probe into CBI’s April 21 FIR against Deshmukh and unknown others to a court-monitored special investigation team on the grounds that the CBI probe “is biased given the director (of CBI) Subodh Jaiswal is a witness and a possible accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/param-bir-not-whistleblower-says-maharashtra-government-affidavit-in-apex-court/articleshow/88111917.cms||Swati Deshpande

Productivity in the opening week fell to 47.7%, but covered some ground on Thrusday and Friday, when the House sat for 33 minutes beyond its scheduled time and recorded a 95% productivity. On Friday, this improved further with the House transacting 100% of its scheduled business, including the Private Members’ Business for the full scheduled time of two and half hours. This, in fact, was a first in nearly two years and after 66 sittings. The last time the Rajya Sabha conducted the complete Private Members’ Business was on February 7, 2020 during the Budget session, in the the 251st session of the House. Private Members’ Business was suspended in the 252nd session to accommodate other business. No business could be transacted on Fridays in the last session due to disruptions. Making up for lost time, Rajya Sabha saw 22 Private Members’ Bills being introduced including one seeking to amend the Preamble of the Constitution, which was put on hold. However, it remains to be seen whether the business will run as per schedule with the suspension impasse still on. Last week, Rajya Sabha chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu had discussed the matter with opposition leaders and ministers and urged both sides to discuss their stated views on suspension of the 12 opposition MPs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/winter-session-in-1st-week-rajya-sabha-lost-over-50-of-sitting-time/articleshow/88112038.cms||Swati Mathur

The scientific exercise will answer two critical questions: Can this variant impact the efficacy of Covishield and Covaxin; and will it outfight existing antibodies in those who have had Covid illness from old strains? Read AlsoA test to find out if Omicron affects vaccine efficacyThe first step Scientists at the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV), Pune, have initiated efforts to isolate and grow the Omicron strain of the novel coronavirus from a patient’s throat/nasal swab sample. The exercise will answer two“ICMR-NIV received the positive sample of the Dombivali man whose genome sequencing confirmed the infection from Omicron strain on Saturday. “Isolating the whole Omicron strain from the sample is going to take at least a week. Thereafter, we will be able to take up a neutralisation study to assess the efficacy of Covaxin- and Covishield-induced antibodies and natural infection-induced antibodies against the lab-grown strain,” said an ICMR official. The isolation and culturing of the Omicron strain are going to be the first step towards finding answers to these questions. “Once we have isolated the whole strain and grown a sufficient amount of it in our lab, scientists will be able to take up the neutralisation study to assess vaccine efficacy,” the official said. Read AlsoExpert: Covishield, Covaxin may offer protection against OmicronPUNE: Covishield and Covaxin jabs can prevent hospitalisation and death of patients infected with the new Botswana variant Omicron (B.1.1.529), novel coronavirus’s most mutated version as yet, a noted infectious diseases expert has said. “Theoretically, it is possible that the new variant of concernA neutralisation study is the best way to assess vaccine efficacy and chances of reinfection. Through this study, scientists will also be in a position to compare the ‘level’ of neutralising ability against existing strains and the new variant. “And beyond cell-culture experiments, the protective ability of vaccine-induced as well as natural infection-induced antibodies can be studied in animal models against the new variant. A positive correlation will increase the confidence in vaccines,” said another virologist. Infection by any strain of SARS-CoV-2 kicks off an immune response against the entire virus, and not just against certain parts such as its ‘spikes’. This is why many experts believe mutations are unlikely to affect vaccine-induced protection. There are 1,273 amino acids on the SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein that triggers the immune response. The new Omicron variant has 32 amino acid changes or mutations in the S protein. So, the assumption that vaccines will offer protection against the new strain sounds logical, experts said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/to-test-vaccine-efficacy-icmr-isolating-omicron-strain/articleshow/88112063.cms||Umesh Isalkar

In July the BMC had asked Sood to convert his Juhu hotel back into a residential building and remove any unauthorised construction that has been carried out in the building. Sood had told the BMC in July that he would on his own restore the building. However, a new BMC notice issued by the K-West ward last month said that Sood had not yet restored the building. “You have stated in your letter….that you discontinued the activity of lodging/boarding in the existing 1st to 6th floors of the building and it shall be used for residential purposes as per sanctioned plan. Also you have mentioned that necessary work for addition/alteration/restoration is under progress …this office has inspected the site on 20.10.2021 and it is observed that you have not yet restored the work as per approved plan,” the BMC notice reads.  When contacted Sood however said that he had already converted the Shakti Sagar building on Juhu’s AB Nair Road into a residential structure from a hotel. “We have already carried out the restoration. We have submitted the details to the BMC and the documentation process is underway. I am not carrying out any unauthorised activity and it will remain a residential structure as per the approved plan,” Sood told TOI.  Activist Ganesh Kusmulu who had filed a complaint with the Lokayukta against Sood said that the police must register an FIR against Sood. “The restoration has not taken place. The hotel has been converted into a girls hostel now. This also amounts to change of use. The BMC is not carrying out demolition despite the Lokayukta’s order. The BMC is only issuing notices and delaying the demolition action,” Kusumulu said.  Sood had allegedly converted the building into a hotel without necessary permission from the BMC. Earlier this year Sood, after getting a rap from the Bombay High Court (HC) and withdrawing his petition before the Supreme Court, Sood had agreed to restore the building from an unauthorised hotel back into a residential premises.  The BMC gave Sood to restore the structure as per the approved plan within seven days failing which action would be taken without further intimation, the notice said.

Till November 23, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had issued 756 CPLs and with over a month to go, the year will end at a higher number. The previous high, 744, was seen in pre-pandemic 2019, with the figure falling to 578 last year due to lockdowns, reports Saurabh Sinha. “The pandemic has seen airlines lay off pilots, slash their salaries and delay payments, yet that did not dampen the spirits of budding pilots, despite the steep cost of training to become a pilot. The general feeling is that the pandemic will someday be over, travel will be back, people will fly and pilots needed,” said a senior official about the record-setting 2021. Krishnendu Gupta, director of the government-run Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi (IGRUA) near Lucknow, told TOI he saw tremendous interest in choosing this path during the pandemic. “Every year there are some candidates from the selected list who do not turn up to join the CPL course and we have to turn to names in the first and second standby lists. This year everyone on the merit list turned up to join the course and we did not have to go to the standby lists. I am told other flying training organisations (FTO) had the same experience,” Gupta said. He added it takes about two years to earn a CPL with the cost ranging from Rs 37-38 lakh to Rs 47 lakh for the course fee. A CPL from government-run IGRUA costs Rs 45 lakh. Share of DGCA CPLs being issued to cadets from foreign FTOs has declined this year due to international travel restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-hit-airline-sector-but-not-pilot-dreams/articleshow/88112124.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Only 4 of 346 rich govt temples audit accounts||BENGALURU: Only four of the 346 top category temples governed by the Karnataka endowment department have been diligently auditing funds every year and the rest of them — including famous shrines such as Kukke Subramanya and Kolluru Mookambika temples — have been irregular with the exercise. With some temples not conducting audit for 10-15 years, the state government has instructed all temples coming under categories A and B to submit pending audits by January 30 or face action. The endowment department controls 34,563 temples. Of them, 207 are A-category (with annual income of a minimum of Rs 25 lakh) and 139 are B-category (annual earnings between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 24.99 lakh). Of these, the 34,217 temples with annual income of less than Rs 5 lakh are not required to conduct audits. After a meeting of the department's executive officers on November 16, the government found out that only four — Banashankari temple in Bengaluru; Ghati Subramanya temple; Chamundeshwari temple in Mysuru; and Yediyur Siddalingeshwara temple, all in A-category — have been submitting audit reports. The office of endowment commissioner Rohini Sindhuri issued an order on November 23, directing all executive officers to conduct and submit pending audits by January 30 and give responses for questions about management of income and assets of the respective temples. "Failing this, action would be initiated against the officers as per the Karnataka Civil Service (Conduct) Rules and the Endowment Act. In cases where it is found that the temples have suffered a revenue loss on account of officers' laxity, the said loss amount will be recovered from the respective officers," the order reads. Calls to Rohini went unanswered. Endowment minister Shashikala Jolle said there must be transparency since these temples collectively earn hundreds of crores each year. "These temples get donations from lakhs of devotees — both in kind (jewellery, gold, etc) and in cash — to whom we must be answerable. There has to be transparency in the way these earnings are used and people should know these details. It's shocking (that many temples have not been auditing accounts)," she said, adding the government is ready to grant more time to audit accounts in bona-fide cases. A back-of-the-envelope calculation of the lowest amount these temples collect collectively each year throws up a figure of Rs 59 crore. However, department officials said that just one of the top temples in the A category earns more than that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/only-4-of-346-rich-govt-temples-audit-accounts/articleshow/88112127.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||Bengaluru||Kodigehalli underbridge flooding due to unfinished work: BBMP||BENGALURU: Of the eight railway underbridges that it maintains, only the one at Kodigehalli is prone to flooding, claimed BBMP. The civic body, however, said flooding happens because the underbridge is still under construction. During the recent long spells of rain in the city, only Kodigehalli underbridge saw flooding, the Palike said. The underbridge is being built and its drains are still not functional. This, say officials, is leading to water-logging every time there is moderate to heavy rain. The railways, which is constructing the underbridge, has missed a few deadlines, but as per the latest one, work is slated to get over by December 31, said BS Prahalad, chief engineer, road infrastructure division, BBMP. However, a top official from the railways said: “Earlier, there was a level-crossing at the spot. Work was taken up to construct a railway underbridge. The deadline was November this year, but we couldn’t complete it due to rain. We will need two more months to finish this project. So, it is likely to be completed in January 2022. Drain and service road works are pending.” Besides the eight railway underbridges, the civic body is also the custodian of 24 underpasses. These include the ones at Mekhri Circle, KR Circle and Madiwala. Twelve of these underpasses come along ORR (Outer Ring Road). “The underpasses and underbridges are maintained with an annual budget of Rs 20 crore. Maintenance work has ensured smooth flow of traffic without water-logging,” said Prahalad. Maintenance checklistUnderpass or underbridge maintenance work includes checking if drains are desilted and unclogged, if water entering drains through gratings is reaching the end point, painting retaining walls and filling potholes. “The drains can easily handle 70mm of rain per hour and even a little more. However, flooding occurs when there is over 100mm of rain per hour, which is nothing but a cloud burst causing flash floods. In such cases, water recedes after 30 to 45 minutes and can sometimes even take an hour...,” explained Prahalad. Prahalad said when the annual maintenance work is taken up, strength of the gratings is also checked. “A good grating lasts close to five years and a very good and well-maintained one can last for nearly ten years. It also depends on the density of traffic and if heavy vehicles frequent the road,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-underbridge-flooding-due-to-unfinished-work/articleshow/88112130.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

Operating on a ‘buy-a-seat’ basis, the new chopper service will be available on all days of the week except on Tuesday and Wednesday. The service is hosted by BLADE India, an urban air mobility platform, in collaboration with BLADE New York and Delhi-based venture capital firm Hunch Ventures. BLADE began chopper operations in Maharashtra in 2019, flying passengers from Mumbai to Pune to Shirdi. In Karnataka, it launched private charter services covering Bengaluru, Kodagu, Kabini, Chikkamagaluru and Hampi on December 18, 2020. BLADE will provide chopper services from Jakkur at noon and passengers can reach Kabinie and Kodagu in an hour. By road, it usually takes 6-7 hours to reach Kodgau. The aim is to connect congested and inaccessible ground routes through an efficient and affordable air transport system. The fare for a one-way ride from Bengaluru to both destinations is Rs 16,000 per seat. The company said it wants to provide flyers an all-round holistic experience by taking care of everything, including baggage facilities, ground transfer and partner benefits. Amit Dutta, MD of BLADE India, said, “Karnataka boasts of some of the most beautiful destinations in the country, but their accessibility is a pain point. Six to seven hours of road travel from Bengaluru eats into the precious time travellers could otherwise spend enjoying their holiday.” For flight schedules from Bengaluru and routes, log on to www.flyblade.in||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/take-chopper-ride-from-jakkur-to-kabini-kodagu/articleshow/88112132.cms||---

The comprehensive mobility plan, ironically prepared by BMRCL in 2019, had proposed five major measures. It said Metro operations should aim to minimise end-to-end trip duration and maximise ridership with improved connectivity to station catchment areas. The measures: One, introduction of monthly subscriptions, 10-ticket sets and other products to give discounted fares to regular commuters. Two, improve operational and fare integration with public bus services for last-mile connectivity. Three, better access to Metro stations through elevated walkways to key economic centres up to 1km away and development of pedestrian footpaths and bicycle lanes within that catchment zone. Four, transit hubs at stations by integration of bus stops, IPT (intermediate public transport) bays and bicycle parking, as well as electric charging infrastructure. Five, real-time passenger information systems, crowd management mechanisms and easy-to-access last-mile modes. With ridership unlikely to touch pre-Covid numbers anytime soon, especially with work-from-home arrangement, activists say Metro systems in Chennai and Kochi have come up with discounts and monthly passes for passengers to increase patronage. K Pradeep, a techie from Mahadevapura who filed multiple RTIs with BMRCL, said, “It’s high time BMRCL introduced monthly passes at an affordable rate. This will mainly benefit daily-wage workers and others while also encouraging more people to switch to public transport. If there is more footfall at the stations, BMRCL could earn more non-farebox revenue as well. When other Metro systems can launch monthly passes, why can’t BMRCL?” A BMRCL official said introduction of monthly passes is a policy decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bmrcls-monthly-pass-proposal-remains-on-paper/articleshow/88112133.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

However, to his utter dismay, defects showed up on the device’s lens and Roy decided to take it to an authorised service centre.  But when the service centre refused to help despite a warranty cover, the Bengalurean sued the camera maker. Now, a consumer court has ordered the company and owner of the shop to give the customer a new lens and pay him a compensation of Rs 35,000 for deficiency of service. On October 28, 2019 Roy purchased a Nikon Z6, a full-frame mirrorless camera, from Foto Circle, SC Road, near Anand Rao Circle for Rs 1,59,553. But much to Roy’s chagrin, within two months of the purchase, the new lens started malfunctioning. On December 28, 2019, Roy, 37, approached Nikon India Private Ltd’s Sampangi Rama Nagar service centre and the camera was taken for checking. The Bengaluruan demanded that Nikon grant him a fresh product as it was still under warranty. However, after the company denied him a new piece or a refund, Roy sent them a legal notice on June 22, 2020. He lodged a complaint with Bangalore Urban 2nd Additional District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Shantinagar against Nikon and Foto Circle. While Roy’s lawyer presented the case, Nikon’s attorney claimed the complainant was attempting to make wrongful gain from the camera giant and that he refused to pick up the repaired lens from the service centre. There was no manufacturing defect in the camera but a problem with the lens, which was replaced, the attorney added.  However, judges of the consumer forum noted that neither did Nikon produce the lens in court, nor exhibit the damages to the photography equipment for which the Bengalurean had paid over Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, Foto Circle failed to appear in court despite a notice and was declared as ex parte. In a verdict pronounced on November 10, 2021, the judges of the Bengaluru consumer court observed that it was established that there was no manufacturing defect in the camera, but the lens that was sold to the complainant was faulty. The court directed Nikon India Pvt Ltd and Foto Circle to replace the customer’s lens, apart from paying him a compensation of Rs 25,000 for deficiency of service and Rs 10,000 towards his court expenses, all within 60 days of the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/blurean-sues-camera-maker-for-faulty-lens-gets-replacement-and-35k-relief/articleshow/88112134.cms||Petlee Peter

Rejecting a writ appeal filed by Abdul Khader, a Bengalurean, the bench noted that in this case, the lease deed executed in his favour was subsequent to the deposit of title deeds by the landlord with the bank. Khader had challenged the proceedings initiated under SARFAESI Act, claiming that he held rights to the property in question by virtue of a two-year lease agreement dated February 12, 2018, after paying Rs 14 lakh to the landlord. Bank of Maharashtra had lent Rs 1.8 crore as housing loan to Sadath Ali Siddiqui, owner of the property, and initiated proceedings under SARFAESI Act for taking possession. Khader challenged this in court. However, the bank contended that the owner had, on November 3, 2017, executed a mortgage deed and the bank had secured the assets by the deposit of title deed vis-a-vis the housing loan. The bench said in case there is any breach in lease agreement, it will give rise to civil consequences and redressal has to be worked out before the competent civil court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/secured-creditor-holds-first-right-over-property-court/articleshow/88112137.cms||---

To keep up with the fast-paced growth around, she said, it is the need of the hour to remain updated and have the zeal to learn. She compared it to investing in the stock market for the longer run – “the longer term gains will always outweigh the shorter ones and you should think of your career exactly like that.”Arun Sreelalan, principal technical product manager at Bajaj Finserv Health, emphasised the importance of being data literate. “Innovations such as cab hailing with Ola and Uber have been made possible by the huge amounts of data that power their algorithms. Our lives are now hugely dependent and, in a way, running smoothly, because of Google maps, and that in turn enables platforms like Swiggy and Zomato,” he said.You could be in finance, HR or operations, he said, you need to be data literate.

Ravi Kumar, who is president and deputy COO, has got additional responsibilities of immigration, cyber security, procurement and the India business unit. Kumar, who is based in the US, has been president for three years now. He leads the global services organisation and is accelerating Infosys’ localisation strategy in the US. The other president, Mohit Joshi, who leads the financial services & healthcare/life sciences businesses, as also the products & platforms business Edgeverve, now has the additional responsibility of information systems and computers and communications. CFO Nilanjan Roy will also look into infrastructure, facilities, physical security. EVP Karmesh Vaswani, who leads consumer goods and tech and retail, will take the additional responsibility for quality. Group HR head Krish Shankar will also get talent acquisition. Group general counsel Inderpreet Sawhney will also be in charge of privacy and data protection. Rafee Tarafdar, the unit technology officer and who heads the strategic technology group, will be redesignated CTO and will report to Kumar. An email sent to Infosys on the changes did not elicit a response till the time of going to the press. Infosys had begun the exercise of collapsing roles and delayering the organisation some time ago. Experts believe it ties into the larger strategy of keeping the organisation less top-heavy in order to build more agility. In 2019-20, the company had reduced the number of title holders (VPs, SVPs, EVPs) to 926, from 971 at the end of the year before. Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based IT advisory HfS Research, said there is a clear move from service providers to remove layers of management and complexity as they seek to make decisions faster with fewer points of authorisation. “Most major IT services firms no longer have a COO role. It will be interesting to see whether this executing committee can work together effectively, especially with Ravi Kumar and Mohit Joshi so busy on client engagements. However, these leaders have both been in the firm for two decades and know the workings and culture of the firm inside and out. It is worth adding that with Ravi in the US and Mohit in the UK, this extends more decision-making authority to crucial client locations, which can help when needing to move fast on immediate customer need,” he said. For Pravin Rao, it’s the end of a 35-year-long innings at Infosys. He worked under many leaders including NR Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani and with many chairpersons of the board including K V Kamath. Rao was inducted as COO and a whole-time director on the Board in 2014. An electrical engineer from Bangalore University, Rao joined Infosys in 1986 on a salary of Rs 1,500. Infosys co-founders Murthy and NS Raghavan interviewed him for the job. He was part of the core team that set up the offshore delivery centre for GE and won a big contract from Reebok France to set up their information management system. The defining moment of his career was as the unit head of retail, CPG and logistics (RCL), the first vertical to be formed in Infosys in 2002. He brought in accounts such as Tesco, Walmart, Nordstrom and GAP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/as-coo-rao-retires-infy-drops-role-splits-tasks/articleshow/88112144.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

The 22-year-old’s fourth ITF title will help her move some 50 places in the WTA ranking to around the 720-mark. “I am thankful to be playing again and making my comeback with a victory, it feels great,” said the champion, who spent much of the last two years recovering from a back injury.It was Bavisetti, however, who looked the stronger of the two players on court at the start of the title clash. The left-hander from Hyderabad swung freely, stepping into the court and going for the lines, she won three successive games from 2-3 to take a 5-3 lead.Some strong serving and decisive shot-making then helped Yadlapalli pull one back on serve. The fourth seed then followed that up with a stirring counter to start of the tenth game where she levelled scores at five games apiece. Yadlapalli, claiming better court position in the midst of a three-game charge, saw her momentum interrupted somewhat when Bavisetti took a medical timeout.Bavisetti, who played three matches on Saturday, the doubles semis and final, following her long-drawn upset win over the top-seeded Rutuja Bhosale in the singles semifinals, was a tad off the pace as the match progressed. In the 12th game, she surrendered her serve and set to Yadlapalli.Yadlapalli, now on a five-game streak, saw her charge stalled when Bavisetti pulled off a tough hold to level at one-all in the second set. The fourth seed then struck in the sixth game, taking a 4-2 lead. Yadlapalli’s right arm required attention from the physio following the seventh game, but that didn’t stop her from breaking for the title when she returned to the court.Yadlapalli said, “When I was 3-5 down, I thought I should give my best and try to win in two sets as she is a good player and could have made a comeback anytime. I was taking it easy and putting the ball on the court and only going for big shots when I felt confident.”Result: Final: Pranjala Yadlapalli (Ind) bt Sowjanya Bavisetti (Ind) 7-5, 6-2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/feisty-pranjala-emerges-triumphant/articleshow/88112145.cms||---

It is like saying do not eat food for some days. Faith is the background in which all good works are done. To say you do not have prayers is not the way. On the other hand, if they had fortified every church, every place, that would have given them a lot of credit,” he said. The archbishp was speaking on the sidelines of the release of a fact-finding report by the Association for Protection of Civil Rights on attacks against Christians. The report is a compilation of attacks on Christians across the country, according to which, in the past one year, 91 incidents were reported. These range from the Roorkee Church violence in October 2020 to nuns being attacked in Mau, Uttar Pradesh.“Till now, attacks against Christians used to happen in interior places, like in North Karnataka where they are a minority. Now, they are happening in areas like Hubballi, Dharwad and Mangaluru, which means people are taking law in their hands. Certain attitude of the government shows this is allowed and can go on. This is sad. If the government can put down its feet and say there’s a rule of the land, these things will not happen,” he said.‘Christians will suffer if anti-conversion bill passed’According to him, there is so much trouble even though the anti-conversion bill has not yet been passed. “If passed, it will trouble all of us and leave us helpless. This bill was passed in Odisha in 1967. After 30 years, the state was burning. Over 300 churches were burnt, 3,000 houses were set on fire and 67 people died. It will cause a similar situation here too. I request the government to not pass the bill as it will trouble the Christian community,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/archbishop-flays-police-order-against-holding-prayers-in-halls/articleshow/88112141.cms||---

Drivers say the price of auto LPG has now touched Rs 69.5 a litre, up from Rs 66 last month. In fact, LPG prices have been spiralling of late, from Rs 31.51 a litre in May 2020 to Rs 58.18 in October 2021. This neutralises the hike in passenger fare. The minimum auto fare has increased from Rs 25 (for the first 1.9km) to Rs 30 (for 2km) and for every additional km, from Rs 13 to Rs 15. “Auto LPG prices are rising every month. The fare revision is not adequate if the Centre keeps this up. The government should regulate prices or provide financial subsidies to convert existing autos into CNG or electric ones. Already, our business has reduced because of Covid-19,” said M Manjunath, an auto driver. Auto drivers need to spend nearly Rs 1,000 on recalibration of existing meters according to the revised fares. A driver will have to pay Rs 350 to the legal metrology department to get a certificate that the meter is recalibrated. Meter manufactures/dealers are supposed to charge Rs 250 for repairs. “We conducted a meeting and fixed these rates and capped the total charge at Rs 600,” said an official. However, BV Raghavendra of Autorickshaw Drivers Union said: “Many meter repairers are fleecing auto drivers for calibration. Instead of Rs 250, they are charging Rs 500-600.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/lpg-hike-meter-revision-charges-irk-auto-drivers/articleshow/88112135.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

The accused is V Narayana, a resident of Vinobanagar near Kalasipalyam. The victim was Nivesh Kumar K, who had come to Bengaluru from Tamil Nadu in search of a job and was staying at his uncle Loganadham’s house in Vinobanagar. Police said between November 27 and 29, Loganadham and his family members had gone out of Bengaluru on some work leaving Nivesh at home. When Loganadham returned to the city, he couldn’t find Nivesh. Meanwhile, around 8am on November 28, an injured Nivesh walked into Victoria Hospital. Doctors treated him but he succumbed to injuries by 10am the same day.

Addressing the ‘Vijaya Sankalpa’ convention organised by the BJP in Anekal, he claimed the Congress has fielded “moneybags who have paid to the party fund.” “The fall in moral standards of the Congress is very clear. People should show the party its place as it is trying to win the elections through immoral splurge of money,” he alleged. Reacting to opposition leader Siddaramaiah’s allegation of the BJP using money and muscle power to win elections, Bommai said: “What moral right does Siddaramaiah have to say that when his party has fielded moneybags as candidates? He did not do anything to help gram panchayats when he was in power. His promise to distribute one lakh houses remained a mere promise.” He said the BJP government has taken steps to build one lakh homes in urban areas and four lakh homes in villages, and they would be completed in a year and half. Vision document for AnekalThe chief minister added that comprehensive development of Bengaluru is possible only if adjoining gram panchayat areas are well- developed. “Many entrepreneurs are showing interest in investing in Anekal. Our government will prepare an exclusive ‘Anekal Vision’ document fordevelopment of the suburb, on the lines of Bengaluru Vision,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/congress-fielded-moneybags-to-win-council-polls-says-bommai/articleshow/88112180.cms||---

Several retired teachers recently represented to the university to clear retiral dues in their lifetime. The Raj Bhavan had earlier directed each university to hold monthly ‘pension adalat’ at the university headquarters. According to MU registrar Prof P K Verma, the university has settled at least 350 cases of the retired teachers related to fixation of their pension, payment of arrears and other retiral dues during the past three months. The university has set up a cell at the university headquarters in Bodh Gaya under the direct supervision of the acting VC, Prof B N Singh, to look after the teachers’ welfare issues. Prof P B Lall, who had retired from B D College in 2002, has not been paid his dues so far. Even his provident fund, earned leave and other arrears were not released by the university despite several reminders, Lall said. Prof V D Singh of B D College and Prof Yogendra Prasad of J N Lal College echoed similar feelings. Several teachers, who retired from JD Women’s College, Arvind Mahila College, J N Lal College, Khagaul and B D College, have not been paid their gratuity or arrears so far. According to the registrar, the university has worked out details about pending cases of the retired teaching and non-teaching staff. “After assuming the charge in August this year, I held several meetings with the university officials to settle pending cases of the retired teachers and non-teaching staff on priority. Now, the harassed retired teachers need not rush to university for getting their retirement benefits,” he said, adding the university would release all dues to them soon after getting funds from the government. Meanwhile, the university, which has prepared a blueprint of the new education policy under the supervision of MBA coordinator Prof Risa Singh, is likely to execute it from the next academic session 2022-23, the registrar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mu-to-resume-pension-adalat/articleshow/88109875.cms||Kumod Verma

Justifying this year’s theme, ‘Halt soil salinization, boost soil productivity’ on the World Soil Day on Sunday, they felt an urgent need to raise awareness about maintaining healthy ecosystems and human well-being by addressing the growing challenges in soil management and fighting soil salinization. Patna University (PU) botany department teacher Birendra Prasad said soil salinization is a major soil degradation process threatening the ecosystem and it is recognized as one of the most important global problems for agricultural production, food security and sustainability in arid unexpected surplus rainfall since mid-June in the catchment areas of major rivers in the state and neighbouring Nepal, resulting in floods and consequent soil erosion. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University’s soil scientist Shankar Jha pointed out that 37% of the land area in the country stands degraded mainly due to soil salinization. In Bihar, approximately 3.2 lakh hectares of agricultural land have been degraded due to salinization. The salt-affected soil occupies a major area of Samastipur, Siwan, Muzaffarpur, Gopalganj, Vaishali, Saran, East Champaran and West Champaran districts. Salt-affected soil has serious impact on soil functions, including decrease in agricultural productivity, deterioration of water quality, loss of soil biodiversity and acceleration of soil erosion process. Salt-affected soil reduces both the ability of crops to take up water and the availability of micronutrients, he added. Bihar State Environment Impact Assessment Authority chairman Atul Aditya Pandey said soil and water pollution are closely connected. Rapid urbanisation, untreated sewage, industrial effluents and toxic waste material are responsible for fast deteriorating health of soil. Over the years, the excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides has also resulted in soil degradation. to degrade. “We should focus on switching over to organic farming for maintaining the health of the soil as well as the human beings,” he said. Course coordinator of PU environmental science department, D K Paul, said soil is degraded by various anthropogenic activities such as dumping of solid wastes, water pollution, deforestation and indiscriminate use of pesticides and fertilizers to increase productivity. Efficient resource management and crop/livestock improvement for evolving better breeds can help overcome salinity stress. Hence, we must minimize soil pollutants and encourage the use of bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-plead-for-awareness-to-improve-soil-health-in-bihar/articleshow/88109882.cms||B K Mishra

Recently, following a drop in the number of cases and high vaccination numbers, these sectors were witnessing the green shoots of recovery, however, the fear of Omicron has again caused fear for those in the hospitality industry, with many tourists cancelling their advance bookings and hotel room reservations. According to stakeholders in the tourism industry, December 15 to January 5 is the peak tourism period. However, now they fear that due to the Omicron variant emerging, many tourists may not turn up this year. C Narayana Gowda, Mysuru District Hotel Owners Association president, said that for the tourism sector, the period is crucial. “In the last couple of days, around 30% of the advance bookings have been cancelled, while the number of tourists arriving here has come down by 50%,” he said. “Unverified information is causing problems for the tourism sector. We request people not to panic,” he said. B S Prashanth, honorary president of Mysuru Travels Association, echoed a similar fear. “Many are cancelling their foreign package trips after this new variant emerged. We are witnessing the effect of the new variant, due to unverified information being spread,” he said. Even though tourism in Kodagu has not seen any decline or cancellation, since the Omicron variant emerged, tourists are fearing to travel. B G Ananthashayana of the Coorg Homestay Association said that there are no cancellations. “However, we are getting calls regarding the present scenario. People are panicking due to the news about the new variant,” he said.

---||Kolkata||Shut by Hills strike, Gorkha band revival now faces migration hurdle||Siliguri: Efforts to revive a Gorkha band that had broken up due to the 2017 Darjeeling agitation have now hit a Covid wall. Nishant Singh, a 37-year-old pakhawaj player and national awardee, had weaved together this band of underprivileged school children to revive the use of traditional Nepali folk instruments. The band couldn’t make its public performances in 2017 after it was formed due to the 104-day Hills agitation. And now, most of these children have migrated to other cities, or abroad, for work. “My dream project was to form a Gorkha band representing our culture, including all the Nepali folk instruments. I was successful in forming it, but it couldn’t take off. It would have been an achievement in Nepali folk culture. We do have brass bands in uniformed forces, but they don’t really portray our culture,” said Singh, who is also a Rabindra Bharati postgraduate. Singh, then a music teacher who taught underprivileged students at a private school, had trained kids under 14 for six months and they were able to play the instruments. He had hoped to take them to New Delhi and Kolkata to perform in the Republic Day and Independence Day programmes, which would have brought them recognition. “The kids are still in touch with me and it is sad to see them working in other cities, taking up odd jobs. They were eager to learn and loved the instruments. Because they were from a poor background, music could have given them a better livelihood,” Singh said. Kalyan Sunam, who played ‘maadal’ — a Nepali folk musical instrument — and now attends college in Alipurduar, said, “Some of my band mates are working in cities while some have moved abroad in search of jobs.” “We had no idea of music, and in the initial phase of learning, I had thought I would not be able to play the instrument. But we started liking it and would have excelled. But the agitation cut everything short. We had plans to perform at the national level, but the unrest forced us to change everything,” he said. Singh, however, refuses to give up on his dreams. “I have a dream to conduct a Maruni Naach (a Nepali folk dance) and Krishna’s Raaslila. I tried to reconnect with the children for these performances. We need to revive our old culture,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shut-by-hills-strike-gorkha-band-revival-now-faces-migration-hurdle/articleshow/88110690.cms||Roshan Gupta

The driver and other passengers, sensing trouble, jumped out of the car minutes before the collision. The train driver saw the static car on the tracks, but failed to stop the passenger-loaded train instantly. The impact of the crash pushed the car forward around 100m along the tracks. Police said there was no casualty, but locals blocked traffic for more than an hour. Tamluk Trinamool Congress president Chanchal Khanra said that for a long time locals had been demanding a level crossing there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/close-shave-for-passengers-as-train-hits-car/articleshow/88110735.cms||Suman Mondal

On November 29, an SC bench of justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari in two special leave petitions filed against the HC ruling said, “We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned judgment(s) passed by the High Court. Special Leave Petitions are dismissed.” The state had issued three GRs in 2015, increasing age of superannuation of district health officers, civil surgeons and superior officers in the public health department from 58 years to 60 due to non-availability of candidates. Doctors in the state public health department challenged the age extension in HC’s Autangabad bench. A petition filed by Dr Sanjay Kadam and six others in 2018 argued that the age enhancement adversely affected legitimate right to promotion of deserving candidates. They also alleged that age extension was issued to “benefit some officers who are nearer and dearer, ministers and higher officers working in Mantralaya”. They argued that for many years the state took no effective steps to fill vacancies. In SC, advocate Shivaji Jadhav for SLP petitioner Dr YS Chavan questioned HC’s order, saying it had “created a bias and ambiguity by adversely affecting career of petitioners and other persons...” Senior counsel Vinay Navarre with advocate Shirish Deshpande for the respondent, Dr Kadam and others, said HC rightly held that such blanket decision could not be taken. For state, counsel SU Lalit and Rahul Chitnis appeared. Dr Radhakrishna Pawar, president, District Health Officers’ Association, welcomed the SC order and said the state must fill all vacancies. “There is a lot of frustration among officials who are working hard but have been denied promotions and growth. All 23 posts of deputy directors are currently vacant and senior officials hold additional charge. This affects the overall efficiency and morale of the department,” he said. Another district health official said the GR for age extension was completely illegal, as held by the court, adding “only 192 officials benefitted from the extension, not the public at large”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sc-rejects-plea-against-hc-order-nixing-retirement-age-extension/articleshow/88111719.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Business||Pension bill of PSBs may be an impediment for sale||Mumbai: Pension liabilities of public sector banks (PSBs) would impede prospective buyers should current provisioning norms continue. If a private promoter takes over a PSB, it would have to provide hundreds of crores for all future pension liabilities in addition to making an upfront provision. Some private banks have suggested that the government should allow pension payments to be made out of current expenditure to retired employees. This would enable the privatised banks to meet obligations towards retired employees without taking a big hit on their profit & loss account. Unlike the government, where employees joining after 2004 shifted to a defined contribution scheme, banks moved to the new scheme only after 2010. This means that the bulk of PSB employees are eligible for an indexed-linked pension after retirement. The fact that the pension is indexed to inflation results in pension rising every time there is an increase in dearness allowance for bank employees. “The scheme was devised at a time when life expectancy was in the 60s and interest rates were around 14%. Life expectancy for this segment is expected to be above 80 years,” said a senior banker. He added that the bank would have to make provisions every time there is an increase in inflation (dearness allowance) or if there is a drop in interest rates as life insurers hike the cost of annuities when interest rates fall. There would also be periodic provisions to be made to reflect the gradual increase in life expectancy. The finance minister had assured bank employees that none of them would be affected by the sale of the PSBs. However, employee associations have been holding protests over fears that the government may extend its sale plans to other PSBs as well. While public sector senior management get low salaries compared to their peers in the private sector, probationary officers receive a much better package when compared to entry-level executives in large private banks. As a result, the wage-to-income ratio of most private banks is lower than that of PSBs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pension-bill-of-psbs-may-be-an-impediment-for-sale/articleshow/88111696.cms||Mayur Shetty

For instance, Odysse Electric Vehicles Pvt Ltd commenced an electric two-wheeler plant at Changodar in Ahmedabad in 2020 with 24,000 units per annum capacity. It also launched e-scooters last year. Matter, an electric vehicle and electric technology startup, is also setting up a manufacturing facility near Ahmedabad with an annual capacity of 2 lakh units. Founded by Mohal Lalbhai, a scion of the city-based Lalbhai Family, the startup is readying itself to launch an e-motorcycle in the first half of 2022. Svitch Energy Private Limited, too, has chosen Gujarat for its electric vehicle facility in recent years. Having its presence in EV space since 2016, BSE-listed Wardwizard Innovations & Mobility Ltd inaugurated a new two-wheeler manufacturing facility in Vadodara in January this year. The new plant created by consolidating the company’s three assembly units now has a production capacity of 2.5 lakh units per shift per annum. According to EV makers, subsidies offered by central and state governments, growing awareness among consumers and high petrol and diesel prices have contributed to the surge in demand for electric two-wheelers. “The prospects for EVs are very promising. Apart from high fuel prices, central and several state governments offering substantial subsidies on EV purchases have prompted increased number of people to opt for e-mobility,” said Yatin Gupte, chairman and managing director, Wardwizard Innovations and Mobility Ltd, which is also setting up two more plants in the next six months. One plant will come up in south India and the second one either in north or east India. “The demand for electric vehicles is much higher and customers are waiting for more products which cater to their specific needs. At present, there are not many product offerings in the EV segment. So, we would see the demand increasing and a lot of products getting launched in the next few years,” said Mohal Lalbhai, Founder and CEO, Matter, which will also be launching a few other products. “The potential for electric two-wheelers is very high and its acceptance among people is growing. The growth in electric two-wheelers was at least 50-70% in 2020-21,” said Nemin Vora, CEO, Odysse Electric Vehicles Pvt Ltd, which started another plant in Mumbai with a capacity to produce 36,000 units per annum. The sale of electric vehicles surged nearly 10-fold from 149 units sold in October 2020 to 1,621 units sold during the same month this year, according to data compiled by Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA). These included cars, two-wheelers as well as three-wheelers. “There is no PLI (Production Linked Incentive) scheme for startups, which is a stumbling block for newcomers. As a result, it's critical that the government makes the scheme more inclusive for startups and offer enough incentives for it to flourish and satisfy the sector's growing demand,” added Lalbhai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/electric-2-wheeler-manufacturing-picks-up-momentum-in-gujarat/articleshow/88110807.cms||Kalpesh Damor

Six-month-old Arjun was kidnapped by unidentified persons near Araku weekly market locality under Dumbriguda police station limits in Vizag Agency. Though the incident took place in the wee hours on Friday, it came to light on Saturday night after the parents of the baby boy approached the police. Police said the couple, Suraj and Jyothi, belong to Sagar in Madhya Pradesh, and had come to Araku along with the baby and their relatives a few days ago in search of a livelihood. The couple were engaged in the manufacture and selling of axes, knives and other articles. On Thursday night, when the family was sleeping in a temporary shelter, some unidentified persons kidnapped the child. Though Arjun’s parents launched a search for him on Friday and Saturday, their efforts proved futile. “We traced the child to Vizag city, rescued him and nabbed two persons. The child was later reunited with his parents. Investigation is on to nab a few more people in connection with the case,” said sub-inspector Santhosh Kumar. Locals suspect the accused kidnapped the child in order to sell him to a childless couple. However, police said the investigation is still underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/6-mnth-old-rescued-from-kidnappers/articleshow/88110249.cms||Nalla.Babu

The head constable, identified as Y Srinivasa Rao, was posted on security duty at an EVM strong room at the time of the incident. The bullet pierced through his chest on the left side, causing severe injury. He was rushed to Machilipatnam government hospital first and later shifted to a private hospital at Tadepalli where he was operated upon by doctors. Krishna district SP Siddharth Kaushal said Srinivasa Rao is said to be out of danger. “We are yet to look into the issue of how the misfire took place. Our first priority was to save him by providing proper treatment and luckily we heard that he is out of danger. Prima facie it appears to be a misfire and the additional SP of AR wing will conduct a detailed investigation into the issue,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/constable-injured-after-gun-misfires/articleshow/88110278.cms||---

However, a clear picture is yet to emerge on how much cannabis is transported through e-commerce platforms. With law enforcement agencies cracking down on the smuggling of dry ganja in Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts, peddlers are converting cannabis into hash oil, which is easy to conceal and transport. A West Zone Task Force team recently nabbed three persons in Hyderabad, including a delivery personnel of an e-commerce site, and seized hash oil worth Rs 55,000 from their possession. Investigation revealed that one Praveen (supplier), a resident of Hyderabad, had procured the hash oil from Vizag Agency. The arrested—B Santhosh, K S Shiva and N Vijay Kumar—were friends and in contact with Praveen to sell the contraband to other customers. Recently, the sale of ganja on an e-commerce platform was busted by Bhind police in Madhya Pradesh, leading to the arrest of two kingpins Suraj Pawaiya and Mukul Jaiswal. Investigation revealed the involvement of five persons from Vizag. Joint director of Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB), Vizag, S Satish Kumar said they are investigating further to make more arrests. The gang had been transporting cannabis via an e-commerce platform for over six months, he added. Enforcement officials suspect that ganja and hash oil are transported through e-commerce sites from Vizag. The agencies have in the past six months seized over 60 litres of hash oil and machinery for manufacturing the oil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/tech-savvy-smugglers-fly-under-official-radar/articleshow/88110269.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Vijayawada||AP: Sans ID proof, welfare schemes hover out of sex workers’ reach||VIJAYAWADA: While a majority of registered sex workers have ration cards, many do not have any kind of identity proof, including ration cards, and are struggling to avail welfare schemes of the state government. Interestingly, about 4.8% of registered sex workers do not even have an Aadhaar card, according to Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) data. However, NGOs working for the rehabilitation of sex workers claim that the numbers available with the government are far lower than the actual number in the state. Unregistered sex workers are not covered under any welfare scheme of the state government as they do not possess an identity proof like an Aadhaar card, voter card or a bank account, said N Rammohan, secretary of Help, an NGO working towards the rehabilitation of sex workers. Rammohan said the government only recognises as sex workers those who availed medicine from APSACS under the HIV control programme or for sexually transmitted diseases. But the actual number of sex workers in the state would be more than twice the recognised number as many of them do not approach APSACS, he said. The state government should conduct an enumeration of sex workers through community based organisations (CBOs) like Vimukti, to provide rations to sex workers without insisting for a ration card, as directed by the Supreme Court in its recent judgement, said Rammohan. B Sunitha (name changed), a sex worker from Addanki, said she had applied for a ration card about two years ago but is yet to get the card. “It has become increasingly difficult to feed my two children, especially after the pandemic. Repeated requests to the local authorities to provide a ration card have not given any result yet,” she said. V Lakshmi (name changed), a 29-year-old sex worker from Vijayawada, has to look after her two daughters after husband left her. Her application for a ration card was rejected as her name was included in the system along with her husband. She said a ration card is the basic identity to be eligible for any welfare scheme, but her application has been pending forover two years. V Priya (name changed), from Guntur, also recounted a similar story of her application for a ration card being rejected as her name was included in the family of her husband, who abandoned her about five years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/sans-id-proof-welfare-schemes-hover-out-of-sex-workers-reach/articleshow/88110210.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Candidates tweak campaign plans on rain-soaked Sunday||KOLKATA: The unseasonal rain played spoilsport on the penultimate Sunday before the civic polls and political parties had to tweak their campaign plans across wards. Colourful rallies were replaced by intense door-to-door campaigns while the opposition cried foul over the ill-preparedness of the civic management to meet emergencies that may crop up in the wake of rain that has been lashing the city. Trinamool candidate from Bhowanipore Ashim Bose decided to meet citizens on the streets rather than visiting their homes. Accordingly, Bose went to a famous Jain temple on Heysham Road and interacted with a large number of devotees who had assembled for a religious function. Later, he had a chat over tea with the residents of the area. “I hardly discussed politics with the citizens wherever I went. I wanted to know whether they were facing any civic problems,” Bose said. Faiz Ahmed Khan of CPM, spent the day interacting with voters on the digital platform. Khan has created several WhatsApp groups involving residents of his ward who prefer to interact online. “Today was a different day when I couldn’t venture out and reach my voters. I didn’t want to miss the opportunity to interact with my voters who are available online,” said Khan. Debajyoti Das, one of the youngest candidates this time, who is contesting the civic polls on a Congress ticket, has started an intense campaign over social media. “The youths here decided to utilize the time wasted during the rain by intensifying our campaign on the social media platforms. We have more than 27,000 voters in ward 103 and the target is to reach each one of them through social media apart from meeting them personally,” Das said. Jadavpur MLA Debabrata Majumdar, contesting from Tollygunge, held workers’ meetings and campaigned in the Regent Colony area in the morning. In the afternoon, Majumdar went to a high-rise on NSC Bose Road and interacted with residents. “Today being a Sunday, I didn’t want to miss the opportunity of reaching out to the citizens,” he said. The opposition, however, used the inclement weather to highlight the deficiencies in civic management. At Park Street and Camac Street, BJP candidate Navin Mishra (ward 23) raised concerns over malaria and dengue making a comeback after the rain. “Areas like Collin Lane, Kyd Street and Sudder Street have garbage dumped on the road side. These spots are potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes after the rain,” Mishra said. Chayan Bhattacharya, CPM candidate from ward 111 (Tollygunge), pointed fingers at the waterlogged roads in Brahmapur and Ujjal Park. “The residents of Brahmapur area are now under water. I was not part of any meeting of the Kolkata Environment Improvement Investment Programme. I will move the Calcutta High Court seeking legal recourse if the civic authorities fail to solve the trouble,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/candidates-tweak-campaign-plans-on-rain-soaked-sunday/articleshow/88110665.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Ahmedabad||Pictures of Ahmedabad's first drainage line network surface||AHMEDABAD: Complaints of drainage blocks in housing societies and waste water network glitches have overwhelmed the municipal corporation. Last week standing committee members in the civic body held a special meeting in this regard. Drainage related complaints constitute nearly 59% of the total complaints filed by citizens. But as the civic body grapples with the situation it is worth remembering here that the work for laying city’s first full-fledged drainage network began on January 10 , 1936 and was inaugurated by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to rid the city of water-borne diseases. The ground-breaking ceremony was held in the Kalupur area behind Kapasia Bazaar. Two pictures, one of the ceremony and the other of the first drainage network being laid by municipal workers, were published in leading dailies of the time. The first drainage line was laid on an ‘experimental basis’ in 1885-86 in Khadia by the first Indian president of the city municipality, Ranchhodlal Chhotalal. But for nearly 40 years, no new demand for drainage network and water supply was made by citizens, owing to social issues. “The project was a huge task. Back then, Amdavadis consumed 180 litres of water per capita. Nearly 1,200 acres were to be covered within the Walled City limit, while network was required for 300 acres in the east side of city. Sardar had clearly stated that if the city was to rid itself of water-borne diseases a drainage network was smust and the projected should be completed with immediacy,” says city historian Rizwan Kadri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pictures-of-ahmedabads-first-drainage-line-network-surface/articleshow/88110728.cms||---

Activist P V Moorjhani has issued a notice to the VMC raising concerns over the lack of safety guidelines and compensation package. Moorjhani has asked the civic body to come clear on the compensation package to be paid to victims in case of an accident during the boating activity. “The VMC has said that if some accident happens during the boating, the contractor will be responsible for it. The civic body is trying to escape its responsibility by putting the onus on the contractor,” Moorjhani told TOI. “In 1993, 22 Barodians died when a boat capsized in Sursagar lake. Even then the VMC had said that the contractor was responsible for paying the compensation. We had approached the Supreme Court that had asked the VMC to deposit compensation amount first with the State Consumer Commission and then recover it from the insurance firm,” Moorjhani, managing trustee of Jagrut Nagrik Grahak Mandal, said. “The court had also asked the VMC to issue clear safety guidelines. Despite the SC verdict, the VMC is yet again trying to shift all the responsibility on the contractor. I have asked the civic body to announce a certain amount to be paid as compensation in case of some injury or death arising due to an accident while boating,” Moorjhani added. On August 11, 1993, a major tragedy struck when a boat carrying 38 persons capsized in Sursagar lake. The boat, having a capacity of 20 persons, was overloaded. The matter reached the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission where the VMC was accused of negligence. The civic body had argued that the insurance firm is responsible for compensation. But the SC too rejected VMC’s claims and asked the civic body to deposit the compensation amount first. “If the VMC doesn’t come clear on the compensation issue and declare safety measures that it is planning to take, I will approach the court,” Moorjhani said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sursagar-boating-plans-rock-in-uncertainty/articleshow/88110572.cms||---

The criminals also stabbed his son Rajiv Mandal and thrashed the women members of his family for showing reluctance in handing them over the keys of steel almirahs. Mandal, who has jewellery and garment business, claimed that the robbers decamped with jewellery and cash worth over Rs50 lakh. Ratanpur police outpost SHO Sudha Kumari said they were trying to identify the criminals from the CCTV footage of the cameras installed near the spot. She said the actual value of the property looted could be ascertained after thorough scrutiny. Mandal said the robbers knocked at the main door of the house. “One of us opened the door thinking that the maid had arrived. However, as soon as the door opened, two armed criminals wearing masks stormed into the house. At least three more with arms soon followed them. As it was very early in the morning, most of the family members were sleeping inside their rooms. They entered all the rooms and held all the members captive after tying them with ropes and putting tape on their mouth. One of the criminals stabbed Rajiv when he raised an alarm. They also threatened to kill the children if any of us further tried to raise an alarm,” Mandal said. The criminals remained inside the house for over an hour while the frightened family members kept watching them opening the almirahs and taking the jewellery and cash. “It was only after the criminals made a safe escape that we raised alarm and the neighbours came for help and admitted Rajiv to a private nursing home,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jewellery-cash-looted-1-stabbed-in-begusarai/articleshow/88109898.cms||---

Police sources said the deceased, Ram Sewak Poddar, was a former district secretary of AISF and used to run a grocery shop at Parihara Bazar under Parihara police outpost area in Begusarai district. When he asked Kari to return him the money he had borrowed, the accused started thrashing Ram Sewak at the shop itself.  “People present there somehow pacified Kari, who went home. However, when Ram Sewak was on way to his home after downing the shutters of his shop late in the evening, Kari intercepted and assaulted him brutally. This caused his death on the spot,” his family members alleged at the Sadar hospital where the body was sent for postmortem on Sunday. Following the news of Ram Sewak’s death, angry villagers blocked traffic on Bakhri-Khagaria road Saturday night. The blockade was lifted only after Bakhri SDPO Chandan Kumar assured them to arrest the accused soon. Bakhri MLA Surya Kant Paswan, who belongs to the CPI, also reached the spot. “Kari is an addict and was in an inebriated condition even when he attacked Ram Sewak,” his family members said. The SDPO said the accused and his family members were absconding. Ram Sewak was also a former member of the local panchayat samiti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cpi-activist-beaten-to-death-in-begusarai/articleshow/88109915.cms||---

Police attributed illness, mainly heart attack, as the reason behind deaths, but villagers suspect they had consumed liquor. The deceased were identified as Arjun Jha (55) of Subhankarpur Tikauli village, Arvind Singh (32) of Mahthi Dharamchand and Manoj Kumar Singh (55) of Padmaul. Arjun died on Friday, Arvind on Saturday and Manoj in the wee hours of Sunday. Sources said Nandu Patel and Nandlal Mahto underwent treatment after allegedly consuming spurious liquor. Mahua SDPO Poonam Kesri said medical teams have been deployed in the area. “They are conducting survey to know if anyone has any symptom of hooch poisoning,” she said. Kesri said both Nandu and Nandlal were found healthy at their homes and denied any illness due to consuming spurious liquor. Tisiauta police station SHO Ravindra Pal on Sunday morning said he knew about the death of Manoj only, but the SDPO admitted three deaths since Friday. SHO Pal, quoting Manoj’s family members, said his ‘oxygen level’ used to remain low and he was also a heart patient. Pal, who visited the spot for investigation on Sunday morning, said Manoj fell ill on Saturday night and died while being taken to a hospital at Mahua. The SDPO said Manoj’s family members told her that he had suffered heart attack twice in the past. She said Arvind used to be in depression since his elder brother lost the panchayat election. “On Saturday, he started sweating excessively and fell ill. His blood pressure shot up and he later died in hospital,” Kesri said, quoting family members. She said Arjun was originally from Muzaffapur but lived at a mutt in Subhankarpur Tikauli with a friend, Vijay Jha. “He was mentally disturbed. Vijay told police that he suddenly collapsed at their room’s entrance after dinner Friday night. Vijay also told police that Arjun often used to sleep in the open and probably had caught cold,” she said. Kesri said the deceased had no symptoms of vomiting, nausea or anything else typical in hooch poisoning cases. “Two bodies were already cremated. The third body was taken to ghat for cremation on Sunday morning. The postmortem could not be conducted because his family members opposed it,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/three-die-in-vaishali-under-mysterious-circumstances/articleshow/88109938.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Kolkata||Exhibits at city event aim at finding ‘a permanent home for dance’ in Kol||Kolkata: The city, with its rich history of artistic practice and discourse, has strangely never created a permanent space for dance. The aristocratic households have had jalshaghars and naachghar, the dance bars have hosted the cabaret style performance. Temple spaces have given space to soulful trance movements of devotees. But in all these cases, the audience’s gaze never celebrated dance as a serious art form involving its craft. Finding a permanent home for dance by advocating re-adaptive use of the city’s Grade 1 heritage building is one of the themes of the three installations presented by Pickle Factory and Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan at an ongoing event in the city. Astrid Wege, director of Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan Kolkata, said, “Culture needs space — to unfold, meet, learn from each other, and make new experiences. Goethe-Institut sees itself as an enabler of such space , and is happy to embark on the journey to a new ‘Home for Dance’ — an initiative of our partner, Pickle Factory, to envision a much-needed venue for contemporary dance and culture in Kolkata.” Vikram Iyengar, founder-director of Pickle Factory, told TOI the idea is to bring together dancers, visual designers and architects to “imagine how to repurpose existing buildings in the city into venues for dance”. Dancer Paramita Saha and scenographer Swarup Dutta were intrigued by the chequered history of Thonthonia Thakurbati that has seen both ‘nautch’ and ‘palagaan’ existing in the same space. “In this 300-year-old house belonging to Biharilal Mitra, there existed a dedicated place for nautch. Later, Mitra’s mother established a Radhmadhab temple with an idol that is now 500 years old,” Saha said. In their installation, various spaces of the Thakurbati, like the courtyard, baithak, mandir dalan, naachghar and terrace, have been reimagined as part of a ‘Home for Dance’. In their installation titled “Of dust and clay…” Odissi dancer Monami Nandy and architect Sayantan Maitra have focused on an old Chinese school in Tangra and tried to reimagine how that venue could be used for anything related to dance practices. “Tangra has now changed its colour but this Chinese school, though maintained well, has no students. As an architect-dancer partner, we tried to explore this school, its surroundings and decipher if this can be turned into an ideal home for dance,” Maitra said. Performance-based researchers Upasana Das and Abanti Banerjee’s installation titled “The Tunnel of body-hood in the making” imagines a space in the city which includes the marginalized queer community. “As a dancer, I have realized that performative space is super-liminal and it allows gender fluidity. Our installation spreads awareness to accept this fact,” Banerjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/exhibits-at-city-event-aim-at-finding-a-permanent-home-for-dance-in-kol/articleshow/88110677.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

However, attention has for the first time shifted to the reverse repo rate — the rate at which the RBI borrows from banks. The reverse repo has come into focus as the central bank has indicated that it will start normalising liquidity in December even while retaining an accommodative stance. This is seen by some as a pointer to a reverse repo rate hike from the present level of 3.35%. What this means is that for borrowers this is as good as it gets and rates will only rise in future. For depositors, there is finally some prospect of banks offering slightly better returns. “We still believe policymakers remain on track to initiate monetary policy normalisation. We do expect the RBI to hike the reverse repo rate by 20 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) during the policy meeting,” said Rahul Bajoria, chief economist with Barclays Investment Bank. One reason for this expectation is the solid macro numbers following the festival season. Also, the government’s decision to cut taxes on fuel last month has eased inflation fears. The detection of the Omicron variant has stalled inflation in global commodity prices, particularly crude oil. “The RBI has already embarked on a policy normalisation path with the introduction of variable reverse repo rate (VRRR) auctions. We expect it to take further steps — a 20bps hike in the reverse repo rate at the December 8 policy meeting, followed by 20bps more in February. Repo rate hikes are likely to follow in mid-2022,” said HSBC chief economist Pranjul Bhandari. However, State Bank of India chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh is of the view that the RBI will be able to achieve its goals without any revision in key policy rates. “We believe the talks of a reverse repo rate hike in the MPC (monetary policy committee) meeting may be premature as the RBI has been largely able to narrow the corridor without the noise of rate hikes and ensuing market cacophony,” said Ghosh. The central bank had responded to the Covid pandemic by releasing vast amounts of money into the banking system, resulting in a surplus of close to Rs 11 lakh crore earlier this year. Liquidity remains in the surplus mode with the average daily net absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) at Rs 7.6 lakh crore as of November. The minutes of the earlier MPC meeting give an insight into the thinking of the RBI members. While the external members sought normalisation of the surplus liquidity, they wanted the central bank to maintain an accommodative stance. Unlike the past when the central bank relied strongly on signalling, the RBI is seen to be achieving its goals through multiple tools such as VRRR, open market operations and intervening in the forward foreign exchange markets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-expected-to-hold-repo-may-hike-reverse-repo-rate/articleshow/88111648.cms||---

They have not been paid their salaries and pension for the last three months, making their lives miserable. The condition of retired university staff is worse as most of them, in their eighties and nineties, depend on their monthly pension for medical expenses and house rent besides groceries and other items of daily use. L N Mithila University (LNMU) retired teacher Sushil Chandra Govil is facing difficult times in getting proper medical care for his ailing wife who is on dialysis. Another retired teacher, I C Pathak of the same university, is also in deep trouble as both his wife and son died recently due to lack of proper medical treatment, said sources. Former principal of C M Science College-Darbhanga, Sangeet Kumar Verma, told this newspaper that most teachers of LNMU, working as well as retired, are facing great mental agony due to irregular payments. They did not get money even during the festivals of Diwali and Chhath this year. They had got their last salary (pension) after a gap of four months and again they were deprived of their salary for the last three months, he said. Magadh University Teachers’ Association former general secretary Satyadeo Narain Sharma expressed his deep anguish over the non-payment of salary and pension of university staff for some time. “Nobody knows as to when will the teachers receive their next salary as the vice-chancellor of the university has gone on a month’s medical leave and the financial adviser has also quit,” he said. The associations of both teachers and non-teaching staff of Patna University have already threatened to launch an agitation from December 15, if their demands, including payment of arrears of their salaries, were not fulfilled by December 14. Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar working president K B Sinha said delay in payment of salary and pension was not only ethical but illegal also. Education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary said he would look into the problem and ensure earliest payment of salaries and pension to all the university staff. “At no cost, teachers or non-teaching staff would be allowed to starve when the government has already made the budgetary provision for the payments,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-months-on-varsity-teachers-wait-for-salary-continues/articleshow/88109982.cms||B K Mishra

The minister said officials concerned have been asked to keep the beds ready and install equipment in the dedicated Covid health centres and Covid care centres already set up in the districts so that infected people could be admitted there if required. Pandey said the list of people returning to Bihar from abroad is being sent to the districts daily. “Sample collection is being done by contacting the identified people based on the list. People returning from abroad are being screened at Patna, Gaya and Darbhanga airports,” he added. “At least 5% of the total flight passengers are required to undergo random RT-PCR test post-arrival. The remaining passengers will have to undergo rapid antigen test as per the revised guidelines. If found Covid positive, the sample of the passenger concerned will be sent to IGIMS for genome sequencing,” Pandey said. The minister has appealed to the people to follow Covid safety protocols and take both vaccine doses. “Efforts are being made by the health department to increase the number of Covid tests and accelerate vaccination,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/all-districts-asked-to-identify-foreign-travellers-health-minister/articleshow/88109821.cms||Faryal Rumi

It will also ensure more development of this area,” Nitish said. Accompanied by senior officials of urban development and housing department (UDHD), the CM further inspected the Mandiri drainage pumping plant. He instructed UDHD principal secretary Anand Kishor to ensure that untreated water from the drainage is not discharged into the Ganga. He also asked the officials to treat the drainage water and utilize it for irrigation purposes outside the urban areas through pipelines. Nitish said the UDHD and the water resources department should work together to utilize the drainage water for irrigation purposes. Accompanied by education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary and building construction minister Ashok Choudhary, the CM also inspected the construction works of houses meant for the ministers at Gardanibagh. He was satisfied with the quality of works and asked the officials to plant saplings along with the boundary wall to ensure enough greenery on the campus. He said a separate arrangement has been made on the premises for the stay of security guards. Nitish asked the building construction department (BDC) officials to make arrangements for early handover of the ready houses to the ministers. He also inspected the construction works of the Bapu Tower. Officials informed him that it would be ready by May next year. The CM also inspected the construction works at the MLA flats and enjoyed laser show at the Adalatganj pond. He enquired about its redevelopment plan under the Patna Smart City Mission. He asked the UDHD officials to make arrangements for fresh water in the Adalatganj pond.  He also ordered for replacement of dirty water from the pond. The CM also asked the UDHD officials to make necessary arrangements for morning walk of people near the pond.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/link-mandiri-drainage-road-with-jp-ganga-path-nitish/articleshow/88109869.cms||Madan Kumar

Bhrigunath emailed a complaint letter to the SVU on Sunday, alleging that he has been receiving threat calls from the VC. As per the letter, a copy of which is with TOI, the VC called Bhrigunath once on Saturday and again on Sunday through an instant messaging platform. Prasad has also mentioned in the letter that Rs 1.75 crore meant for the examination wing of the university was diverted and used for buying e-books on November 21, four days after raids on the VC, without his information. After raids, the VC proceeded on a month-long medical leave on November 23, Bhrigunath alleged. SVU sources said there was no e-library facility in the university for which the e-books had been purchased. SVU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan has confirmed having received the complaint letter sent by Bhrigunath. Khan said the complaint was a clear indication that the tainted VC was trying to threaten witnesses, pressuring and mentally harassing them. “The VC has threatened Bhrigunath through an instant messaging platform to gather bank statements. We will see what legal action can be taken in such cases,” he added. Bhrigunath told TOI over the phone that the VC had been pressuring him to gather bank statements of transactions worth crores. “The VC specifically asked me to gather statements of the transactions made during his tenure. These transactions are now being investigated by SVU,” he added. The SVU had raided the VC’s office and his residence in Gorakhpur on November 17. The raids were carried after an FIR was lodged against the VC, his PA-cum-assistant Subodh Kumar, VKSU financial officer Om Prakash, Patliputra University registrar Jitendra Kumar and two private firms for allegedly embezzling Rs 30 crore public money by purchasing answer booklets, OMR sheets, books, hiring guard even without any need and making payments to favoured people without floating tenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mu-official-accuses-tainted-vc-of-making-threat-calls/articleshow/88109934.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||Omicron may influence rates of term insurance||MUMBAI: The discovery of the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus has delayed stability in the term insurance market. Insurers, who are raising their prices on term insurance this month, are now waiting to see the impact of Omicron before finalising their term insurance strategy. Speaking to TOI, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance MD & CEO Tarun Chugh said that the company will be raising term insurance rates this month following a communication from reinsurers in September announcing a hike in rates and tightening of process. “The next two to three weeks and the findings from South Africa are critical. The increase of our term pricing was under way and things were expected to stabilise. But with this, it is a little bit of an unknown,” said Chugh. He added that what is being watched out for is whether it turns out to be virulent and there are a lot of hospitalisation cases, which may call for a reset. While life insurers commit to a fixed term insurance rate for life, the reinsurers revise their prices regularly based on experience. According to Chugh, many insurers have already thought through the increase in pricing brought about by the reinsurers in September, but the new variant might stretch the onboarding process. Besides having a wait period for Covid survivors, insurers are asking prospects for a negative RT-PCR report if any of their family members contracted the virus. “Term is not an easy product to buy anyway, but now the discussions have become elongated. As a result, the issuance rate has come down,” said Chugh. He added that this also resulted in lesser policies being issued in a straight-through manner. According to a report last week on the life insurance industry by rating agency ICRA, the total sum assured for the private sector was Rs 4.04 lakh crore in FY2021, up only 1% year-on-year. While for LIC, it had increased 7.5% Y-o-Y to Rs 8.9 lakh crore. Private life insurers have been more aggressive than LIC in bringing down term rates. Even after the forthcoming hikes, term rates will be cheaper than they were a decade ago. According to Chugh, term rates in India are lower than in most European countries despite better life expectancy there. While there is uncertainty over term rates, the drop in interest rates has helped push up sales of annuity business for Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance. Chugh said that the guaranteed returns under annuity has opened up a new segment of the market of older individuals. “In the last seven months, we have managed to grow 53% as compared to the rest of the private industry, which grew by 30%,” said Chugh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/omicron-may-influence-rates-of-term-insurance/articleshow/88111691.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||Family beats salary in pandemic times||MUMBAI: A senior executive in a plum posting at a large organisation in Mumbai wanted to relocate to Bengaluru to be with her family, but her application was rejected by her organisation. She then decided to look out for another job as the desire to be with her family was strong. However, when she landed a good offer, her current organisation relented and decided to retain her by allowing her to relocate to Bengaluru. “It was a critical role and the organisation valued her and thus eventually gave in to her demand for relocation when she was about to quit,” says BTI executive search MD James Agrawal. In another instance, an executive in a CXO role based in Pune wanted to quit the organisation for no other reason but to be with his family in Hyderabad. “He was desperate to move back with his family and was even okay with giving up a good position for the relocation,” says Agrawal. Career and job decisions now increasingly pivot around location as candidates — mid-level and senior executives alike — want to be based near their families. The earlier jet-setting, pre-pandemic trend of long-distance relations between spouses and families appears to be reversing with several anecdotes strengthening the new trend of candidates demanding a location of their choice while hunting for a job. Earlier, the lure of money and perks were the overriding factors, while location was secondary. But today, some are also willing to take a cut in compensation, say executive search firms. There are a couple of assignments BTI Executive Search is handling in which the candidates are willing to even take a 20% cut to be close to their parents in their native place. “One of them works for a top organisation based in the US and is keen on relocating closer to his aged parents. He’s not concerned about either the package or the position. When we asked the candidate why he was giving it all up, he said all his life he has only been working away from his parents, and now when they are old and they want to see him more often, he can at least make that effort to be closer to them,” says Agrawal. The trend cuts across sectors. A woman executive from an FMCG company moved from Delhi to join a large Indian conglomerate in Mumbai, where her family was located. Another senior marketing head shifted from Pune to Mumbai — a distance which can easily be covered in about a couple of hours by road — to be with the spouse.  Sharing these examples, Claricent Partners managing partner Jyoti Bowen Nath says the pandemic has re-defined priorities. Health and family, she says, are now paramount. “Homecoming has never seemed sweeter. More professionals, like homing pigeons, are looking at returning home to be with their spouses and families. We see professionals consciously relocating to be with their spouses and ageing parents,” says Nath. Also, wives are not necessarily trailing their husbands. “It’s now not unusual for a husband to relocate to facilitate a wife’s ongoing career journey. A senior executive from a telecom company relocated to Mumbai, and her husband followed suit by joining a bank there,” says Nath. Earlier, candidates would move to the so called “greener pastures” — many a times away from the family, with whom they managed to catch up over weekends and holidays. Executive Access India MD Ronesh Puri says, those days, travel was not such a problem. “Post-pandemic, given the changes in regulations, mobility — which was earlier taken for granted — is now mired in uncertainty. There have also been cases where people have suffered as a consequence. People are taking pay cuts for being together with their family.” At least 15% of the searches by Executive Access are of such nature. “At times, candidates are happy with their jobs and company but seek a change for only one reason, which is to be with their family,” says Puri. With greater demand for certain skills, most organisations are relenting and offering not only the location of a candidate’s choice, but also compensation and a good post. A freelance intelligent automation consultant, who lives near Chandigarh, was offered a permanent job that required him to be based in Noida. However, being averse to the idea of moving away from his family, he rejected the offer. “Not only has the company now accepted his demand to work from anywhere and visit the office once in a fortnight, but also offered him a substantial jump in compensation. In the end, he got the role, the package and the location of his choice,” says Agrawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/family-beats-salary-in-pandemic-times/articleshow/88111634.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Delhi||Non-production of undertrial prisoners draws court’s ire||New Delhi: Non-production of undertrial prisoners (UTPs) despite repeated orders of the court has become quite common. This has led the courts to pass directions to the DG (Prisons) to ensure timely production of the accused from judicial custody. On November 30, Additional Sessions Judge Sunil Beniwal directed the DG (Prisons) to ensure timely production of the accused in an attempt to murder case on all dates at 10am. It was further directed that all accused and those in judicial custody be produced in the lock up of Dwarka court positively by 10.30am on each working day. In another order on November 18, Additional Sessions Judge Anil Antil noted that it was invariably seen that the accused were not produced either physically or through videoconferencing due to which no effective hearing could take place. This resulted in matters being adjourned. “There is a serious lapse on the part of the jail authorities. The DG (Prisons) should take appropriate measures in this regard to ensure that UTPs are produced in terms of the custody warrants before the courts to substantiate the cause of justice,” the order mentioned. In the absence of the accused, evidence could not be recorded and witnesses present had to be discharged unexamined. In another case being investigated by Special Cell of Delhi Police, the court had issued production warrants against three accused after they were not produced from judicial custody on November 30. At 2pm the same day, they were produced from custody following which the court said production warrants need not be issued against them. On November 29, a sessions court noted in its order that a prosecution witness had to be discharged unexamined as the accused was not produced physically. There were five other orders wherein it was noted that the accused were not produced from judicial custody during hearing of their cases. The special courts designated for dealing with the riots cases have been noting in several orders that the accused were not being produced during the proceedings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/non-production-of-undertrial-prisoners-draws-courts-ire/articleshow/88111306.cms||Usha Das

Cops found that he had fired bullets on his own car and even shot dead a stray dog. On June 28, Rajesh Gude approached the Palghar police with bullet marks on the rear windshield of his car. Gude told the cops that two unidentified men on a motorbike had fired at him. A case of attempt to murder was registered against unknown persons. Investigations revealed that Gude had procured the country-made revolver and given it to two of his accomplices. He had then driven on the deserted road in Palghar and asked the men to fire . As there was no CCTV camera at the spot, police were unable to get leads on the firing initially. It emerged that Gude had shot dead a stray dog while trying to test the revolver. He was called for questioning and he confessed to the crime. He was arrested on Saturday. Police said that the revolver has not been found. His motive for cooking up the story has not been ascertained yet either. Police said they are probing if it has anything to do with his wife losing the Palghar civic polls in 2019. He has been arrested under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 429 (maiming cattle or animal),120(b)(conspiracy) of the IPC, along with the Arms Act and Cruelty to Animals Act. He has been remanded to police custody till December 10. A search is on for his accomplices. Cops are also probing where he procured the revolver from. Sena’s Palghar district chief, Rajesh Shah said that Gude will be expelled from the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-shakha-pramukh-fakes-gun-attack-held-party-to-remove-him/articleshow/88111974.cms||---

The defenders of the wild were honoured at a virtual ceremony of the awards that was streamed live on Zoom, YouTube and Facebook for a global audience. At the award ceremony noted primatologist Dr Jane Goodall was honoured the Wildlife Legend Awardee. In her acceptance speech she said, “For those of us who care, we must collaborate.” Students, doctors, lawyers, fisherfolk, architects, hoteliers, teachers, farmers, scientists from across Goa joined the popular movement to oppose the three projects. Petitions and online educational talks highlighting the value of Mollem were organised to increase awareness and encourage conversation. Young Goa rose as one to attend public hearings, rallies and flash mobs. Films, songs, stories and art amplified the movement when on-ground meetings were impossible. “Popular support for Amche Mollem keeps growing. Diverse, yet united voices spoke up for Mollem and the Supreme Court appointed centrally empowered committee ordered a re-examination of all three projects, revoking one and modifying two,” Amchem Mollem said in a statement. “The Amche Mollem campaign is a true example of the power of the collective. It teaches all those that have made the protection of Earth’s biosphere a purpose of life that the best environmental defence strategies are home-brewed and imbued with joy, love and dogged resilience,” the statement read. Tragically one of the Mollem campaign’s stalwarts, Julio Cedric Aguiar, vice chairperson of Goencho Ekvott passed away during the peak of the resistance. His life has been a lesson in courage and resilience and served to strengthen the resolve of thousands of young Goans whose very future is at stake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mollem-movement-wins-wildlife-service-award/articleshow/88111331.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Lack of funds in way of road to redemption||NEW DELHI: Several roads in residential areas have long eroded and the municipal corporations don’t have the funds to reconstruct them. Civic officials claim they are no longer getting funds for road construction and strengthening and they have to look at alternative sources such as MLALAD funds, the chief minister’s road development fund and the Union urban affairs ministry’s Urban Development Fund (UDF). At Mukherjee Nagar under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, for instance, for four months the stormwater drain along the internal lanes has been lying open obstructing the passage of the residents. Aggrieved locals claimed to have requested the municipal officials to repair it without getting any response. OP Singh, general secretary, Citizens’ Welfare Association, Mukherjee Nagar, said the drain covers were removed when the locality was inundated during the rains in August. “The corporation damaged the ramps and roads constructed above the drain when removing its covers for desilting work. Now they have no funds to repair the ramps and get the drain covered again.” Jatin Sehgal, another member of association, added that they recently petitioned the area MLA on the matter and received assurance that the problems would be looked into. In neighbouring Model Town III, the situation is no different. The residents got some roads repaired using the MLALAD funds but many internal lanes are in a pitiable state for a decade now. “When we pursue the officials, they constantly say there are no funds and the Rs 25 lakh sanctioned to the local municipal councillor is too little to meet the requirement of repairs in the whole area. After repeated complaints, they have now filled in a few of the bigger potholes,” said Sanjay Gupta, vice-president, Model Town III RWA. North corporation commissioner Sanjay Goel reiterated this to TOI. “We are already going through a severe cash crunch and re-carpeting roads only when unavoidable,” he admitted. “We take up projects for which MLALAD funds are released but for the rest we only carry out basic repairs.” Goel said that the corporation had submitted a road-dust mitigation proposal of Rs 490 crore to DPCC, which will consider it and route it to the fund sources in the state or central governments. “If some funds are released, we can take up the work,” said the commissioner. Residents, however, are worried that with municipal elections scheduled early next year, the model code of conduct will be implemented and all such work will be kept at abeyance. In east Delhi, Sumit Kumar Sharma of Laxmi Nagar F Block RWA alleged, “The corporation is not only unable to take care of damaged roads, but it doesn’t even restore roads after digging for laying pipelines and cables. The lanes in Laxmi Nagar have been in poor condition for a long time because they have not been restored properly after laying pipelines.” EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand responded to this by saying that the civic body did everything in its power to fix things, including pursuing other agencies for coordinated repair of infrastructure. An official added, “We have savings of Rs 20 crore in UDF and we will utilise that to carpet the colony roads. While basic repair work is being undertaken, we are approaching PWD and DDA to get stretches under their jurisdiction repaired also.” In Greater Kailash II in south Delhi there was a similar grouse. Residents complained that internal roads such as in M Block, where a water pipeline were recently laid, lie damaged. “SDMC did some restoration work after the pipeline was laid, but the quality was shoddy and potholes have appeared again. The road dividing M and S blocks is also now cratered and requires proper repair,” said a local. The internal lanes of Chittaranjan Park are also in a pitiable state at many spots. An SDMC official said two grants of Rs 20 crore and Rs 40 crore were sought under UDF. “We have completed work on 75% of the roads earmarked for the Rs 20-crore revamp. These include select stretches in Vikaspuri and Shooting Range. Paving of kerbs will be completed by December 10,” the official said. “As for the residents’ demand for complete repairing and carpeting of colony roads, we have requested Rs 40 crore under UDF for the purpose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lack-of-funds-in-way-of-road-to-redemption/articleshow/88111320.cms||Vibha Sharma

Shah was arrested on charges of cheating, forgery, breach of trust and under Maharashtra Ownership of Flats. Shah has been sent to police custody. The police said Shah was already lodged at Arthur Road jail in another cheating case. Based on the fresh complaint, the police took Shah’s custody from Arthur Road jail last Thursday. The fresh complaint was lodged by Avadh Shah who said that he, and four others, had booked flats in a housing project at Oshiwara. While Avadh had paid Rs 98.39 lakh, the others paid a total sum of Rs 8.48 crore. He said they were supposed to get possession of their flats in 2012 but even after a decade, the housing project has been incomplete and they still haven’t got possession. Avadh told the police they were shocked to learn that the builder did not have all permissions required from the BMC. Yet, the builder had constructed an 18- storey tower though he had permission to construct only 17 floors. Also, the builder had taken bookings of flats up to the 27th floor. The police said that the builder had diverted the funds that had been collected from flat purchasers in another project.  Gaurav Legend Owner Welfare Association, a group of 190 members from Andheri, have approached Amboli police station to lodge a fresh FIR of cheating and forgery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bldr-dupes-5-flat-buyers-of-rs-10-crore/articleshow/88111722.cms||Ahmed Ali

The animals not just obstruct vehicular traffic, but may also cause accidents. A large number of livestock animals are often seen on the Lam Road, that links Deolali Camp to Nashik Road, as well as the internal roads of the cantonment town that lead to the market area. All day long, small herds of cattle cause traffic snarls here. Many residents of the Deolali Camp area said the owners of these animals should ensure that their cattle are let out in the fields for grazing and not on the streets. Subhash Khaire, a resident of Deolali Camp, said, “Cattle on the streets are a common sight here. The roads are already narrow and the animals occupy most of the space. They do not move despite repeated honking by motorists.” Many others said wrong-side driving was also a common problem on the Deolali Camp streets, and when the wrong-side drivers pass through the herd of cattle, the situation gets worse. Bhagwan Kataria, former corporator and vice-president of Deolali Camp, said they are spreading awareness among people to not let their cattle out on the roads. There is a cattle farm of the cantonment board, and the animals can be kept there. When contacted, senior officials of the cantonment board said they were planning action against the cattle owners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/cattle-blocking-traffic-on-lam-road/articleshow/88109561.cms||Santosh Sonawane

He was killed on November 20 and the murderers dumped his body at a secluded place, said officers of Ahmedabad rural police who knew about the murder while investigating the missing person’s complaint. According to Bopal police, the deceased has been identified as Ankit Mehta, 39, who worked with a private firm. On November 23, his family members informed the cops that he had been missing. When Bopal police personnel were searching for him, they found that his cellphone was being operated and Rs 6 lakh had been transferred from his UPI account. Tracing the cellphone location, the cops found Mehta’s friend Vasu Saini from Chhatarpur in Madhya Pradesh. Saini told the Bopal cops that he and two friends, Amit Saini and Samrat Saini, had strangulated Mehta during a road trip on November 20. Bopal police approached Vidisha Police and inquired about Mehta. Officers of Vidisha Police told Bopal cops that they had found a body on November 20 from a secluded place and had registered a case of accidental death. The body had been buried after completing the postmortem examination. Later, Bopal police arrested Amit from Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh. Samrat is still on the run. The arrested men told the cops that they had befriended Mehta at a temple. As he used to remain anxious due to some personal problems, they persuaded him to go to a temple in Ujjain by road. The accused hired a car from Ahmedabad and took him to Madhya Pradesh. They sought the account details from Mehta and strangled him with a muffler. Bopal police has filed a case of murder against the three and has begun an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/three-befriend-bopal-man-and-kill-him-in-mp/articleshow/88110743.cms||---

Speaking to reporters, SP Sachin Patil said additional bandobast, in the form of teams of State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) and home guards, has been deployed in Malegaon to ensure that there is no untoward incident. He requested people to not leave for Mumbai or Nagpur, and instead pay their respects to Dr Ambedkar at their own hometowns. SP Patil conducted a meeting with the peace committee members of Malegaon on Saturday. Patil said people should be made aware that they must not put up objectionable posts on the social media. The police have arrested several people who had made objectionable posts on the social media in the past. If such a case is registered against someone, his/her entire future may get spoiled, warned the SP. Violence had broken out in Malegaon last month during a bandh call. About 10 people, including a few police personnel, were injured. Against this backdrop, the police are making continuous efforts to ensure that law and order situation is under control in the textile town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/heavy-bandobast-in-malegoan/articleshow/88109570.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Driving test tracks at edu institutions to cut wait time||New Delhi: While the capital is on its way to get 12 automated driving test tracks by next year, Delhi government has started creating seven new test tracks at educational institutions. TOI reported in October this year that Delhi government’s transport department has identified seven sites at Industrial Training Institutes at Mayur Vihar, Shahdara, Narela, Jail Road, Pusa Road and Jafarpur Kalan, apart from the Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University at Kashmere Gate and Delhi Technological University in Bawana. Each automated test track is expected to cost around Rs 10 crore. The first automated driving test track in Delhi came up at Sarai Kale Khan, which caters to both the South and Central zones, in January 2018. In March next year, three more such centres came up at Mayur Vihar, Vishwas Nagar and Shakur Basti, followed by a track at Burari that July. Last year, automated driving test tracks came up in October at Loni Road, Rohini and Raja Garden and Dwarka also got a centre in January 2021. However, the number of automated test tracks are not able to cater to the rush of applicants appearing for driving tests. As a result, Delhi government zeroed in on educational institutions to construct tracks, which would reduce the load on existing test tracks. Delhi government also plans to start 12-hour shifts seven days a week from the automated driving test tracks at Sarai Kale Khan, Loni Road, Shakur Basti, Rohini and Janakpuri. The maximum number of driving licenses are issued every year from tests conducted at these locations. The 12-hour shifts may also be planned for other test tracks later, sources said. With the completion of work at Lado Sarai, Hari Nagar and Jharoda Kalan, Delhi would have a total of 12 automated driving test tracks by next year. The transport department plans to rope in another agency for maintenance and operations of these tracks by that time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/driving-test-tracks-at-edu-institutions-to-cut-wait-time/articleshow/88111337.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Mumbai||Pet regret: Many abandoned dog or cat after lockdown, says survey in Mumbai||Alongside sourdough baking and virtual concerts, the other ‘quarantine trend’ that exploded was pandemic pet adoption. With people confined to their homes and often suffering emotional distress, many flocked to pet shops and shelters to find a furry friend that would make lockdown less lonely. For many, the cat was their only companion and the dog-walk, their only trip outside. But as the world moved on and the initial enthusiasm wore off, many of these new pet parents realised they weren’t dog or cat people after all. The same animal shelters that had recorded high adoptions at the height of the pandemic, are faced with an influx of pet surrenders due to ‘buyers’ remorse’. “Impulse pet adoptions were already quite common,” points out Kirti Bhardwaj, a member of Animal Adoption & Care, a collective of animal lovers and rescuers in Mumbai. “But during the pandemic, it went through the roof, as people craved companionship without giving enough thought to what would happen when they went back to work or resumed their old lifestyle.” While Bhardwaj has been fielding “six to eight calls every day” from pet owners wanting to relinquish their dogs since lockdown lifted, there have been several instances of dogs and cats unceremoniously dumped at marketplaces, roadsides and parks. The launch of a first-of-its-kind study of pet homelessness, conducted by Mars Petcare and an advisory board of animal welfare experts, last week confirmed this. India’s data revealed that despite an increase in pet ownership during the Covid-19 pandemic, where “six in 10 people” felt encouraged to bring home a pet, relinquishment levels are higher in the country. 50% of pet owners said they had relinquished a pet since the pandemic began, compared to 28% globally. Many pets were abandoned at the beginning of the pandemic due to fears of whether pets could pass on the virus. Others took in a pet to stave off loneliness and later realised upkeep was not easy. If 34% said they had abandoned a dog on the streets, 32% admitted to having abandoned a cat. Among the nine countries surveyed, India also recorded the highest pet homelessness with a score of 2.4 on a scale of 10 (lower the score, worse the scenario), followed by Mexico at 3.9, and South Africa at 4. This doesn’t surprise Aditi Nair, founder of Pet Owners and Animal Lovers Foundation, who stumbled upon Atlas, a six-month-old Great Dane at a construction site in Thane about eight months ago. “He was very ill, had loose motions and a maggot wound — all a result of severe lack of care. The first thing we did was inform the local police station because someone might be looking for a lost pet. No one was, which meant he was abandoned,” says Nair who nursed Atlas back to health before he was rehomed and rechristened Gabbar recently. “Most abandoned dogs and cats are sick and/or come with behavioural issues because owners found their upkeep too expensive and exhaustive,”says Nair, who for the last few months has been nursing three Persian cats — Sylvester, Oliver and Peanut — all deserted outside a chawl in varying degrees of distress. Sylvester had maggot wounds on his tail and liver issues, while Oliver had multiple wounds, and Peanut was suffering from a viral infection and on the verge of losing an eye. “There’s a craze for Persian cats these days and they’re also being abandoned in large numbers because people buy them as a status symbol without knowledge of the breed’s dietary or medical requirement. Yes, they’re furry and cuddly, but also need special care and grooming. Not to be dumped because they shed hair.” Pedigreed and exotic canines, too, are surrendered or discarded every day by owners unable to nurture them after the initial showing-off. “We’ve seen so many labradors and dobermans living on the streets. When taken out of a protective environment, they don’t have the social skills to adapt to the street, can’t fend for themselves and die of maggot wounds,” says Bhardwaj. According to animal welfare advocates, pet buyers don’t always research beforehand. “One has to understand that they’re bringing home a life, not a use-and-throw toy,” Nair stresses. The excuses typically range from “return to office”, “couldn’t find a full-time carer” to “moving cities” and “allergies”. “Adopting a dog or a cat is like adopting a baby. One shouldn’t make these decisions on an impulse if they’re not able to commit their time and energy,” reiterates Ganesh Ramani, managing director, Mars Petcare India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pet-regret-many-abandoned-dog-or-cat-after-lockdown-says-survey-in-mumbai/articleshow/88111979.cms||Mohua Das

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: RGIA lab lowers Covid test rates||HYDERABAD: The state health department on Saturday directed airport health authorities at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) to charge Rs 500 for RT-PCR tests after receiving complaints of overcharging from international passengers. Reacting to the letter from the state health department, Mapmygenome, a diagnostics firm, announced lowering the RT-PCR test charges to Rs 750 on Sunday. Many had also taken to social media to complain about the issue. In one such complaint, C Satyanarayana tweeted, “In Hyderabad airport agencies are over charging the travellers for RT PCR tests. At RGIA, a regular RT-PCR test costs Rs 999, and a rapid RT-PCR test costs Rs 4,500 for passengers. Telangana government allowed to charge Rs. 500-800. Please stop this looting.” “I was charged INR 4500 at Hyderabad Airport for at Rapid test to fly to Dubai,” tweeted Surya from the twitter handle @surya_kan. The charges meant a heavy burden for families travelling together with many having to cough up Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000 for the tests for a five to six-member family. Meanwhile, in the letter addressed to the airport health officer, RGIA, the director of public health, Telangana Dr G Srinivasa Rao said, “This is to inform you that complaints have been received against Mapmygenome laboratory at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, Shamshabad that is charging more than the rate prescribed by the state government from international passengers for Covid (RT-PCR) test. In this regard, it is to inform that government has fixed Rs 500 as maximum charge for RT-PCR test,” read the letter. It further asked the airport health officer to take measures to ensure that the government rate be displayed at various places in the airport. It also said the WhatsApp grievance number 9154170960 must be displayed prominently apart from ensuring that Mapmygenome laboratory issues payment receipt for international passengers who have paid for the RT-PCR test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rgia-lab-directed-to-charge-rs-500-for-rt-pcr-test/articleshow/88110756.cms||---

---||Pune||NIV to isolate, culture Omicron strain to assess vaccine efficacy||PUNE: Scientists at the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV) have initiated efforts to isolate and grow the Omicron strain of the novel coronavirus from the Dombivali man’s throat/nasal swab sample inside its high-end biosafety laboratory in Pune. The scientific exercise will answer two critical questions: Can this variant impact the efficacy of Covishield and Covaxin; and will it outfight existing antibodies in those who have had Covid illness from old strains? “The ICMR-NIV received the positive sample of the Dombivali man whose genome sequencing confirmed the infection from Omicron strain on Saturday night. Isolating the whole Omicron strain from the sample is going to take at least a week. Thereafter we will be able to take up a neutralization study to assess the efficacy of Covaxin- and Covishield-induced antibodies and natural infection-induced antibodies against the lab-grown strain,” said an ICMR official. The isolation and culturing of the Omicron strain are going to be the first step towards finding answers to these crucial questions. “Once we have isolated the whole strain and grown a sufficient amount of it in our bio-safety lab, our scientists will be able to take up the neutralization study to assess vaccine efficacy,” the official said. A neutralization study is the best way to assess vaccine efficacy and chances of reinfection. Through this study, scientists will also be in a position to compare the ‘level’ of neutralizing ability against existing strains and the new variant. “And beyond cell-culture experiments, the protective ability of vaccine-induced as well as natural infection-induced antibodies can be studied in animal models against the new variant. A positive correlation will increase the confidence in vaccines,” said another virologist. Infection by any strain of SARS-CoV-2 kicks off an immune response against the entire virus, and not just against certain parts such as its ‘spikes’. This is why many experts believe mutations are unlikely to affect vaccine-induced protection. There are 1,273 amino acids on the SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein that triggers the immune response. The new Omicron variant has 32 amino acid changes or mutations in the S protein. So, the assumption that vaccines will offer protection against the new strain sounds logical, experts said. The Neutralization Study Scientists at ICMR-NIV will be isolating and culturing (growing) the Omicron strain in ample amounts using animal cells Once through, they will draw neutralizing antibodies from the serum or blood of Covid-recovered patients/ vaccinated humans The lab-cultured (grown) Omicron strain will be used in the neutralization study by subjecting the strain to antibodies drawn from the recovered patients/vaccinated participants and examining how they react with each other||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/niv-to-isolate-culture-omicron-strain-to-assess-vaccine-efficacy/articleshow/88111324.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Speed bars gone, Western Railway hits near-100% punctuality||MUMBAI: Western Railway (WR) has said the punctuality of its trains has increased to almost 100% from 95% in 2019-20 after it removed permanent speed restrictions (PSRs) at various locations between Churchgate and Bhayander. PSR is imposed primarily because of track geometry where there is a big curve and at crossovers, where trains change tracks. Speed restrictions at PSR spots ensure that there are no accidents, particularly because of derailments. WR general manager Alok Kansal had drawn up a plan to remove obstacles to improve punctuality across the suburban section. “The removal of PSR is a great achievement as some of these were in place for almost 30 years. We now have a punctuality percentage of 99.3,” said WR’s chief public relations officer Sumit Thakur. TIMES VIEWDespite the pressures of running one of the most crowded rail transport systems in the world, the Western Railway deserves praise for upgrading its services. The removal of permanent speed restrictions along its entire route will improve the running time of local trains and allow operational flexibility.WR used to run 1,367 services, which increased to 1,373 from November 22 after the introduction of eight more air-conditioned services. The removal required a realigning of track geometry. This can only be done by a suspension of services, but Thakur said, “We took advantage of the lockdown when the number of services was less to undertake this challenging work.”  At Marine Lines, there was a PSR of 20 kmph, which meant that the train had to slow down from peak speed before entering the stretch. “Because of the removal of this PSR, we are able to save two minutes per train. It comes to almost 560 minutes per day. Similarly, we are saving 1.25 minutes per train, or almost 307 minutes per day, because of the removal of PSR between Bandra and Khar,” said Thakur.  Zonal Railway Users’ Consultative committee member Kailash Verma said, “Still, there are days when trains from Virar run late by 10 minutes during the morning peak hour as authorities give priority to long-distance trains that arrive late in Mumbai.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-speed-bars-gone-wr-hits-near-100-punctuality/articleshow/88111745.cms||Manthank Mehta

The detained people are activists of the Sambhaji Brigade and they had thrown ink on the journalist in response to alleged misinformation and defamation of Sambhaji Maharaj by the journalist in his book ‘Renaissance State: The Unwritten Story of Making of Maharashtra’. Speaking to TOI Amol Tambe, DCP (Zone 1) of Nashik police commissionerate, confirmed that two people have been detained and necessary legal action would be taken against them. The journalist concerned — the editor of a Marathi newspaper — was one of the speakers at the sammelan. The ink was thrown on him a few minutes before his speech in one of the sessions of the literary meet. District secretary of Sambhaji Brigade Nitin Rote Patil accepted responsibility of the incident. “Sambhaji Brigade takes strong objection to the information on Sambhaji Maharaj published in the book. Six months ago, our members had given a complaint in this regard in Pune. We had also asked author to remove the objectionable part. However, the author neither picked our phone call nor come for discussion,” said Rote Patil.

---||Goa||All women will get Rs 1,000 a month, also hike Griha Aadhar by Rs 1,000: Arvind Kejriwal||MARGAO: AAP national convener and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal came out with yet another poll guarantee on Sunday, this time for women. He said that if AAP is voted to office, payment for beneficiaries under the government’s Griha Aadhar scheme will be hiked from the current Rs 1,500/month to Rs 2,500/month. Besides, all women above 18 who can’t avail of the scheme owing to one-beneficiary-per-household rule will get Rs 1,000 per month,Kejriwal said. “This will be the biggest and most effective women empowerment programme, not only in India but in the world,” Kejriwal said. He announced this guarantee while addressing a gathering of women at Navelim. He, however, said that the scheme will provide an option for people to opt out if they so desire. He said that the finances required to implement the scheme will come from the money saved by avoiding corruption in the government system. “We will give Goa honest politics,” he said. This is the fifth “Kejriwal guarantee” assured by AAP for the 2022 assembly polls. While his first guarantee was to provide 300 units of electricity free per month, the second was about promising government jobs, reserving 80% jobs for Goans in the private sector, and providing doles to the unemployed. During his subsequent visit, he came with the third guarantee — senior citizen pilgrimages to Ayodhya, Shirdi, Velankanni and Ajmer Sharif for free, and then followed it up with the fourth, wooing taxi and rickshaw operators by saying an AAP government would form a dedicated corporation to decide policies and matters pertaining to the sector. In his address on Sunday, Kejriwal lauded lawyer Amit Palekar, who ended his five-day long fast on Saturday. Palekar was on an indefinite strike protesting the approvals granted by the government for an illegal structure at Old Goa. He broke his fast after the town and country planning department (TCP) withdrew the approvals given to the illegal structure. “At a time when political leaders switch parties for crores of rupees, here we have found a leader who is willing to put his life on the line,” he said, even as he said the battle will be fought by the party at another level. “Now, we have to save Goa’s politics. Goa’s people are very good, but Goa’s politics is horrible. We need to clean up Goa’s politics. And in this, women will play an important role,” Kejriwal said. He said that Goa was currently witnessing only two types of political discourse — party-hopping, and alliances. “There isn’t any leader who talks about improving the quality of education, bettering water supply or providing employment to locals. “It’s all dirty and ugly politics of which Goans are fed up. On the other hand, AAP has come to Goa with a blueprint for Goa’s development,” Kejriwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/all-women-will-get-rs-rs-s-1k-a-mth-also-hike-griha-aadhar-by-rs-rs-s-1k-kejriwal/articleshow/88111346.cms||---

However, this year, parents of toddlers as well as the private pre-primary schools have to navigate through uncertainty. Provisions of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 require that three years of pre-primary education — nursery, KG-I and KG-II — are also considered part of mainstream education. The directorate of education (DoE) also issued a circular last year on NEP provisions stating that only toddlers who complete three years of age by May 31 of that particular year will be eligible for admissions to nursery. Pre-primary schools, however, said that there has been no further communication from the government to them on implementation of other provisions of NEP at nursery level. There are around 450 pre-primary registered schools in the state, many of them are private and function independently and are not attached to any primary school, while NEP states that pre-primary classes should now be considered part of five years of foundational learning up to Class II. Schools are waiting to hear from the government about the future of the independent pre-primary schools. This also means uncertainty for parents admitting their children in such schools. “The Prime Minister’s vision is to implement NEP recommendations at all levels by 2030. In the state, teacher training has begun and work to revise the syllabus as per NEP provisions has also started,” said All Goa Government Recognized Unaided Schools Association (AGGRUSA) president Vijai Shetti. “As per NEP pre-primary stage is also now part of five years of foundational education stage from nursery up to Class II. Goa has many independent pre-primary schools.” “Many schools also have a shortage of resources. We have not yet received any communication from the government on what is the plan for independent pre-primary schools that only have classes from nursery up to KG-II,” The parent of a toddler, Mervin Dais from Margao, said that schools were confused when they sought answers during admission inquiries. “We asked the nursery if they have a tie-up with any primary school so that our child does not have an issue after completing education up to KG-II. Also, the cut-off age for admissions is three now as of May 31, 2022. This will mean my child is eligible for admission only in June 2023, even though she turns three in July 2022. Irrespective of what the rules state, it is a reality that after the age of three, schools admitting children test their knowledge of basic alphabets, etc. In this case, it will be left to the parents to teach them till the time they are eligible for admissions to nursery,” Dias said. Some parents said they are also unsure whether under the new NEP norms it will be permissible if they choose to admit their child in the schooling system at a later stage, due to the pandemic. “The rules are vague at present and even schools could not give us clarity on whether we are allowed to admit the child directly in KG-I, by skipping the nursery stage, as NEP states nursery is now part of the foundational education stage,” a mother said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lack-of-clarity-on-nep-norms-implementation-brings-uncertainty-in-nursery-admissions/articleshow/88111357.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The FIR against the sugar mill was lodged on the complaint of BJP MLA from Gola Gokrannath constituency Arvind Giri at the Gola police station. The FIR has been lodged against owner Kushagra Bajaj, unit head Ompal Singh, factory manager RK Mishra and legal adviser Avani Kumar Pandey. The accused have been booked on the charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and criminal breach of trust and Essential Commodities Act, for not paying dues to farmers and financially exploiting them. MLA Giri in his complaint stated that non-payment of dues of the last crushing season has led to severe discontent among farmers and may lead to a law and order problem. “Sugar mill purchased 120 lakh quintals of sugarcane for which it had to disperse around Rs 387 crore as per the government rate but the mill paid only Rs 120 crore despite several notices and reminders. As per rules of Sugarcane Control Order-1966, payment must be made within 14 days from purchase of sugarcane,” he said. The farmers have been staging a dharna demanding their dues, due to which the mill has not been able to operate for the 2021-2022 crushing season. The non-payment has tarnished the image of cane department and created a law and order issue. Earlier, an FIR was registered against Bajaj Hindustan Sugar Mill at Palia police station of the district on the complaint lodged by cane department special secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, against the mill manager Pradeep Salar, finance manager Manoj Kumar Mishra and general manager sugarcane Sunil Kumar Dhingra. On November 26, Additional Chief Secretary, cane, Sanjay Bhoosreddy had directed the mills for speedy payment for the current crushing season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sugar-mill-owner-officials-booked-for-cane-dues-on-bjp-mlas-plaint/articleshow/88111356.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Jaipur||BJP won’t topple Rajasthan govt, but beat it in 2023 polls: Amit Shah||JAIPUR: Union home minister Amit Shah has asked his party workers to force the Ashok Gehlot government to reduce Value Added Tax (VAT) on diesel and petrol. Addressing party workers at Janpratinidhi Sankalp Sammelan at Jaipur Exhibition and Convention Centre (JECC) on Sunday, Shah said, “Gehlot loves his tijori (money) more than the problems of people. I urged Gehlotji that BJP ruled states have reduced VAT to reduce the price of fuel and you too should reduce VAT.” “Gehlot government is not reducing the price….we have to force him by organising a movement,” he added. Shah was on a two-day trip to Rajasthan, which concluded with his address. Earlier in the day, over 40,000 people welcomed the Union home minister from the airport to JECC. Shah has repeatedly called party workers and leaders to aggressively work for getting an absolute majority in the state in 2023. He recognised the efforts of party workers in paving the way for forming the government in the Centre by giving all 25 seats in 2014 and 24 seats in 2019. The remaining one seat in 2019 was won by BJP’s ally Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) Hanuman Beniwal who drifted away over farm laws. Taking a dig at Gehlot for living in constant fear of seeing his government fall apart, Shah said, “Nobody is attempting to topple your government…. but you should tell us why your own people are running away from you.” He said the BJP would never topple Gehlot’s government and rather would go to the public in 2023 to seek their blessings and will return with an absolute majority in the state. “Gehlot is busy fighting internal fights while the law and order situation has gone for a toss. Cases of rape, murder and crimes against Dalits are at an all-time high. Even several cases of murders of temple priests have also been recorded in the state, which clearly states that temples are not safe,” said Shah while advising Gehlot to stop visiting other states like Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh and focus on improving the condition of his own state. Countering the claims of Gehlot of running an efficient government, Shah challenged him to hold assembly polls in Rajasthan with the polls in Uttar Pradesh. “Contest polls with UP and you (Gehlot) will come to know what the people of Rajasthan want,” said Shah. Accusing Gehlot of the poor show of central government schemes, he said, “Gehlot government twisted, tweaked and dropped several social welfare schemes of former CM Vasundhara Raje while not allowing people to reap the benefits of the schemes of the Modi government,” said Shah. Slamming the UPA government for poor security at the border, “Moni Baba (Manmohan Singh) government had always reacted poorly to terrorist attacks while PM Narendra Modi has given befitting reply to Pakistan for the attacks in Pulwama and Uri by carrying our airstrike and surgical strike.” Shah recalled his party’s contribution in paving the way for Ram Temple at Ayodhya and scrapping Article 370 from J&K.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/we-will-not-topple-gehlot-govt-but-beat-him-in-2023-polls-shah/articleshow/88111359.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Notorious shooter arrested, cops say gang war averted||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Special Cell has allegedly averted a gang war with the arrest of a notorious shooter of the Kapil Sangwan gang. Police said Deepak Dhankar had been playing cat and mouse for several months and was planning to eliminate his rival, Manjeet Mahal, who is in custody. Dhankar was allegedly involved in the murder of gangster Manjeet Mahal's father in Mitraon village, which triggered an all-out war between the Mahal and Sangwan gangs. He was on the run for six heinous incidents, including murder and extortion. He had also jumped his interim bail and absconded only to be involved in a crime spree that allegedly included a murder. DCP (Special Cell) Jasmeet Singh said that the accused was arrested from Kakrola road and a semi-automatic pistol with five live cartridges was seized from him. “Inspector Shiv Kumar’s team received information about Dhankar's movements in Kakrola and laid a trap. The accused was spotted sitting in a Celerio and identified by the informer,” the DCP said. Dhankar was signalled to stop the car, but tried to flee on detecting police presence. He tried to shoot at the policemen but was overpowered tactically without any exchange of fire. The suspect was disarmed and arrested. The rivalry between the Sangwan and Mahal gangs took a nasty turn in 2015 when shooters of the Sangwan gang killed the father of their rival, Nafe Mantri, and injured his mother and wife to avenge the killing of Sangwan’s brother-in-law. After that, Sangwan and his associates had gunned down the father and brother of Dharmender, an associate of Manjeet Mahal, for the same reason, police said. Sangwan was eventually arrested by the police, after which Deepak Dhankar was given the reigns of his gang. Dhankar and his aide Krishan again bumped off the father of Manjeet Mahal in village Mitraon. Dhankar was later arrested and was on interim bail when he again went underground and started committing crimes. On November 9, a non-bailable warrant was issued by a court. Dhankar, cops said, was involved in multiple criminal cases including murder, attempt to murder, robbery/dacoity, car-jacking, trespass, criminal intimidation, assault on police, extortion and Arms Act in Delhi and Haryana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/notorious-shooter-arrested-cops-say-gang-war-averted/articleshow/88111358.cms||---

In a letter addressed to drug control officers and chemists and druggists associations in the state, the assistant director, DCA said, “All drug control inspectors and assistant directors in the state are instructed to strictly implement rule 65 (2) of Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945. All the drug inspectors are instructed to ensure that a pharmacist should be available at every medical store and prescribed drugs should be sold in the presence of a registered pharmacist only.” Officials were also directed to conduct surprise inspections and joint raids to ensure that the directive is followed by medical stores. “If any violations are found, stringent action should be taken immediately,” read the order. Meanwhile, pharmacies and small medical stores mainly running with one or two workers do not have registered medical practitioners. “We have been turning away patients requiring prescription drugs since the second wave began as lot of complications were happening. Infact, we stopped stocking a lot of drugs,” said an owner-cum-worker of a small medical shop in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sell-drugs-only-after-inspection-by-pharmacists-dca-to-med-shops/articleshow/88110776.cms||---

As per officials, the Omicron variant can cause nausea, vomiting and headaches. However, Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director of public health, Telangana confirmed that lockdown is not being thought of under any circumstance while maintaining that ‘lockdowns are the not solution.’ “Covid-19 cases are likely to increase in the state after January 15. The severity of the cases is set to increase further by February. We can get rid of the infection by taking the vaccine. Masks should be worn continuously for the next six weeks at home and where people are likely to congregate. We must protect ourselves and not let the guard down as Covid-19 can be asymptomatic too. No severe symptoms have been seen in those infected with Omicron so far. Infection with this variant can cause severe aches and pains, headaches and lethargy. People experiencing these symptoms should opt for Covid-19 test immediately,” said Rao. Officials said that sooner or later the variant might spread across the state. “Arrangements have been made to tackle a possible third wave. Those coming from abroad are being tested at Shamshabad airport,” said the official. Revealing details about the incoming passengers from various high-risk countries, the official said that so far a total of 979 passengers have landed at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) in Shamshabad. “All the passengers have been tested with the RT-PCR method and so far only 13 have tested positive for Covid-19. Their samples were sent for genome sequencing and the reports are expected on December 6. One of the sample was sent to the CCMB while the remaining were sent to the CDFD,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-cases-may-increase-after-jan-15-health-dept/articleshow/88110780.cms||Amrita Didyala

A report on vaccine wastage stated that the state average for Covaxin wastage is just 0.79%. According to Cowin data, Pune district has administered 1.25 crore Covishield doses so far against 9.84 lakh Covaxin doses. Sanjay Deshmukh, the assistant director (medical), Public health department, Pune circle, told TOI, “One of the major reasons is the limited number of vaccination sites of Covaxin, which results in a limited response to the vaccine. The other reason being, the limited supply and limited beneficiaries.” Deshmukh said Covaxin wastage has been observed to be higher across many other districts in the state. “The wastage could also be attributed to the fact that it was recorded in the phase when the district was going through a shortage of syringes. But now the issue has been addressed and the wastage is getting back to negligible,” he said. An official with the District Hospital Aundh, which is the only dedicated Covaxin site in the district, said they recorded wastage of 145 doses since in January. “Most wastage occurred in the first two months when the Covaxin was available only in the 20-dose vial. Now the vial is available in 20, 10 and five dose vials,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wastage-of-covaxin-in-district-at-3-17-higher-than-states-average/articleshow/88111355.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Kochi||Gandhinagar poll an acid test for fronts||Kochi: The byelection to Gandhinagar division of Kochi corporation will be an acid test for both LDF and UDF. While retaining the seat will give confidence to the ruling front which is holding power through a tightrope walk, winning the election will fuel the UDF’s move to unseat the LDF from power. On the eve of the byelection on Monday, both the fronts expressed confidence that their candidates would emerge winner. “Voters are fed up with the poor performance by the LDF in Kochi corporation. We are sure that our candidate will win,” said Antony Kureethra, opposition leader. “In the past several years, LDF councillors represented the division. But there isn’t proper development in Gandhinagar. So, the residents of colonies in the division are against the LDF,” Kureethra claimed. The main contest is between Bindu Sivan, wife of K K Sivan, of the CPM and P D Martin of Congress. It was following the demise of Sivan that Gandhinagar seat fell vacant almost six months ago. “A decade since 2010 marked lack of proper development in the division. Though the councillors discharged their duties well, the ruling UDF didn’t support them. It reflected on the development front as well. But, in the six months from December 2020 when Sivan had been councillor, the situation changed. The LDF which is in power extended all the support and the change is now visible in the division,” mayor M Anilkumar said. “In the campaign, we compared the 10 years of the UDF rule with the past 10 months of the LDF rule. The voters are convinced, and we are confident of increasing the margin,” he said. In the local body elections in 2020, the polling percentage in Gandhinagar was less than 50. “There was some dissent among the LDF workers. Now, all such issues have been addressed. The poll percentage will go up this time and the LDF will steadily increase the margin,” an LDF leader who has been in the campaign front in the division said. Gandhinagar is the stronghold of the LDF where its candidates used to get a margin of more than 1,000 votes. In the 2020 local body polls, Sivan won by a margin of just 130 votes. “Besides the unity among the party workers, the developments brought in after the LDF assumed power in Kochi corporation a year ago also will pay off,” he said. The UDF hopes that their effort to wrest power from the LDF will be easier once the front’s candidate wins from Gandhinagar. “Then, we will be able to win the byelection to Ernakulam South division which will be held soon. So, our strength in the corporation will go up and some of the councillors who support the LDF will switch sides. This will help us wrest power from the LDF,” a UDF leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gandhinagar-poll-an-acid-test-for-fronts/articleshow/88131485.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

---||Kochi||Kerala: Byelection at Piravom today||KOCHI: The bypoll to division 14 (Edapallichira) in Piravom municipality on Tuesday will witness tight contest as LDF is trying to retain power while UDF is looking to wrest the seat. The death of councillor George Narekkad in May this year warranted bypoll to the division which used to witness candidates from both parties scripting victory in every alternative five years. LDF won the 27-member council with the support of 14 councillors. Following the death of Narekkad the number shrunk to 13, same as that of the opposition UDF. UDF ruled the local body in the last council when the Piravom municipality came into existence in 2015. Ajesh Manohar is the LDF candidate, while Arun R Kallarakkal and P C Vinod are UDF and BJP candidates respectively. As LDF cashes in on the activities it carries out in the division and the sympathy factor over the death of the councillor, UDF pins hope on the backwardness of the division as a whole. The Left party also believes the current trend in favour of LDF will benefit them in the election. Kallarakkal was the health standing committee chairman in the previous UDF council. “We lost the division to LDF for more than 100 votes. Our votes got split due to the presence of a rebel candidate. We do not face such a threat in this bypoll. We will wrest back power,” said Thomas Mallipuram of the UDF. Counting of the votes will be held on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/byelection-at-piravom-today/articleshow/88131496.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Vaccination drive: 2,200 inoculated in 3 Old City mosques||HYDERABAD: Amidst the growing threat of new variant Omicron, about 2,200 people have been vaccinated in three mosques in Old City in the last five days. Local mosque committees have taken up a vaccination drive in parts of old Hyderabad, particularly slum areas, amidst vaccine resistance in minority-dominant areas. The mosque committees have also surveyed about 5,000 households so far and the exercise will continue for the next six months to ensure that everyone in the Old City is vaccinated against Covid-19. The response has been good. The special drive is funded by Azim Premji Foundation (APF) and executed by Helping Hand Foundation (HHF) in partnership with primary health centres at Rajendranagar, Hasanagar and Jalpally. The large turnout of people at the vaccine camps attached to mosques shows that people are gradually shedding vaccine resistance and hesitancy after local religious leaders and social activists created awareness on the need for vaccination, HHF representatives said. The three mosques serve a catchment of 30 urban slums. The mosque camp at Jalpally administered 703 doses of Covid-19 vaccine, followed by Rajendranagar at 480 and Hasanagar 398. The camps began on November 29. “Out of the total doses administered, 75% were first dose cases. In the door-to-door survey, 4,596 households have been covered. Volunteers are checking out for unvaccinated and pending second dose cases. We are bringing them to the vaccine camps,” said HHF managing trustee Mujtaba Hasan Askari. He said the threat of Omicron coupled with awareness through religious and community leaders, including special mention during Friday sermons in mosques, had resulted in many people turning up voluntarily at these mosque camps. Vaccination camps are also being held in interior areas through mobile vans and public announcements are being made daily. The vaccination camps at Masjid Mustafa, Rajendranagar, Masjid Adam Alaihis Salam, Hasanagar and Masjid Omer Shifa, Shaheen Nagar, are open daily from 10 am to 3 pm. A notable feature at these camps is the large turnout of women. Most of them have not been vaccinated for fear of adverse side effects. This is the second time in five years that religious leaders are actively participating in the vaccination drive to beat vaccine resistance. The turnout is expected to increase further as local mosques have taken upon themselves the task of creating awareness through door-to-door campaign in areas where resistance or hesitancy is high.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vax-drive-2200-inoculated-in-3-old-city-mosques/articleshow/88110788.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Goa||Goa’s plans for genome sequencing lab hit permission hurdle||PANAJI: Goa’s plans for a genome sequencing laboratory at Goa Medical College may not see light of day due to difficulties faced in getting the required permissions for setting up the facility. A senior health official said that the main reason Goa is unlikely to get permission is because a similar facility is available in Mumbai and Pune. More than six months ago, health minister Vishwajit Rane had proposed the setting up of a genome sequencing facility at GMC after it was realised that there were inordinate delays in receiving reports from the National Institute of Virology (NIV) at Pune, where samples were routinely sent for genomic sequencing. “Certain criteria have to be met for setting up of a regional laboratory and that’s why the approval has not been granted,” an official said. Since March, although Goa sent randomly-selected samples to NIV, Pune, and subsequently to other laboratories, most reports were received more than a month later, and after the worst phase of the second wave ended. The delta strain was found in 94% of the samples sent for genomic sequencing between March and June-July. Presently, results of around 400 samples sent during last few months are awaited. With the emergence of Omicron, the newly-found variant of the coronavirus, the official said it was very important that Goa received test reports immediately, or else some alternative arrangement has to be made so that carriers of the new variant are detected faster and the state can take immediate measures to contain its spread. Dr Utkarsh Betodkar, state epidemiologist, said the latest samples or samples sent for testing after the discovery of Omicron will get priority, and results will be received faster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/states-plans-for-genome-sequencing-lab-hit-permission-hurdle/articleshow/88111361.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Delhi||Delhi: Half of ATM break-ins unresolved in 3 years||NEW DELHI: Data analysed by the crime branch of ATM break-ins in the past three years has revealed that more than half of them remained unsolved. While deputy commissioners of police have been directed to conduct a fresh survey of ATMs in their areas and take preventive measures, senior officers have also been handed a list of 77 suspects and asked to keep tabs on them. A report submitted by special commissioner of police (crime) Devesh Chandra Srivastava and sent to senior officers on November 18 said a total of 90 ATM shutter-breaking cases were reported during 2019, 2020 and 2021. Of these, only 42 cases were solved. “Only 12 of the 89 arrested criminals are in jails,” Srivastava said in the report. In 2019, a total of 27 cases were registered, 12 solved and 23 suspects arrested. Last year’s cases rose to 42, with 19 solved and 42 accused being arrested. This year till November 18, 21 cases took place, of which 11 were solved and led to 24 arrests. Of the 90 cases analysed, 51 were reported between 12am and 3am while 19 took place between 3am and 6am. “Six incidents happened between 6am and 9am, five between 9am and 12pm, four from 9pm to 12am, three between 6pm and 9 pm and the remaining two between noon and 6pm,” the report said. The report said in more than 35 cases, the suspects came from a different district of Delhi or a neighbouring state. “If criminals commit a crime in the area or district where they live, it is likely that they can get caught easily because of surveillance by local police. Hence, they often choose a different district for committing the crime so that no one can identify them,” an officer said. An investigator said criminals often use two types of modus operandi for committing ATM thefts. “They uproot the cash dispensing machine by tying one end of a strong rope to it and the other to a pickup car or they use a gas-cutter,” the officer said, adding that suspects keep an eye on abandoned ATMs in the city. “Many times, they also keep stones or weapons in their vehicles so that they can throw them at policemen if they are chased,” he said. Earlier this year, four members of a gang from Nuh were arrested by special staff (south district) for alleged ATM thefts. Police said they would cut off the ATM’s power supply just before the money was withdrawn and one of the accused would hold on to the notes without actually taking them out. “After the machine was switched off, the accused withdrew the money. Due to the power cut, the process of withdrawal would be affected and their bank balance would remain the same,” the officer said. If the money was debited, the gang would visit the bank and file a complaint, after which the amount would be transferred to their accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/half-of-atm-break-ins-unresolved-in-3-years/articleshow/88111364.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Rapid RT-PCR test cost varies at various airports, Mumbai among top||MUMBAI: A major concern these days when it comes to international travel is the cost of Covid tests, especially that of a ‘rapid RT-PCR’ test done at the airport. The cost varies from airport to airport to such a degree that on one end there is the Kochi airport where a rapid test is priced at Rs 2,490 and on the other is Kolkata airport which charges Rs 4,000.  Mumbai airport was on the extreme end as it charged Rs 4,500 for the rapid test. But on December 4, it reduced the cost to Rs 3,900.  Two categories of flyers largely undergo the rapid test. Those bound for Dubai — under UAE norms, they must undergo the rapid test six hours before departure. Then last week after the Omicron-led norms came into effect in Maharashtra, many flyers arriving into Mumbai from ‘at-risk’ countries have been voluntarily opting for the rapid test. The reason? They cannot leave the airport or board a connecting flight till the time the test result is issued. On December 3, for instance, of 969 who underwent RT-PCR test, 755 opted for Rapid PCR test, as per the Mumbai airport. Unlike the regular RT-PCR test which reports in 6-8 hours and costs below a thousand rupees, the rapid RT-PCR issues a report within 13 minutes to 2 hours. Social media has been rife with tweets on the expensive tests. Ruchir Purohit tweeted, saying there is no logical explanation why the rapid test costs more in Mumbai than in Delhi.  As per an IATA survey of July, 70% respondents said they believed cost of testing is a vital barrier to travel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rapid-rt-pcr-test-cost-varies-at-various-airports-mum-among-top-in-mumbai/articleshow/88112006.cms||---
---||Lucknow||30yrs after Ayodhya demolition, Babri Masjid Action Committee now a defunct body||AYODHYA: Three decades after the Babri mosque demolition, the Babri Masjid Action Committee (BMAC), which was formed in 1987 at the peak of the Ramjanmabhoomi movement is now a defunct body with a critically ailing Zafaryab Jilani being the sole member of the once-influential Muslim outfit that spearheaded a public campaign and legal battle to protect the Ayodhya mosque. Jilani’s son Najam Jilani confirmed to TOI that currently the committee did not have any office-bearers or active members. “With abba (father) ill, there’s nobody left to lead or handle day-to-day activities. All have gone,” he said. The committee shot to limelight in the turbulent years leading to the mosque demolition and several members, including former diplomat and politician Syed Shahabuddin, Imam Bukhari, Maulana Ubaidullah Azmi, SP leader Azam Khan and Hyderabad politician Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi projecting themselves as champions of the Muslim cause. Even after the Babri demolition, BMAC actively participated in organising black days and holding protests for reconstruction of the mosque on December 6, but gradually it lost steam. “BMAC began losing its appeal among Muslims after the 2010 Allahabad High Court verdict, which split the disputed land in three parts. BMAC was accused of failing to strongly pursue the case in court and its leaders were forced to issue clarifications to the community. Again, after the special CBI court of Lucknow acquitted all Babri demolition accused, BMAC again drew ire of Muslims,” said Maulana Wasif Hasan, mutawalli of Teeley Wali Masjid, Lucknow. On February 5, 1986, soon after the unlocking of the Babri mosque, the Babri Masjid Movement Coordination Committee was formed under the leadership of former diplomat and Janata Party leader Syed Shahabuddin. In March next year, an overarching organisation was constituted — Babri Masjid Action Committee (BMAC) — with several Muslim leaders, including the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid Syed Ahmed Bukhari and Hyderabad politician Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi joining ranks. In following months, the movement organised protests in UP and Delhi, demanding status quo at the then disputed site. In March 1987, the BMAC protest at the Boat Club venue drew more than a million participants. These mobilisations prompted consolidation in the Hindu camp with VHP setting up Ramjanmabhoomi Mukti Yagna Samiti with top seers and organised a mahayagna in Ayodhya on October 11, 1988, ahead of a planned march by BMAC to Ayodhya. BMAC, however, was not a registered body and was mainly run by Zafaryab Jilani and others, while declaring all Muslims as its members. Though defunct today, BMAC then enjoyed political patronage of Janata Dal and Congress leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/30yrs-after-ayodhya-demolition-babri-masjid-action-committee-now-a-defunct-body/articleshow/88111362.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh not whistleblower, says Maharashtra govt affidavit in SC||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government has filed a counter-affidavit before the Supr-eme Court seeking dismissal of the special leave petition (SLP) submitted by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. The state said it had “no knowledge of any conversation having taken place” between him and incumbent director general of police Sanjay Pandey, and only learnt of the alleged exchange when Singh filed the petition. Singh is no whistleblower, contrary to his claim in the SLP, the state said, adding that it has approved initiation of disciplinary proceedings against him under the All-India Service (Discipline and Appeal) Rules of 1969, and issued him the charges of alleged misconduct or misbehaviour and lists of documents and witnesses. The SC bench of Justices S K Kaul and MM Sundresh will hear the SLP on Monday. The state said the Bombay high court order of September 16, which Singh seeks to challenge before the SC, is correct. It added that HC’s dismissal of Singh’s plea against two preliminary enquiries in April—to be conducted by Pandey—was on grounds of maintainability. The state said validity or allegations of ‘malafides’ of the order to conduct preliminary enquiries falls within ambit of ‘service matters’ which can be challenged before Central Administrative Tribunal, as held by HC. Singh, in a letter to CBI on April 19, alleged that Pandey had offered to mediate and advised him to withdraw his March 20 letter to the CM ag-ainst the then home minister Anil Deshmukh. The affidavit by V M Bhat, joint secretary of state home department, said such conversations, if any, are of “purely personal nature” and “not at the instance” of the state. In any case, the state said, CBI is probing the conversations as is evident from the summons it had issued on September 18 to the DGP, hence rendering the SLP infructuous. The state’s affidavit, drafted by its advocate Rahul Chi-tnis, clarified that this conte-ntion is “without prejudice” to its petition pending before HC. It has sought transfer of the probe into CBI’s FIR against Deshmukh and unkno-wn others to a court-monitor-ed special investigation team on the grounds that the CBI probe “is biased as its director Subodh Jaiswal is a witness and a possible accused”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-singh-not-whistleblower-says-state-affidavit-in-sc/articleshow/88111749.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Forum directs IT firm to refund Rs 1 lakh||HYDERABAD: A district consumer forum here has directed an IT firm to refund Rs 1 lakh and pay another Rs 1 lakh as compensation to a consumer for failing to develop and deliver the website. D Naveen Nischal, the complainant, submitted that he approached Sri Sai IT Solutions in Kukatpally for their services in creating a website— a multi-user e-commerce site which displays the description of agricultural products in English, Telugu and other local languages. Nischal said that he entered into an agreement with the firm on May 21, 2019 and paid Rs 40,000 as advance. By August 3, 2019, he said that he paid a total of Rs 1 lakh out of the Rs 1,26,900, which was total consideration. He said that even after the lapse of many months, the firm failed to develop the e-commerce website as promised. He said that he made several requests, but the firm kept on dodging the matter on some pretext or the other. Nischal said that he even got a legal notice issued to the firm asking them to return his money. Left with no other alternative, the complainant approached the forum seeking a refund and compensation. The opposite party, on the other hand, has not appeared before this commission and was set ex parte. From the documentary evidence submitted by the complainant, the forum noticed that even after receiving Rs 1 lakh, the opposite party failed to provide server application software maintenance to the complainant as promised. “The opposite party did not respond even after receiving the legal notice and summons, this shows their negligence to provide the service to the complainant. It clearly shows a deficiency in service and it is true that it causes more mental agony to the complainant,” the forum said. Apart from refund and compensation, Rs 5,000 was awarded as the cost of the complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/forum-directs-refund-of-rs-1l-for-failing-to-develop-website/articleshow/88110801.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

However, the tanker was later lifted from the slush safely and no gas leakage was detected. The incident happened near Gregorian Public School on Monday morning. A tanker carrying liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from Coimbatore to Irumbanam got stuck in the mud after slipping of the road while the driver was taking reverse near the school. According to the police, the driver lost the path and took a wrong turn to the road that heads to the school. He realized the mistake only after seeing the dead end of the road near the school. Then he tried to turn back by taking reverse in a tight spot. In the process, the rear side of the truck slipped off the road and entered the marshy land adjacent to the road. As the area was not steep, the tanker did not topple avoiding a major accident. Though the driver tried to take the multi-axle tanker out of the slush it ended in vain. By that time residents in the area and staff of the school noticed the incident and alerted the police and fire force. The fire and rescue personnel came to the spot and ensured that there was no gas leakage. But as the tanker was too heavy and fully-loaded only a heavy duty hydraulic crane could lift it. As the exam of Class XII was scheduled in the school the authorities decided to not move the truck until the exams were finished. However, as a precaution, the school gave holiday to all other students. “Fortunately the tanker did not topple and there was no gas leakage. But when the tanker was lifted we did not want kids here for their safety reasons. So we sent them home immediately and completed the evacuation in 20 minutes. The tanker was later lifted with the crane in the afternoon,” said principal Jayaprabha Pradeep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gas-tanker-stuck-in-slush-near-school-lifted-safely/articleshow/88131507.cms||---

He had submitted his passport at the time of sampling which officials said has a "British address with the place of birth mentioned as Bareilly.” They added that he works for an IT firm with one of its units based in Gurgaon. District nodal officer for Covid, Dr Anurag Gautam said, “The man has been identified but we are yet to get him. He arrived in India on November 24 and came to Bareilly the next day. He stayed at his residence in Sadar Cantonment area with his father. The man seems to be still unaware that his reports were positive. He has left Bareilly, perhaps for Delhi." The district nodal officer added that a notice has been sent to the private lab for not collecting the man's mandatory details. "We have informed the state government and are taking the help of the police. His samples have been sent to Lucknow for further lab tests, and its results would help us understand the exact Covid strain. The man had entered the country from Delhi airport where he is said to have tested negative," he said, adding that police will contact the British Embassy and his company officials in Gurgaon for further details. An official of the local intelligence unit (LIU), who wished not to be named, said, “Foreigners visiting any district in UP are supposed to fill ‘Form C’ online before their arrival and the details are sent to our headquarters in Lucknow. The local residents or the hotel authorities, where the foreign guests are staying, are supposed to notify us. We have not received any information about this missing man who arrived on a British passport in Bareilly. So, we will take appropriate action against him on this as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-with-foreign-passport-tests-positive-for-covid-in-bareilly-then-goes-missing/articleshow/88110162.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

On Sunday, 28 students from a medical college in Karimnagar tested positive. Concerned about the spike, the college has temporarily suspended classes and shut hostels. According to reports, hundreds of students had attended annual day on November 27 without masks. Many of them developed symptoms later and 43 tested positive in the last two days. The college has 1,000 students. There have been roughly 300 cases in educational institutes across the state in the last 40 days. At the current rate, the next spike could occur in the middle of January and everything would depend on Covid-appropriate behaviour, sources said. “The next wave will see half of what we’ve observed in the second wave, but it is best to avoid huge gatherings,” health officials said Health director G Srinivasa Rao has warned people about lowering the guard. He said that there was no need to worry, but ignoring proper behaviour could lead to a spike. Meanwhile, the number of confirmed cases from an apartment at Puppalguda increased to 14.

Businessmen say if they comply with the order, they will have to pay arrears to workers on retrospective basis.Gurmeet Singh Kular, president of FICO, says, “Recently, the CM announced an increase in minimum rates of wages by Rs 415.89 per month. With it, the minimum wage has been revised from Rs 8,776.83 to Rs 9,192.72 per month. But in a setback to the businessmen, it has been decided that the hike will be applicable from March 2020. In the present situation when there is a severe slump in the market and especially the MSME units are struggling for survival, this backdate increase is a big blow to the industry and is unjustified.”“We are not against the increase in minimum rates of wages, but it should be from the current date. We request the CM to increase it from September 2021, else the industry will not be able to bear this financial burden,” he adds.Rajeev Jain, general secretary of FICO, says, “Apart from the minimum rates of wages, the industry will face other repercussions also, as we will have to pay arrears under ESI Act, EPF Act, Income Tax Act, among others, and there will be other complications too. We, therefore, request the CM to increase the minimum rate of wages from September 2021.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bizmen-roll-back-minimum-wage-revision-from-backdate/articleshow/88110170.cms||---

As per the university’s counselling document accessed by TOI, AKTU could fill only 19,057 seats out of the total 1.03 lakh in various engineering, management, architecture and pharmacy courses till the final round of counselling this year. Candidates told TOI that poor placement record is the main reason behind the high number of vacant seats. University officials said the vacant seats would be filled through direct counselling. “Even after scoring second highest marks in my batch, I failed to get a job with a good pay package as hardly any company visited our college for placements. In the job fairs organized by the university, companies offered packages as low as Rs 3-4 lakh per annum. There is no point in joining such jobs as even my BTech fees was more than this,” said Shashank Sharma who pursued BTech in mechanical engineering from a private college in Meerut. “I had to change my field and I am now preparing for banking sector,” he said. “Only a few good colleges affiliated to AKTU in Delhi-NCR region have the required infrastructure like hi-tech laboratories and software to impart quality education,” said Avinash Bajpai, who had applied for a course in AKTU as a backup option. “I preferred admission to a private university in Vellore as it offers better placement and facilities,” he added. Vidhi Tripathi, another candidate who preferred a private college in Bengaluru, said: “As a student, we look for job security which is revealed by past placement records of any academic institute. I know many who had pursued engineering from AKTU private colleges and are now preparing for government jobs.” Meanwhile, AKTU spokesperson Asheesh Mishra said, “We have been taking various initiatives to improvise our student enrolment records. We have closed a number of colleges which were not performing well in terms of student placements and quality education.” “Over the time, we have reduced the number of seats in colleges so that we can focus on quality, not quantity. From this year, we have introduced minor courses in emerging technologies like learning artificial intelligence, machine learning which can be pursued along with traditional courses. This skilled-based learning will further improve their job prospects,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aktu-professional-courses-find-fewtakers-only-19k-of-1-03l-seats-filled/articleshow/88111374.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Resident doctors to strike; won’t do OPD work in Mumbai||Mumbai: Resident doctors from all government-run colleges of Maharashtra will join the pan-India agitation of medical students against the postponement of NEET PG counselling. The medicos have complained of being overworked as only two batches of students are currently working in medical colleges. The Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) have said that they will not participate in outpatient department (OPD) services from Monday. However, they will not stop emergency work and surgeries. Hospital authorities in Mumbai have confirmed that they will run OPDs with the help of senior faculty members. KEM dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said that OPDs can be managed to some extent by senior doctors.  NEET-PG for MD/MS admissions is usually held in January, but due to Covid it was conducted in September. While the counselling process was to commence on October 25, petitions challenging a central government notification stalled the process. In the state, senior resident doctors (final-year students from 2018 batch) were relieved on July 1. Since then, hospitals are managing with only two batches, instead of three. The doctors want the PG counselling process to be fast-tracked as non-Covid work load has increased and Covid duties are also being assigned.  Mumbai doctors have an additional reason for the protest. Recently, notices were issued to vacate the accommodation that was provided by MHADA/BMC after the Covid outbreak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/resident-doctors-to-strike-wont-do-opd-work-in-mumbai/articleshow/88112008.cms||---

He said, in the current bypolls, the people have rejected BJP because of the inflation. Taking a jibe at Amit Shah’s Jaipur visit, Khachariyawas said that Shah is coming to Jaipur to settle the infighting among the BJP leaders, but even this will not help. In the past, the BJP has issued ‘black paper’ four to five times. So, whenever the BJP leaders release paper, it suffers a defeat, he said. Khachriyawas said, on December 12, a large number of people will support the Congress in protest against inflation and the policies of the Central government. On a question related to Sachin Pilot, Khachariyawas said that success, failure, victory and defeat are all in the hands of destiny. The destiny is in the hands of Lord Krishna and whatever is decided by the almighty will happen. Only time will tell the fate of a person.

---||Vijayawada||AP: More takers for OTS scheme as awareness drives pay off||VIJAYAWADA: The Jagan Anna Saswatha Boohakku (One Time Settlement) scheme which had initially faced criticism from beneficiaries is now getting positive response. A string of awareness camps conducted by the government is deriving positive results. For several years, successive state governments had given houses under various schemes to beneficiaries. But these houses are not entitled for transfer of title. Similarly, many people living in these flats shoulder the burden of paying back installments. The state government launched registrations for the OTS scheme which gives complete rights including transfer of property and mortgage to the beneficiaries at B-form lands and D-form lands. The scheme also helps beneficiaries to clear all their dues to the government. The people initially opposed the scheme as they have to pay Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000 as OTS fees based on the location of the property. After the door-to-door awareness camps by ward and village secretaries, 9,530 beneficiaries have applied for the OTS scheme in Krishna district. “Jagan Anna Saswatha Boohakku is the last chance given by the government to regularise and register the houses given by the government under various schemes. On paying a nominal fee all pending dues to the government will be waived and a clear registered title will be given to the house owner. They can sell it or mortgage it as a guarantee to the banks,” said J Nivas, district collector. “Many beneficiaries are coming for enrollment and we hope every eligible beneficiary will apply for this scheme by the due date,” he said. Meanwhile, opposition parties and various associations are opposing the scheme and demanding the government to register the property free of cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/more-takers-for-ots-scheme-as-awareness-drives-pay-off/articleshow/88110173.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Delhi||Delhi: Waqf board takes up conservation of Jama Masjid, in need of urgent repair||NEW DELHI: The Delhi Waqf Board on Sunday said it had decided to conserve Jama Masjid. According to Waqf section officer Mehfooz Mohammad, the conservation project is currently in its initial phase. “After the waqf board chairman Amanatullah Khan visited the mosque, a team of section engineers and conservationists was sent there to carry out a second inspection. The portions of the masjid in dire need of repair are its small dome, minarets and the roofs,” Mohammad told TOI. About a month ago, when the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid Syed Ahmed Bukhari had initiated the repair of mosque’s small dome and roof, reactions had poured in from heritage enthusiasts and conservationists on social media, expressing their disappointment over the use of cement. Delhi-based historian and author Swapna Liddle had then told TOI, “The entire building of Jama Masjid was built in red sandstone. And the use of white marble in its dome is its most beautiful feature. It is a matter of shame that the monument built during the reign of (Mughal emperor) Shah Jahan is getting such treatment by its authorities. Cement will not only affect the beauty of the mosque, but also severely affect its health in the long run.” Seconding the Imam’s explanation that “the use of cement was urgently needed then to save the other parts of the monument from water leakage from the small dome and the roof of Jama Masjid”, Mohammad said: “only cement could have stopped the water leakage”. The slabs and stones of several parts of Jama Masjid have developed cracks. The board’s chairman has decided to initiate the entire mosque’s repair this month even if no government agency comes forward to support the works. But any fund support is welcome,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/waqf-board-takes-up-conservation-of-jama-masjid-in-need-of-urgent-repair/articleshow/88111385.cms||Zumbish

According to police, the deaths were prima facie the result of a suicide and the accused have been arrested under Section 306 of the IPC. Dileep of Punchepady, Nayarambalam, is the arrested. The relatives of the woman had alleged foul play in the death. Police said the relatives had produced an audio clip in which the victim named the person, Dileep. “In the clip, the relatives can be heard asking who did this, when the woman replies with the name. There were confrontations between the victim’s brother and the accused twice last month. A case for stalking and pestering the woman was registered against him as well,” said an officer. On Sunday, neighbours saw smoke coming out of the house around 6am. The woman and her son were the only residents of the house. Her husband had died earlier.

It is for the first time post pandemic that the ridership touches the 50,000 mark. On Saturday, the Metro registered a ridership of 50,233. Before the onset of covid-19, the Metro ridership was around 65,000 per day. The most number of footfall in a single day in the history of Kochi Metro was on June 19, 2018, when 1.56 lakh passengers used Kochi Metro. On December 31, 2019, the Metro recorded a footfall of 1.25 lakh. As the Metro services resumed after the restrictions imposed subsequent to the first lockdown were lifted, the ridership was 18,361 a day. When the restrictions were lifted a few months after the second lockdown, the average footfall a day was 26,043. In November, the daily average ridership rose to 41,648. According to Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) officials, starting more feeder services connecting various destinations and Metro stations contributed heavily to increasing the footfall. The concessions allotted to the passengers, slashing parking rates, etc. also paid off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/at-50k-metro-records-highest-post-pandemic-ridership/articleshow/88131514.cms||---

They will be placed in localities with a large number of simians, officials said. "Monkeys have been a cause of concern because of several attacks over the past few months. Some of them have proved fatal as well," divisional forest officer (DFO) of Meerut, Rajesh Kumar, said. If the cut-outs are unable to scare monkeys away, langur urine will be spread across several locations to get rid of them, the DFO added. He further said that the cut-out experiment, if successful, will be one of the cheapest ways to scare away monkeys. “We have placed the first cut-out in a city nursery,” the DFO said. According to sources in the forest department, various drives undertaken to catch monkeys over the past few years revealed that contractors often released the animals just outside the city limits, from where they could reenter the city easily. The DFO said that monkeys cannot be trapped and then left in locations such as Hastinapur and Shivalik as these areas are already facing an acute monkey menace. “A comprehensive policy is needed to control the monkey menace as this is not a problem confined to Meerut. The entire nation is suffering from it,” Kumar said. Notably, authorities at Lucknow Metro have also opted for cut-outs of langurs to scare away monkeys at metro stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/langur-cut-outs-to-scare-monkeys-away-in-meerut/articleshow/88110195.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Ahmedabad||Months after Covid death, woman booked for cheating in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Seven months after a woman died of Covid-19 in the killer second wave, she has been booked for cheating 24 persons of Rs 47 lakh with the promise of giving them housing subsidies under a government scheme. She did not keep her word and was booked on Saturday, posthumously. According to an FIR filed with Isanpur police, Nisha Shah had been running a fair price shop in Vatva. The FIR said she took money from about 24 people by telling them that she would help them get subsidies to build their own homes. She reportedly took the money between January 2019 and March 2021, ahead of the Covid calamity in the city. After she died in May at 55, the 24 people separately approached Shah’s daughter Heli to make inquiries about their money. Heli told each one of them that she was unaware of her mother’s financial transactions. One of the 24 people, Gulab Kataria, who works as domestic help in Vatva, filed a complaint of cheating and breach of trust against the deceased. Kataria said in her FIR filed with Isanpur police that she had come to know about Shah’s shop in January 2019. In one of their meetings, Shah told Kataria that she could help her if she wanted her own house. Shah told Kataria that she will help her avail of a government subsidy of Rs 3.50 lakh. Kataria was told that houses were being constructed near the Gebanshah Pir shrine in Vatva. Shah told Kataria that she would have to pay Rs 70,000 and the government would provide the Rs 3.50 lakh. Kataria paid Shah Rs 70,000 between January and June 2020 and got receipts for the payments. Kataria said when she had met Shah last, in February, Shah had told her that she will get the subsidy by April or May 2021. As Kataria could not get any information about the subsidy, she went to Shah’s shop and was shocked to learn that Shah had died. Then Kataria realized that 23 others had also lost their money. They all joined Kataria when she went to the Isanpur police station, where the complaint was filed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/months-after-covid-death-woman-booked-for-cheating/articleshow/88110817.cms||Ashish Chauhan

All teachers are protesting against this unjust and unnecessary action. In PAU, Harmeet Singh Kingra has started an indefinite hunger strike till their demands are accepted. So, it is our duty to stand with our teachers and support them in this crucial time.

---||Vijayawada||AP: Soaring vegetable and oil prices leave family budgets in tatters||VIJAYAWADA: Skyrocketing prices of vegetables and cooking oils has become a major concern for the consumers. Prices of brinjal, ridge gourd, okra, and carrot touched an all-time high of Rs 85 per kg in local markets on Saturday. Incessant rains damaged the vegetable crops in Rayalaseema and south coastal districts and resulted in increases in prices all of a sudden across the state. Tomato, which initially touched Rs 120 per kg mark, is now stable at Rs 50 per kg after officials started importing from Karnataka, Maharashtra and Telangana. But traders and market authorities are not importing other vegetables considering the huge cost of transport. “Ridge gourd and bottle gourd are widely cultivated in Chittoor and Nellore districts and we usually import their crop. But production fell significantly following the rains. We made efforts to import them from Maharashtra but stalled our proposals as farmers there are selling ridge gourd at Rs 35 per kg and we have to sell it at wholesale rate of Rs 65 after adding transport cost and margin. Consumers will not buy it at that price,” said M Sesharatnam, a wholesale vegetable vendor at Kaleswara Rao wholesale market in the city. On the other hand, the soaring prices of cooking oils is also worrying the consumers. Prices of sunflower, palm, groundnut and gingelly oils increased by 25 per cent when compared to last year. Traders expect prices to rise further next month as demand increases during Sankranti season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/soaring-vegetable-and-oil-prices-leave-family-budgets-in-tatters/articleshow/88110190.cms||Venu Lanka

When the health department conducted contact tracing, they found that their relatives from South Africa met them at their residence and spent 3-4 hours. The family from Adarsh Nagar is a joint family of 14 persons, but out of those, four have contracted the virus. After that, the health department met the family from South Africa and got their samples and they tested positive for Covid-19. Their samples were sent for genome sequencing on November 3 to SMS Medical College and NIV, Pune. Health department officials said before arriving in India, they got their Covid-19 tests done thrice from November 21-23, and they had tested negative for the virus every time. What is even more worrisome is that the family, who arrived from South Africa had attended a wedding ceremony at City Palace on November 28. The groom is the brother-in-law of Mukesh. The groom belongs to Ajitgarh in Sikar and the bride belongs to Karkardooma in Delhi. The wedding ceremony was attended by around 100 guests. Chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I) Dr Narrottam Sharma said, "We are taking the list of guests who attended the marriage. We have also informed Delhi’s health department about the wedding of a girl from Karkardooma in Delhi, which was attended by a family which returned from South Africa." The health department has also informed Sikar administration. "From Sikar’s family, eight samples were taken and all of them have tested negative for Covid-19. Since the family which attended the marriage has tested positive for the Omicron variant of Covid-19, we will do resampling for getting their Covid-19 tests done," said Galriya. He said, "All of those, who tested positive are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms." According to the health department officials, the family that arrived from South Africa is asymptomatic and out of five persons from Adarsh Nagar, the 71-year-old man, the 46-year-old man, and the 39-year-old woman have a cold and cough. The husband and wife (from South Africa family) are fully vaccinated, while four, out of five from Adarsh Nagar family are fully vaccinated. The 16-year-old girl from Adarsh Nagar family is not vaccinated as she is a minor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/9-including-sa-returned-family-of-4-test-omicron-ve/articleshow/88111390.cms||---

Swinging into action, a team of four personnel from the Bidkin police station, of Aurangabad rural, busted the event and rescued seven bulls. The cops also seized nine pick-ups, 14 two-wheelers and arrested two people. The raid was carried out at an open ground in the vicinity of a hamlet — Jambhli Tanda — where people from nearby villages had gathered to witness the event. Superintendent of police Nimit Goyal said the suspects not only organised bullock cart racing, but were also accepting bets from the audience. After carrying out the panchanama, the suspects were booked under relevant sections of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, the Maharashtra Prevention of Gambling Act, the Maharashtra Police Act as well as for organising a gathering in violation of Covid-19 norms. Bidkin police station’s assistant inspector Santosh Mane said, “On learning about the event, we rushed to the spot and found a large gathering. As soon as we started arresting the suspects, the crowd started dispersing.” During the raid, taking advantage of the open ground, large number of the participants fled with their respective bullock-carts. “To avoid any untoward incident like stampede, directives were given to seize maximum number of vehicles and bulls, instead of nabbing the organisers or those placing bets, as they could be nabbed even after registering the offence,” Mane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-cops-bust-bullock-cart-race-rescue-7-animals-arrest-2/articleshow/88109648.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Police said they arrested the boy’s 23-year-old cousin and his two aides, who had kidnapped him and made a ransom call for Rs 60 lakh. After receiving the kidnapping complaint, SSP Abhishek Yadav had formed a special team to investigate the matter. The breakthrough, however, came after the accused made the ransom call and police tracked down the mobile phone location. ASP Krishan Bishnoi said, “The boy’s family had lodged a missing complaint on November 25 at Chhapar police station. On December 4, his father approached police again, stating that he had received a ransom call.” After tracing the phone’s location, the police team recovered the boy from a graveyard at Khoja Nagla village and arrested Sadiq Rana (cousin), Abdul Rehman and Shahzad Shaikh, and seized two country-made pistols from their possession. The accused have several criminal cases registered against them, said police. “Sattar, who is considered a rich man locally, landed in India after getting the information of his son’s kidnapping and sought police’s help as soon as he arrived at the village,” said the ASP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/cousin-two-aides-held-for-kidnapping-boy-12-demanding-rs-60-lakh-ransom/articleshow/88110237.cms||Mohd Dilshad

---||Dehradun||BCCI takes away infra development rights from cricket bodies of U’khand, Bihar, Puducherry & North-east||Dehradun: Infrastructural development for cricket practice and matches in Uttarakhand, North-eastern states, Bihar and Puducherry will now be taken care of by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), not the cricket associations of the respective states. The decision was taken at the 90th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of BCCI held in Kolkata on Saturday. Sources said that the move will come as a major blow to these state bodies as development of infrastructure forms a major part of their activities. As to why a core responsibility was stripped from these associations, sources privy to the matter indicated at three possible reasons – infighting, slow pace of development works and lack of funds. In particular, the apex cricket body was unhappy with the continuous infighting among the members of the Cricket Association of Uttarakhand (CAU), as per sources. Last month, amidst high drama, BCCI had taken away CAU’s voting rights for an upcoming election although the rights were later reinstated. A CAU official, on the condition of anonymity, told TOI, “The reason behind the responsibility being taken away from CAU can largely be attributed to continuous infighting among members of the association. Moreover, BCCI wasn’t satisfied with the slow pace of cricket development in the state.” Some sources also said that CAU office- bearers wanted BCCI to take over infrastructural development, since it requires large capital, which CAU didn’t have. “A meeting was recently held between the finance team of BCCI and CAU, in which this particular topic was discussed,” the CAU official added. Meanwhile, the budget for 2021-22 was adopted at the BCCI AGM. Notably, BCCI secretary Jay Shah is also in-charge of overseeing cricket-related development works in Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bcci-takes-away-infra-development-rights-from-cricket-bodies-of-ukhand-bihar-puducherry-north-east/articleshow/88110225.cms||Mohammad Anab

The case under IPC section 420 (cheating) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) was registered against the duo on the orders of a local court. In the FIR, complainant Narendra Singh alleged that Sachin Chaudhary of Amroha and Amit Singh of Chhajlait are managing directors of a service provider company through which he bought a residential plot for Rs 9.70 lakh in 2018. When he started the construction, the real landowner stopped him. When he sought his money back, the duo threatened him with dire consequences. When TOI contacted Congress leader Chaudhary he said, “The company belongs to my family members. I have nothing to do with it. I was described in the complaint as managing director, which is baseless. I never assumed any designation in the company. I am going to send a notice to the complainant for tarnishing my image.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-cong-general-secy-booked-for-duping-man-of-rs-9l/articleshow/88110214.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh crosses 9 crore vaccination mark in last mile push for 100% coverage||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh became the fourth state to reach nine crore vaccine dose coverage on Sunday. Though Uttar Pradesh with 16.77 crore, Maharashtra with 11.84 crore and West Bengal with 9.46 crore doses are ahead of MP, in terms of coverage of first and second dose, MP is way ahead of these three states with about two-third population fully inoculated. The coverage for UP and WB is just about 50%, while that of Maharashtra is high at 60%. Three mega vaccination days to cover around 45 lakh people plus another 22 days of December should see a near 100% double-dose coverage in Madhya Pradesh. Double vaccination is seen as a major measure to curb spread of Covid-19 infection and its variants. Recently, MP has logged over 150 Covid-19 cases in about two weeks. “Target is of two jabs for 5.49 crore eligible. We will touch four crore fully vaccinated people on Monday. It leaves us with 1.13 crore less. We will cover around 35% of eligible in three mega vaccination days December 8, 15 and 22 and rest will be double jabbed too. We expect a 95% coverage considering migration, deceased and other indicators,” said Madhya Pradesh immunization officer Dr Santosh Shukla. As many as 1.13 crore people are to be reached given health department estimates. If 45 lakh are covered in three days of the said mega vaccination days, that leaves the health department with only 22 days to cover over 3.12 lakh doses per day. The move on the face of it, the target looks achievable. Covid-19 vaccination campaign in the last few weeks has been an impressive. 1.87 crore vaccine doses have been administered across Madhya Pradesh in last 30 days. That was an average of 6.26 lakh doses per day in last 30 days. To achieve target of 100% double dose vaccination, MP health department needs to achieve 4.37 lakh doses per day. On Sunday Madhya Pradesh imparted 1.53 lakh doses, which was the fourth highest for any state in the country. 1.44 lakh doses were for people seeking full inoculation. Dhar reported the highest vaccination coverage in Madhya Pradesh with almost 50,000 doses administered during the day. Guna, Chhatarpur, Ashoknagar, Barwani and Balaghat covered more than 6000 doses during the day. Three districts Chhindwara, Mandla and Anuppur did not report any vaccination coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-crosses-9cr-vaccination-mark-in-last-mile-push-for-100-coverage/articleshow/88112031.cms||---

The Delhi BJP unit didn’t comment on the allegations and there were no immediate reactions from the party regarding the claims made by AAP. Chadha said that AAP’s members are principled volunteers who cannot be lured by excessive money, and ‘a promise of a dazzling and luxurious lifestyle’. “Starting today, we have ordered every single MP, MLA, worker, and any other AAP member in Punjab to put their phone on recording any time an offer call strikes,” he said. “Do whatever you want, stay away from the Aam Aadmi Party, do not try to talk to our people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chadha-alleges-bjp-poaching-aap-functionaries-in-punjab/articleshow/88111422.cms||---

The man is vaccinated, they added. “While it’s too early to comment on the nature of the variant, we are keeping a close eye on the progression. The patient has not developed any complications so far. To start with, he had developed cough and fever and thus he got tested,” said the official, adding that two of his relatives who have also tested positive – their samples are sent for genomic sequencing – have remained asymptomatic. With only a few cases reported of the variant in India, the experts are keeping a close eye on its impact on vaccinated patients, its progression and its severity. The first few patients have reported sore throat, body ache and weakness according to a few reports. “Need of the hour is to increase testing of all suspected cases, keeping a close vigil on airports and railway stations, screen maximum persons and go for aggressive contact tracing. So far, it’s very similar to the onset of the pandemic when the first cases were reported in the persons who returned from abroad,” said a city-based infectious diseases specialist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/symptoms-mild-experts-keep-a-close-eye-on-progression/articleshow/88110828.cms||---

The recent unseasonal showers have badly affected grape, paddy, onion and other crops, causing huge losses. Pawar has sent a letter to Thackeray, seeking filing of the panchanamas of crop damage and immediate relief disbursal for the rain-hit farmers in the state. The unseasonal light to medium rainfall lashed parts of Maharashtra, including the Nashik district, last week. In Nashik district, the farmers have suffered post-harvest losses on the crops like paddy and onion. Moreover, ready-to harvest grapes have also been badly hit. A delegation of the Maharashtra Rajya Draksha Bagaitdar Sangh (MRDBS), a grape growers association, recently met the state agriculture minister Dada Bhuse and urged him to provide immediate financial assistance to the rain-hit farmers. The MRDBS also urged Bhuse to give a 50% subsidy on the plastic material that is used to cover grapes to protect them from rains and hail. Bhuse has assured the delegation to look into the issue positively. Kailas Bhosle, the president of MRDBS said, “The ready-to-harvest grapes in Satana and Baramati areas have developed cracks due to the recent rains. Around 20% of the total vineyards in the state have been affected due to rains.” Khanderao Shevale, a grape farmer from Satana in Nashik district said that early grape harvest has been done in Satana taluka.

In a latest division-level review meeting, principal secretary of the water supply department Sanjeev Jaiswal has said the option of solar power should be explored to run public water schemes in remote rural areas, where electricity supply still remains an issue. Notably, the drought-prone Marathwada witnesses heavy use of state-supplied tankers during summer in case of deficient monsoon, which puts heavy burden on the exchequer. “All eight districts of Marathwada should ensure effective implementation of the central mission in order to address drinking water issues in rural areas. Any bottlenecks or gaps in implementation of the scheme should be removed at the earliest,” Jaiswal said. He also pressed for staff training and community participation among other measures to carry out activities such as water conservation and groundwater recharging as a part of the central mission. Jal Jeevan Mission aims to provide safe and adequate drinking water through individual household tap connections by the year 2024 to all households in rural India. The review meeting also saw discussion on defunct public water supply schemes from Marathwada due to non-payment of electricity dues. Jaiswal also directed the authorities to utilize the funding made under 15th Finance Commission to revive such schemes. During the meeting, Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran authorities gave a detailed presentation on the proposed water-grid project for Marathwada, following which Jaiswal said Aurangabda divisional commissioner will act as ex-officio coordinator for the multi-crore ambitious project.

Singh earlier avoided two ED summons while he was in hiding to avoid arrest in different cases registered by police against him. Last month, the Supreme Court provided Singh protection from arrest till the next hearing of his petition on December 6.

Samples collected from Covid-19 clusters are also sent for genome sequencing. However, we have no clusters in the district at present, as the number of daily cases has reduced drastically in the last few weeks. Meanwhile, in the wake of the Omicron threat, samples of those who arrive from high-risk countries are sent for genome sequencing within 24 hours, if they test positive for Covid-19. None of the 17 passengers who arrived in Dakshina Kannada from high-risk countries tested positive for Covid-19,” he said. Dakshina Kannada district surveillance officer Dr Jagadeesh said that the district has been sending an average of 15 samples randomly, in a fortnight, for genome sequencing. “Transit passengers from high-risk countries like South Africa, Belgium and other nations, who arrived at the Mangaluru International Airport (MIA) via Dubai, were subjected to RT-PCR testing at the airport. If they test positive for Covid-19, their samples are sent for genome sequencing. We are now giving special emphasis for all international passengers, especially those from European countries, who land at MIA. When it comes to the Omicron variant, the district is so far safe, as all those who arrived here from high-risk countries have tested negative for Covid-19,” he said. Deputy commissioner K V Rajendra said that the district has ramped up surveillance at the airport and borders. “We are planning to send more positive samples for genome sequencing from the district,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/17-arrivals-from-high-risk-countries-test-ve-for-covid-19/articleshow/88110251.cms||---

The total count currently stands at 21. Saturday’s tally was four. after Maharashtra and Gujarat had a case each, adding to Karnataka’s two. A 44-year-old woman of Indian origin from Nigeria and her two daughters (aged 12 and 17) tested positive after travelling to Pimpri Chinchwad from the African country via Mumbai on November 24. Three of their contacts, including the woman’s brother and his two children, and a man (47) who had travelled to Pune from Finland via Mumbai on November 26 are among the seven Omicron cases in the city. The six in Pimpri Chinchwad have been quarantined at Pimpri’s Jijamata Hospital and the seventh patient at home. Delhi’s first Covid patient found to have been infected with the Omicron variant is a 33-year-old man who returned from Tanzania recently. Sources said the fully vaccinated patient is being treated at Lok Nayak Hospital. Delhi’s first Covid patient found to have been infected with the Omicron variant is a 33-year-old man who returned from Tanzania recently. Sources said the fully vaccinated patient is being treated at Lok Nayak Hospital. The 44-year-old woman and her two daughters had come from Nigeria to meet her 45-year-old brother and his family members in Pimpri Chinchwad. Three of the 13 close contacts of the woman tested positive, including her brother and his two minor daughters (aged one-and-a-half years and seven), following which their samples were sequenced at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune and the Omicron strain was detected. The 47-year-old man had returned from Finland to Pune on November 26. His positive sample, when sequenced at the National Chemical Laboratory in Pune, confirmed the presence of the Omicron variant. The total number of cases of the Omicron variant in Maharashtra has gone up to eight. “Barring the 44-year-old woman who travelled from Nigeria and the 47-year-old man who travelled from Finland, both of whom developed mild illness, the other four have not developed any symptoms or illness,” said state surveillance official Pradip Awate. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, Pune branch, said, “The fact that none of them developed severe symptoms is very reassuring. People should take both doses of the vaccine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/7-in-city-9-in-raj-1-in-delhi-omicron-cases-up-from-4-to-21/articleshow/88111426.cms||Umesh Isalkar

After a visit to Sandeep’s family, Kodiyeri said that Sandeep was a victim of political rivalry. Balakrishnan said that the murder was unfortunate, and Sandeep’s demise had left the family in deep sorrow. “It is a politically-motivated murder. The involvement of BJP and RSS in the murder is clear. They plotted the murder conspiracy,” he said. Kodiyeri consoled Sandeep’s wife and his parents. He told them that the party would be with them. “CPM Pathanamthitta district committee has been asked to ensure that Sandeep’s wife got proper employment. Educational expenses of Sandeep’s children will also be taken care of. Party will take care of Sandeep’s family,” he told the media after visiting the family. He said that Sandeep’s brutal murder was a well-planned crime executed with the knowledge of BJP-RSS leadership. He said that those who prepared the plan should be booked. “The RSS should abandon the path of violence. The BJP-RSS leadership shouldn’t think that these murders would affect CPM’s morale. CPM is on the path of peace. BJP and RSS shouldn’t see it as the party’s weakness,” said Balakrishnan. “RSS would never admit to a murder committed by its members. The same thing happened in the case of Sandeep too. Spreading false propaganda is the usual tactic by RSS when the CPM members are slain,” he said. Kodiyeri was accompanied by his wife Vinodini, minister Saji Cherian and party leaders from Pathanamthitta district. On Thursday night, a five-member gang arrived on bikes and attacked Sandeep near Nedumpuram Chathankary mukku in Thiruvalla. They stabbed him in the neck and chest. In an effort to escape, Sandeep jumped into the nearby paddy field. But, the gang hacked him in the paddy field too. Later, Sandeep was taken to a hospital but he had already succumbed to the injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sandeeps-kin-under-party-care-kodiyeri/articleshow/88110839.cms||---

While journey along the up-ghat road from Alipiri to Tirumala used to take anywhere between 26-30 minutes, it is now taking nearly 90 minutes for the devotees to reach the hill town through the second ghat road. Traffic gets affected on the up-ghat road owing to a number of reasons including the repair works and movement of down-ghat road vehicles in brief intervals. Vehicles heading for Tirumala are now passing through the second ghat road. They are then diverted to the first ghat road through the link road as the stretches near the last two-three hairpin bends on second ghat road have been closed down for repairs. On the other hand, devotees returning to their home-towns from the hill temple are at the receiving end as they have to wait for more than 2 hours to even enter the exit route. While it normally took anywhere between 45-50 minutes to complete the down-ghat journey earlier, it is now taking 150-175 minutes to reach Tirupati from Tirumala through the first ghat road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/2nd-ghat-road-repairs-trigger-traffic-snarls/articleshow/88110257.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Ankit is lodged in Kheri jail along with 12 other accused, including Union MoS for home Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish. In an application filed in court of CJM on Saturday, Ankit’s advocate said his client is suffering from "lumbar disc prolapse (slipped disc) and cannot live without a surgical chair and proper treatment". Senior prosecution officer SP Yadav said, “The application was filed by advocate Shailendra Singh who informed that Ankit Das was undergoing treatment for slipped disc in Lucknow when he was arrested by the SIT. So, he requested to send him to Lucknow for treatment and provide a surgical chair. Normally in such cases, the decision for treatment at a higher medical facility is taken on the advice of jail doctors.” Jail superintendent PP Singh said, “Ankit Das has a health issue. However, he can be treated by doctors in jail. His condition is not life threatening. Doctors haven't prescribed a surgical chair yet. It can only be provided after a doctor’s prescription and court’s approval." Ankit and his personal gunner Lateef alias Kaale were arrested from Lucknow on October 13. SIT had recovered weapons from both of them and the ballistic report had confirmed that bullets were fired from the former’s pistol. The SIT couldn’t recover his pistol’s licence as it was "burnt" along with the vehicle during the incident. Ankit Das is a Lucknow-based contractor and nephew of former Congress MP Akhilesh Das. He is said to be working closely with the BJP, and his frequent visits to Kheri district suggests his strong ties with Ashish Mishra. Ankit owned the black Fortuner - one of the vehicles which allegedly ran over the protesting farmers in Tikunia claiming the lives of four farmers and a journalist on October 3. Three BJP workers were later “lynched” and two vehicles, including the Fortuner, were torched in retaliation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kheri-violence-accused-ankits-counsel-files-plea-in-court-for-treatment-in-lucknow/articleshow/88110262.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

However, timely intervention by few staffers present at the spot along with the police deployed for bandobast avoided the untoward incident. MSRTC divisional controller for Latur Sachin Kshirsagar said Ravi Birajdar, a conductor from Ausa depot, was handed over to police after the incident. “Birajdar deliberately came to Latur depot and raised slogans in support of the merger of the state transport utility into the state government and rued over poor monthly salary before trying to self-immolate. An offence has been registered against him under IPC section 309 (attempt to commit suicide),” he said. Earlier on Saturday night, a group of 14 MSRTC employees were booked by Latur police for not allowing to restart the buses and allegedly abused the staffers resuming duties. The staffers removed their shirts and slept in front of a bus that was scheduled to move out of Latur depot for ferrying passengers. As the extended strike involving majority of MSRTC employees continues, a total of 180 depots of the transport utility across Maharashtra were shut and only 70 were operating on Sunday. In Marathwada, 41 out of 47 depots did not witness any operations, causing continuous hardship to passengers, especially those from rural areas. Even if suspension and dismissal from services have failed to deter agitating employees, MSRTC top-brass has started initiating transfers of some of the agitating employees. While the move aims at putting further pressure on agitating staffers to return to the work, its actual impact will be seen in the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/st-conductor-booked-for-attempting-self-immolation/articleshow/88109659.cms||---

The dramatic incident of road rage occurred around 2pm on Saturday near the Kaspate Vasti at Wakad. The cab driver identified as Santosh Bhosale, a resident of Pashan, chased and blocked the way of the complainant’s car. Not only that, but he also bit the forearm of his right hand. In fact, Bhosale had even threatened to kill the complainant before driving away from the spot. “We have arrested Bhosale under sections 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” said Sharad Patil, the investigating officer in this case from the Wakad police. Patil also said that the complainant was driving towards a gym in the same locality on Saturday afternoon. “He had heated arguments with Bhosale, who was plying behind him and was constantly honking. Finally, when Bhosale threatened to kill the complaint, the latter decided to leave from there,” Patil said. He said Bhosale, however chased the complainant in his cab, and forced him to stop once again. “He thrashed the complainant and bit his forearm. Bhosale again threatened to kill him and then drove away,” Patil said. Patil said Bhosale was arrested on Sunday with the help of a cab registration number provided by the complainant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cab-driver-bites-motorist-who-objected-to-honking/articleshow/88110836.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana residents want politicians to park their attention here||LUDHIANA: With election fever gripping the political parties, many announcements are being made. But the city residents feel that the leaders are not focusing on real issues that plague Ludhiana. They say no party talks about solving the parking problem in markets and residential areas, because of which roads have turned into parking lots, causing traffic jams. People say only if candidates consider these problems seriously, they will be able to take these up in the assembly and demand special funds for resolution projects. A resident of Sarabha Nagar and businessman Rahul Verma says, “We have suggested to the officials many parking places where land is available and people can park very easily, but nobody took note. Political leaders only think about their vote bank and offer free electricity, water supply and other benefits. In a growing city like Ludhiana there are other issues as well. In residential areas, people do not find parking space and it sometimes leads to arguments with neighbours. Under the Smart City project, parking lots were proposed in Ghumar Mandi, Books’ Market and Feroze Gandhi Market, but nothing came up in reality. Going to the Old City areas is a nightmarish experience in the absence of ample parking space.” Jaskirat Singh, an activist, says, “The parking mafia, poor town planning and encroachments are the major issues troubling the residents. There is a need to think about these issues seriously and if it is difficult to arrange parking lots then the government should apply brakes on purchasing of new vehicles, so that chaos on roads ends.” Sanjay Goel, an architect and member of Ludhiana Smart City Limited, says, “Parking is one of the most important requirements in Ludhiana, which is known for its cars. In the last five years, neither Smart City Limited nor the MC could deliver on a single multilevel parking. Ludhiana immediately needs at least 10 multilevel parking lots at busy commercial areas to get rid of congestion on roads. Politicians do talk about parking, but are not able to deliver. Traffic congestion and parking issues must be solved on priority.” Akali Dal candidate from East constituency Ranjit Dhillon says, “I do feel that parking and traffic are major issues, but when we talk to people they ask for free education and better medical facilities. We can deliver things if people raise the demand.” BJP state vice-president Parveen Bansal, who is former senior deputy mayor, says, “It is not that we do not think about these issues. When I was the deputy mayor, the multilevel parking lot near Mata Rani Chowk was constructed. We can plan these things on suggestion from the public.” Parking policy that was never implemented In April 2018 when Navjot Singh Sidhu was local bodies minister, the first parking policy of the state was notified, but it was never implemented. The civic body failed to take up the policy in which it was mentioned that everywhere a lane should be earmarked for unhindered movement of emergency vehicles, and no parking should be allowed on these. Electric vehicle charging facilities should be provided in parking areas and the revenue generated through parking fees could be utilised to promote local area’s improvement by providing better walking and cycling facilities, public spaces and access to high quality public transport either directly or through a dedicated urban transportation fund. The MC was supposed to notify roads and spaces for granting permission for overnight parking of transport vehicles upon payment. Apart from this, policy had also suggested the concept of community parking in residential areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/city-residents-want-politicians-to-park-their-attention-here/articleshow/88110253.cms||Nidhi Bhardwaj

Demanding action against those hospitals which exploited the pandemic situation for their advantage, the MP said, “During the Covid period, many hospitals took advantage of the helpless patients and minted money. Action should be taken against them, and the Covid treatment charges at private nursing homes and hospitals should be fixed for the future.” He, however, praised and thanked the medical staff, doctors, sanitation workers, police and the administration for serving the people during the pandemic. Rahman said the government should learn from the mistakes made during the last two waves and make arrangements to protect people from the deadly Covid virus. Meanwhile, condemning attacks on the Tablighi Jamaat and the Nizamuddin Markaz for “spreading” Covid, Rahman demanded guidelines for the media organisations to prevent them from spreading lies or targeting a particular community in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bsp-mp-demands-relief-for-families-of-covid-victims-who-died-due-to-lack-of-oxygen-supply/articleshow/88110267.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Vax cover effect being monitored||AHMEDABAD: With Gujarat recording its first case of Omicron on Saturday and India’s cases of that Covid variant going from four on Saturday to 21 on Sunday evening, the vital question is: what are the re-infection chances? Dr Mukesh Maheshwari, a city-based pathologist, said that the vaccination drive has surely shown its impact with new cases and deaths going down significantly as the vaccinated population increases in the state. “Acquired antibodies from vaccinations wane after some time, but there is no linear increase in cases,” he said. “Low cases and mortality suggest T-cell immunity.” Dr Bhavini Shah, director of a pathology lab chain, said that their study earlier this year on medical professionals had shown that about 30% of the samples had reduced antibody levels after three months. “With the onset of the new variant, more citizens are coming for antibody tests. While it’s surely a factor to ascertain future projections for infection, it’s not the only factor,” she said. “It will take us some time to understand the new variant.” But will it mean re-infection? To answer that, some more empirical data will be needed, said experts. With a high number of vaccinations — 93% getting the first jab and 73% getting the second shot — and a large population testing positive on successive sero-surveys, other factors are at play too. Experts have urged citizens not to let their guards down yet. Meanwhile, IIPH, Gandhinagar, (IIPH-G) has moved a proposal to the Centre to carry out research in T-cell immunity. Prof Dileep Mavalankar, director of IIPH-G, said that it’s important to understand the role of long-term immunity along with the antibodies generated by vaccinations. “We propose to upgrade the existing BSL-2 lab to BSL-3 and train virologists and lab staff to work on infectious viruses,” he said. “BSL-3 labs are designed to contain aerosol spread risk for personnel working in the lab and outside. Apart from Covid-19, such a lab will be handy for nipah, highly pathogenic influenza virus, etc.” Mavalankar said that understanding immunity will be key to fighting future pandemics. Two antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses will be measured by experts in patients who have recovered and in vaccinated persons. The samples will also give a glimpse into the impact on cytokines (IL-2, IFN-g and TNF-a) in patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vax-cover-effect-being-monitored/articleshow/88110841.cms||Parth Shastri

So far, around 91% of the beneficiaries in Kolhapur city have received the first dose and 64% of the eligible population above 18 years are fully vaccinated. However, the stock of vaccine with the KMC was on the verge of exhaustion on Sunday. The city and district is witnessing huge turnout of beneficiaries for the last five to six days, but on Sunday the turnout was less.. In Kolhapur city around 2,400 were vaccinated and in the entire district around 6,200 got the jab. Amol Mane, KMC’s vaccination nodal officer, said, “If the doses demanded from the Kolhapur zilla parishad does not arrive on Sunday, we will have to stop the vaccination process. We have very limited stock of Covishield vaccines in store, but the stock of Covaxin is quite adequate. Most of the people with first dose due are from the age group of 18 to 44 years. Most of the elderly population is fully vaccinated.” In Kolhapur district, 89% eligible population has been vaccinated for the first dose and 49% is fully vaccinated. The recent days have seen increase in turnout mainly due to fear of new Omicron variant, the cases of which are increasing in Maharashtra as well as neighbouring Karnataka state. Also, the turnout is propelled by the compulsion of both doses to avail services like transport and access to public offices. The administration has set a vaccination target of 30 lakh people above the age of 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-civic-body-may-face-vax-shortage/articleshow/88110271.cms||---

The RT-PCR test, costing Rs 600, gives a report within 5 hours, rapid tests take 5 minutes to 2 hours. “The appropriate term,” said a civic hospital doctor, “would be rapid tests instead of rapid RT-PCR tests.” One test offered at Mumbai airport is US healthcare major Abbott’s ID test that gives positive result in 6 minutes.Technically, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique (used in Abbott’s ID Now) are distinct, but both detect molecules — RNAs, DNAs and proteins. But PCR is still considered most accurate. Another test at the airport is cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) that takes 2 hours. Dr Nilesh Shah of Metropolis Lab said, “In a usual RT-PCR test, a laboratory is necessary. A technician has to collect the sample, manually extract the RNA and then place it in the PCR machine. The rapid tests have replaced the need for a laboratory as the whole process is replicated in a tiny box.” A rapid test contraption could be as small as a toaster. Dr A Velumani, who founded Thyrocare Lab, said the rapid Covid tests emerged in the past year. “Unfortunately, the rapid term has allowed companies to skirt the government’s price control measures,” said Velumani. Rapid tests costs between Rs 3,000 and Rs 5,000. Another doctor said a cartridge of CBNAAT test costs Rs 2,500. “One test requires one cartridge. So how much further can one reduce the test costs?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/time-to-get-report-determines-price-of-rt-pcr-rapid-tests/articleshow/88112037.cms||---

As many as 19 persons, including two women, were taken into custody along with different types of synthetic drugs, ganja and hashish oil in their possession. The officials have also arrested three of them, whom they identified as the organisers of the event. Akshay Mohan of Aryanad, Peter Shane of Kannanthura and Ashir of Chanthavila are those arrested. The substances seized from the venue include MDMA pills, MDMA powder, ganja and hashish oil. Liquor was also distributed at the event. The excise officials said that the rave party was held at Karaikkattu Backwaters and Resorts at Poovar. The name of the event was Nirvana Music Fest and Fashion Show. The party commenced from 6.30 am on Saturday onwards and went on till 1.30 am on Sunday. A fashion show was scheduled on Sunday evening. The excise squad reached the resort around 12 noon based on a reliable tip off received and conducted a raid. “Though the Saturday's DJ party was attended by more than 50 persons, there were only 19 present at the resort when we reached there as the others left the place after the party,” said excise inspector T R Mukesh Kumar, who was part of the raid. They suspect that the organisers chose the island resort as their venue for safety concerns as there was no road access to the resort, which meant no surprise raids. The only way to the resort is on boats through the backwaters. When the officials reached, most of the party goers were resting as they were apparently intoxicated from the use of drugs. Hence, they could not get a chance to dispose of the drugs and ganja. Akshay Mohan is the main organiser of the event. He is a DJ by profession. He is also alleged to have smuggled the narcotic substances distributed at the party from Bangalore. The tickets of the party were issued at three rates - Rs 1,000 for normal entry, Rs 2,000 for entry plus liquor and Rs 3,000 for entry plus liquor and drugs. Akshay Mohan had earlier been arrested by Cantonment police in 2017 for possession of LSD stamps, a type of synthetic drugs. All the persons taken into custody will be subjected for a drug test. If they are found to have consumed the substances, they will also be booked under relevant charges, Mukesh Kumar said. The team that made the catch was led by special enforcement squad circle inspector T Anikumar. Some of the other officers in the team are circle inspector G Krishnakumar and excise inspectors R G Rajesh and Madhusoodhanan Nair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/rave-party-at-poovar-island-resort-19-taken-into-custody/articleshow/88110842.cms||---

The employees of the state transport utility are on strike demanding merger of MSRTC with the state government that will help them in getting better salaries. The MSRTC, meanwhile, pressed into service Shivshahi buses to Aurangabad on Saturday. This is the first bus that has started for Aurangabad, though it is not the corporation-owned, an MSRTC official said it is bringing in much relief to the people who were waiting for travel to Aurangabad in the backdrop of the strike.

Tourists from Odisha and West Bengal prefer Vizag city and Agency areas such as Lammasingi, Araku Valley, Tajangi and others. They are not much interested in visiting Vizianagaram district. Expressing displeasure at the poor facilities in the tourist spots in Vizianagaram district, Sailesh Patro, a tourist from southern Odisha, said Vizianagaram district has beautiful waterfalls and picturesque Tatipudi reservoir. “But the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) has failed to create facilities for the visitors at these spots. If the authorities resume the boatingat Tatipudi reservoir and provide amenities at the waterfalls, tourists will throng those places,” he added. “Apart from the scenic spots, the district has a potential for pilgrimage tourism. However, the Ramatheertham, Pydithallamma temple, Govindapuram, Bobbili guest house, and Venkanna temple at Thotapalli should be developed by providing basic amenities,” felt K Siva Kumar, a resident of Vizag city. Speaking to TOI, district tourism officer, Chandrasekhar Varma, said they have identified three waterfalls - Sikaparuvu, Dandigam and Kurukutti under Salur mandal - to be promoted by creating amenities for the visitors. “We will send a proposal to the government for funds for this purpose,” he added. On resumption of boating at Tatipudi reservoir, Varma said boat drivers have to undergo training and officials from Kakinada port will visit the reservoir to examine the equipment and others facilities there before giving clearance to operate services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tourism-destinations-in-vizianagaram-lack-basic-infra/articleshow/88110273.cms||Nalla.Babu

Yunus had a miraculous escape while five of his aides received bullet injuries. One of them later died in hospital. Police said over 40 bullets had hit the convoy of three cars. The incident took place on a bridge near Bhaipura village of Nai Mandi when Yunus was returning from a wedding ceremony in Nai Mandi Chowki area of Bulandshahr. “Police were told that there were three cars in the convoy. When the vehicles slowed down while crossing the bridge, some unidentified men opened fire at the convoy, leaving five people injured. One of them, Mohd Khalid, 35, later died during treatment in hospital. The others are out of danger,” said IG Meerut Zone Preveen Kumar, who reached the crime spot later in the day. Bulandshahr senior superintendent of police (SSP) Santosh Singh said Haji Yunus has accused his nephew Anas, currently in jail, for the attack on him. “Five police teams have been formed to investigate the case, and we have got some leads,” said the SSP. Police said Yunus and Anas have criminal cases lodged against them, and there is a dispute between the two over some properties and an old murder that took place in the family. Yunus was the block head of Bulandshahr city between 2016 and 2020. At present, Yunus’s wife, Seema Parveen, holds the post. Yunus is the brother of two-time BSP MLA Haji Aleem, who was found dead in his house in 2018 in Bulandshahr. Later, Aleem's son Danish alleged that his uncle Yunus had orchestrated his father's murder. Earlier this year, Yunus had fought the assembly by-polls from Bulandshahr Sadar seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/40-bullets-fired-at-ex-bsp-leaders-convoy-1-dead/articleshow/88110275.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Varanasi||SP govt patronized criminals, gave‘Atankgarh’ tag to Azamgarh: CM||Varanasi: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath accused Samajwadi Party of patronizing criminals and blamed it for denting the image of Azamgarh badly so much that it came to be known as Atankgarh (haven of terror). The CM also made a sweeping attack on BSP Party and Congress alleging that when ministers in SP regime grabbed properties of Dalits in Rampur, these parties, which claim to be pro-Dalit, did nothing. Sharpening attack on SP chief Akhilesh Yadav while addressing a public meeting in Sagadi assembly segment of his parliamentary constituency Azamgarh on Monday, Yogi said, “Azamgarh was the worst sufferer of the SP’s tradition of patronizing criminals and generated an identity crisis for the people of the district who were denied accommodation in hotels and dharmshalas in the country due to the tag. “SP government’s patronage to criminals had given Azamgarh the tag of Atankgarh. After coming to power, our government worked to change its image,” said Yogi. The talented youths of Azamgarh helped in developing the cities where they migrated, but their home district remained undeveloped, he added. “We cracked down on mafia and criminals and their illegally earned properties are being bulldozed. So far properties worth Rs 1,900 crore of mafia has been seized. It is strange that the bulldozing of properties of mafia and criminals is hurting SP and Congress,” the CM said. Paying tributes to BR Ambedkar on his 64th death anniversary, Yogi said, “A minister in SP government was grabbing the land of Dalits in Rampur, and BSP and Congress remained mook spectators. These parties have exploited Dalits, poor, women, and youths for coming to power. Congress ruled the country for 55 years while SP and BSP supported Congress-led UPA government, but the poor had to wait for BJP government to get homes, free power, water, LPG connections and benefits of welfare schemes.” Cautioning people against Covid-19 and appealing them to get vaccinated as a new variant Omicron has been detected, Yogi taunted Akhilesh saying, “When Prime Minister Narendra Modi and I were making all efforts to ensure free test, treatment, ration and vaccination for people, the MP of this constituency had abandoned the people. When we tried to find the reason for his absence, it came to light that he went to England during first wave and Australia in second.” Today 17 crore people in UP have been given vaccinated, but when vaccination had started he (Akhilesh) opposed it and said it is vaccine of Modi and BJP. Now, when abbajaan has taken jab, he should also do so because a new variant has arrived, he added. “May be the vaccine also develops the habit of speaking truth in him and he will stop misleading people,” said Yogi. Yogi, who laid foundation and inaugurated 37 projects worth Rs 122.43 crore, said, “Mulayam Singh Yadav had also been Azamgarh MP but the expressway, airport, university were made in Saifai only. Azamgarh was left for criminals and mafia to rule.” Today Azamgarh is linked with Purvanchal-expressway, Gorakhpur Link-expressway, Prayagraj and Varanasi with four-lane highways while a state university is coming up, he said, adding, soon an airport will also become operational in Azamgarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/sp-govt-patronized-criminals-gaveatankgarh-tag-to-azamgarh-cm/articleshow/88130855.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Pune||Pune civic body restrained from operating animal incinerator||PUNE: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has restrained the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) from incinerating animals at the civic animal carcass plant in Keshavnagar, Mundhwa, till January 17 when it posted the next hearing of an application against the plant. “It is also open for Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to cause inspection of the plant as well as RDF plant and file additional report as to the alleged pollution being caused or already caused on account of operation of both plants,” the NGT bench of Justice M. Sathyanarayanan and expert member Dr Arun Kumar Verma said on November 25. Keshavnagar resident Mohan Nanasaheb Kudale has filed the application through lawyer Saurabh Kulkarni alleging, among other things, that the plant is being operated without a valid environment clearance under the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification of 2006 issued by the Ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC). The plea also raises concerns about the health hazards posed to the residents around the plant and the pollution and foul smell caused by it. On March 6 last year, the NGT had assigned a three-member expert panel comprising representatives of MoEF&CC’s regional office in Nagpur, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and the Pune district collector to jointly inspect the plant and file a report. The joint panel filed its report in October last year and the green tribunal had further asked the MPCB, MoEF&CC and the PMC to file reply affidavits in the matter. “Despite sufficient opportunity granted to the PMC, no reply affidavit has been filed so far that apart there is no representation on their behalf, the NGT bench said and went on to direct the PMC commissioner to appear before it through video conferencing at the next hearing to provide “necessary and effective” cooperation in the matter. The bench referred to the MPCB’s stand, and observed, “In the light of above facts and circumstances, especially the stand taken by MPCB, a prima facie case has been made out for grant of interim orders; otherwise, hardship and difficulties being caused to nearby residents would continue. The balance of convenience as on today, lies in faovur of the Original Applicant (Kudale).” In its reply affidavit on September 29, the MPCB cited an MoEF&CC letter of July 17, 2020 and submitted that there was no provision under any schedule of the EIA Notification, 2006 for obtaining Environment Clearance (EC) for the incinerator unit incinerating the dead animals. It further submitted that a `consent to operate’ the plant, valid up to June 30, 2018, was first granted and was later extended till January 31 this year and a PMC plea for further renewal is pending consideration. Lawyer Saurabh Kulkarni, appearing for Kudale, then submitted that the PMC must make its stand clear in the light of the MPCB’s reply affidavit and the tribunal may pass appropriate orders till then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-restrained-from-operating-animal-incinerator/articleshow/88110847.cms||Vishwas Kothari
---||Pune||Pune: Ambil Odha culvert work to check floods in final stages||PUNE: The work related to strengthening and reconstruction of culverts on Ambil Odha is in the final stages in Sahakaranagar area. The civic administration expects to complete the work by month-end and reopen the roads for vehicles. The roads stretches were closed to vehicular traffic over the past few months. Alternate routes are available for commuters. However, there is a demand from motorists to complete the pending work to avoid detours. The work of strengthening and reconstruction of culverts and bridges on Ambil Odha was taken up after the 2019 floods. Three culverts have been reconstructed so far in the Sahakaranagar area, while two more at Aranyeshwar and Mitramandal chowk will be ready by December-end. PMC officials said, “The work was delayed for some days due to technical reasons and the pandemic. However, now they have been pushed on the fast track. We will open a road at Aranyeshwar in the next 15 days. The slab work has almost been completed. Ongoing work at Mitramandal will be completed by the end of December.” Some portion of culverts and roads had washed away at some locations during the 2019 flooding. The PMC drafted a plan to reconstruct the culverts, which were not in good condition and unable to handle huge flow of water. During a survey, 21 culverts were identified for repairs and strengthening.  The work, including conversion of pipe culverts into box-type culverts and widening of existing structures, has been estimated at Rs40crore. The work has been taken up in a phased manner. Local residents said that besides strengthening of culverts and roads, the administration should also complete the pending work of construction of safety wall along the nullahs. Ashok Joshi, a local resident, said that the PMC should also set aside funds for regular maintenance of culverts and cleaning of nullahs. “Such work is only taken up ahead of monsoon, and done haphazardly,” he added. A private agency PriMove had identified 77 illegal constructions along the Ambil Odha that had caused the devasting flash floods on September 25, 2019. According to the city’s development plan of 1987, the width of the Ambil Odha was fixed at 18 metres and permission of construction was given accordingly. After the Pune-based firm submitted its report, the civic body issued notices to all the owners of these encroachments. The private agency had taken into account 20m as the width of the stream while conducting the survey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ambil-odha-culvert-work-to-check-floods-in-final-stages/articleshow/88110849.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Dues mount, vendors not ready to up Covid facilities||MUMBAI: “Stretched” for funds, the state has not been able to clear pending vendor bills worth crores of rupees for services rendered during the second wave. Several districts are now concerned about scaling up preparations for the anticipated third wave with the agencies asking for payment first. Sources said power bills, money for food given to patients, and salaries of additional manpower hired at temporary Covid centres are pending. In some districts, payments for installation of PSA plants for generation of medical oxygen and liquid medical oxygen plants used for storage have not been cleared. The bills run from several lakhs to multiple crores. State officials did not divulge the total sum they owed to vendors. Sources said even small districts like Satara have bills of over Rs 4 crore pending. “We are flooded with vendor calls. The money has not been cleared for food that was served to patients. Dues have not been cleared for medicines either,” said an official. He said if they have to scale up overnight due to a third wave, few would be willing to extend a helping hand again. The civil surgeon of one of the districts said that more than 300-400 healthcare workers, starting from doctors, nurses to ward boys, who were hired during the second wave have not been paid. “They haven’t got salaries for months of July and August,” he said, admitting that his district also had dues pending up to a “few crores”. A state government official told TOI that there are multiple budgetary heads from which district collectors can clear bills related to Covid-19. “We have allowed collectors to use funds from the state disaster response fund, district development fund, funds under the National Health Mission. But funds under all these heads are stretched,” the official said. He said the state has sanctioned Rs 550 crore from the state disaster response fund for Covid-related purchases or services. The fund, which now under Rs 700 crore left in it, will be exhausted towards the Rs 50,000 ex gratia to be paid to the families of Covid-19 victims. The state requires Rs 800 crore to fulfil the scheme. “Not all districts have used the funds judiciously. However, we cannot start auditing infrastructure set up, or personnel hired as everyone was told to prepare adequately,”said the official.  Dr Shyamsundar Nikam, civil surgeon of Amravati, said his district also had pending dues. “If a third wave is there, vendors cannot refuse us services,” he said. He said most districts are waiting for money from NHM as district planning and development committee funds can only be used for procurement and not payments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mumbai-dues-mount-vendors-not-ready-to-up-covid-facilities/articleshow/88120308.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Nashik||NMC U-turn: 60% temporary health staff to be retained||Nashik: The emergence of Omicron, the new Covid variant, has prompted the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) to take precautionary measures in the city. The civic body, which was earlier planning to release the temporary workers recruited during the second wave of the Covid pandemic in March and April, has now decided to give an extension to over 600 of the 1,025 temporary personnel. They had been given extension twice considering the projection of the third Covid wave in August and September. The extension period was to end on November 30. As the number of new Covid positive cases had been on the decline, Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav had directed the health department not to give provide extension to the temporary employees after November 30. However, the civic body made a U-turn after the new variant of Covid-19 was found in South Africa. NMC’s medical superintendent Bapusaheb Nagargoje said the extension has been given to about 600 temporary workers including 164 medical officers, 271 nurses, 81 lab technicians, 83 data entry operators etc. The civic officials said there has been a rise in vaccination and most people have already been infected. Moreover, the infectivity of the virus has become mild and the positivity rate has also reduced below 0.5%. This is why the number of daily Covid positive cases has reduced significantly. NMC officials said they are fully prepared for the third wave and have developed all the infrastructures to treat patients. There has been a continuous drop in active cases of the city. The number of active patients, which had increased from 500 in the first week of February to 28,000 by April 23, has again declined to 150 right now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-u-turn-60-temporary-health-staff-to-be-retained/articleshow/88109701.cms||Tushar Pawar

Sanjana held detailed discussions with C Suersh Kumar, general secretary, CISSA, and volunteered to extend her creative inputs and networks around the world for the revival of the industry, thereby ensuring respectable income for the traditional weavers. The ace designer is looking at styling the celebrities in the forthcoming Oscar’s probably in next March, which will be a golden opportunity for national to international pitch for Balaramapuram handlooms. “It is high time the Balaramapuram industry with all its ethnicity comes out from the shackles of conventional wisdom. Balaramapuram handlooms sarees and other fabric materials need radiant reshaping that will catch the attention of the international fashion world,” she said. To accomplish this, Sanjana will be visiting the weavers’ village in Balaramapuram in a month’s time with her innovations to be incorporated on handloom fabrics to make it a sought-after slice of art rather than a simple piece of cloth. Sanjana’s involvement in Balaramapuram handlooms will give a morale fillip to the hundreds of small time weavers, including women who weave this extraordinary piece of art for generations, mostly from their homes. CISSA had already chalked out a massive plan for the revival of the ailing industry to take it to international levels, ensuring better livelihoods and advanced intellectual inputs. In association with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), it had chalked out an ambitious plan for revival of the ailing handloom weaving industry through forming a producer company with around 500 backyard handloom weavers. The member artisans with a single handloom struggle to eke out a living from the two centuries odd profession. “Our association with Sanjana Jon is poised to take the weavers of Balaramapuram to newer heights,” said C Suresh Kumar, general secretary, CISSA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/fashion-designer-to-give-creative-inputs-to-weavers/articleshow/88110876.cms||---

Jayashri Jadhav was a BJP corporator of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC). But she had resigned after Chandrakant Jadhav filed nomination for the 2019 assembly election on Congress ticket.  Patil said, “We need someone who can fulfil the dreams of the late MLA. We see that courage in his wife and we want everyone to support her. Our state party president Nana Patole will soon arrive in Kolhapur to offer condolence to the Jadhav family and he will announce the name of the candidate.” Senior minister and NCP leader Hasan Mushrif said Jayashri Jadhav must be elected unopposed. In the 2019 election, BJP and Shiv Sena had contested the assembly election in alliance and Kolhapur North seat went to Sena in a seat-sharing arrangement. Jadhav defeated Sena's sitting MLA. However, now Sena is with Congress, NCP as Mahavikas Aghadi. “The recent legislative council election was held unopposed. BJP and Sena should show the same kindness. Congress has decided to offer the ticket to the wife of the deceased MLA. She should be elected unopposed for which BJP should refrain from contesting the bypoll.” Since BJP had almost no stakes in the assembly election for Kolhapur North assembly constituency, it is now up to Sena to take a call. Kolhapur North is Sena's bastion, which was demolished by Congress after a long time. Neither Sena nor BJP has cleared their stand on the bypoll issue yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/congress-plans-to-field-wife-of-deceased-mla/articleshow/88110304.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||‘Proposed EIA changes to suit industry, biz’||Pune: The city’s environmentalists, speaking at a public meeting organised by Sajag Nagrik Manch, said the changes proposed in the Draft Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2020 are going to make the notification weaker. Shripad Dharmadhikary of Manthan Adhyayan Kendra, said, “The changes aimed at ease of doing business and reducing public participation. This is going to make it tough for common people to raise their voices against environmental violations. The amendment should be introduced to file criminal offense against the violators.” “The EIA notification is more inclined to give environmental clearance rather than keep check on environmental degradation. The experts and organisations, working in or around the project-affected areas, should be allowed to participate in the public hearings. The public hearing committee should do site visits, if doubts are raised by the public,” said Rohit Prajapati of Paryavaran Suraksha Samiti (PSS). According to experts, projects that need environmental clearances have been reduced. This is done so that the projects that are going to impact the environment adversely can be carried out with proper assessment. Post-facto environmental clearance have been promoted in amendments. Even if projects are started without clearance, they can get away with it just by paying a fine. If clearances are given so easily, it will reduce the importance of EIA. The common citizens, public representatives and environmental experts should be allowed to be part of Environmental Impact Assessment Committee. The deadline to send suggestions and objections is December 15, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/proposed-eia-changes-to-suit-industry-biz/articleshow/88110875.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat collects Rs 294 crore in mask fines||AHMEDABAD: Even after witnessing two killer waves of Covid-19, the Gujaratis have been constantly defying the mask norm which is apparent from the figures of fines collected from the offenders who were caught on roads without masks. According to the figures of Gujarat police, the cops recovered Rs 294 crore for not wearing mask from 41.60 lakh offenders between June 24, 2020 and December 2, 2021. This means, on an average, mask offenders coughed up Rs 56 lakh every day in the Covid years. This amount is half of the money invested to build an advanced Covid hospital and about the same to build four flyovers in the city. If an oxygen plant has been set up with 2,000 litres per minute capacity which has a cost of Rs 13 crore, then at least 22 such plants can be made. According to the data, Gujarat police recovered Rs 247 crore from the 36.80 lakh offenders between June 24, 2020 and June 23, 2021. In last five months from June to November, the state police collected around Rs 47 crore in mask fines. “We will intensify the mask drive soon as the new variant of Covid-19 Omicron has been reported in the state,” said a police officer. A senior police officer told TOI, “We have fined 41.60 lakh people for not wearing masks in one-and-a-half-year. They paid Rs 294 crore in fines. This means, we have fined around 8,000 people every day.” “Rather than paying Rs 1,000 to cops for not wearing mask, the people should understand that the mask norm is for their safety only. So, they can buy at least 10 decent masks with this amount,” he added. Another police officer said that people did not cultivate the habit of wearing mask even after witnessing two killer waves in the state. Like helmets, people usually wear masks when they see cops and remove it or pull it under their chins later, said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-records-mask-fines-of-rs-294-cr-in-covid-years/articleshow/88110904.cms||Ashish Chauhan

Environmentalist and convenor, Sahyadri Sanchaya, Dinesh Holla, said that there has been a rise in the movement of elephants in the district in recent years, which is likely due to the changing topography. “Several areas of the Western Ghats have been affected by landslides in the past four years. Not only elephants, but there has also been a rise in movement of leopards, bison and wild boar in villages. The government must look at a solution to prevent landslides in the Western Ghats, as landslides pollute streams and waterbodies with excess sediment, and can wipe out large tracts of forests, destroy wildlife habitat, and remove productive soil from slopes. When a landslide occurs, the course of a river may change, which may make it challenging for animals to move, due to which they look for a new route. Also, in areas that witness landslides, we have noticed that the temperature within the forest has also increased,” he said. In the last few months, there has been a rise in the movement of elephants in Subrahmanya, Uppinangady and Belthangady in Dakshina Kannada district. “The government only focuses on compensation, but from Belagavi to Madikeri, we are noticing a rise in illegal activities near animal corridors. We are already witnessing climate change, and man-animal conflict is only going to get worse in the coming years, if action is not taken by the government to control landslides. Public support is essential for conservation,” Holla said. DCF Dakshina Kannada, Dinesh Kumar Y K, said that permanent loss of habitation and man-made barriers could be a reason for a rise in the movement of elephants in the district. “We can expect the movement of 60-70 residents and migrant elephants in a year. The migrants are well aware of the food and water sources. This year, the government has released approximately Rs 30 lakh compensation for crop damage so far,’’ he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/landslides-amplify-man-animal-conflict-in-dakshina-kannada/articleshow/88110299.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Lucknow||In run-up to UP polls, deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya positions himself as face of hardline Hindutva||LUCKNOW: Is UP’s deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, with deep roots in Vishwa Hindu Parishad, is back to his old self in the run-up to the high-stake UP elections? The question has gained currency with Maurya going on a verbal blitzkrieg using the lexicon of hardline Hindutva to target his rivals. Last week, the deputy CM hit back at the Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav by calling him “Akhilesh Ali Jinnah” over the latter’s recent controversial remarks comparing Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah with Mahatma Gandhi and Vallabhbhai Patel. Earlier, he stirred a row with a tweet claiming that while construction of grand temples were under way in Ayodhya and Varanasi, preparations were afoot for a temple in Mathura. Next, the UP deputy CM attributed the poor law and order situation in previous regimes to people who wore “lungi” and “topi” and added that Yogi government has given a befitting reply to ‘lungi’ and ‘topiwala’ goons. While Maurya couldn’t be reached despite several attempts and senior BJP leaders distanced themselves from his remarks, political analysts say such statements are an indication of the stance that BJP might adopt against its opponents in the fight for the UP’s crown in 2022. “Maurya’s recent statement unlikely to be the diatribe of a singular person,” says an observer. SP has not taken Maurya’s remarks quietly. Party MLC and Akhliesh’s aide, Udai Veer Singh, called Maurya an “irresponsible” leader who has no regard for the constitutional position he occupies. “All this is being done deliberately to divert people’s attention from key issues. Moreover, Maurya seeks to hog the limelight out of desperation and frustration after being sidelined in his party for the past many years,” Singh said. The MLC asked if BJP leaders are trying to “spread anarchy” for sheer political gains by such irresponsible statements. But UP BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said that Maurya’s statements should not be seen through communal lens. He claimed that the deputy CM made the “lungi” and “topi” statement in reference to the problems faced by some traders in Prayagraj during the SP regime. “Likewise, his tweet with reference to Mathura projected BJP’s commitment to make Hindu religious places `bhavya’ (grand) and an attractive religious tourist spot,” Tripathi added. Maurya’s Mathura tweet came a week after police clamped Section 144 in the religious town following a threat by a right wing group of installing a statue of lord Krishna in Shahi Eidgah on December 6.Tripathi said Akhilesh whipped up Jinnah’s name and, therefore, Maurya should not be blamed for calling SP chief as “Akhilesh Ali Jinnah”. Maurya was a key functionary of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad before he formally joined BJP in 2002. After two defeats, he won the Sirathu assembly seat in 2012 and then Lok Sabha election from Phulpur in 2014. Subsequently, Maurya was made UP BJP chief in 2016 even as the saffron outfit sought to project an OBC face in 2017 assembly elections that saw BJP storming to power in UP with an overwhelming majority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/with-run-up-to-big-battle-maurya-position-himself-as-face-of-hardline-hindutva/articleshow/88111462.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Lucknow||Security to traders ensured growth,rise in per capita income: Yogi||Lucknow: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said the security provided to traders ensured economic prosperity and increase in per capita income. Addressing a traders’ convention organised by the BJP in Lucknow, Yogi said it was because of the robust law and order situation that the state jumped from 6th to 2nd rank in terms of economy since 2017. “The next five years will be crucial as the state government seeks to make UP the biggest economy in the country,” he said. Mounting attack on the opposition parties, Yogi accused them of creating terror among the traders. “Due to the misrule of Congress, SP and BSP, traditional and local businesses faced closure over a period of time. The state government came up with One District, One Product (ODOP) scheme to boost local business,” he said. He recalled the murder of a local businessman, Shrawan Sahu, and his son, Ayush, in 2013 to hit out at the previous SP government and charged the party with allowing goons to damage properties of traders. “If any trader lodged a complaint, he would himself get implicated under false charges,” Yogi said, citing how the prime accused in Sahu murder case managed to construct a bungalow barely 500 metres away from the official residence of the DGP. Aqeel Ansari, the accused in the case, is currently lodged in Hardoi jail. “After coming to know that the bungalow was constructed illegally, I ordered razing of the property with the help of a bulldozer,” he said, claiming that the move irked the SP since it happened to be “sarparast” (supporter) of hardened criminals. Raking up the issue of alleged exodus of Hindu families in Kairana, Yogi said around 70% of the traders left the town out of fear during the previous SP regime. “All those traders have returned to Kairana after BJP came to power,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/security-to-traders-ensured-growthrise-in-per-capita-income-yogi/articleshow/88111467.cms||---

The cartoonist explained the reason for giving such a caption to the cartoon. P V Narasimha Rao, former Indian prime minister was known for his ability to remain silent. Despite his silence, he performed admirably in his duties. Rao’s stillness is symbolized by the deep well, while his ability to work is symbolized by the water at the bottom. E Suresh’s 80 such political cartoons are featured in the on-going solo exhibition at Vyloppilly Samskrithi Bhavan. The exhibition will continue till December 8. The exhibition namely “History Line -history through his lines” features the political history of India through cartoons from the period 1990 to 2021. Freelance cartoon artist E Suresh, a native of Maruthankuzhy, began his career by drawing social cartoons and later he moved to Delhi intending to become a political cartoonist. He received the Lalithakala Akademi state award in 2009 and honourable mention awards in 2008, 2015 and 2017. He has also proved his talent in the field of short film and documentary. “It is important for the citizens to know the history of Indian politics. I believe cartoons have the characteristic of conveying the messages and story easily. I have included only 80 cartoons from my account of political cartoons. I tried to focus on all the major events of Indian politics. I have arranged the cartoons in such a way that it tells the story from the period of P V Narasimha Rao to Narendra Modi,”said E Suresh. “The artist has given an expansive view of Indian political history.

The saplings were sown during the statewide afforestation drive, ‘Van Mahotsav’, from July 1 to 7, this year. Now most of the saplings have either been eaten up by cattle or have shriveled up. Villagers claimed that no efforts were made by the department to either water or take care of the saplings. Some were not even planted properly. No officials came to check despite complaints by the villagers. Local farmer Satyaveer Singh said, “The plantation campaign in the district largely remains a formality like previous years. Large scale malpractices will come out if the state government conducts a proper investigation." The 30-minute function held on July 4 was nothing more than a photo-op by the officials, the villagers said. On an average, a sum of Rs 6 is spent by the forest department to prepare saplings for the plantation drive. Thereby, the estimated cost of 15,000 saplings is Rs 90,000. When asked, district forest officer Diwakar Vashistha said, “The plantation drive at the village was carried out before I took charge. I will soon do a spot inspection at the village. All complaints will be investigated. Suitable action will be taken against those found guilty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/5k-saplings-persish-in-etah-village-in-5-months/articleshow/88110312.cms||Deepak Lavania

Addressing ‘Vyapari Mahakumbh’ organised by the state unit of Samajwadi Vyapar Sabha at Indira Gandhi Pratishthan in Lucknow, Akhilesh said, “Demonetisation and GST left a lasting impact on the overall economy and had hit the traders the hardest. The government’s approach towards trade and the trader community during the lockdown came as a final blow.” “Businesses which closed down because of these blows, have not been able to get back on track till date. The government has done nothing to help the trader community,” he said. The SP president said the BJP government has managed to create a divide between traders and farmers and was hitting the interests of both. “Farmers had to go on the warpath and so seems to be the case with the trader community,” he said, adding that the resentment among businessmen against the BJP and its policies was growing by the day. “Traders have no money left in their pockets. Only big corporate houses are being encouraged by the government. Today, online giant Amazon is selling ‘kande’ (cow dung cakes) and fuel prices are rising daily. Transport business has come to a standstill. Government policies are finishing off trade business in India. The medium and small traders are the worst hit,” he said. “If you asked the BJP about the income of businessmen, they would have no answer. If you ask them about unemployment, no one will be able to answer. Inflation has doubled today and is rising due to decisions like demonetisation and GST,” Akhilesh added. Apart from senior SP leader Rajendra Chaudhary and former minister Ravidas Mehrotra, president of Samajwadi Vyapar Sabha (UP) Sanjay Garg and Pawan Manocha were also present at the event. Sanjay Garg aired the grievances of the trader community before the SP chief who assured all possible help after the party forms the government in the 2022 assembly elections. Talking to media persons at the party office, Akhilesh accused the BJP of indulging in politics of hate. “Their language will get filthier by the time the elections are held,” he said in response to a media query on “lungi wearing people” comment by deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya which was apparently aimed at a particular community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/demonetisation-gst-hittraders-hardest-akhilesh/articleshow/88111470.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

In just 36 hours, researchers analysed samples from 100 infected patients, collated the data and alerted the world, setting off new rounds of travel restrictions and adding uncertainty about the trajectory of a pandemic. Omicron has reached over 40 countries, although most of the cases so far have been found in arriving travellers. According to scientists in South Africa, Omicron appears to spread faster than any other variant, thanks to a combination of contagiousness and an ability to dodge the body’s immune defences. Global concern has not waited for a fuller picture to take shape. The WHO acted with alacrity. Even before the WHO meeting was over, over 10 countries, including the US, had announced they would close borders to travellers from southern Africa. Japan, Israel and Morocco went a step furthering, sealing themselves off completely to foreigners. These curbs continue to grow. From Monday, the US has made it mandatory for all incoming passengers, including those from India, to test negative within a day before their flights or carry a proof of recovery. The variant has been reported in at least 16 states by Saturday, about one-third of the country. Amid growing fear, many vaccination clinics are reporting long lines and delays in booking appointments recently. Vaccine demand has more than doubled since the beginning of October, especially for boosters and first doses, according to CDC. Beginning Tuesday, travellers will be required to take a Covid test within 48 hours of travelling to Britain regardless of their vaccination status. The reintroduction of compulsory pre-departure testing has prompted an angry response from the travel industry. Justice secretary Dominic Raab said he knew the new measure was a “burden” but stressed the UK needed to act. Experts cautioned that travel restrictions and bans will not halt the new variant’s spread. A government science adviser, Mark Woolhouse, told BBC that the latest steps “may be a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted”. “I think it’s too late to make a material difference to the course of the Omicron wave.” In Australia, five people in Sydney have contracted the Omicron variant locally. The cases are linked to two schools and a climbing gym. On Friday, three students had were reported to have been infected due to community transmission. New South Wales state has confirmed 15 Omicron cases. The rise in cases came as Australia provisionally approved the Pfizer vaccine for kids between the ages of 5 and 11. Meanwhile, Senegal has recorded its first Omirant case, becoming the third West African nation to detect the variant after Nigeria and Ghana. Romania said two recent travellers to South Africa tested positive for the variant. Chile’s first case was a foreign resident who had travelled recently from Ghana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/omicron-plunges-the-world-into-collective-uncertainty/articleshow/88112286.cms||---

---||Kochi||Drug dose based on genetic profile reduces organ rejection risk: Study||Thiruvananthapuram: In a genetic study that could help in reducing the risk of organ rejection and other medical complications, scientists of the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) have formulated a method to predict the optimal dose of an immunosuppressant drug given to kidney transplant patients. The dose prediction study focused on tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant drug given to a kidney, heart or liver transplant patient to lower the body’s immunity, thereby reducing the chances of organ rejection. For maximum effectiveness, the drug level has to be maintained at an optimum concentration in the blood, especially during the initial period after transplantation. Dr Radhakrishnan Nair and Dr Lekshmy Srinivas of the laboratory medicine and molecular diagnostics, RGCB, conducted the pharmacogenetic study involving patients who have undergone kidney transplantation at the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram. They studied the effect of the genes and their variants involved in determining the drug concentrations in patients’ blood. “We developed an equation/technique that can be used by nephrologists to predict the starting dose of tacrolimusbased on their genetic profiles,” Dr Radhakrishnan Nair said. “This equation is specific to patients from the state who undergo kidney transplantation. The molecular-based method uses testing the DNA of patients for a specific variation, before transplantation surgery,” said Dr. Lekshmy Srinivas. This variation, along with their body weight, can be used to calculate the optimal starting drug dose for the patient. It will help the patients achieve optimal tacrolimus levels post-transplantation and thus prevent the adverse effects due to overdose and rejection. At present, the dose is calculated based on the patient’s body weight. To attain this, blood levels have to be closely monitored and drug doses adjusted, as lower levels can lead to rejection of the transplanted kidney, while higher levels can lead to undesired medical complications. Not only is this trial-and-error method of dose adjustment time-consuming and costly, but it also causes a lot of complications among the patients “Though there have been similar studies in other populations before, the predictive value of pharmacogenetic factors identified were insufficient and not much of clinical use. The new development would help prevent the adverse effects of overdose and thereby help a lot of patients,” said Prof Chandrabhas Narayana, director, RGCB. The study was conducted in collaboration with Dr Noble Gracious of the department of nephrology, Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram. The group also discovered the genetic variants which increases the chances of rejection and adverse effects associated with the drug. The research, which has the potential to save lives of kidney transplant patients significantly, was jointly funded by the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), and RGCB and was published in the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/drug-dose-based-on-genetic-profile-reduces-organ-rejection-risk-study/articleshow/88110349.cms||---

Don’t try to settle the score at Thiruvalla for the defeat in Periya, is what I have to tell Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. Thiruvalla is a peaceful place and Marxist party shouldn’t try to disrupt it,” he said, after meeting Pala bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt on Sunday. “There were no disputes between CPM and RSS in the area before the murder. How can RSS men there, one fine day, get a reason to kill a CPM leader? One of the accused in the case was an activist of Yuva Morcha but he was removed from the organization due to his illegal connections. Besides that, none others have any connection with BJP. Not only that, all of them are CPM workers. Everyone knows this,” he added. “The status of police in the state is sad. These people had even prevented the retirement benefits of the officer who brought out the truth in the Fazal case. Policemen are also humans. No officer will be able to oppose such threats in Kerala. That is why the policemen were forced to correct their initial finding,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cpm-forced-cops-to-add-political-motive-union-min/articleshow/88110907.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A senior police officer at DGP headquarters said, district police chiefs have been asked to nominate a deputy superintendent of police (DySP) rank officer, along with an investigation officer and supervisory officer to the SIT. A member of the special task force (STF), which is spearheading the probe, will also be appointed to the team by SSP, STF. The decision was taken to maintain the pace of investigations in districts, where maximum FIRs were lodged, to meet deadlines in case disposals. The cases will be closely monitored and ADG STF will personally deal with problems during the probe and send a report to DGP headquarters. This followed the approval of state DGP Mukul Goel. The 10 districts under the radar include Kokhraj police station in Kaushambi, Ghazipur in Lucknow commissionerate, Dhumanganj, Jhunsi, Georgetown and Naini police stations in Prayagraj district, Surajpur police station in Noida commissionerate, Kotwali Shamli and another in Baraut police station of Baghpat. On November 28, UPTET was cancelled after a question paper was leaked on social media, triggering arrests of 39 persons. At least 20 lakh students were scheduled to write the examination at 2,736 centres in two shifts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sits-to-be-constituted-in-10-dists-to-expedite-probe-into-tet-paper-leak/articleshow/88111486.cms||---

She has filed her petition in this regard before the chief minister on Saturday. The complainant said that she has demanded a crime branch probe as she does not believe in the commitment of the officers who are currently conducting the probe. After she raised her allegations a week ago, the district police had launched an inquiry. Thus, she was summoned to the office of Deputy Superintendent of Police of Kattakkada police subdivision for recording her statement. However, this procedure was merely a farce, she accused. ''Even while recording my statements, I noticed that the officers were not writing down my words verbatim. They were twisting my words thinking that I cannot read Malayalam,'' the complaint, who hails from Thrissur and migrated to Mumbai more than two decades ago, said. Her original complaint was that the Malayinkeezh police failed to take appropriate action against her partner who allegedly sexually abused her daughter in July this year. After registering the complaint, the police sent her and daughter back to the home of the accused. A scuffle ensued between the complainant and the accused on that night following which the police arrested her and jailed her for 47 days. Meanwhile, the alleged abuser, who is an Air Force official, was given bail two weeks after his arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/survivors-mother-seeks-crime-branch-probe/articleshow/88110906.cms||---

District health officer Dr Kapil Aher said the health department had received 78 employees from National Health Mission to enable data entry of Covid related updates through the respective PHCs. The appointment of employees assumes significance after 706 people on contract through National Health Mission for Covid duty were relieved by the Nashik ZP on August 1, due to lack of support from the central government. “Currently, we have deployed 78 people through NHM at respective centres and we have a good number of data entry operators that carry out the work related to Covid in time,” the officer said. The staff was relieved of the responsibilities after the second Covid wave started fading and the central government stopped the support for the workers in the form of their salaries. Aher said with the number of cases going down then, there was not much impact on Covid-related work, be it carrying out health survey or collection of swabs etc. However, the administration has also pointed out that it was ready to hire more personnel if and when the government funds allowed and also when the number of Covid cases would increase in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/zp-gets-78-employees-under-nhm-for-covid-19-duties/articleshow/88109722.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The UP special task force officials disclosed to TOI that printing of over 23lakh question papers were outsourced to four agencies, which had sole expertise in publishing seasonal wedding cards and calendars. These firms were located at Delhi, Noida and Kolkata and their owners were paid Rs 6lakh each to print and allow access to the solver’s syndicate. ‘Each firm had to publish 6 lakh papers, and was paid Rs 6 lakh’The nodal Delhi firm, RSM Finserv, was in fact a dummy agency floated by the syndicate with a swanky office at upscale Greater Kailash-II and an elaborate website to flaunt authenticity, said STF sources. “These nondescript printing companies were awarded contracts by RSM Finserv director Rai Anup Prasad and a scrutiny revealed these presses were adept at publishing only calendars, wedding and birthday cards that don’t carry security features. Competence in handling security codes is a prerequisite for bagging a contract to print competitive exam papers. It’s unbelievable how these agencies got the contracts,” said an STF official. The probe also revealed that an agreement of Rs13 crore was hammered out with RSM Finserv, but the entire amount was yet to be disbursed. As per the order, each printing press was contracted to publish 6lakh question papers and were paid Rs 6 lakh each, sources in STF said. A senior STF officer said, government officials who approved the work order and approved the budget are also under the scanner. On Sunday, STF teams again scrutinised phone numbers of the 39 accused, who circulated UPTET question papers via WhatsApp. Teams are also tracking down conduits of the RSM Finserv director Rai Anup Prasad and would be questioning owners of the four printing presses in Okhla, Noida and Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/printing-of-23l-tet-question-papers-outsourced-to-4-firms-that-published-wedding-cards-calendars/articleshow/88111495.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

Furthermore, the proliferation of weeds provided cover for open defecation, resulting in the area surrounding the PHC building becoming a cesspit and mosquito breeding ground. However, a forward-thinking IAS officer serving his probationary period as the chief officer of the Annigeri town panchayat (TP) decided to change this unpleasant state of affairs.The state of the PHC dismayed Madhav Gitte during a tour of the taluk, and the young bureaucrat decided to clean the entire campus. Gitte began work on cleaning up the grounds in order to ensure that the atmosphere of the PHC was condusive to visiting patients.Gitte then discussed the issue with town panchayat officials, and with the help of local labourers, work on cleaning the grounds began. After the weeds were removed and the haphazardly grown trees were felled, 65 tractors of red soil was used to level the ground. KRN Company, a private firm that is building roads in Dharwad district, donated funds for the exercise as part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative.“The PHC grounds had become a lavatory for many people, attracting pigs and other stray animals. Now that it has been cleaned, the people feel no hesitation in visiting the PHC,” Gitte told TOI.The IAS officer also met with officials from the health department, requesting that the PHC be well-equipped. The PHC now has all of the necessary facilities, and the atmosphere is such that the personnel can happily carry out their duties. Dharwad deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil was effusive in his praise for Gitte. The DC also called on the people to cooperate with the bureaucrats to help maintain government facilities, which had been set up for the welfare of the public.Annigeri resident Malleshappa, who had desisted from visiting the PHC earlier, given its sorry state, is now a happy man. “The PHC campus is clean now, and looks good. I will no longer hesitate to visit the PHC when I need to consult a doctor,” he added.Caption: The Primary Health Centre campus in Annigeri beforecovered with Parthenium and other poisonous weed and slush.2.

I had met Sitaram Kunte, the then chief secretary who is now advisor to the CM. I had told him that we should take the Sahitya Mahamandal’s help after the sammelan wraps up,” Pawar said. Pawar spoke at length on the Marathi language and recalled the efforts made for the language’s development during Yashwantrao Chavan’s time. He expressed regret that such measures had been put on the back burner, but added that all the efforts will now be revived. Pawar said steps should be taken to teach subjects like science and commerce in Marathi at graduation, postgraduation levels. He also appealed to the litterateurs and intellectuals to make use of technology. With the right technology, the language could be made not just attractive, but also easy to use, especially for the youngsters. On the demand to name the venue after Savarkar, Pawar said, “Swatantryaveer Savarkar was one of the greatest litterateurs and none of us has demeaned his stature. However, naming the venue after Kusumagraj was an effort to hour the Jnanpeeth awardee.” He added: “Savarkar was the supporter of science. He considered the cow a very useful animal. His contribution to the freedom struggle is unparalleled. There should be no opposition to Savarkar.” Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, who was the chief guest, pointed out that the litteratuers had failed to criticize ‘some’ people who claimed that freedom that India received in 1947 was a ‘bheek’. “Tomorrow somebody will speak about the Constitution, and if the society and the litterateurs remained silent, it will be a great loss to the nation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pawar-stresses-on-need-to-conserve-develop-marathi/articleshow/88109733.cms||Abhilash Botekar

In a press conference here on Sunday, Surendran said that there is a clear planning in Sandeep’s murder and there is a possibility of the murder reason being the factionalism in the party. CPM has a lot of inner-party issues in Thiruvalla and it has to be examined if these issues have anything to do with the murder, he said. The police should also investigate if the top CPM leaders had knowledge of Sandeep’s murder, he added. “CPM erected flex boards and posters widely in Thiruvalla when the murder occurred. Also, CPM’s acting state secretary A Vijayaraghavan alleged immediately after the murder that BJP activists murdered Sandeep. But, Sandeep’s close friend and DYFI leader Manu had posted on Facebook that the murder was committed by a gang of goondas, but the CPM leadership made him delete his post,” Surendran alleged. Surendran said that all the four arrested in the case have CPM connections, and without the CPM local leadership’s knowledge such a murder cannot be committed. He asked how Muhammed Faisal, one of the accused and a native of Kannur, would be part of the murder. His background should be probed as he has connections with quotation gangs hired by CPM. The CPM background of two other accused, Nandu and Vishnu, are widely known and they are regular attendees of CPM’s party classes, Surendran said. Throwing his weight behind the police, Surendran said that CPM is now trying to sabotage the probe which the police had investigated in the right direction. This is also the reason why the CPM cyber gangs are engaged in cyber attacks against SP (Pathanamthitta) R Nishanthini, he added. However, after CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan threatened, the police are now doing exactly as instructed by the party, Surendran said. The chief minister has not yet made any comments that the murder was committed by RSS activists, he added. Surendran said that the investigation has to be handed over to a special unit or any other agency for an impartial probe. Any attempt to put the responsibility of the murder on BJP or RSS will be strongly defended, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-leaders-have-role-in-sandeeps-murder-bjp-chief/articleshow/88110941.cms||---

The revamped ‘Thuna’ portal and the integrated mobile application Pol-App would offer multiple services, including lodging FIR through the digital platform without even visiting the concerned police station. The portal and the mobile app will enable the public to avail services like lodging complaints, availing digital copy of the FIR and accident general diary, police clearance certificate, loudspeaker permissions, etc. Also, citizens are provided with an easy user interface and multiple advanced payment modes like the UPI, net-banking, payments using debit card and credit card. Provision has also been created for the citizens to air their opinion on the quality of service provided by the police for each service. All certificates issued through the new system will be imprinted with a QR code, which will eliminate the chances of using forged police certificates. Anyone can verify the authenticity of these certificates using a QR code scanner application available on the internet. Thuna portal was revamped and introduced to replace the existing citizen portal, which was running on the architecture envisaged during 2009 by the national crime records bureau (NCRB), which has now become outdated. Due to the difficulties in operations and non-availability of online payment modes, the number of citizens using the earlier portal was very few. In the new portal, the police clearance certificate (PCC) can be issued from the concerned police station or from the district police chief’s (DPC) office based on the gravity of requirement, whereas earlier this was issued by the DPC only. Facilities for senior officers to forward the complaint to any police station and reporting facility have been included in the new application.

---||Kochi||Muraleedharan flays CM’s halal remarks||Kochi: Union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan met Pala bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt on Sunday. Speaking to the media after their meeting, the BJP leader criticized chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan for his remarks on the halal controversy. Muraleedharan said that the many statements that the chief minister made were unsuitable considering the position he holds. “What he said about halal was that it only meant that the food was edible. So, what is he intending to say that the rest, everything, is not edible?” he asked. He added that the meeting with the bishop was just a friendly visit. Muraleedharan said when the bishop spoke about narcotic jihad, everyone cornered and attacked him. “When he made the remark, I had called him and had shared my opinion with him on the issue. I had also offered my support. CPM and Congress had then taken a stand that the priest of a minority community does not even have the right to share the problems that his community faces before the members of that community. The consequences of such an approach are getting clearer now due to the incidents that are happening in Kerala,” he said, adding that CPM thinks that some communities have special powers. He said that the chief minister’s comment on K-Rail that it will be a green project was absurd. “Anyone who knows the meaning of a green project would not say that K-Rail is a green project. It is like saying that a thief is very honest. If only he had known what a green project is, Pinarayi Vijayan wouldn’t have made that comment despite holding such a high position,” he said, adding that he can only urge the chief minister that he shouldn’t just blurt everything that his advisers tell him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/muraleedharan-flays-cms-halal-remarks/articleshow/88110951.cms||---

Zirakpur MC chief Udaivir Singh Dhillon said earlier SAD councillors had failed to deliver, but now Congress has started repairing and re-carpeting the roads. Dhillon inaugurated the renovation work at a cost of about Rs 1 crore in the presence of all Congress councillors. The road, which connects about two dozen societies and colonies in the area to Zirakpur city, had been in poor health for the last several years. Dhillon said, “The SAD regime ruined the living quotient of Zirakpur and did nothing except for indulging in corruption. But now, the Congress will deliver and boost the road network in Zirakpur.” He said this road would be diverted from Harmilap Nagar gate with special approval from the government, keeping in view the shortcuts used by residents of Baltana area to reach Chandigarh and Panchkula. The council chief also appealed to the locals and shopkeepers to cooperate with the contractor during the renovation work of the road and not to park vehicles on the stretch to avoid traffic jams. Udaivir said under the leadership of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, efforts were being made to provide quality facilities in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/zirakpur-road-to-get-healing-touch-after-13-yrs/articleshow/88111823.cms||---
---||World||West condemns reprisal killings in Afghanistan, Taliban rejects allegations||BERLIN: The United States and a group of Western countries including Germany, France and Britain have expressed concern over reported killings and disappearances of former members of the Afghan security forces after the Taliban took power in Afghanistan in August. In a joint statement issued over the weekend, the 21 countries plus the European Union referred to reports of such abuses documented by Human Rights Watch and others. “We underline that the alleged actions constitute serious human rights abuses and contradict the Taliban’s announced amnesty,” said the statement, issued by the German Foreign Ministry. “Reported cases must be investigated promptly and in a transparent manner, those responsible must be held accountable, and these steps must be clearly publicized as an immediate deterrent to further killings and disappearances,” it said. Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Sayed Khosti rejected the accusation of reprisal killings, saying no evidence had been presented. “If there is any evidence, it should be shared with us,” he said in a video statement, pointing to the general amnesty announced by the Taliban government. “We have had some individual cases of killings of ex-government members but these were due to private enmity and we’ve arrested those involved.” “This is slander against the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, not justice.” Human Rights Watch said in a report on November 30 that Taliban forces in Afghanistan have executed or forcibly disappeared more than 100 former police and intelligence officers since taking over the country on August 15, despite the proclaimed amnesty. The Taliban interior ministry has rejected the Human Rights Watch report but said it would arrest anyone who could be shown to have carried out violent reprisals against members of the former military. Facing a deep economic crisis following the abrupt withdrawal of foreign aid when Western countries pulled out of Afghanistan, the Taliban have been appealing for international support to stave off a humanitarian disaster, with more than half the population facing hunger over the winter. The joint statement said, “We will continue to measure the Taliban by their actions”. The statement was issued by Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, the European Union, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and the United States.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/west-condemns-reprisal-killings-in-afghanistan-taliban-rejects-allegations/articleshow/88112306.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Booster dose’ of learning for health department staff||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat recorded the peak of active cases at 1,48,124 on May 5. Soon after, the rapid decline brought the active cases to 20,087 on June 5 and 2,333 on July 5, recording 63 times drop in 60 days. With the active cases below 500 since mid-July, the preparations for the third wave including hospital expansion plans and oxygen installation also reportedly slowed down. However, the first case of Omicron on Saturday worked as a wake-up call with a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bhupendra Patel the same day to chalk out future strategy. One of the major points was to revitalize the health system that has gone back to pre-Covid normal. A senior official present at the meet said that the impetus would be to provide a course recap to the government health machinery. “The modules were taught online on how to handle Covid cases and coordinate with senior health officials. A course will soon be conducted in person at major hospitals across the state to train the 50,000-plus staff again,” said the official. The government figures indicate 342 pressure swing absorption (PSA) plants installed at various government-run health facilities in addition to installation of 1,043 MT liquid oxygen tanks. “Audit of all these facilities has begun as assessment of bed preparedness for both public and private hospitals start. While there are no projections of a major spike, the authorities have been asked to remain prepared,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/booster-dose-of-learning-for-city-district-health-staff/articleshow/88110960.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Delhi||Navjot Singh Sidhu joins protest of guest teachers in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Forty-year-old Ashok Kumar Bansiwal has been working as a guest teacher in Delhi government schools teaching natural science since 2010. This was when the process of hiring guest teachers started. On Sunday, Bansiwal and several others walked towards the residence of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal reviving their demand for regularisation for the fifth time since 2014, when Aam Aadmi Party came to governance. As hundreds of teachers sat on the road opposite Metcalfe House in Civil Lines, Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu also joined in. Shouting slogans like “Equal Pay for Equal Work”, he asked Kejriwal to “practice what he preaches”. The guest teachers in Delhi revived their protest after the CM promised regularisation of contract teachers in poll-bound Punjab. In 2017, the AAP government had introduced a Bill for regularisation of 22,000 guest teachers, which was passed in the Delhi assembly. However, the then LG Najeeb Jung didn’t approve it. In 2019, after a long protest by the teachers, Delhi government brought in a policy like Haryana where guest teachers could work till retirement, but the LG yet again didn’t give his assent. Sidhu tweeted that Delhi’s teachers were treated like bonded labourers and daily wagers and weren’t given payment for holidays or weekends. He further claimed that Delhi’s education model was a contract model. “Delhi government has 1,031 schools, but only 196 have principals, 45% teachers’ posts are vacant. AAP promised to regularise contractual teachers and give equal wages as permanent staff, but made it worse by just having guest teachers,” he stated. The teachers claimed their salary had not increased in the past four years and now they were not eligible to sit for recruitment exams. Bansiwal, who teaches in a school in A-Block, Jahangirpuri, said, “I have become overaged. Also, we really don’t get time to study. If the government was not going to regularise us, then it shouldn’t have made a promise.” Sunday’s protest led by All India Guest Teachers’ Association demanded that either the Bill be passed or they be given equal pay like permanent teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sidhu-joins-protest-of-guest-teachers-in-delhi/articleshow/88110952.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Delhi||After first Omicron case in Delhi, calls for caution||NEW DELHI: A 33-year-old man who returned from Tanzania recently has become the first person to be confirmed positive for the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in Delhi. He is currently isolated and under treatment at Lok Nayak Hospital. Sources said the 33-year-old man was fully-vaccinated. Genome sequencing results declared on Sunday confirmed that the infection was caused by the Omicron variant, which is reported to be highly transmissible. Fortunately, sources at the hospital said, his symptoms are mild. “The patient was referred to Lok Nayak upon arrival at the airport on Thursday. At that time, he had a fever, sore throat and fatigue. The fever has subsided now,” said a source. She added that they will repeat the Covid test after a few days and once the patient tests negative, he will be allowed to go home. Meanwhile, sources said, attempts are being made to identify each and every person who may have come in contact with the patient in flight or while he was being transported to the hospital in ambulance to prevent the disease’s spread.  Till date, Delhi has received 17 passengers travelling from at-risk nations who were found to be symptomatic or confirmed positive for Covid-19 upon arrival at the airport. All of them are under isolation at Lok Nayak. Six contacts of these passengers are also under isolation. “Most of the isolated passengers and their contacts are asymptomatic. There is no reason for panic,” Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, said. The Omicron variant was first detected in South Africa last month. It is feared that the variant – which is highly mutated -- may overtake the Delta variant as the predominant variant of SARS-CoV-2 in the coming days. The number of cases of Covid-19 caused by the new variant is already on the rise with over a dozen cases reported in the country over the past one week. Maharashtra has reported a maximum of nine cases, followed by Rajasthan (6), Karnataka (2) and one case each has been reported from Delhi and Gujarat. Dr N K Mehra, an honorary emeritus scientist of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), toldTOI recently that all available information suggest that the new variant is more transmissible and, therefore, it has the potential to replace Delta as the predominant variant, indeed. “In South Africa also, Alpha variant was predominant initially. It was overtaken by Delta. And now, 70% of all Covid-19 cases are being caused by the Omicron variant,” he added. Dr Mehra, however, clarified that the new variant was unlikely to cause severe disease in fully vaccinated persons. “Some reports suggest that the new variant may have immune-escape properties. Even if this was true, I don’t think that the immunity accorded due to vaccination or previous infection will not have any effect at all. It will, in my view, reduce the risk of severe disease and need for hospitalisation,” Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, a public health expert said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-first-omicron-case-calls-for-caution/articleshow/88110961.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

---||Delhi||SDMC zeroes in on 2 more stack parking sites||New Delhi: After speeding up allotment work for constructing four stack parking projects at Greater Kailash-I & II, Amar Colony and Punjabi Bagh crematorium, South Delhi Municipal Corporation has identified two more sites near residential areas on public demand. One of them is at B1 Block Janakpuri inside the market that is now used for surface parking and the other one at Punjabi Bagh Club Road in a district centre that belongs to Delhi Development Authority (DDA). While the sites have been identified for multilevel parking, the corporation needs DDA’s approval for the Punjabi Bagh facility. “The proposals are under preparation and we plan to begin construction in the next financial year,” said Col (retd) B K Oberoi, SDMC’s standing committee chairman. Another site was also identified in Vikaspuri and a proposal was prepared, but only 40% of the space was suggested to be used for parking, he said. “I objected to this as DDA’s master plan allows utilisation of 64.1% of the total space for construction,” he added. The multilevel parking at GK-I will accommodate 399 vehicles and another at Nizamuddin 86 vehicles. “Tender will be allocated for the GK I market parking as soon as the project gets approval in the House. For the Nizamuddin parking, the work for shifting the underground wires passing through the identified site is put on hold due to the construction ban. We expect to complete the project once the ban is lifted,” said an official. Further, the tendering process will soon start for construction of the GK-II facility accommodating 238 vehicles, the Amar Colony (Lajpat Nagar) parking with space for 81 vehicles and the Punjabi Bagh one that can keep 225 vehicles, the SDMC commissioner said in its recent budget. “The facility near the Punjabi Bagh cremation ground is primarily meant to serve people visiting Bharat Darshan Park, located next to the crematorium,” said Oberoi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-zeroes-in-on-2-more-stack-parking-sites/articleshow/88110982.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Delhi||Delhi: No need to panic, but wear masks and get fully vaccinated, urges Satyendar Jain||NEW DELHI: While confirming the capital’s first case of the Covid-19 Omicron variant, health minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday said there was no need to panic, but people should follow safety protocols stringently and get vaccinated as soon as possible. “Omicron is not a new disease, but a variant of Covid-19. Its symptoms are similar to almost all the past variants. With the number of cases decreasing, people were not following Covid-appropriate behaviour, but now you need to be more careful. People who have not yet taken the vaccine should get vaccinated as soon as possible. Those waiting to get the second dose should get it on the due date itself and not wait even a day longer,” said Jain. The minister further stated that Delhi received the maximum number of flights from abroad, so it was most at risk. “The central government should accept chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s suggestion and ban flights coming from all countries affected by the Omicron variant at the earliest. It is very unfortunate that the Centre didn’t stop the flights coming from the affected countries despite the CM writing a letter appealing for a ban. Five new cases have been reported in the country so far,” Jain said. However, Jain added that Delhi government had completed its preparations even before the arrival of the new variant. “Delhi government has established 40 isolation wards in Lok Nayak Hospital, with an additional 500 beds ready to go, if needed. The protocol for the treatment and prevention of the Omicron variant is the same as for the other strains, so there is no need to panic, we just need to be careful,” said the minister. Till 7.30pm on Sunday, Delhi had seen a total of 2,32,78,495 vaccine doses being administered, including 1,40,87,057 first doses and 91,91,438 second ones. With the number of people eligible for vaccination being around 1.5 crore, 61.3% of adults in Delhi had been fully vaccinated and nearly 94% had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Though experts believe that vaccination is the best bet against the Omicron variant, more than 9 lakh adults are yet to receive a single dose of the vaccine. Despite large-scale measures being taken by the district authorities to reach out to the unvaccinated population through door-to-door surveys and mobile vaccination teams, the pace of inoculation remains slow. The significantly high number of unvaccinated people was a cause for concern even before the Omicron variant was detected, despite measures being in place for complete coverage through a “targeted approach”. The government is also carrying out an extensive information, education and communication campaign, including creating awareness about the necessity of getting the second dose of the vaccine in time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-need-to-panic-but-wear-masks-and-get-fully-vaccinated-urges-jain/articleshow/88111010.cms||Sidharatha Roy

While the commission members and one of their advocates remotely participated in the hearing through video conference, other advocates and deponents physically attended the hearing from the commission’s office at the high court premises. The first deponent before the panel was principal secretary, home, Ravi Gupta, while the last witness was head constable D Srikanth, who was a handler of one of the accused at the encounter site. Family members of the four alleged encounter victims also deposed before the commission. While the family members of J Shiva, J Naveen and C Chennakeshavulu claimed that the three were juveniles at the time of their arrest and cited the relevant entries pertaining to their dates of birth in the school admission registers as proof, state counsels and the advocate of the police personnel argued that the said entries in school admission records can’t be trusted as whitener was used several times over various entries. Citing the Aadhaar cards of the trio, the state counsel also argued that they were majors at the time of arrest. The commission has examined tahsildar J Pandu, who sent the accused in judicial custody after their arrest, and magistrate P Shyam Prasad, who gave police custody of the accused, over procedure followed by them. The commission elaborately examined the two injured cops, sub-inspector (SI) Venkateshwarulu, constable Aravindh Goud and the doctors, who treated them, about the nature of injuries and the treatment given to them to ascertain how the two cops suffered injuries and whether their injuries require ICU admission. IO V Surender was questioned about not issuing notices to the accused families in the villages at the time of apprehending them and the reason to start from the safe house at 3.30am with the accused. All the police party members were asked how four accused in the grip of four handlers and under the supervision of six armed cops, managed to snatch two pistols from the cops. They were also asked why all entry wounds on the deceased were on their front portion of the body, above the waist. Police maintained the accused hurled mud in their eyes and snatched the pistols while attacking with stones, sticks and in resultant retaliatory firing in self defence, the accused were killed. Among other things, the IO was asked why not a single bullet was recovered from the site and why the recovery of Disha’s articles were not videographed. The IO said that despite searching with metal detectors, bullets could not be traced and though he gave instructions to record the proceedings, the process was not recorded but he could prove the recovery through witness statements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/57-witnesses-examined-in-3-mths/articleshow/88111464.cms||---

The commercial was said to be defamatory towards the RTC’s bus services. The court also directed Google’s online video sharing platform YouTube to block access to the versions of the video. Rapido had been airing an advertisement which suggested that it was uncomfortable and dangerous to travel in TSRTC buses by showing a bus belonging to the corporation which was hired by Rapido. The company was then issued a notice by TSRTC following which it started showing a slightly modified version of the commercial but still continued to show the bus. Since Rapido refused to stop airing the commercial, TSRTC approached the court for relief. Appearing for the RTC, senior counsel K Vivek Reddy argued that while Rapido was entitled to promote its services, it cannot do so by making defamatory statements against TSRTC and public transport. Reacting to the court’s order, TSRTC MD called on people to strengthen TSRTC. “It is our social asset and everyone help maintain its smooth functioning and not defame it in any manner whatsoever,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/court-bars-bike-taxi-company-from-airing-ad-defaming-rtc/articleshow/88111437.cms||---

The members, who visited the encounter site for the first time, spent over an hour in the agricultural field and they specifically observed the spot at the fifth bund where veterinarian Disha’s articles were claimed to have been recovered from. The members, however, had to face a protest against the commission outside the Shadnagar police station. On Sunday morning, commission chairman V S Sirpurkar along with the other two members — Rekha S Baldota and DR Karthikeyan — started from a star hotel on Road Number 1, Banjara Hills, around 8.30 am and went to the safe house at Mirjaguda near Shankarpally where the four rape and murder case accused — Md Arif, J Shiva, J Naveen and C Chennakeshavulu — were interrogated during the police custody on December 5 and December 6, 2019. Escorted by a CRPF team, the commission members along with secretary S Sasidhar Reddy, advocates Virupaksha Gouda and K Parameshwaran then went to Chattanpally in the same route in which police took the accused from the safe house to the encounter site. At the encounter site, SIT’s investigating officer J Surender Reddy pointed out the fifth bund below which the police party took cover to protect themselves from the alleged firing from two of the accused, the spot from where Disha’s articles were recovered and the spots where the bodies of the four accused were found lying after the alleged exchange of fire. Assisted by CRPF personnel, the panel members even walked through the paddy field to closely observe various positions and aspects related to the encounter, mentioned by the witnesses in their evidence. The commission members also observed the waterlogged underpass where Disha’s charred body was found from a distance. From Chattanpally, the commission went to Shadnagar police station, where the accused were interrogated for the first time after their arrest. While travelling to the plot near Thondupally toll plaza where Disha was raped by the accused, enroute, the commission members also looked at the Shadnagar community health centre where the two injured cops were treated initially and the tahsildar’s office. At the rape and murder spot, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Shamshabad, N Prakash Reddy explained to the commission members about how the crime was committed and the place from where related evidence was recovered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sc-panel-visits-encounter-site-met-with-protests-at-police-stn/articleshow/88111455.cms||Mahesh Buddi

The commission, in its report submitted to the government last month had recommended to repeal as many as 218 acts prevailing in the state, many of those that were enacted even before the formation of the state. The law reforms commission had submitted the draft Kerala saving and repealing bill, 2021, for repealing these laws. The law department then found that of the 218 acts that have been recommended for repealing, as many as 96 acts have already been recommended for being repealed by a committee headed by eminent jurist V R Krishna Iyer in 2009 itself. The law department then informed the cabinet that the procedures for repealing the 96 acts as recommended by the committee headed by Krishna Iyer have already been initiated, and the procedures for repealing the remaining 122 acts can be initiated. The cabinet on November 24, cleared the proposal for repealing the remaining acts that have been recommended by the committee by excluding those that have already been recommended by the Krishna Iyer committee on which the law department is still working. On the basis of the cabinet decision, the law department has begun the procedures for placing the bill in the assembly. All these 122 acts that are being repealed are amendment acts to various existing acts in the state. However, the acts that have already been recommended by the Krishna Iyer committee includes several of those which could evoke interest in history enthusiasts, including two acts passed in the erstwhile Travancore, eight in the erstwhile Cochin, one that is applicable to Travancore and Cochin, 16 acts that are applicable to former Malabar district that came under the Madras state and 10 acts that were passed after the formation of the state. It also contains as many as 59 amendment acts that were passed till 2007 in the state. The acts of pre-state formation era includes Madras Devadasis (Prevention of Dedication) Act, which is a law enacted on October 9, 1947, immediately after the country became independent from British rule that made it illegal to dedicate girls to the temples, the Paliam Proclamation enacted by the Cochin government in 1935, that declared all the estates under the Paliam family (the family of the chief ministers of Maharajas of Cochin) to be under the kingdom, Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act enacted in Cochin to stop cruelty towards animals and the Supply of Paddy and Rice to Travancore Palace (extinguishment of rights and liabilities), Act, 1976, that abolished the obligation on the part of the government to honour the order of 1949, without paying any compensation to the palace. The order of 1949 said that as much as 4,000 paras of paddy, 110 paras of njavara rice, and one-and-a-half paras of oora rice be supplied to Travancore palace annually for the use of the former Maharaja and the palace, in lieu of surrendering the kandukrishi lands to the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/steps-on-to-repeal-122-acts/articleshow/88111831.cms||KP Saikiran

Instead, we’re working to advance an international system that is free and stable and open.” He offered the broad outlines of his strategy for dealing with China, something he called “integrated deterrence,” which relies on both strengthening work with allies and partners in the region and pushing the US technology industry to keep ahead of Chinese innovations. The Biden administration has been trying to use concerns over both Russia’s and China’s intentions to bolster support among allies. In his remarks, Austin stressed that the US did not intend to build a new Nato for Asia. Rather, Washington is trying to better coordinate countries to block efforts by China to dominate the region, he said, pointing to the recent deal to help Australia deploy nuclear-powered submarine as an example of strengthening alliances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/to-counter-chinaus-defence-secretary-vows-to-shore-up-alliances-in-region/articleshow/88112322.cms||---

The apartment was found during raids conducted as part of investigating locations where Syju Thankachan, the accused in the Vyttila accident case that claimed three lives, attended parties. Police took a resident of the apartment into custody and seized several sets of poker chips from the flat. “A hotel room in Thrikkakara, an apartment in Chilavannoor, a flat in Panangad and a homestay at Maradu were raided as part of the investigation. The gambling den was found during a raid at the flat in Chilavannoor. It had modern facilities. Those who used to gamble here were using poker chips in place of money to avoid the risk of getting caught by the police,” said Kochi police said in a statement. Police arrested Tipson Francis (33) of North Paravoor, who used to allegedly run the facility. Police seized five grams of ganja from him. Ernakulam south police seized the poker chips and playing cards used at the facility. Police said in the statement that players at the facility used to pay the money upfront and played using the chips. Kochi police said the accused would be questioned further to know more about the facility and the participants. Police had registered nine cases against Thankachan. He was arrested for tailing the Ford Figo car – that met with an accident in Vyttila, in which three persons (including two models) were killed – in his Audi on Nov 1. Police had invoked provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act to register cases against him in various police stations based on the visuals and chat history collected from his phone. Thankachan was arrested for stalking the women and forcing the driver of the car to increase speed, which in turn led to the accident. Police had found videos and images of parties attended by the accused in which drugs were allegedly used. Sources said that the sleuths were in the process of identifying and tracking down the persons who were seen attending the parties with Thankachan. They would also be booked after confirming their role in the offences, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/raids-lead-to-gambling-den-poker-chips/articleshow/88111016.cms||---

Addressing the media in Kozhikode on Sunday, he said that a working calendar will be prepared for carrying out road repair and construction works in the state in a timely manner. “Each assistant executive engineer in PWD has (avg) 500km of roads under him/her. They should not write reports on the status of roads by sitting in office. Engineers will have to personally visit road projects on the stretch and file monthly reports about the status. The reports should have photographs of them visiting the stretches,” Riyas said. He added that assistant engineers, who have around 150km of roads under their jurisdiction, will also have to submit monthly field reports about the status of the roads. Riyas said that all the roads in state should be maintained in good condition irrespective of which department it belongs to. “Of the around 1.5 lakh km of roads in state, around 1 lakh km does not come under the jurisdiction of PWD. But, as far as the general public is concerned, they don’t need to know which department carries out road works. The only thing that matters is that the roads should be in good condition,” he added. Riyas said that efforts are on to modernize the rest houses under PWD and bring them under an online booking system. He added that during the last one month the government has been able to get Rs 27.5 lakh as rent through online booking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/file-monthly-field-report-with-pics-riyas-to-engineers/articleshow/88111028.cms||---

Superintendent of police Vinayak Deshmukh said the action is the result of specific input about some farmers conniving with marijuana peddlers and growing large quantities of weeds in their farms. “The possibility of the peddlers convincing the farmers to make easy money with weed plantation cannot be ruled out,” said Deshmukh. Assistant inspector Ratnadeep Jogdand said three farmers have been detained and only after the raid is completed, the suspects will officially be arrested. The officer said police teams from Bhokardan and Hasnabad police stations are jointly carrying out the operation under sub-divisional police officer Indalsingh Bahure. Till Saturday late night, the police had seized about 165 kg of marijuana and weed plants, while the process of uprooting more weed plants from the cotton fields was underway. An officer said they were facing limitations in scanning the entire field as it was dark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/marijuana-seized-from-3-cotton-fields/articleshow/88109833.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Addressing an ‘explanation’ meeting organized by the CPM at Mandhamkunnu near Thaliparamba against the backdrop of former CPM Thaliparamba North area committee member Komath Muraleedharan joining the CPI, Jayarajan said that he was sad at the misfortune that has come to that party. “If one takes action against anyone for financial irregularities, then they immediately become CPI. Also, if party (CPM) takes action against anyone for immoral conduct, they immediately they become CPI,” he said. CPM leader E P Jayarajan, who inaugurated the meeting, said that there could be people who are staying away from the party but they should not try to weaken the party. “There are many people who are coming back to the party after correcting their mistakes. Those who don’t come back would get weakened,” he said. Muraleedharan, who was expelled by the CPM recently, had joined the CPI. He had claimed that as many as 57 people, including 18 CPM members, were joining the CPI along with him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/jayarajan-takes-swipe-at-cpi/articleshow/88111042.cms||---

The emphasis is on staying close to nature, while getting away from the hustle and bustle of city life. In the India International Travel Mart’ (IITM) Tourism Fair, which was inaugurated at Hitex on Friday, tourism departments of several states including Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Telangana, Goa, set up stalls to promote tourism in their respective states. “There is no doubt that pandemic has been harsh on everyone, but at the same time, it has also been a boon for the domestic travel industry. With restrictions on international travel, people started exploring their cities, states, and nearby places,” said Harsh Mittal, manager-marketing, skill development, Punjab Heritage and Tourism Promotion board. Mittal said that the farm tourism in Punjab has been a hit with many thronging to the state to stay on a farm. “We have 37 farmhouses with a maximum of nine rooms in a farmhouse in various districts of the state. The stay can cost anywhere between Rs 2,500 to Rs 10,000 depending on the package,” he added. In Madhya Pradesh (MP), the state is busy promoting authentic rural experiences. Heritage walks, cycle safaris, handloom walks, cooking sessions with villagers are some experiences that travellers can look forward to in rural tourism. “We had identified 100 villages, of which 60 are already hosting rural tourists. Travellers can opt for homestays and get to experience rural life,” said Shilpa Gupta, additional managing director, MP Tourism Board, adding that there is a huge demand for rural tourism in the pandemic as people are preferring to travel to places that do not have high footfall. Gupta said that while they have six homestays at each of these 60 villages, the board is also recognizing private homestays and these would cost about Rs 2,000 per day. Jammu and Kashmir has identified 75lesser-known destinations and is promoting them among domestic travellers. “Gurez, Bhaderwah, Kishtwar are some of the lesser-known destinations,” said Dr Zahoor Ahmad Raina, chief executive officer, Tourism Development Authority, Gulmarg. He said that all high-end hotels in J&K are fully booked until February-March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/omicron-cloud-many-prefer-domestic-travel/articleshow/88111032.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Goa||Difficult moment for Goa, we must forget the past and be ready with a clear mind: Juan Ferrando||These may be early stages in the Indian Super League (ISL) but three straight defeats at the start is a cause for concern at FC Goa. For a side that has been dominant in the past and, on the back of a morale-boosting triumph in the Durand Cup, Goa’s fall from the top has had many wondering. Coach Juan Ferrando has another opportunity to address the issues and get their campaign back on track when they face SC East Bengal, another struggling side, at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco on Tuesday. Ferrando tried to shake things up and benched captain Edu Bedia in the last game, making way for the centre-back pairing of Ivan Gonzalez and Dylan Fox. The team showed promise after equalising soon, but NorthEast broke their hearts with a late added time winner. The loss was Goa’s third in a row, and they have now conceded eight goals in just three games. “In the last game, we knew NorthEast’s press was not so high, so in this case we needed more in the build-up. That’s why we played Ivan and Dylan because they know about build up, they know our style. It was a tactical decision,” Ferrando told TOI in an online interaction on Monday. East Bengal have a similar wait and watch approach as they look to pounce on their opponents’ errors. It will be interesting to see how Ferrando strikes a balance. “For me it’s not about thinking about the way (we played) was good or we created chances,” said Ferrando. “For me, it is important to get three points because it’s our target. Now the team must be ready for the next game with a clear mind and forget about the past.” Goa are at the bottom of the table and are yet to open their account. East Bengal are just a place above with two points and have played an additional game. Goa last went on such a poor run in the 2016 edition and Ferrando will not want an unwanted record against his name. All that he wants for his team now is to regain their confidence. “It is a difficult moment when the players are fighting (to change results) on and off the pitch in training sessions,” said Ferrando. The Spaniard feels his team needs to be more patient and control the ball well. Goa tried playing Jorge Ortiz upfront in place of forward Airam Cabrera, who had a slight niggle before the last game. He is expected to make a return, along with Redeem Tlang who has started training with the team but may need time to regain match fitness. Star midfielder Brandon Fernandes, though, continues to be injured. Last season, both fixtures between the two teams ended 1-1. East Bengal are on the look out for their first win in the league this season and will fancy their chances against the bottom-placed opponents. “Every match is important to win, not only FC Goa,” said East Bengal coach Jose Manuel Diaz. “But FC Goa is a very good team. Last season they were amongst the best four and they can play well every match.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/difficult-moment-for-goa-we-must-forget-the-past-and-be-ready-with-a-clear-mind-juan-ferrando/articleshow/88131817.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

Dressed like their favourite characters, they packed into Manhattan’s main convention hall — some 53,000 of them — over three days in November to celebrate their love of Japanese anime shows. In the crowd was Peter McGinn, a 30-year-old healthcare analyst from Minneapolis.After flying home, he learned that one friend from the convention — an anime fan from North Carolina — had just tested Covid positive. In the days to come, many more of his friends from the convention would test positive. That was November 23, a day before most scientists had even heard of the new variant that was tearing across southern Africa. The WHO had not yet even given the variant a name — omicron. But it was already present in the US, undetected. That became apparent this past week, when authorities in Minnesota examined the virus samples in a batch of recent tests. One of them — from McGinn — showed Omicron’s telltale mutations. His infection, which was announced by Minnesota health authorities on Thursday, is the first known instance of Omicron spreading within the US. “I’m essentially patient zero,” he said, though he wonders how he contracted it. New York City officials have sent emails and text messages to the convention attendees, urging them to get tested. But so far authorities have yet to confirm any transmission of Omicron at the Anime NYC convention, which was held Nov. 19 to 21||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/before-even-receiving-a-name-omicron-mayve-reached-us/articleshow/88112327.cms||---

The police team, led by newly posted sub-divisional police officer Jaidutt Bhavar, intercepted the truck. With this detection, authorities said they are confident of unearthing a major gutka racket with inter-district, or even inter-state, connections. The truck with a valuation of about Rs 15 lakh was also seized by the police, while the process of registering the offence was underway till late night. A preliminary probe has revealed that the banned substance was loaded from a discreet location in Amravati and was heading towards Mumbai, where it was scheduled to be delivered in the wee hours of Monday. Karmad police station inspector Rajendra Bokde said the mini-truck was briefly chased for a few km before being intercepted at Golatgaon. “We have detained the truck driver and he is being questioned about the ones who loaded the gutka and also about the prospective receivers in the state capital,” said Bokde. Authorities said gutka was stuffed in 83 bags and in order to avoid any suspicion or interception by the law enforcement agencies, it was being transported like any other goods. “There was a specific tip-off about the movement of the truck from the limits of Aurangabad rural, and accordingly the action was planned,” said a senior police officer. Authorities said they were trying to ascertain if the seized gutka was manufactured in Amravati or like other cases, was sourced from neighbouring states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, before being stocked in Amravati for further distribution in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/gutka-worth-rs-1cr-seized-from-truck/articleshow/88109853.cms||Mohammed Akhef

They said that though the management issued cheques to faculty in August before JNTUH inspection, the cheques had bounced due to lack of funds. “For the part of our salaries, the management issued post-dated cheques. They had asked us not to deposit the first cheque until the first week of October and finally, they gave a demand draft. The remaining two cheques were not honoured,” a faculty, who has been working at the college at Ghatkesar for the last five years, said. The faculty said that management has filed a false complaint against four of them, alleging that they had disrupted mid-term exams and suspended the faculty. “To threaten faculty, the management suspended us. The exams were held as per schedule. We reported for examination duties — question paper preparation, invigilation, among others. When we went to college on November 22, we were not allowed inside,” a teacher said, adding the college even hired bouncers to stop them from entering the campus. They claimed that since March 2019, they have not been paid salaries and added that about 10-15 faculty had resigned over non-payment of salaries. They alleged that the college was now conducting classes with the help of guest or part-time faculty. M Manzoor Hussain, registrar, JNTUH said that they have already issued a notice to the college seeking explanation. “We received a complaint alleging the institute is not paying salaries to faculty. We are looking into it,” he added.

The education board of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to give daily exercises to students of standards VIII to XII on handwriting improvement. The exercise will be conducted on a pilot basis with 90 students and later be expanded to all PMC schools. Some private schools have also begun a similar exercise after realising that students’ handwriting and writing speed had decreased and with offline examinations likely for secondary students, the habit of good handwriting needed to be inculcated back among students. As the mid-term got over, the civic education board realised that the handwriting skills of students needed to be improved and so on an immediate basis, it would be implemented among a few students and later scaled up to other classes, education officer of the civic board, Shivaji Daundkar said. Daundkar said, “The online education system has ruined the writing skills of the students. Even the examinations were conducted in MCQ format as a result of which the students have forgotten to write and also their handwriting has become very poor. Our workshop will focus on improving the handwriting and also enhance the capacity of writing for a long time.” There are chances that the board exams may also be conducted offline and so the students have to start practising from now onwards. “We will be starting with board students in the next two weeks and later for students from standards VIII and IX,” Daumdkar said. The private schools in the city had also raised concerns over the writing skills of students a few months after the online education had begun. Writing by hand may seem outdated, but a new Norwegian study suggests that handwriting may be more beneficial than typing. A lot of senses are activated by pressing the pen on paper, seeing the letters one writes and hearing the sound you make while writing. These sense experiences create contact between different parts of the brain and open the brain up for learning. This makes students learn better and remember better, the study has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/daily-writing-exercise-to-overcome-scrawling/articleshow/88111053.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

And it’s not rocket science. There are solutions to handle much bigger crowds then airport gatherings. But someone having decision making power have to take interest in it,” Sisodia tweeted, quoting a tweet and photograph of an airport user, showing a packed arrival area at the airport. Sisodia also tagged civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia in the tweet. The central government has made it mandatory for all travellers arriving in India from countries that have been identified as ‘at-risk countries’ to undergo post-arrival Covid-19 tests at airports.

James Wilson, member, expert advisory group, KSEBL, said that 501.592mu power was generated at the plant in November and the average daily generation was 16.67mu. “The maximum power generation capacity of six generators at the power plant is 18.72mu,” said Wilson. Normally, to manage the power demand during summer season, the maximum power generation at Moolamattom is 450mu. A KSEB dam safety official said that the maximum power generation at the plant was to reduce the water level in Idukki reservoir. “For the first time in November, the water level reached 2,400ft. Power generation at the plant was at maximum level on almost all days in November,” he said. The water level slowly decreased in Idukki reservoir and fell to 2,400.68ft, the blue alert level, at 6pm on Sunday. The orange alert level is 2401ft and upper rule level 2,403 ft. The water level slowly declined in Idukki reservoir and is expected to decline further in the coming days. With the water in safe position, the annual maintenance works at Moolamattom power plant has begun. “The annual maintenance works of the generators was delayed due to the increased power generation to utilize the water in the wake of a long rain spell. With the water level reaching a safe position, it was decided to begin maintenance works. The works are expected to be completed within 90 days, before the peak-production season” said the official. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu opened spillway shutters of Mullaperiyar dam for the fourth consecutive day on Saturday. On Saturday night, TN opened four spillway shutters and released 1,602cusecs of water to Periyar. TN had opened nine spillway shutters on Tuesday night without warning, resulting in flooding. Kerala chief minister then sent a letter to TN CM demanding that the shutters not be opened in the night. Despite Kerala’s plea, TN continued to open shutters in the night and released water to Periyar. After the water level slowly fell at Mullaperiyar dam on Sunday, TN closed all spillway shutters except v3. Later, at 6pm on Sunday, nine spillway shutters of the dam was opened, releasing 7,341.06 cusecs of water to the Periyar The 24-hour fast by Idukki MP Dean Kuriakose at Cheruthoni, demanding a new dam at Mullaperiyar, concluded on Sunday. Former water resources minister PJ Joseph inaugurated the valedictory function. “How can chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan ensure that the Mullaperiyar dam will not fail? Very heavy rainfall could result in the dam overflowing. Besides, earthquakes with magnitude 6 on the Richter scale can affect the dam. Public opinion should be mobilized for a new dam at Mullaperiyar,” said Joseph.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/record-power-generated-at-moolamattom-plant/articleshow/88111067.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Company claims Covaxin open vial policy 28 days||NAGPUR: Following TOI reports on challenges posed by multi-dose vials to vaccinaters and citizens, Bharat Biotech has stated that its multi-dose open vial policy is for 28 days for Covaxin and its shelf life is 12 months at 2-8C temperature. Dr Archana Patil, director (immunisation), public health department, said, “There is no open vial policy for Covaxin.” In an email to TOI, the vaccine manufacturer’s spokesperson claimed that the advisory had been issued six-month back to all centres offering Covaxin. Vaccinators and officials in the city are also not aware of any such advisory which allows usage of opened Covaxin vial beyond four hours. This week, many beneficiaries faced problems. They were asked to either wait for some hours or sent back due to the multidose Covaxin vials. The city centres have received 20-dose vials which makes it difficult for vaccinators to open when a few beneficiaries walk in. The deputy director of health services (DDHS), civic health officials, and vaccination centre officials said they were asked to discard the left over doses after 4 hours from opening it. This has been the policy since the beginning. On Saturday, Bharat Biotech issued another statement saying, “During early January 2021, Covaxin received a shelf life of 6 months during emergency use approval by CDSCO. Based upon the additional stability data submitted to CDSCO, the shelf life extension from 6 months to 12 months was approved by CDSCO. Also, the WHO has approved Covaxin for usage under the 28-day open vial policy as a unique product characteristic, thus reducing vaccine wastage by approximately 10-30%.” The statement added, “Now hospitals can continue to use the available stock towards vaccinations. Bharat Biotech expects to extend the shelf life further, based on the availability of the additional stability data.” The manufacturer explained, “Covaxin contains a whole virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which is produced in vero cells. It is stable at 2 to 8°C (refrigerated) and is shipped in a ready-to-use liquid formulation that permits distribution using existing vaccine supply chain channels.” Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, DDHS, Nagpur circle, reitierated that the vial has to be consumed within 4 hours. “We have both 10 and 20-dose vials if the company says it can be kept for 28 days. But right now, vaccinators follow instructions on the leaflet which comes with the vaccine. There is no written instruction to us on using the vials beyond 4 hours,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/co-claims-covaxin-open-vial-policy-28-days-state-health-dept-says-no-such-norm/articleshow/88111066.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||Din in BMC was Shiv Sena's ploy to clear land transfer: BJP||MUMBAI: Bharatiya Janata Party has alleged that the chaos at BMC’s general Body meeting on Friday was deliberate. The commotion was used to clear the exchange of land with Ajmera Builders at Mahul, profiting the builder at the cost of the city, alleged BJP MLA Ashish Shelar. At a press meet on Saturday, Shelar said the proposal to allot a 4.5 lakh sq ft private plot outside CRZ in exchange for the builder’s 1.5 lakh sq ft plot near the nullah for Mahul pumping station was approved amid the chaos. As per the proposal, the private plot was transferred to BMC as an amenity plot and BMC had reserved it for a garden. TimesViewThat BMC polls are near is clear from the aggression with which BJP has taken up civic issues. Good for citizens that issues affecting them are raised. But BJP’s approval to exchange of land to set up the pumping station in the improvements panel and attempts to stall it in the general body indicate it is not the city’s welfare that drives the aggressive stand. BMC’s many panels and general body are a forum for discussion and debate which have been sorely missing for decades. Mumbai deserves better from its elected representatives.“While BJP opposed the proposal and sought a vote on it, the ruling party created chaos to ensure the proposal was passed. BJP corporators were questioning about an infant’s death due to burns at Nair hospital as it did not get timely medical aid, Sena was busy plotting to get the land deal completed,” he alleged. Yashwant Jadhav, standing committee chairman, said the proposal was passed unanimously. “Mahul pumping station is a necessity for Mumbai. Once commissioned, it will ensure there is no water-logging at Hindmata. When the proposal was first placed before the Improvements Committee, it was supported by BJP corporators. When it came up at the general body their stance suddenly changed. Why the double standards?” he asked. Expressing outrage over manhandling of BJP women corporators outside the corporation by goons allegedly brought by Jadhav, Shelar said the standing committee chairman even threatened to strangle people in the general body. “The police must seize CCTV footage from inside and outside and, if required, file an FIR against Jadhav.” Jadhav said the men BJP was referring to as goons were Shiv Sainiks and are always with corporators. “No one called for goons. When we stepped out of the corporation, BJP women corporators came onto some of the corporators even as the BJP men corporators used abusive language,” he said, adding, “There is a difference between aggression and goondagardi. We are aggressive and what Shelar did in the legislature for which he has been suspended is goondagardi.” Targeting minister Aaditya Thackeray, also the MLA from Worli, Shelar said he has not had time to visit the victims while mayor Kishori Pednekar, a local corporator, reached after 72 hours. “The child was not attended to for 45 minutes at the hospital. Inquiry has revealed that there is no duty chart nor are roles defined...,” he said. Jadhav said the incident was unfortunate but it is shameful that BJP is politicising the issue ahead of elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/din-in-bmc-was-sena-ploy-to-clear-land-transfer-bjp/articleshow/88096670.cms||---

Colonel (Retd) Amit Dalvi, the director of SPI Aurangabad, has been appointed the member secretary of the panel that will give shape to this maiden institute in Maharashtra. In Nashik, the building of the department of higher and technical education and the girls’ hostel for the daughters of ex-servicemen have been shortlisted as the place to set up the institute. Dalvi, on Sunday, said the proposed SPI for girls would offer education of two years from Class XI along with necessary training to crack entrances to defence courses. “It will be a milestone in the history of Maharashtra to set up a defence training institute for girls. Different authorities are taking swift measures to ensure the start of the first-of-its-kind facility in Nashik,” he said. As per the Government Resolution issued by the general administration department, a six-member panel will recommend the temporary and the permanent set up of the SPI. Headed by Nashik divisional commissioner, the panel has been asked to submit its report by December 15. Pradnya Dharashivkar, a parent, said, “The entry for girls in defence services is revolutionary move and many parents are keen to send their daughter in the service of the nation. The government should consider setting up such institute in every division of the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/states-first-spi-for-girls-to-come-up-in-nashik/articleshow/88109872.cms||Prasad Joshi

The entire passage has been occupied by hawkers and authorities have turned a blind eye to it. Though several complaints about the presence of illegal occupants on the passage have been made to the GHMC and police officials, no action has been taken. Illegal encroachments thrive, blocking vehicular movement. “Authorities have paid scant attention to the Puranapul. Motorists are always in haste here causing traffic jams that last long during peak hours. The other carriageway is yet to be opened up for traffic flow. If this is done, it could ease the traffic situation,’’ said a motorist Sameer. Heritage lovers have time and again urged authorities to ensure the Puranapul is a safe and clean place for locals. Drunken driving and illegal encroachments, they say, are robbing this historic structure of its glory. “While traffic police have made attempts to stop drunken driving, they have failed to curb the menace. Traffic heading towards Charminar, Bahadurpura, and other parts of the Old City have to face hurdle after hurdle during peak hours. Authorities should take note of the traffic problems being faced by people,’’ said a resident Mohammed Abdul Samad. The 600ft long and 35ft broad bridge once attracted tourists from all over the world, but is now home to vegetable and fruit vendors. The bridge was built in 1578 to provide better connectivity between the then capital of Qutub Shahi kingdom Golconda and the port city of Machilipatnam. It was also built long before Charminar and predates Hyderabad city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/a-symbol-of-the-past-puranapul-cries-for-attention/articleshow/88111069.cms||Omar bin Taher

---||Ahmedabad||Working capital shortage makes MSMEs seek credit||Industrial units across Gujarat are battling working capital woes, amid growing costs of production and payment cycles getting longer. To make matters worse, higher freight, coal and gas costs are also making manufacturers shell out more. Manufacturers in sectors such as textiles, chemicals and dyes, metal castings, plastic packaging, engineering goods — particularly micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) — are reeling from a shortage of working capital. Most are thus either downsizing production, cutting operational hours or simply keeping units shut. MSMEs which do not have large cash reserves are the worst off, say industry players. "Exporters are already battling delays in shipments due to the container shortage. In most cases, manufacturers receive payment after shipments reach their destination. With shipments delayed due to the lack of shipping containers, payments are delayed by an additional 45-60 days. This adds to the manufacturers’ working capital constraints," said Jaimin Shah, co-chairman, Assocham Gujarat State Council. With higher input costs on raw materials and the industry operating on water-thin margins, MSMEs find it difficult to absorb the cost, state industry players. "Overheads such as Covid-19 related safety protocol, followed by higher fixed costs and lower utilization of capacity have added to the burden on working capital," said Milan Thakkar, CEO, Walplast. Plastic makers operate at 65% of capacity Plastic packaging manufacturing units across Gujarat have been operating at around 65% capacity due to a shortage of raw materials and working capital. Gujarat has an estimated 5,000 manufacturing units – mainly MSMEs – which manufacture roughly 10,000 tonnes of plastics every month. "With polymers such as high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene and polypropylene getting 25% to 40% more expensive, the cost of producing packaging materials has risen. Banks are not extending working capital loans under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), which is becoming a huge challenge in manufacturing. We need to procure raw materials at higher cost and realisation is taking time. Due to this, units have downsized production," said Shailesh Patel, former president of the Gujarat State Plastic Manufacturers’ Association. Dyes, chemicals sectors push for more credit to MSMEs With skyrocketing raw material prices, availability of credit is a growing concern among dyes and chemical manufacturers as production is being hampered. "Raw materials have become at least 40% more expensive and costs have even doubled for some. Four to six months ago, raw materials were available on credit for up to 60 days. Now, with supply short and raw material prices increasing, manufacturers are forced to pay within a week or in some cases even immediately. Working capital needs are rising for manufacturers, particularly, MSMEs," said Natubhai Patel, managing director, Meghmani Organics. Industry players expect that the government extend benefit of the 20% additional credit top-up to MSMEs under the Atmanirbhar Bharat package. Manufacturers are facing a credit shortage and high prices of raw materials for agro-chemicals, pharma chemicals, fine chemicals and basic chemicals, industry stakeholders say. Expensive steel, non-ferrous metals hurt engineering productionProduction in engineering units across Gujarat has been hit for lack of raw materials. With the price of steel and non-ferrous metals going up by at least 50% and as high as threefold, the need for working capital has increased. "Metal castings and metals have become costlier, adding to the liquidity needs of units to sustain operations. Also, demand has slowed due to which manufacturers are unable to get realisation on their orders. As a consequence, working capital needs are increasing. The situation was better last year due to credit availability for MSMEs under Atmanirbhar Bharat package, which is not the case now. Small and mid-sized manufacturers are battling liquidity shortage and are forced to downsize production," said Rajendra Shah, former president of the Gujarat chapter of CII. 20% of foundries across Gujarat yet to reopen after DiwaliAt least 20% of foundries across Gujarat are yet to resume operations after Diwali, as they’re reeling from a liquidity crunch according to estimates by the Indian Institute of Foundrymen (IIF). Costlier raw materials and delayed imports are causing huge sums of working capital of foundries to be blocked. Subodh Panchal, a past president of the IIF, said, "Raw materials including ferrous alloys as well as foundry chemicals have become 50%-300% more expensive. Most of these alloys are imported and suppliers are asking for advance payments. Moreover, due to the container shortage, raw materials which earlier arrived in a month and a half now arrive in about three months. As a consequence, working capital is blocked, which is affecting production." Foundrymen also said that besides the surge in inventory cost, repayment cycles have also stretched which is adding to their woes. "Banks are also not extending credit readily, which is posing a challenge to industry operations." Textile processors cut working hoursWith prices of raw materials used for textile processing shooting through the roof, several textile processing units have cut their hours of operation as they are facing a shortage of working capital. For instance, the Ahmedabad Textile Processors’ Association (ATPA) recently released a circular stating that processing units in Narol are operating for only three days a week. Naresh Sharma, vice president, ATPA, said, "Raw material costs have increased by as much as three times in some cases. Even though the price of imported coal has reduced, it is still nearly three times higher than what it was six months ago. Coal is widely used to fire boilers at processing units. With costlier raw materials bought on advance payment, processors face a liquidity shortage." Chemicals used in processing such as caustic lye, reactive dyes, industrial urea, acetic acid and pigments and wet colours have got 50% to 300% more expensive, show ATPA estimates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/working-capital-shortage-makes-msmes-seek-credit/articleshow/88111073.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Hyderabad||27 Hyderabad monuments to get facelift||HYDERABAD: Better late than never. The department of heritage Telangana has finally decided to give a facelift to 27 monuments in twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. Though this is a truncated list and excludes most of the monuments built during the Asaf Jahi period, heritage experts welcome the move as the department has turned its attention to conservation after a long time. The decision to protect, conserve and give a facelift to the monuments, mostly built during the Qutub Shahi period, comes after the high court earlier this year pulled up officials concerned over the neglect of heritage and historical structures. Heritage experts suggest that the department of heritage Telangana include all the structures of the Qutub Shahi and the Asaf Jahi periods to give a holistic approach to conservation of city’s heritage, culture, history and architecture. They argue that unless all the monuments, big and small, are brought into the protected list, it would be difficult for Hyderabad to bag the Unesco’s world heritage city tag. Hyderabad has everything to qualify for a world heritage city, but what is required is removal of encroachments, protection of the monuments and conserving them for the posterity. Hyderabad has hundreds of monuments including the not so famous. Every heritage monument and site in the city speaks volumes of the engineering and architectural advancement of those days. They have their own heritage tales to tell. If the tomb of Hakim brings forth the history of the medicine in Hyderabad, the tombs of Kulsum Begum and Khairati Begum give a glimpse of the women power in the Hyderabad of yore. The Shamsheer Kota and Khazana building tell about the weaponry and economic and military prowess of old Hyderabad. “Hyderabad has witnessed three different styles of architecture – Qutub Shahi, Asaf Jahi and Osmanian. They are a synthesis of Indian and Persian styles of architecture. We need to protect prehistoric sites too. The monuments built during the Nizam VII should also be protected,” said P Anuradha Reddy, convener of city unit of INTACH. She said the Osmania General Hospital building should be included in the state heritage list. Dr Mohammad Safiullah of Deccan Heritage Trust said though the decision to conserve 27 monuments is a welcome move, the department of heritage Telangana should ensure that all monuments of the Asaf Jah period are also protected. The department should expand the list of heritage sites in twin cities. “The state government is keen to secure world heritage city tag for Hyderabad. Heritage and history of Hyderabad should not be seen in isolation or limited to a certain period. The continuity should be maintained and the best way is to protect all the Qutub Shahi, pre-Qutub Shahi, Asaf Jahi and Osmanian monuments,” Safiullah said, adding that continuity of city heritage and history would only fetch Hyderabad the heritage city tag.

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Industrialist booked under Explosives Act||COIMBATORE: A day after a Delhi-based industrialist was detained at the city airport after the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel detected 85% presence of trinitrotoluene (TNT), a chemical compound that is used chiefly as an explosive, in the ore that he was carrying during the baggage screening, the city police on Sunday said the amount of TNT detected in the ore was a negligible 3.3%. While the city police said it would have been a serious issue if there were 30% TNT in the ore, CISF has lodged a written complaint stating they have found “explosive material” in the industrialist’s baggage and sought action against him. The city police have registered a first information report against the industrialist, who is identified as Varun Arora, 32, director of SRAM India Logam Pvt Ltd, under Section 5 of the Explosive Substances Act. The city police said they would send the ore to Chennai-based laboratory to find the exact percentage of TNT. The CISF personnel had scanned Varun’s baggage on Saturday afternoon, when he was planning to return to Delhi. After detecting the presence of TNT in the ore, he was handed over to the Peelamedu police. A bomb detection and disposal squad was subsequently deployed to test the ore. “The squad used an explosive vapour detector, which found only 3.3% of TNT in the 2.5kg ore that he was carrying in seven small packets. The ore had 98% copper content and .17% gold content. Sniffer dog Lyca was also pressed into the service and it found traces of TNT in only one of the packets,” a police officer said. Preliminary inquiry revealed that Varun, who owns an industry in Himachal Pradesh, had brought the ore from Cambodia to find gold, copper and lead contents in it. “On November 29, he had reached Kochi in Kerala from Delhi by flight. His baggage was scanned at Delhi and Kochi airports. But the CISF personnel did not find any explosive traces at the two airports,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/industrialist-booked-under-explosives-act/articleshow/88111074.cms||---

The car got completely mangled in the accident. Car driver Sajid Ali, 32, and two children — Mohammed Azhar, 9, and Mohammed Azan — died, while three others — Javeed bin Sulaiman, his wife Amreen and Anas,12 — escaped with injuries, Korutla police said.

---||Nagpur||Will stop cashless mode for govt schemes: 50 pvt hosps||Nagpur: Claiming that the central government has not cleared the bills to the tune of nearly Rs25 crore to Rs50crore for over six months, 50 private hospitals have warned of stopping cashless facilities to the beneficiaries of Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) and Ayushman Bharat. The Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) said the hospitals have already suffered losses due to arbitrary decision of some private insurance companies which have de-empanelled them following disagreement over rates, and the unpaid bills are adding to the financial burden. However, officials in-charge of the government schemes countered the VHA claims saying the pendency of bills is technically for the last one or two months only, that too for bills worth Rs11 crore only. A CGHS doctor said the bill scrutiny process has been taken over by National Health Authority of India since June this year. “Earlier, a private agency used to scrutinize the bills. The entire process has been switched to online mode. The system with the authority is continuously updating. Hospitals too are unable to furnish all documents on time. After the national authority, the powers to sanction the bills wrest with CGHS Kolkata. Nagpur CGHS does it for another centre,” said the doctor. The official added that so far none of the bills from Nagpur and Mumbai have been cleared. “The argument that hospitals are suffering is not true. Some hospitals got approval recently. As on date, not all hospitals are empanelled. Earlier, we had 96, now we have 84 hospitals including those from Raipur as it comes under Nagpur jurisdiction,” said the doctor. He added that hospitals can coordinate with the authority for speedy clearance. In a press release, the VHA said, “Shortly, these hospitals will stop cashless service to CGHS beneficiaries also. The hospitals are unable to sustain themselves. Such a hostile environment is not conducive to the existence and viability of any hospital and will affect the healthcare sector.” The release added, “Private patients uncovered by either CGHS/ECHS/Ayushman Bharat schemes are now insured with major health insurance companies. Till date, these insurance companies were empanelling hospitals and reimbursing for the services utilized by their clients at the negotiated hospital rack rates.” “Of late, these 3 insurance companies and their third party administrators (TPAs) have got together and are dictating the reimbursement all-inclusive package rates, which are less than the present cost incurred by the hospitals in rendering the services. This endangers the quality of care and safety of the patients,” said the release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/will-stop-cashless-mode-for-govt-schemes-50-pvt-hosps/articleshow/88111100.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

While the saffron party is keeping the names of those who are approaching them under wraps, the ruling TRS is reportedly keeping a close eye on those who are approaching the BJP. “The joining is likely to happen in Delhi, as a rule, former MPs and ex-MLAs join in the presence of national president, depending on JP Nadda’s time,” sources said. C Vithal, a former member of the Telangana Public Service Commission (TPCC), is joining the party in Delhi on Monday, and Teenmar Mallanna has declared that he will join the party on Tuesday. According to sources, another women leader from a local party is also expected to join the party. Though many leaders are approaching them, the BJP is concerned because several of its leaders have been stopped by the ruling TRS after learning about their intentions. “This has happened three times recently. Getting leaders with solid ground connections is critical for us,” a senior leader said. “We are ensuring that these leaders who are joining us bring rank and file with them,” he added. Former minister Eatala Rajender has been tasked with getting leaders who were active in the Telangana statehood agitation into the party and DK Aruna would oversee the joining from the Congress. Elsewhere, the TPCC is attempting to be active, and there is widespread speculation that the party is in talks with Cheruku Sudhakar, the founder of the Telangana Inti party, to join them. Meanwhile, Ravinder Singh, who is running as an independent MLC from Karimnagar, claimed on Sunday that the TRS is going all hard to win two MLC seats. “TRS has activated local ministers and legislators to win these seats, demonstrating how scared they are,” Singh stated.

It has been now established that this small Himalayan state is home to ‘five’ species of the flying squirrels – Kashmir flying squirrel (spotted 25 years ago in Ranikhet), woolly flying squirrel (spotted 20 years ago in Pakistan), Indian giant flying squirrel, red giant flying squirrel and white bellied flying squirrel. The study was conducted across the state between October 2020 and July 2021, and it is the first such study conducted by any forest department in the country, as per authorities. The aim is to understand their habitat and distribution, threats, and chalk out a conservation strategy.Six different sites – Ranikhet, Devprayag, Ranichauri, Deoban, Govind Wildlife Sanctuary and Bhaironghati -- were selected and data was recorded on various parameters like forest composition, physical appearance, nesting behavior, gliding distance, activities/behavioral patterns, etc. Among all five species, red giant flying squirrel was spotted most frequently in different habitats while maximum sighting of the squirrel was reported from Tehri forest division. “India is home to 13 species of flying squirrels and 5 of them are present in Uttarakhand as per our findings. It is time we conserve their habitat which is under threat due to multiple reasons ranging from deforestation, wildfires, urbanisation. A conservation strategy needs to be formulated to save them from the adverse impact of changing atmosphere,” said Jyoti Prakash, junior research fellow of the research wing of forest department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/study-finds-5-species-of-flying-squirrels-in-ukhand/articleshow/88122357.cms||Shivani Azad

Priced at Rs 40,000, the cart aims to save vendors from losses incurred due to fruits and vegetables -- which are highly perishable commodities – getting spoiled. "Perishable vegetables and fruits need low temperatures and high relative humidity of 80 to 90% for enhanced shelf life. The cold air operating system fixed on the cart adjusts the temperature automatically,” said RP Saini, coordinator, RuTAG. Researchers said they have built a cooling system in the cart on the lines of a domestic air cooler. For this, they made several glass-covered chambers, each having a dimension of 1.5 ×1×0.9m, after attaching the main chamber with a water tank, a DC pump, a battery and other electrical control panels. During the virtual inauguration of the project recently, Union panchayati raj secretary Sunil Kumar said pocket-friendly carts should be developed so that vendors are able to afford them. Also, banks should come forward to help vegetable and fruit sellers procure the carts, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/iit-r-vending-cart-lends-longer-shelf-life-to-veggies/articleshow/88110516.cms||Tapan Susheel
---||Delhi||Wind helps Delhi weather the AQI storm, for now||NEW DELHI: Having oscillated between “very poor” and “severe” for the past few weeks, Delhi’s air quality improved on Sunday to the lower end of “very poor” due to slightly favourable weather conditions.  Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to the pollution monitoring agencies and the weather department, the air quality is likely to improve over the next few days with consistently higher wind speeds. The city may see light rain between Sunday night and Monday morning and, thereafter, a slight drop in mercury. On Sunday, Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) reading stood at 305, on a scale of 0 to 500, against 362 a day earlier. Easterly winds, which are slightly warmer, better ventilation and lower intrusion of external pollutants helped. “The city is experiencing easterly winds due to a western disturbance. Though the speed is normal at 5-7 kmph, the intrusion of external pollutants was negligible. Also the day had some sun and better visibility, which resulted in an improved air quality. The wind speeds are likely to increase over next three days,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD. According to SAFAR, the AQI is likely to improve due to better ventilation. “The AQI today indicates the lower end of ‘very poor’. For December 6 and 7, wind speeds are likely to be relatively higher, increasing ventilation. The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to drop, leading to more stable atmosphere, reducing the convective mixing. The net effect will be to improve the air quality, but it will remain within the ‘upper end of poor’ or the lower end of ‘very poor’,”said a statement from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research on Sunday. According to the India Meteorological Department, the city is likely to see experience a drop in the minimum temperatures. “The western disturbance is withdrawning from the region, leading to change in the wind directions back to westerly and northwesterly, which are icy cold. That is why the minimum temperature will start dropping and after December 10, the minimum temperature may hover around 7-6 degrees Celsius,” added Jenamani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wind-helps-delhi-weather-the-aqi-storm-for-now/articleshow/88111105.cms||---

In yet another raid on poachers, the Nagpur forest division officials arrested 10 accused from Salekasa under Gondia forest division for hunting a leopard and removing its paws and other body parts. The raid is the sequel to earlier arrests of poachers from whom several tiger and leopard body parts and bones have been seized. According to the assistant conservator of forest (ACF) and investigating officer, Narendra Chandewar, the number of accused arrested in wildlife crime since July has gone up to 73. Acting on a tip-off, Chandewar said a joint team of Gondia and Nagpur forest officials lured the poachers on a playground of a junior college in Salekasa. The team seized a leopard skin, four chopped paws, canines, teeth, and whiskers. Three motorcycles used to traffic the materials were also seized. The accused have been identified as Radheshyam Uikey, Jallatola, Jogeshwar Daseriya, Dhansowa (Bori), Pappu Madavi, Jambhli, Dinesh Shrivastav, Bhandara, Sandeep Ramteke, Mokara, Dinesh Sahare, Deori, Vinod Daseriya, Kawrabandh, Litesh Kumbhre, Baghnadi (Chhattisgarh), Parasram Meshram, Girola, and Ramkrishna Dahale, Pandhri. Chandewar said the accused tried to mislead by saying the leopard was not killed by them but was found dead near a hill in Salekasa in July 2021. But, the animal was poached and later its body parts were removed. For the past four months, the accused were looking for prospective customers. On November 24, a team of Nagpur forest officials had nabbed five persons for poaching a tiger and had seized its body parts. In both these cases, Melghat Cyber Cell proved to be of big help in tracking the culprits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/10-held-for-poaching-leopard-in-salekasa-chopping-paws/articleshow/88111126.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The incident took place at Akurdi during the night intervening between Friday and Saturday. The arrested man, Sunny Dhas, is a native of Sangli but resides at Panvel. He had left his food delivery job recently, and also worked with a transporter. But he was desperate for money. He drove down to Akurdi on his motorcycle with a plan to target an unmanned ATM kiosk. The police seized a cutter, screw driver, pepper spray, nylon rope and other material from his possession. During questioning, Dhas revealed that he chose Pune as no one from here knows him. Police are verifying whether Dhas has any cases against him in Panvel. He has been arrested under sections 357 (house-trespass or break-in by night) and 380 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/food-delivery-person-caught-breaking-into-akurdi-atm/articleshow/88111116.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: DMRC deploys 14 smog guns at construction sites||NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has deployed 14 anti-smog guns to combat pollution at its construction sites, apart from other measures. Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications) of DMRC, said that at present 12 civil contracts are operational across the capital as part of Delhi Metro’s Phase IV expansion and some other construction projects. “With the gradual expansion of construction work, more such anti-smog guns will be introduced at the sites in the days ahead. DMRC’s environment department is conducting regular inspections to ensure that the anti-smog guns are regularly used at the sites by the contractors,” he said. Dayal said that the anti-smog guns throw fine mist from time to time to check the possibility of dust pollution emanating from construction work. “These state-of-the-art anti-smog guns are capable of spraying fine mist up to 70 to 100 metres. One such gun is considered adequate for covering an area up to 20,000 square metres,” he said. “It is ensured that the water used for sprinkling are free from coliforms, viruses and bacteria. High quality nozzles with droplet sizes of 10 to 50 micrometers are used for greater impact,” he added. Dayal said that traditionally, anti-smog guns have been used at coal and cement manufacturing sites across the world. In November, 2016, DMRC arguably became the first construction company in the National Capital Region to use anti-smog guns at its sites as a pilot project. “Now Delhi government has also made the use of anti-smog guns mandatory for all construction agencies in the national capital as a tool to combat pollution,” he said. Apart from the regular use of anti-smog guns, DMRC takes several other measures to minimise the impact of pollution emanating from its sites, Dayal said. He said that all construction materials are properly covered with tarpaulin and other materials, and daily barricade cleaning and toe dust cleaning is also carried out. “Wheels of vehicles leaving the sites are properly cleaned so that they do not spread dust or mud on the streets. The materials carried by them are also adequately covered,” he said. Dayal said that all roads leading to major construction sites are properly black topped and the construction and demolition waste generated are recycled at specified construction and demolition recycling facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dmrc-deploys-14-smog-guns-at-construction-sites/articleshow/88111120.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Conmen pose as cops, dupe couple||PUNE: Two men posing as policemen put a 72-year-old former state government employee and his wife (63) under the fear of getting robbed and duped them of jewellery worth Rs2.6 lakh by a sleight of hand technique near Sus Khind in Pashan around 11.30am on Saturday. The couple are from Mumbai and were on a weekend trip to Sus Khind where they have a second home, officials from the Chatushrungi police said. They were taking a stroll when they came across the two men who introduced themselves as ‘policemen’ and told the couple to be careful about their jewellery as a senior citizen had been stabbed and robbed at some distance ahead. Police said the wife then removed her gold necklace and rings and the elderly man too removed his gold chain, totally worth Rs2.60 lakh and kept it in a purse. The two men, on the pretext of helping the couple, took the purse from the woman, and by sleight of hand, removed the jewellery before handing over the purse back to the couple. The couple realized they had been duped only after returning home and they found the purse empty, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/conmen-pose-as-cops-dupe-couple/articleshow/88111106.cms||---
---||World||Plenty of sanction options if Russia invades Ukraine: US||WASHINGTON: The Biden administration has plenty of options to make good on its pledge to hit Russia financially if President Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine, from sanctions targeting Putin's associates to cutting Russia off from the financial system that sends money flowing around the world. The United States and European allies have made no public mention of any plans to respond militarily themselves if Putin sends troops massed along the border into Ukraine, a former Soviet republic with close historical and cultural ties to Russia but now eager to ally with NATO and the West.  Instead, payback could be all about the money.  Secretary of State Antony Blinken this week promised financial pain — “high impact economic measures that we've refrained from taking in the past.”  President Joe Biden on Friday said the US had developed the “most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr. Putin.”  The United States over the past decade already has put a range of sanctions in place against Russian entities and individuals, many of them over Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea and its support for armed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014. US sanctions also have sought to punish Russia for election interference, malicious cyberactivities and human rights abuses.  Since 2014, the West also has helped Ukraine build up its military. So while Putin denies any intention of launching an offensive, his troops would face a Ukrainian army much more capable of putting up a fight.  The sanctions now imposed on Russians include asset freezes, bans on doing business with US companies and denial of entry to the United States. But in seeking to punish Russia, the West over the years has weighed even bigger financial penalties.  That includes the so-called nuclear option: blocking Russia from the Belgium-based SWIFT system of financial payments that moves money among thousands of banks around the world.  The European Parliament this year approved a non-binding resolution calling for that step if Russia does invade Ukraine.  When the US successfully pressured SWIFT to disconnect Iranian banks over Iran's nuclear programme, the country lost almost half of its oil export revenue and a third of its foreign trade, said Maria Shagina, an expert on sanctions and energy politics affiliated with the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank.  The impact on Russia's economy would be “equally devastating,” Shagina writes. Russia depends on its oil and natural gas exports for more than one-third of its federal revenues, and depends on SWIFT to make the petrodollars flow.  Russia has worked since 2014 to insulate its domestic financial systems from such a cutoff. A SWIFT cutoff would cause indirect pain for Western economies as well. John Herbst, a former US ambassador to Ukraine and career diplomat, said Friday he believed that while “SWIFT is not off the table, it would be a last resort."  The Biden administration earlier this year further limited Russia's ability to borrow money by banning US financial institutions from buying Russian government bonds directly from state institutions. But the sanctions didn't target the secondary market, leaving this as a possible next step.  Other possible tools and targets, Herbst noted: financial sanctions targeting people close to Putin and their families; and more sanctions on Russian banks and on Russia's vital energy sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/plenty-of-sanction-options-if-russia-invades-ukraine-us/articleshow/88112347.cms||---

Many flyers complained about the lack of coordination, crowd factor and other problems. They said the airlines were not providing proper information and many said they would miss connecting flights. “I had booked a flight to Patna via Delhi. The flight from Pune to Delhi has been rescheduled four times already. With no proper information, I will miss my onward connection. I had to reach Patna urgently today,” a flyer said. Airport officials said that the security hold area meant for international flyers had been opened up to accommodate the rush of waiting flyers. Airline sources told TOI that during the winter schedule between December to March, flight disruptions due to weather conditions are expected and taken into account. “The weather forecast is closely monitored and we have a fair idea about the disruptions expected.

The planning will be done in the presence of two party observers appointed by the central party leadership for the Chandigarh MC election. “Since we want all candidates to share a plan for campaigning in their municipal wards, strategy can be planned accordingly. All candidates will sit with the party’s leadership and discuss their plan of campaigning. After that, ward-wise campaign will be prepared and executed accordingly,” sources in the party said. Issues to be taken up in the election will also be decided during the meeting on Saturday. “Since issues are the most crucial part of a campaign, we will also need to decide national and local issues to be taken up during the campaign. These should not only appeal to the public but should also be real and should impact common people of the city,” sources said. Sources said that the Congress had requested party presidents of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh to send local leaders of the areas situated near Chandigarh for campaigning. Since these leaders remained in touch with people of the border areas, the party wants to take advantage of their relations and experience.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: President to begin Maha visit with tribute to Shivaji at Raigad fort||President Ramnath Kovind’s four-day visit to Maharashtra begins on Monday with a visit to the historic Raigad fort to pay tribute to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Whether the he will arrive at the fort by helicopter or ropeway, however, is yet to be confirmed.The President will visit Maharashtra from December 6 to 9, according to a statement by the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Following the fort visit, on December 7, the President will visit the Air Force base in Lohegaon in Pune, witness a flying display and interact with air warriors. He will present the President’s Standard to the 22nd Missile Vessel Squadron in Mumbai on Wednesday. A helipad has been constructed at Holicha Mal atop Raigad fort for the visit. The fort is at a height of 1,356 metres. According to officials, arrangements have also been made at another helipad constructed at Pachad, which is below the fort. There are 1,737 steps leading to the fort, which was the seat of Shivaji. Helicopter landings at the fort started in the 1980s. This continued for over two decades during ministerial visits. However, local protests against helicopter landings ended this practice. Activists of Konkan Kada Mitra Mandal (KKMM) had sat on a hunger strike in 2005 demanding that the Holicha Mal helipad be done away with. They had objected to dust accumulating on the statue of King Shivaji during helicopter landings and take-offs. The protests led to the helipad’s removal. Superintending archaeologist-Mumbai circle had on November 14, 2005 (copy in TOI possession), written to KKMM that "…the helipad near Holicha Mal has already been removed..." President Kovind’s upcoming visit has once again revived memories of the protests. Rajya Sabha MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati has tweeted that the President has decided to use the ropeway on his upcoming visit. However, a district official in Raigad said the final schedule was yet to be made known. “Two helipads, one at Holicha Mal and the other at Pachad, have been readied for the presidential visit scheduled for Monday. Though no official communication has been received, other possibilities of helicopter landing are being explored. Certification for safety of the ropeway has been obtained owing to concerns expressed earlier,” said Pratima Pudalwad, sub-divisional officer, Mahad. In the meantime, members of KKMM are welcoming what they believe is the President’s decision to avoid using the helipad. “The President has honoured the sentiments of large number of Shivbhakts by taking the ropeway to reach the Raigad fort,” said Rohit Pawar, a member of KKMM. Architect Rahul Samel agreed that landing helicopters in the vicinity of a monument may be detrimental to the structure. “Helipad is not allowed around the monuments protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Landing of helicopters is a major activity which not only involves dusting but also creates vibration. There is threat to monuments in case of any mishap. However, we cannot come out of the VIP culture,” said the noted architect.

A joint survey conducted by personnel from the revenue, agriculture, horticulture and sericulture departments ascertained the extent of the losses, which was found to be rather staggering. The other key finding of the survey, conducted at the behest of Chamarajanagar deputy commissioner Charulatha Somal, was that 640 houses were damaged owing to the record rainfall that the border district registered in November. Taking cognisance of the scale of the damage, the district administration has commenced work on distribution of compensation to residents in accordance with the guidelines of the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF). Ragi, sown in all the taluks of Chamarajanagar – Hanur, Kollegal, Chamarajanagar, Yelandur and Gundlupet – and, consequently, the crop was destroyed across 2,014 hectares. Paddy crop was destroyed in 24 hectares, while jowar was lost in 184 hectares, while groundnut and horticulture crops such as banana and papaya, among others, were washed away in 107 hectares. The NDRF guidelines stipulate that the district administration can offer Rs 6,200 for every hectare of crops lost in farms fed by rain, while the sum is Rs 13,500 for every hectare of irrigated farmland. Meanwhile, damaged houses have been classified in three categories – A (destroyed houses), B (severely damaged) and C (partially damaged). While members of houses that were completely destroyed will be given Rs 95,100, while those whose houses have sustained partial damage will get Rs 5,200. In addition to the money disbursed from the NDRF corpus, residents will also be compensated by the state government, which is offering Rs 5 lakh for members of Scheduled Castes / Scheduled Tribes whose houses are completely destroyed, while a sum of Rs 3 lakh will be disbursed to those for repair of houses that have sustained severe damage. Chamarajanagar additional deputy commissioner Katyayanidevi S told TOI that all the information about the loss of crops across the district had been uploaded on to the BHOOMI App. “We will directly credit the compensation to the bank accounts of the farmers. The district administration has sent all details about the losses incurred by the farmers and the damage to the houses to the principal secretary of the revenue department. There is the possibility of a central team arriving in the district to assess the extent of crop loss in the district,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/crops-across-2500-hectares-destroyed-by-unseasonal-rain-in-cnagar/articleshow/88110342.cms||---

Earlier, the MC fixed October 15 as the deadline for signing of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the French firm, Agence Française de Développement (AFD). However, in the absence of requisite approvals from the Union government, the deadline has now been extended to next year. UT adviser Dharam Pal said that the MC commissioner had recently briefed him about the required approvals from the Centre and the MoU would be signed next year after getting these. He also said that he was closley monitoring the project along with senior officials of the UT and MC. Recently, Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) had submitted public investment board (PIB) documents of providing the city with 24x7 water to the ministry of home affairs (MHA). The papers have been circulated to the ministry of external affairs, among others. A meeting led by the secretary, expenditure, under the ministry of finance will soon be held, following which the document will be signed between the department of economic affairs of the ministry and AFD, a French development agency, to obtain the first loan installment for the ambitious project. This May, MC officials announced the project timeline, saying that an agreement would be signed in August/September, tenders floated by October-end and work on the project would be started by February 2022. Officials declared that by December this year, AFD would release Rs 43 crore while EU would release around Rs 9 crore as the first installment for the project. The fact that the MC hasn’t taken all the requisite approvals came to light during the two-day visit of MC commissioner Anindita Mitra to the ministry of home affairs (MHA) in October. Thereafter, Mitra briefed UT adviser Dharam Pal about the status of the project. The AFD is to provide Rs 413 crore to the project in the form of a loan, which is to be repaid in 15 years. The European Union (EU) is also giving a grant of Rs 98 crore to the project. However, before the grant is released, the AFD has to sign the “Credit Facility Agreement” (CFA) with the department of economic affairs (DEA) of the Union ministry of finance. Thereafter, an MoU will be signed between the MC and donor agencies. Box: Foundation stone laid In November, UT administrator Banwarilal Purohit laid the foundation stone of the 24x7 water supply project in Manimajra. The project is to be implemented for Rs 162 crore, including 15-years’ operation and maintenance. The work is expected to be completed by August 2023. Box: Overflowing Issues -There are no generators for power backup at city tubewells despite members recommending installation of power generator on tubewells during the Finance and Contract Committee (F&CC) meeting of 2013. Whenever a power cut was imposed in areas where these tubewells are installed, water supply to the area is stopped -Many areas of the city witness low water pressure especially on upper floors in the summer - The city witnessed waterlogging during rains in different areas. The MC has more than 30,000 road gullies under its jurisdiction and the UT engineering department cleans gullies on roads under its purview such as Madhya Marg and Dakshin Marg. However, residents are sceptical about claims of cleanliness. As part of annual monsoon preparedness, the civic body claimed to have spent Rs 1.25 crore on cleaning of road gullies but almost all major roads of the city were submerged in water during the monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/24x7-water-supply-still-a-pipe-dream-for-chandigarh/articleshow/88110556.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Delhi||North Delhi corporation has no funds for Rs 515 crore bad-air plan||NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has chalked out a detailed action plan costing Rs 515 crore to mitigate air pollution in the long term. Under the plan, Rs 196 crore would be required for operation and maintenance of the existing fleet of mechanised road sweepers for the next five years, including the cost of fuel. The corporations, which clean the city and pick up waste, also operate four waste treatment plants (WTP) with a capacity of five tonnes per day and six WTPs with a capacity of one tonne per day, which require Rs 8.8 crore for the next five years. “The mega plan to mitigate air pollution is ready. Most of the projects are operational, but resources are few. We are not confident of operating the mechanised sweepers and WTPs for long. There is also the requirement of new machinery,” said a north corporation official. The civic body would be paving the roads in Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar and also constructing roads in other areas under its jurisdiction at a cost of Rs 283.9 crore. The existing roads would be improved in Civil Lines, Narela, Keshavpuram, Rohini, Kailash Park, Moti Nagar, Kirti Nagar and Manohar Park in Karol Bagh zone. “Vehicular movement on bad roads causes a lot of dust. As they are full of potholes, they are dangerous for commuters. We will pave the roads to help bring down the dust and make them safer,” said the official. However, execution of the projects remains a problem due to acute shortage of funds. “North corporation is facing a funds crunch. There is a requirement for new equipment. If we do not get financial help soon, the projects could be halted. We are looking at Delhi government for financial aid,” the official added. North Corporation commissioner Sanjay Goel had allocated Rs 1,270 crore in the 2022-23 budget for the Department of Environment Management Services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-has-no-funds-for-rs-515cr-bad-air-plan/articleshow/88111148.cms||---

The boy and his mother even clicked a selfie with the woman’s head, police said. The boy has been detained and his mother arrested. Superintendent of police Nimit Goyal told TOI, “The boy seems to have taken inspiration from a Marathi movie. He beheaded his sister in the kitchen while she was preparing tea for him and his mother. After that, he and the mother took a selfie with the head.” Goyal said the cellphone has been seized but it appears that the mother and son have deleted the picture. “We will send the cellphone for a forensic analysis to recover the picture. It is a crucial piece of evidence,” he said. Preliminary investigations have revealed that the boy and his mother were angry with the woman’s decision to elope and marry. Police said the woman and her husband were friends while together in junior college. Vaijapur’s sub-division police officer Kailash Prajapati said, “The 19-year-old woman, a resident of Goyegaon village, had eloped with the 20-year-old youth in June. Her family had registered a missing complaint. About eight days later, on June 21, she got her marriage registered and the couple turned up at the Vaijapur police station. Since then, she has been staying with her husband in Ladgaon.” Police clarified that though it was not an inter-caste marriage, the boy and his mother had blamed the woman for bringing “disrepute” to the family in society. Police, suspecting it to be a case of a pre-meditated murder, said the woman’s mother had come to meet her about 10 days ago and wept profusely after hugging her. The mother left without saying much, only to return on Sunday with her son. Police said that the woman’s husband was in their three-room house at the time of the incident. He met his wife’s mother and brother and went to another room to rest as he was unwell. As the woman went into the kitchen to prepare tea, her brother followed her and chopped off her head with the sickle. He took the head to his mother for the selfie.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/boy-17-chops-off-sisters-head-for-love-marriage/articleshow/88110044.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Taking note of the “glaring victimisation of trees”, the court has slapped a show-cause notice for contempt against PWD engineers and local SHO of Preet Vihar. “The photographs clearly show that all the aforesaid directions and guidelines have been violated. Prima-facie, the court is of the view that R-1 to R-4 ( PWD engineers and Delhi Police SHO) have committed contempt of court. There is nothing on the record to show that any permission was taken from the tree officer with respect to protection of the trees, especially in view of the aforesaid judicial orders,” justice Najmi Waziri observed in his order that was made public on Saturday. The high court was hearing a plea for contempt against the executive engineers and engineer-in-chief responsible for undertaking PWD construction work in east Delhi on Vikas Marg. During the hearing, advocate Aditya N Prasad urged the court to pre-pone hearing of the matter and take it up urgently since one tree had been chopped off while the other was in danger of being cut down due to the ongoing construction work. The court had earlier posted the plea filed by Neeraj Sharma for February next year. After seeing the photographs the bench took a grim view of the conduct of the officials responsible. “For reasons best known to PWD, a healthy full-grown tree was cut down, as shown in the sequence of photographs. First, the roots of the tree were cut, weakening its foundation and depriving it of essential life sustaining water, minerals and nutrients. Then its branches were hacked-off, crippling it fatally. Lastly, the tree trunk was cut from the base to reduce it to a stump,” an anguished justice Waziri observed in the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-notice-to-pwd-cops-for-glaring-victimisation-of-trees/articleshow/88111152.cms||Abhinav Garg

The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by a woman seeking to quash the detention order passed against her husband T Rajadurai, a resident of Athivetti village in Thanjavur district. The prosecution case was that Rajadurai was running a finance company called Amman Finance. Azarudeen had borrowed Rs 50,000 from him in 2019 at the rate of Rs 500 interest a day. Since Rajadurai was demanding exorbitant interest and threatening him, Azaradeen lodged a police complaint on June 18 and Madukkur police booked Rajadurai under various IPC sections and under Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Charging Exorbitant Interest Act, 2003. The same day, police also registered another case against Rajadurai under IPC sections as well as Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 on the village administrative officer’s (VAO) complaint that Rajadurai had illegally detained four people as bonded labourers in his coconut grove. They included a man, his wife and two sons who were forced to work for just Rs 50 each per day because the man could not repay the Rs 2.70 lakh he borrowed from Rajadurai five years ago. Two years ago, when they escaped, they were brought back and forced to work. Police arrested Rajadurai and remanded him in judicial custody the same day. Subsequently, he was detained under Goondas Act and confined at Trichy central prison. A division bench of Justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran observed that the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Charging Exorbitant Interest Act and Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act were enacted to curb two different aggravated forms of crime which deprived others of wealth and/or liberty. The judges said the investigating officer has recovered nearly 347 sheets of papers signed on plain or stamp papers, executed by several people. This indicates that several people have borrowed money at exorbitant interest from the detenu and executed bonds. Observing that the ramification of the activities of the detenu, if allowed to continue, will certainly cause fear in the minds of the public in the said locality, the judges said there is no sufficient ground to interfere with the detention order and hence dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/no-hc-relief-for-man-who-kept-family-in-bonded-labour-indulged-in-usury/articleshow/88111153.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Dehradun||Calendars with catchy illustrations, QR codes dispense advice on co-existing with leopards in U’khand villages||Dehradun: A leopard may not change its spots, but humans can, to avoid fatal run-ins with the felines. This is the message that is being circulated through pamphlets and calendars, with an aim to sensitise villagers in the hilly areas of Uttarakhand, where leopard attacks are rampant. The state forest department, in collaboration with Doon-based NGO Titli Trust, has come up with the calendars and pamphlets, which have comic-book style illustrations and practical advice in local language about measures to minimise human-leopard conflict. They also feature QR codes that can be scanned to watch small educational videos on how to co-exist with the big cats. The films that the QR codes lead to, titled “Guldar ku Dagduya” (a leopard’s friend) and “Guldar ki Pathshala” (a leopard’s school) are enacted by children in Tehri division, an area where leopard attacks are common. The measures suggested in these advisories include going to school in a group, pruning the bushes outside homes regularly, keeping a bulb on at night, avoiding open defecation etc. “Like our ancestors, villagers must also learn to co-exist with leopards. We have to reluctantly eliminate big cats after they kill a human and villagers demand the animal be killed. This is not a healthy trend. Our programme is about changing the approach of people towards the animals. The videos help one understand a leopard’s behaviour,” said Dhram Singh Meena, former divisional forest officer (DFO) of Narendra Nagar division (Tehri Garhwal district), where the initiative has been started. Uttarakhand has long grappled with the problem of leopard attacks in hill villages. The rising population and shrinking habitat of leopards has of late led to a spike in attacks on humans and cattle. According to the latest survey of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) done in 2018, Uttarakhand is home to at least 800 leopards. In the past 21 years, most deaths and injuries in human-wildlife conflict in the state have been caused by leopards. Every year, on an average, the state records 24 deaths and 50 brutal injuries due to leopard attacks. In 2016, Titli Trust had started a project called “Living with Leopards” in Uttarakhand’s Tehri division. After the efforts resulted in reduced attacks, the project was carried forward by the forest department in Narendra Nagar. In a study the NGO conducted to find out the hotspots of leopard attacks, it was found that Tehri, Pauri, Rudraprayag and Almora districts were the worst affected. “Before 2016, Tehri division had seen an average of at least 13 leopard attacks every year,” said Sanjay Sondhi, founder of Titli Trust. He added that after starting the programme aimed at educating villagers about a leopard’s habits and how to avoid attacks, the casualty figure came down to two-three a year. “Since everyone now has smartphones, we thought to print QR codes on the pamphlets and calendars. The idea is to change the approach of villagers towards leopards from ‘reactive’ to ‘proactive’,” Sondhi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/calendars-with-catchy-illustrations-qr-codes-dispense-advice-on-co-existing-with-leopards-in-ukhand-villages/articleshow/88110576.cms||Shivani Azad

Residents will also protest against Huda officials for not taking any decision on the enhancement issue. A meeting of the general house of residents welfare association, Sector 20, Panchkula was held on Sunday to finalise the action plan against paid parking and to save green belt. Linking of sewerage and storm water pipes as well as recalculation of enhancement was also discussed. Residents passed a resolution criticising Haryana Urban Development Authorities (HUDA) and the MC for not providing proper civil amenities to residents for the last 20 years. Association president K K Jindal said that the RWA would organise a five-day protest dharna from December 18 near the community centre opposite the main market. He said there is also a plan to protest outside the HUDA office on December 22. B B Sharma and Yoginder Kawara, vice-president of the association said that they would mobilise all shopkeepers in the market to participate in the protest. Avinash Malik, general secretary and K K Jaitely, joint secretary of association said that they would intensify the stir if their demands were not met. Residents of the densely populated area said the paid parking system was imposing additional financial burden on residents. They also said that there was rush outside the parking lot as the parking lot was 100 metres from Sector 20 lightpoint and vehicles. MC officials justified the move saying that it was aimed at generating revenue for development work in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sector-20-residents-to-protest-against-mc-over-paid-parking/articleshow/88110577.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Madurai||HC modifies trial court order, finds man abetted suicide||Madurai: Invoking suo motu revision proceedings, Madras high court has modified a trial court order and convicted a man for abetting the suicide of a woman in Dindigul in July 2003. The prosecution case was that a man named Nagarajan entered the house of a woman and tried to outrage her modesty while she was putting her baby to sleep late in the night. The woman’s mother-in-law who saw this scolded Nagarajan who ran away. Ashamed of the incident, the woman poisoned her child and died by suicide the next day. The police registered a case and arrested Nagarajan. In 2015, the Dindigul mahila court held that Nagarajan was not guilty for offence under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of IPC. He was however convicted and sentenced to undergo three years imprisonment for offence under Section 354 (assault or criminal force to a woman with an intent to outrage her modesty) of IPC, and to undergo three months imprisonment for offence under Section 448 (house trespass) of IPC. Challenging the order, Nagarajan filed a criminal appeal before HC Madurai bench in 2015. While the court was considering the petition for suspension of sentence, it found that the trial court had erred in acquitting the accused for offence under Section 306 IPC. Hence, the court initiated suo-motu revision proceedings, which was contested by Nagarajan’s counsel. The court appointed advocate A Thiruvadikumar as amicus curiae to assist it. Referring to Supreme Court judgments, the amicus curiae submitted that according to the provisions of Section 401 of CrPC, high court can exercise the power of suo motu revision. He further submitted that the act of the accused in outraging the modesty of the woman had instigated the victim to die by suicide. Taking cognizance of the submissions, Justice B Pugalendhi said, “The high court as an effective instrument in the administration of criminal justice is dutybound to suo motu act where there is flagrant abuse of law. The nature of offence and the manner of disposal by the trial court has prompted this court to take up the suo motu criminal revision petition for the ultimate social good of the community.” Saying so, the judge convicted and sentenced the man to five years rigorous imprisonment for offence under Section 306 of IPC and three months imprisonment for offence under 448 of IPC. The judge dismissed the criminal appeal preferred by the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-modifies-trial-court-order-finds-man-abetted-suicide/articleshow/88111154.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Gabi, a social worker, was active in providing relief to the needy during the Covid-19 pandemic in sectors 45, 46, 51 areas. He distributed free masks, sanitisers, juice, ration and sanitary pads. Ward residents apprised him that garbage was being dumped on the roads of Sector 45 for the last five years and parks were in bad shape. They complained of problems with water bills, sewerage and rising inflation. Other issues raised included the need to prune trees on time, tackle the stray animal menace and to solve the housing board problem. Gurpreet said that as a resident of the ward himself, he was familiar with the issues people faced due to the faulty policies of the BJP. Gabi has been resident of the ward since 1986. The former international basketball player was elected as president of SD College Students Union with a wide margin. He also served as president of Youth Congress of the State Congress Committee, District President and currently the general secretary of Chandigarh Pradesh Congress Committee. Box: Rebel takes on Bansal Former Congress general secretary Shashi Shankar Tiwari, who resigned from the party as he was not given the ticket, accused former city MP and Congress leader Pawan Kumar Bansal of ditching him.

---||Thane||Thane: Elderly woman, her son booked for assaulting neighbour over noisy renovation||THANE: An elderly woman and her son, who reside in a posh residential complex in the Pokhran area of Thane, have been booked for allegedly assaulting their neighbour for objecting to renovations in their flat in the afternoon, the police informed on Sunday. This sort of incident is becoming common in several housing societies of late, as residents are working from home and are disturbed by civic and construction works in the neighbourhood. Office bearers from several societies said they have been handling such complaints frequently of late. In this case, last week, the complainant had approached her upstairs neighbours in the Courtyard building, objecting to the renovation work being done in the afternoon. “The society has a policy of not allowing renovation work from 2pm to 4pm and post 7pm. However, some work was being done during the prohibited hours,” said a police officer. An argument ensued. “The verbal spat turned ugly as the elderly woman, her son and a relative got aggressive with me, also assaulting me in the elevator when I tried to approach the society management,” said the victim in her complaint registered with the Chitalsar Manpada police. The woman suffered minor injuries for which she was treated at CSM hospital, Kalwa. She later approached the police and registered a complaint. The police said they are investigating the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-sr-citizen-hits-neighbour-over-noisy-renovation/articleshow/88111913.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Delhi||Delhi: Air panel sets up 40 flying squads to track compliance||NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Sunday said it has constituted 40 flying squads to inspect and monitor the compliance of the panel’s anti-pollution measures in Delhi-NCR. Pollution levels in Delhi and its neighbouring cities of Gurgaon, Ghaziabad and Noida have been alarming high in the past one month. The commission had earlier constituted a five-member enforcement task force to supervise the implementation of its directions through flying squads or inspection teams. While 12 teams have been assigned each to the NCR districts of Haryana, UP and Delhi, four have been deputed in the NCR districts of Rajasthan, said the panel. The CAQM said that the task force has been holding exhaustive review meetings with the 40 flying squads, which have been formed for “intensive field-level incognito checks at industrial units, construction and demolition sites, commercial and residential units and air pollution hotspots”. So far, more than 140 sites have been inspected. “Based on the reports furnished by the flying squads, serious violations by various units have been identified for strict action, including closure. Additionally, suitable action against other non-conforming units is also been initiated,” said the commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/air-panel-sets-up40-flying-squads-to-track-compliance/articleshow/88111173.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Woes aplenty for residents of Mukambika Nagar||HUBBALLI: Across the twin cities, one is bound to hear residents of one area complaining about the poor condition of roads, while those in a neighbouring locality may point to the absence of streetlights, while a dysfunctional stormwater drainage (SWD) system may well be the bane of another neighbourhood. Mukambika Nagar in Dharwad, appears to have struck the lottery when it comes to civic problems, with the residents of the locality likely to put a tick mark against not one, but most of the woes plaguing various areas of the twin cities. The residents’ repeated pleas to the authorities to fix their locality’s many problems have gone unheeded, with the protracted administrative paralysis that resulted from the delay in holding elections to the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) Council only adding to their woes. Furthermore, when their problems are acknowledged, and corrective action taken, residents find that the quality of workmanship leaves much to be desired. For instance, a thoroughfare that was repaired lasted not six months. Taking cognisance of the extent of their problems, newly-elected corporator Anitha Chalageri recently undertook a tour of the locality to inspect the situation on the ground. That Mukambika Nagar is not five kilometres from the centre of Dharwad only underscores the apathetic attitude of the authorities towards the plight of the public. Residents pointed to the dysfunctional bulbs adorning many streetlight poles in the area, and said that the elderly and women did not feel secure stepping outside their homes after dusk. Mukambika Nagar resident Sureka Poojar said that most of their problems dated back to three or four years. “The quality of materials used to fix potholes on our roads is of poor quality, which means that they do not last more than six months. Many residents have sustained injuries while travelling along these roads. Elected representatives turn up here only when the elections are round the corner. But none of them has taken a keen interest in solving our many problems,” Sureka said. Anita Chalageri said that she would highlight the problems faced by the Mukambika Nagar residents at the next general body meeting of the HDMC Council. “I will also discuss the situation with the MLA, and ensure that the roads, streetlights and drains in the locality are repaired and functional,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/woes-aplenty-for-residents-of-mukambika-nagar/articleshow/88109945.cms||---

The Christmas and New Year’s week is the biggest revenue spinner for both industries as people get into travel and party mode. But with Omicron’s entry, those with non-emergency travel plans seem to be taking a rain check. Gaurav Choukasey, director of Olive Resorts that has multiple properties in Pench, said, “In Pench, many resorts are either seeing cancellations or delay in confirmation from clients from outside. This was on expected lines because speculation about Omicron is currently more towards the negative side. But in Pench we are a bit lucky as Nagpur is a big market in itself. Being so close to the city, Pench has been the preferred choice for Nagpurians so any business that we lose from outstation clients is being covered by locals.” Sandeep Singh, director of Tribal Camp and Tiger Camp Resorts in Pench, said due to Omicron, guests have started rasing doubts. “Doubts are related to travel requirements and what protocols need to be followed while crossing state borders. There’s uncertainty over what restrictions the government will put in place, and that’s never a good thing for business,” said Singh. Ravi Agrawal gets to see both sides of the tourist spectrum as he owns both a travel agency and two resorts. The director of Voyage Global Journeys said, “By the time we have proper information about Omicron, our travel season will be gone. There has definitely been a major impact on bookings because many have put their plans on hold. People want to travel, but nobody wants to get stuck because of protocols which may come into effect in the near future.” Travel Agents’ Association of India’s (TAAI) Nagpur chapter chairman Rajesh Agrawal said the state government’s flip-flop in policy is scaring travellers. “First Maharashtra said RT-PCR will be mandatory regardless of the vaccine status. Then they changed it after facing the heat from various stakeholders. More than the virus, it is the state government’s confusing stance that’s hurting our business. People don’t want to move out of the state because upon their return might end up facing some unreasonable rules,” said Agrawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/omicron-bug-may-spoil-ny-eve-party-for-resorts-travel-firms/articleshow/88111155.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Chandigarh||Dreaded gangster, contract killer arrested||Barinderjit.saluja Mohali: Police have arrested Rajinder, a dreaded gangster and habitual contract killer who goes by the name of Joker in the underworld. He was also arrested in 2017 in a contract killing and extortion case targeting a local businessman. Joker was one of the three arrested and 33 accused booked by the Mohali police in 2017. Joker alias Rajinder has five cases of contract killing and extortion against him. He was hired to kill a Baltana-based businessman in 2017 and this time, he was involved in an incident of firing at Madanpura. During his police remand, police failed to extract concrete information in the Madanpura attempt to murder case. “Police only learned that the Madanpura incident was also a contract killing, in which rivalry between two gangs led to contract killing for the other. However, the other gang member escaped the bid on his life,” said a senior police officer. Police said that in 2017, Joker hatched a conspiracy to kill a Baltana-based businessman while he was lodged in Ropar jail. According to police files, Rohit Madhok, a resident of Baltana, had hired contract killers Rajinder, alias Joker and Rohit to murder Baltana-based Ajay Jain in April 2017 over business rivalry. Ajay was killed. Thereafter, Kuldeep, 24, a resident of Ambala city, contacted Rohit and Joker through Facebook, where they conspired to extort money from businessman Sudhir Gupta, relative of the murder victim, Ajay Jain. After his arrest, Kuldeep confessed to demanding protection money from Sudhir Gupta on September 15, 2017 and then shooting at him on the night of September 26 on the directions of Rohit and Joker, who were then lodged in Ropar jail. They were brought on production warrant by Zirakpur police, who arrested them. The first call for protection money was made on the evening of September 15, 2017, which was rejected by Sudhir. A few days later, another call was made for ransom, after which Kuldeep was supposed to collect the money. On the evening of September 26, when Sudhir and his brother were going towards Chatt village, Kuldeep chased them and allegedly fired a gun shot. Sudhir managed to dodge the bullet and later lodged a police complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dreaded-gangster-contract-killer-arrested/articleshow/88110612.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

M Sivakumar of Thirumoolar street on Kulamangalam Main road says the roads are so bad that taxis, autos and water tankers refuse to enter them. “Our roads were already bad and the rains have made them worse. We do not know for how long we can live in these conditions,’’ he said. Their old pipelines were removed about a week ago after installing new ones about three weeks ago, but they are yet to get water. “Water tankers also do not bring water and people supplying bubble tops also refuse to come into our roads,’’ said Rajakumari, another resident. Same is the condition of Kabambar street, Kabilar street, Thiruvalluvar street, Banar street and Sundaranar street in this ward. “Sometimes when one road is damaged in a ward, we can take the other ones, but here all the roads are unmotorable,’’ said Manikandan, a resident.  Muniyandikoil street is so bad with water stagnating for so long that mosquitoes have started breeding, said Kumaresan, a resident of Alangulam. With Madurai corporation announcing that repair of roads would be taken up at a cost of Rs 60 crore, residents of Alangulam are hoping that roads in their ward are also included in it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/alangulams-woes-bad-roads-no-drinking-water/articleshow/88111170.cms||---

The village administrative officer received information that a portion of the ilmenite stocks kept in the sealed godown of V V Minerals was being illegally transported to V V Titanium Pigments Private Limited. Based on the VAO’s complaint, Sipcot police on August 20 registered a case for offences under several sections including Section 21 (4) of Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. The lorries, the empty gunny bags and 39 tonnes of the mineral sand were seized. Justice G R Swaminathan said that in 2017, the state government had appointed special teams to estimate the actual quantum of beach sand minerals stacked at various places in Tuticorin district pursuant to the direction of the first bench of the Madras high court. It is not in dispute that the entire stock was kept in a sealed godown and till date, permission has not been granted for removing the mineral stored therein. The judge rejected the contention of the company which sought to quash the FIR primarily on the ground that its registration was not preceded by any preliminary inquiry. The judge said that the information lodged by the VAO contained an allegation that there was theft of beach mineral from a sealed godown. Theft is a cognizable offence. Therefore, the police had no option but to register the FIR. The judge said the Supreme Court in a recent decision has laid down a set of parameters to govern the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr PC. It has been laid down that investigation ought not be scuttled at the initial stage. The judge said that the accused has not produced any public document of sterling and unimpeachable quality. That apart, the investigation is at a very early stage. Hence, the judge dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-quash-fir-for-transporting-seized-minerals-dismissed/articleshow/88111161.cms||---

This followed the video of three men thrashing the helpless animal to death circulating on social media on Saturday. The black and white dog was seen wagging its tail as the trio unleashed a series of blows with logs till it became motionless. The accused then dragged its body along Musalaikulam road much to the shock of as passersby and animal lovers. The cruelty was recorded by a man on his mobile phone. Police identified the trio as I Sundar alias Das, 30, and his friends S Isakkimuthu, 37, and P Kumari, 32, from Peikulam. Inquiry revealed that the dog had attacked Das’s goat a few days ago which prompted the trio to kill it. Tuticorin SP S Jayakumar said a team from Sathankulam police station picked them up and brought them to the station for inquiry. Based on a complaint by the sub inspector, the trio was booked under various sections of IPC and The Prevention of Cruelty to Animal Act, 1960. Lakshmi Arun, an animal welfare activist, said similar killing of community dogs by shepherds by beating or poisoning them has been happening in Tirunelveli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/2-held-for-beating-dog-to-death/articleshow/88111176.cms||---

The way the British library of Nainital was closed down, these lamp posts, too, were reduced to mere showpieces around the lake.

She took a swipe at the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, terming it a mere wish list. She was speaking at a discussion at the Youth Parliament of India 3.0 organized in Gandhinagar. “NEP 2020 is a great wish list for what education should be,” she said. “Till we have motivation, a plan, and a way of implementing the plan, it will remain a wish list.” But Gujarat education minister Jitu Vaghani said that with the improved quality of education and infrastructure, nearly 4 lakh students in Gujarat of private schools have taken admission in government-run schools. “Gujarat has about 33,000 primary schools run by the government,” Vaghani said. “We have recently launched a Command and Control Centre to supervise government schools. Officials from other states visit Gujarat to learn about it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sans-plan-nep-is-wish-list-aap-leader-atishi-marlena-tells-students-at-an-ahmedabad-university/articleshow/88110606.cms||---

The gangster, Damanpreet Singh alias Dhillon Preet has been taken on police remand. State special operation police (SSOC) had taken Damanpreet on remand in another case of Arms Act but he was actually taken on remand for interrogation in the Vicky Middhukhera murder case, sources in Mohali police said. Sources added that the SSOC had taken other dreaded gangsters, Yudhvir Jodha, Tawinder Singh alias Sunny, Lovepreet Singh alias Lambu, Sukhjinder Singh alais Sukh and Navpreet Singh alias Navi in remand and they would now be made to sit face-to-face for interrogation in the Middukhera case. Police suspect that the contract killings are in the knowledge of these gangsters and under their command. The previous interrogation of six gangsters in remand and 55 small-time gangsters yielded no results. Mohali police interrogated Rohit, Amit Dagar, Kaushal Chaudhary, Sukhpreet Singh alias Buddha, Aman Jaittu and Bhupi Rana but the exercise was futile as Middukhera killers remain at large. Interrogation of Kaushal Chaudhary revealed the names of Sajjan Singh alias Bhola and Anil Kumar alias Latth, who killed Middukhera. Kaushal told the police that he and Amit Dagar liaised with Armenia-based gangster Gaurav Padial and gave the contacts of Sajjan Singh alias Bhola and Anil Kumal alias Latth to further let out the contract to kill Middukhera. Sajjan Singh alias Bhola and Anil Kumar alias Latth are absconding, he said. Sajjan Singh belongs to Jhajjar in Haryana and Anil Kumar is active in Delhi. They shot dead Vicky Middukhera in Sector 71 on August 7 as he was coming out of a property dealer’s office and sitting in his SUV.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/middukhera-murder-cops-take-another-gangster-on-remand/articleshow/88110637.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

---||Ahmedabad||‘Only 2.47L persons with disabilities have UDID cards in Gujarat’||Ahmedabad: There are about 12 lakh persons with disabilities in Gujarat, but only 2.47 lakh persons have the Unique Disability ID (UDID) cards. The UDID cards are mandatory for persons with disability to avail various government schemes. Providing details of the reach of schemes meant for those with disabilities, development worker Deepa Sonpal, said that according to official figures, 2,47,174 persons with disabilities in Gujarat have received the UDID cards. “However the number of persons with disabilities in Gujarat is pegged to be around 12 lakh,” she said. Activists and development workers participated in a virtual meeting on the occasion of international day for persons with disabilities. The meeting discussed issues concerning rights of persons with disabilities and the use of the Right To Information Act. Pankti Jog, convener of Mahiti Adhikar Gujarat Pahel, said that there are a number of issues that act as impediments for people with disabilities to get UDID cards. “It is often not easy for persons with disabilities to get doctor certificates, as their mobility is severely hampered because of disability. Persons with disabilities cannot avail of any of the government schemes without UDID cards,” she said.  The government has set a criterion that a person can avail of schemes meant for disabled persons if he or she has 40% or more disability. Activists said that the most disenfranchised lot in terms of access to the electoral system are persons with disabilities. “People will have to work towards ensuring that persons with disabilities get access to the election system,” Sonpal said. Other activists said that while the state government runs an elaborate exercise called ‘Gunotsav’ to gauge the scholastic progress of students, there is no mechanism to measure the progress made by specially abled children in schools. “The government spends a lot of money on schemes for disabled persons,but it is necessary to ensure that the right persons avail of these benefits,”said Praveena Mehta, who works among students with disabilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/only-2-47l-persons-with-disabilities-have-udid-cards-in-gujarat/articleshow/88110638.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Glitches mar IIFT entrance in Nagpur, parents seek re-exam||NAGPUR: Many students appearing for the entrance exam of Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) MBA in Nagpur faced a lot technical problems leading to chaos on Sunday. A group of parents has filed a written complaint both with the centre and the exam conducting body — National Testing Agency (NTA) — seeking re-exam. Vineet Joshi (IAS), chairman of NTA, said, “We will seek a report from the Nagpur centre and then take further action in consultation with the IIFT. We will take whatever corrective measures needed to ensure that students don’t suffer.” While the parents may have a genuine concern and seek immediate redressal, the NTA has to follow protocol and seek details from the centre before reaching any conclusion. Till the time of filing this report, no other centre had reported technical issues of this scale. At some places, the exam started late, but students were able to complete it properly. However, for the group of parents in Nagpur, things did not go so smoothly. Tushar Deshmukh, a parent, said, “The exam started, but the answers were not registering. At the same time, the clock kept on ticking and ultimately the test timed out,” said Deshmukh. Parents say the NTA must conduct re-exam for these students. “Exam was not held in West Bengal today because of the cyclone Jawad. So, exam for students here can also be conducted later,” reasoned Deshmukh. Over two dozen parents have signed the complaint and pointed out that this technical problem also resulted in logistical challenges for the students. The letter mentioned that Nagpur serves as a centre for some neighbouring districts and even for Chhattisgarh. “So many people travelled for hours just to reach the centre and the problems faced added to the anxiety. Once such things happen, students get disturbed and are not in the right frame of mind to appear for exams,” said a parent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/glitches-mar-iift-entrance-in-ngp-parents-seek-re-exam/articleshow/88111186.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Their commitment and efforts are paying off, as reflected by their success in protecting the teeming wildlife in the thick jungle and the conspicuous absence of illegal activities in and around the reserve. Recently, the foresters nabbed one of the three members of a gang that is involved in smuggling of sandalwood. They also confiscated sandalwood logs that were in possession of the accused, along with sharp weapons. The forest is spread across an area of 650sqkm, and the only way that its bounteous resources can be protected is by remaining vigilant round-the-clock. Meanwhile, foresters are on the lookout for the other two members of the gang, while a police complaint has also been lodged in connection with the incident. Notwithstanding the handicap of staff shortage, foresters at Nagarahole have been immensely successful in safeguarding the forest. Six months ago, a gang was nabbed red-handed with sandalwood logs. Foresters who attempted to nab the gang were compelled to fire at the members, who tried to attack them.  However, the foresters have come under attack for the recent arrest of members of a tribal community. The foresters alleged that the controversy surrounding the incident was part of a campaign being orchestrated by a syndicate involved in crimes in the forest. Some of the foresters suspected the involvement of prominent personalities in this syndicate.  Nagarahole Tiger Reserve director D Mahesh Kumar said that they had stepped up vigilance across the forest to clamp down on those involved in the felling and smuggling of sandalwood trees. “In the recent incident wherein, we nabbed one of the miscreants with sandalwood logs, we found sharp weapons in their possession. We are currently in the process of locating the place where the miscreants felled the sandalwood trees. We have stepped up vigilance in the wake of this incident,” he said.  Mahesh Kumar added that an investigation had been ordered to ascertain the identity of the head honcho whom they suspected of masterminding the many criminal activities inside the forest. “There is the possibility of locals and members of tribal communities being lured into this racket with the promise of paltry sums and alcohol. Only a thorough probe will help uncover the truth. We are also looking into the possibility of this syndicate operating in other protected forests,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/vigilant-foresters-at-nagarahole-clamp-down-on-sandalwood-smugglers/articleshow/88110407.cms||Lawrence Milton
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra fails to hike no-helmet fine despite 4,800 deaths last year||MUMBAI: The state government's decision to not hike fines for helmet and seat belt violations despite Maharashtra reporting a high number of fatal crashes involving helmetless riders has been severely criticised by activists and transport experts. It is pertinent to note that other States have not diluted the provisions and raised traffic fines as per the amended Act. In 2020, Maharashtra police data shows that of the 11,569 casualties in crashes, 42% were motorcyclists not wearing helmets. The victims included 3,368 riders and 1,510 pillions. Three years ago, in 2018, the state stood second as far as deaths of motorcyclists were concerned -- 5938 persons killed. A guide to using penalties to improve road safety by non-profit group, Global Road Safety Partnership (GRSP), says it's important that risker and more dangerous behaviours result in more severe penalties. In this way, the severity of the penalty is aligned to the level of danger imposed on the community by the person breaking the law. " "If the state does not update fine amounts over time, then technically it is reducing them as inflation rises," said Ranjit Gadgil, Programme Director at the non-profit, Parisar. He added that a wrong message goes out to motorists. "By not updating fines, the government seems to indicate that helmet and seat-belt violations are not that important. This is contrary to data which shows a high number of fatal crashes and fatalities as a result of not wearing helmets," Gadgil added. Studies have shown that use of helmets reduces risk of death by about 42%. Similarly, among drivers and front-seat passengers, seat belts reduce the risk of death by 45%, and cut the risk of serious injury by 50%. A senior RTO official said he was surprised by the government decision. "In fact, we have made it mandatory for motorcycle dealers to give two helmets to buyers- one for the rider and the other for the pillion," he said, adding that children above four years of age should also wear helmets. While the government notification mentions the possibility of a three-month driving licence suspension for a helmetless rider, there is no clarity on how this will be implemented. Most of the enforcement happens via surveillance cameras and challans are sent after checking the vehicle numberplate against RTO records. "But the driver who has broken the law need not be the owner of the vehicle, in which case the owner would be incorrectly challaned. There needs to be a balance between enforcement on the street and via cameras. There also has to be a mechanism for immediate recovery of fines as driver behaviour is influenced not only by the quantum of the fine but also the surety of getting caught and the certainty of having to pay the fine immediately," said Gadgil. A senior Mantralaya official said the state government felt the existing fine of Rs 500 for these violations was already high and increasing it to Rs 1,000 as proposed by the Centre would be "too harsh." "The objective of a helmet should not be to protect you from fines, but to actually save your life," said Dr Rita Sawla working in the field of emergency medical care. "The helmet should be ISI approved, should properly fit your head, and should be replaced from time to time. Every helmet has an expiry date and a worn out helmet is as dangerous as not having one while riding a bike," she added. In the past, motorcyclists from cities like Pune and Mumbai have protested against helmet use. Transport activist Gaurang Vora has demanded that the state government take urgent steps to update the fine amounts.

All of its 12,376 eligible employees had taken the first dose earlier. Around 91% of the family members of SECR employees (14,080) have received the first dose while 70% (10,780) have now been administered the second dose too, with divisional railway manager Maninder Uppal having started door-to-door vaccine campaign on the lines of NMC’s ‘har ghar dastak’ at the railway colonies located in different places. Uppal also set up eight well-equipped vaccine centres across the division to ensure that the employees get the vaccine close to their working station. “We brought the vaccine either at the doorsteps of family members or near employees’ workplace as a part of the ‘ease of vaccine’ vision,” said Uppal, who ran 15 ‘worker special’ trains to get employees and their families vaccinated at locations across Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh when the jab stocks dried up in Maharashtra. While in the Central Railway, 97% have received the first dose and 81% the second dose out of the 15,691 employees, Uppal doggedly pursued the 100% completion of vaccine doses for SECR employees. “We extensively used technology to reach the employees at different strata. Digital platforms were utilised to coax, counsel and convince them to get the jab. Unions too were approached to embrace our vision of 100% vaccination,” said Uppal. The senior railway official had set up a 30-bed Covid care centre in Motibagh with 10 doctors for SECR employees, apart from empanelling 54 hospitals for specialized treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/secr-gets-99-staff-fully-vaxxed/articleshow/88111194.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Madurai||Tomato prices rise again, cross Rs 100/kg in Madurai||MADURAI: Tomato prices once again crossed Rs 100/kg in the retail markets in Madurai, and customers who asked for less than a quarter of a kilogram had to pay Rs 20/100g at a few shops. The price of tomatoes goes up during the monsoons, and this year, owing to the continuous rain for more than a month, the price of many vegetables including tomatoes have fluctuated between Rs 70 and Rs 120/kg. “I have stopped making tomato rice and tomato chutney because it takes about half a kg for a family of four and it is too expensive,” said K Saradha of KK Nagar. Pandi, a shopkeeper at Gomathypuram, had kept his box of tomatoes inside his shop, instead of displaying it at the entrance. “They have become costly, and people keep moving them from top to bottom and they can get damaged. Now, I am picking it for them, because I bought a box of 15 kg for Rs 1,400 on Sunday, whereas I only pay about Rs 700 for it, when there is a good supply,’’ he said. Ellamma, a street vendor at Anna Nagar, said that she had bought two kilograms of tomatoes, and was selling 100g for Rs 20, because people have stopped buying larger quantities for the past few weeks. “Tomatoes spoil fast and cannot be kept for long,” she said. K L Kumar, president of Madurai Hotel Owners’ Association, says that they set aside budgets for all functions in hotels, when the price of vegetables fluctuates, as their profit margins drop, but they do not compromise in the welfare of the customers. President of the Madurai Central Vegetable Market P S Murugan said that the supplies had dropped and they were getting less than half of their usual supply of tomatoes due to rain in other states such as Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The wholesale price was between Rs 80 and Rs 90 on Sunday, and it will cross Rs 100 in the retail market, he said. “During the peak season, we even get tomatoes from the neighbouring districts of Dindigul and Theni, but now those tomatoes do not come,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tomato-prices-rise-again-cross-rs-100/kg-in-madurai/articleshow/88111188.cms||---
---||Madurai||As supply dips, jasmine sells at Rs 2,500/kg in Madurai||MADURAI: The price of jasmine flower spiked to Rs 2,500 per kg at the Madurai Central Flower market at Matuthavani on Sunday as there was a drastic drop in supply even as the demand for the flower is high. During the peak season, the market receives even 5T of jasmine, but now it was getting less than 500kg. Madurai Meenakshi Sundareswarar Flower Market Association president S Ramachandran said that the prices would continue to rise in the coming days as the pilgrimage and wedding seasons are in progress. Thirupathi, a farmer who cultivates jasmine, said that the production drops during the winter season every year and they usually use this season to prepare their crops for next year’s production. However, conventional farmers usually make good use of the winter season as the flowers fetch a good price, but this year the rains have turned most of the buds soggy and water has inundated the farms in many places leading to drop in supply to the markets. T Jayakumari, who has a family wedding soon, said that their budget for flowers alone crossed Rs 50,000 something that they had not anticipated. “Madurai weddings cannot happen without the famous jasmine,” she said. The price of other flowers also went up in the market. Pitchi and mullai are being sold for Rs 800 per kg, button rose for Rs 250 per kg, sampangi for Rs 150 per kg and a single lotus at Rs 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/as-supply-dips-jasmine-sells-at-rs-2500/kg-in-madurai/articleshow/88111187.cms||---

The pay scales, due since January 1, 2016, have still not been given to more than 20,000 teachers working in state universities of Punjab and their affiliated colleges, around 400 in number. Protesting teachers said that the large workforce had been deprived of the financial benefits of revised payscales rightfully due to them without any reason at a time when the entire country, with the exception of Punjab, had implemented the recommendations of the 7th CPC. According to the protesting teachers, all representations to the administration and political dispensations in the state had fallen on deaf ears, forcing them to boycott all academic, administrative and extracurricular duties from December 1, 2021. To draw the attention of the state government towards this injustice, Dr H S Kingra, president, Punjab Federation of University and College Teachers Organisations (PFUCTO) is sitting on fast-unto-death at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana since December 1.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Over 300 people skipped Covid jab for religious reasons||Thiruvananthapuram: Over 300 persons in the city have skipped Covid vaccine due to religious reasons and nearly 5,000 persons have not been vaccinated due to lack of awareness, as per the preliminary findings of the Covid vaccination survey undertaken by the city corporation. The survey which was undertaken over a period of two months looked mainly at five aspects; those who have missed the vaccination due to ignorance or lack of awareness, those who are aware but have not been able to access the vaccination centres, persons who have skipped vaccination due to religious reasons, those with health issues and those persons who are away from the city for job related reasons or other causes. It also covered persons who could not get vaccinated due to hospitalization or because the schedule was not due. The corporation officials said that updation of data collected from each ward is now going on since the survey was mostly done in October and November. Focus is mainly on people who have not been vaccinated due to religious reasons and people who skipped vaccines due to lack of knowledge. `` As regarding other factors, numbers may have varied over the last two months. That’s why we are updating data at the ground level,” an official said. Going by the present figures available with the city corporation, about 305 persons did not get vaccinated due to religious reasons and 4,940 persons in the city were unaware about vaccination. About 14,507 residents in the city either had health concerns or were scared to take Covid vaccination. The data compilation of the survey was affected by disparity in figures of the number of Covid infected people within the city as per the survey and the figures available with the health department. The survey teams reported that many houses which had Covid infected residents were either locked or people had shifted to other places; which resulted in difference in figures. About 1,68,850 households were surveyed as part of the drive and 6.5 lakh residents were covered in the survey. The city corporation had planned to kick-start the survey on September 15 and planned to complete it by September 30. However, surveys could not be initiated in all the wards simultaneously due to which the survey teams had not been able to meet the target. In addition to this, non-co-operation of some residents to the survey had been another challenge for the team. Each ward was allotted survey teams comprising 10 members. The corporation planned to prepare a data bank of people who have been vaccinated and those who are yet to be vaccinated for various reasons. Based on this data, the corporation will organise vaccination camps in respective wards so that the civic body can attain the target of becoming a fully vaccinated corporation in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/over-300-people-skipped-covid-jab-for-religious-reasons/articleshow/88096795.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Health officials said his sample has been sent to Pune to ascertain if it is the Omicron variant. According to health officials, the 43-year-old man and his family of four travelled from Singapore to Madurai airport via Sri Lanka. Since Sri Lanka was a non-high risk country for Omicron variant, the man and his family members took the rapid antigen test at Madurai airport and left for Nagercoil on Saturday after they tested negative. However, when the family reached Nagercoil on Saturday evening, they came to know that he tested Covid-19 positive in his RT-PCR test. Kanyakumari district health officials, who were notified of the same, immediately admitted him to Kanyakumari Government Medical College Hospital, Asaripallam, and his samples were sent to test for Omicron variant. The family members as well as the driver who travelled with them have meanwhile been quarantined and are being monitored. A health official in Kanyakumari said that another US returnee who was in the district had also tested Covid-19 positive but was found to be negative for Omicron variant. Meanwhile, officials said that vigil has been stepped up at borders of the district. “Those who arrive from Thiruvananthapuram airport are tested before they are allowed to cross the border. Further, when any international traveller from other districts who test Covid-19 positive enter the district, we are immediately notified for contact tracing and we will be monitoring them,” said the health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/singapore-returnee-tests-covid-19-ve/articleshow/88111196.cms||---

As many as 65 shops have been constructed in a very organized way in the KV corridor. Besides these shops, the KV Dham will also have mega emporiums in Mandir Chowk area selling tribal, ODOP and traditional handicraft items, artefacts of tribal arts, one district one product (ODOP) scheme items and other traditional arts of different parts of the country. In the allotment of shops, the Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board will give priority to the shop owners, who had to leave Vishwanath Gali, when buildings were purchased and razed for widening of the access way. Several Yatri Suvidha Kendras (tourist facility centres) have been set up in KV Dham for visitors from across the nation and abroad, while the shops and lanes have been numbered block-wise for easy access. The space for mega emporiums has been created on the upper floor of Mandir Chowk. Divisional commissioner and SKVSADB chairman Deeepak Agrawal said, “Around 65 shops have been constructed in KV Dham premises. Once the model for revenue generation for maintenance and operations of establishments in KVD is finalised by London based MNC Ernst & Young, the price for allotment of each shops will become clear.” The allotment of shops will be done on first come first serve basis, said Agrawal adding that the shop owners, who had to leave Vishwanath Gali market during the process of removal of purchased buildings for the project, will be given first priority if they are ready to pay the price for the shop. Space for stalls at the mega emporiums in Mandir Chowk building will also be allotted on the same lines, he said mentioning these emporiums will showcase the tribal arts, handicrafts and handlooms prepared under ODOP.

---||Goa||After guv’s approval, govt starts conceptualising new Raj Bhavan||Panaji: After securing governor P S Sreedharan Pillai’s approval for the construction of a new Raj Bhavan, the state government has started preliminary discussions on how the new Raj Bhavan should be. The state government held its first meeting to discuss the construction of a new Raj Bhavan, though it is yet to start the process of identifying land for the purpose. The meeting discussed the concept of the new Raj Bhavan and the kind of facilities it will need. Pillai had accepted the state government’s proposal for a new Raj Bhavan in October and had said that he had gone through the objections raised when the proposal was put before the governor’s office earlier. “Our chief minister has put a proposal before me for a Raj Bhavan as a (new) residence of the governor and to make this ancient, prestigious Raj Bhavan open to the public as a monument. I accept the offer of the chief minister,” Pillai had said. On August 1, 2020, former governor Satya Pal Malik rejected the state’s proposal to construct a new Raj Bhavan. He had written a strong letter to Sawant and said that it was “irrational and imprudent” to even think of it when the state is reeling under an acute financial crisis amid the pandemic. Malik had also clarified to Sawant that “his requirement for functioning as a governor is very limited and he does not require any new Raj Bhavan building per se”. On July 24, 2020, Sawant, after a meeting with chief secretary Parimal Rai and PWD principal chief engineer Uttam Parsekar, had told TOI that PWD had said it was difficult to maintain the (current) Raj Bhavan, and hence, the state government was in the process of identifying land for a new Raj Bhavan, and it would be tendered by April 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-guvs-approval-govt-starts-conceptualising-new-raj-bhavan/articleshow/88111237.cms||---

Instead, they ensured withdrawal of cases against those terrorists,” he said. After laying foundation of new projects and inaugurating projects worth Rs 30.02 crore at a public meeting at Baba Kinaram Inter College ground in Ramgarh area of Sakaldiha in Chandauli district on Sunday, Yogi launched a fulsome attack on the opposition, especially SP. “Had they understood the definition of family correctly, they would not have made personal attacks on me on the issue of family. For me, the entire 25 crore population of UP is my family and I work for their development,” said Yogi. Taking jibe on the previous alliances of opposition parties, the CM said, “Kahan gayee Bhai-Behan (Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra), Do Ladko ki (Rahul and Akhilesh) aur Babua-Bua (Akhilesh-Mayawati) ki jodiyan (Where have brother-sister, two boys and nephew- aunt pairs gone). They could never ensure development because they don’t have the vision for it.” Yogi added, “Instead of constructing roads, providing power, water, facilities for food grain purchase from farmers, they spoiled the lives of common man only filled their own treasures.” “There was SP goverment in the state four times, but they were capable only of opening fire on Ram Bhakts and did not initiate action against the terrorists who attacked Ram Janmabhoomi. Later, they also decided to withdraw cases against the terror attack accused,” the CM said. On coming to power, the opposition parties only promoted casteism and imperialism, said Yogi adding that entire recruitment process of government jobs was rigged by corrupt practices in their regime. “Today, the opposition has no issues as the BJP government is spending the money for development and upgrading facilities at religious and spiritual centres,” said Yogi. The ministers in previous governments used to sexually harass women, patronized criminals and mafia elements but today the empires of mafia are being bulldozed, he added. Regarding Sakaldiha assembly seats, which was won by SP in 2017, Yogi said that had the people not committed this error, this area would also have witnessed development like other three assembly segments of Chandauli district. Recalling his previous visit to lay foundation of medical college in the name of Baba Kinaram, he highlighted how his government ensured opening of 33 new medical colleges across the state to boost health sector in UP, which had only 12 colleges till 2017. The birthplace of Baba Kinaram in Ramgarh will be developed as prime spiritual site under the project of tourism department, he said. Highlighting the achievements of his government and schemes like free ration for poor families till Holi, Yogi said the menace of criminals and mafia elements has been checked in the state and the Covid pandemic was controlled effectively due to which celebration of festivals like Dussehra, Diwali and Chhath became possible. The CM also appealed to those people who have not taken the vaccine yet to get vaccinated at the earliest as it would also help to check the menace of Omicron, the new variant of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/25-crore-population-of-up-my-family-cm-yogi/articleshow/88111199.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Delhi||Delhi Police bust extortion racket being run from Mandoli jail||NEW DELHI: An extortion racket being run from Mandoli Jail was busted by Crime Branch on Sunday. Three people have been arrested in the case. Investigators claimed that the accused were demanding money from builders and businessmen by calling them from inside the jail. Their associates, who were outside the jail, used to threaten the victims until the extortion money was paid. Last month, Jasmeet Singh, a property dealer in Lajpat Nagar, received a call from a person, purportedly gangster Parveen Sabharwal, demanding Rs 20 lakh. A probe revealed that on November 23 Jasmeet received a call on his mobile number, which he disconnected. Two days later, a person went to his office where his partner Harpal and office boy Bala were present. This person told Harpal to talk to a person calling from jail. “Harpal and Bala tried to stop this man. During the ensuing scuffle, he dropped a country-made pistol and fled. Later, one Abhishek Masih was arrested from Laxmi Nagar. Masih confessed that he and one Rohit Singh had gone to Jasmeet’s office with a country-made pistol last month,” said an officer. ACP (Crime) Dheeraj Kumar said they arrested Rohit from Sheikh Sarai. “Further investigation revealed that Masih was receiving instructions on his mobile phone from one Aakash, who was lodged in Mandoli Jail in a murder case,” he added. Aakash and Sabharwal, a member of the Neeraj Bawania gang, who was arrested by Special Cell last September, were running an extortion racket from the jail. “Sabharwal carried a reward of Rs one lakh. One Shibbu, who provided weapons to Rohit, was arrested from Sangam Vihar. Shibbu got the delivery of the pistol from one Nitesh under the directions of Aakash,” the officer said. Police are probing how the inmate had access to a mobile phone inside the jail, said sources||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-bust-extortion-racket-being-run-from-mandoli-jail/articleshow/88111198.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Gender sensitisation for public vehicle drivers||KOLKATA: From Tuesday, Kolkata Police is likely to roll out a three-month long gender sensitisation programme “This Car Respects Women” aims to train 12,500 drivers of app cabs, taxis, autos and buses. The training module will address sexual harassment and violence against women and try to teach the drivers how to behave with female passengers properly. Kolkata Police commissioner Soumen Mitra is likely to start the session on December 7, which will end on March 15 next year. The drivers will be asked to attend two sessions — the duration of each session is 75 minutes. Cops are roping in psychiatrists, college lecturers and experts on gender issues to conduct 250 such training sessions till mid-March. Each gender sensitization training programme (GSTP) will have 50 participants while each of the 25 traffic guards in Kolkata will organise 10 such programmes. TimesViewSocietal mores have changed but not uniformly across classes; this leads to conflicts and, often, the issue ends up at police stations. This was sorely needed.The training will be part of the Nirbhaya Fund allocated by the Union ministry of women and child development. Initiated in 2015, this project seeks to ensure the security and safety of women. This project is likely to cost around 1.7 crore. In Kolkata, there have been six molestation attempts on buses since 2019 while at least eight serious allegations like molestation and rude behaviour by app cab drivers and app bike riders were reported. “While the basic course will remain the same, the trainers will communicate with the participants in a simple language. A lot of audio-visual aids will be used. In addition, we are designing special caps, T-shirts, and logos, all of which will give the programme its recall value. The drivers will be awarded certificates at the end of the training,” said an officer. The training will be officially launched from the southeast traffic guard, followed by the east guard. “A key concern area is how to make a woman comfortable while she is travelling. It is also about responding to the women passengers in distress,” the officer added. Indrajyoti Sengupta, a motivational speaker, associated with the KP Pronam initiative, is slated to take the first session at the southeast guard on Tuesday. Kolkata’s transport workers will not be the first ones to undergo this training. More than 10,000 bus drivers and conductors of Haryana Roadways are undergoing such training by a private university,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/gender-sensitisation-for-public-vehicle-drivers/articleshow/88110646.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Chandigarh||Heart transplants erratic in PGI as poor outcomes clog success||Shimona.Kanwar@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: So far, PGI has had only six heart transplants, least among all other organ transplants, including kidney, liver, pancreas and cornea since 2013. Out of 18 hearts retrieved in the institute, 12 were sent to other hospitals for transplant. Sources attributed the slow pace of heart transplants at PGI to low success rate. Among the previous transplants, the first patient died before being discharged from hospital, while the other two survived for three years and three months. “The almost 50% success rate in this transplant surgery has not been very motivating for surgeons,” a faculty said. The recent heart transplant was done during the pandemic last year, when a 10-year-old brain dead girl from Kharar, Mohali donated her heart and other organs to a 13-year-old boy. “Consistent efforts have to be made for any such programme to continue. As it is a highly complex surgery, there is high risk of rejection. But when the benefits outweigh the risks, one must go ahead without feeling discouraged,” said a senior faculty, adding, “Else, it will discontinue soon.” PGI also has plans to start lung and intestine transplant surgeries. AIIMS has had over 70 heart transplants since 1994. According to PGI data, organs transplanted and shared with other hospitals include Kidney-4,365 (live: 3,895, deceased: 470); Liver - 82 ; Heart-18; Pancreas-28 and Cornea-8,463. According to published studies, the average heart transplantation rate in India is 0.14 per million population (pmp) versus in 2019 compared to more than 10 per million in the US. Moreover, around 88% of heart transplant patients survive the first year post-surgery, while five-year survival rate is 75% and 10-year survival rate is 56%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/heart-transplants-erratic-in-pgi-as-poor-outcomes-clog-success/articleshow/88110650.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: ‘Bar-to-wheels’ drive books 42 motorists||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Police has launched ‘bar-to-wheels’ to conduct drink-driving tests across the pubbing zones in EM Bypass and other parts of the city. Anyone coming out of a bar and riding a bike or driving a car will be checked with the help of a breathalyzer, This will help cops find whether the person at the wheels exceeds the prescribed alcohol levels or not. The drives, which started in central Kolkata’s New Market, BBD Bag, Park Street and Lindsay Street areas, have led to 42 prosecutions till Saturday. Thirty of these prosecutions took place on Saturday alone. On Saturday, the East traffic guard that keeps watch on the pubs of Park Street area and Jorabagan traffic guard prosecuted seven and five motorists respectively for drink-driving. Kasba and Jadavpur traffic guards made four more prosecutions. The rest of the prosecutions were reported from 21 other traffic guards in the city. Lalbazar — which had previously drawn up the breathalyzer test SOP — is asking cops to strengthen their drives against drink-driving and ensure that no drunk motorist can evade the eyes of the police. “We are also setting up nakas at Tagore Park, Ruby Crossing and Anandapur Road outside pubs simultaneously so that no drunk motorist can escape,” said an officer of the east police division. The decision came in the wake of nearly 448 prosecutions for drink-driving in November — 15 such cases were reported on an average per day, which is higher than the number of prosecutions before the reintroduction of breathalyzer tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bar-to-wheels-drive-books-42-motorists/articleshow/88110651.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||Kerala board leads the chart of outstation Delhi University admissions||NEW DELHI: The number of admissions from the Kerala board at Delhi University is higher than that of the Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab state boards, a committee formed by DU vice chancellor Yogesh Singh to study the representation of students has noted. Overall, among 39 boards, the highest intake of students was from the Central Board of Secondary Education (37,767), followed by the Kerala Board of Higher Secondary Education (1,890), Board of School Education, Haryana (1,824), ISC (1,606) and Board of Secondary Education, Rajasthan (1,329), according to a data analysis of admissions that are based on cutoffs. The report also stated that the five boards contributed more than 90% of the applicants who have taken admission at the undergraduate level. The top five colleges for CBSE students were Acharya Narendra Dev College, Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, Dyal Singh College, Hindu College and Hansraj College. For students from the Kerala board, Hindu, Miranda House, Zakir Hussain, Ramjas and Hansraj College — mostly on-campus colleges known to have a higher cutoff — were the top colleges. At 98.4%, Kerala had the highest mean admission percentage, followed by Rajasthan at 94.7%, Haryana at 92.7%, CISCE at 92.3% and CBSE at 91.3%. The committee noted, “There has been significant variation in the marking pattern across the school boards of the country, which requires an appropriate benchmarking to instil significant equity in the process of admission at the undergraduate level.” The boards with the lowest mean percentages were the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) (72.6%), followed by Gujarat (80%), Bihar (80.7%), UP (82%) and Meghalaya (82%) boards. The committee added that as long as admissions are based on cut-offs, there is no way that fluctuations can be avoided to maintain “equity”. “Any effort to normalise marks awarded by various boards may be fraught with the danger of devising a formula which may not be equitable on some scale or the other. Such an effort could not stand the test of legality, if contested, in a court of law. Therefore, neither cutoff-based admissions nor admission through normalisation of awarded marks by various boards are options which observe maximum objectivity in admission,” said the report. The committee said the only way to ensure fairness is through the Common Entrance Test. The report also pointed out that admissions under the Other Backward Classes (OBC) non-creamy layer were way above the average of 27% for the Kerala (68.7%), Rajasthan (48.5%) and Haryana (38.6%) boards. For CBSE, it stood at 21.7%. The details of the report will now be placed before the academic council members on December 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kerala-board-leads-the-chart-of-outstation-du-admissions/articleshow/88111213.cms||---

Banerjee made this request during her meeting with Maharashtra Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray last week in Mumbai. Banerjee said that many patients come to Mumbai for treatment, especially to the Tata Memorial Cancer Hospital in Parel and don’t have a place to stay. Adding that she could accommodate these needy patients at the Bengal Bhavan if a plot of land is allotted here to the West Bengal government. Aaditya had met Banerjee at a south Mumbai hotel with Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut.  In his weekly column , Rok Thok in Sena mouthpiece Saamna, Raut wrote, “Mamata Banerjee’s demand is not unreasonable. Odisha Bhavan, Uttar Pradesh Bhavan are already constructed around Mumbai. West Bengal has contributed to the country’s freedom struggle and social revolution. The two states have an emotional relationship. It must be sustained.” While land parcels in Mumbai are hard to find and are very expensive, several state governments have constructed bhavan’s in Navi Mumbai. Apart from Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, the Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Meghalaya and Assam governments have also constructed bhavans among others. Officials pointed out it was since 1995-96 when the states started building their own bhavans and Assam was the first to build it. According to officials, the land near the Vashi railway station is a hub of state bhavans with some 18 states having built them there. Officials said that residents from those states and visitors avail the benefits of staying there besides also serving the purpose of those requiring accommodation in the state capital for personal and health reasons. The states showcase products by their handicraft industry and other specialities, including the local food and delicacies that are popular from their states at their respective bhavans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-didi-asks-state-for-land-for-bengal-bhavan/articleshow/88111919.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Dr Uday Narlawar, head of the department of community medicine at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and who is also playing a key role in the survey, said if the existing antibody in the local population fails to match the antigens in the Omicron variant, then the herd immunity is likely to take a hit. “Going by the nationwide reports and other local findings, epidemiologically Nagpur population is likely to have developed herd immunity, but it may not work as a protection any more if the Omicron mutations change the antigenic structure to such extent that it starts behaving as a completely new virus,” said Dr Narlawar. “A large section would become susceptible if the antibodies grown in the 70-80% population having sub-clinical infections during Covid-19 (asymptomatic) fail to match up the substantially changed antigenic structure of the new variant Omicron,” he said. Dr Narlawar also said vaccine, mask, sanitizers and maintaining Covid distancing would go a long way in helping the population against any variant threats. Dr Mohan Joshi, senior assistant professor, department of community medicine, NKP Salve Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, said the infection-induced immunity from the prior variants like Alpha, Delta, Delta plus of the coronavirus will help us in the long way to meet Omicron, which is a ‘variant of concern’ as per the World Health Organization. “Our past serosurveillance studies have shown that even 90% of the 0-18 population has antibodies, even without immunization. This plays a key role in the herd immunity because the adult population is already immunized to a large extent,” he said. “Indians may also have ‘non-specific immunity’, which might have also worked against the coronavirus. This ‘non-specific immunity’ has grown due to various other viruses existing in the country, which had, to some extent, made our immune system trained in fighting virus types and variants,” said Dr Joshi. Dr Ashok Jadhao, head of the department, community medicine, Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, said the role of herd community had been questionable as many with both the vaccine doses and prior infection have tested Covid positive again. But, nevertheless, the intensity of the disease was certainly lesser in them. “Logically, going by the number of active cases hovering around 50 suggests that we may have reached to a certain level of herd immunity or fruitful fallout of the immunization drive undertaken so far. May be for these reasons, we can say the disease is now in the endemic stage in Nagpur,” said Dr Jadhao, adding if the Omicron variant is really mild as the initial reports are suggesting, then it would help in enhancing the herd immunity. “A mild infection would take place from Omicron and antibody would be accordingly generated in the body. Again, the population would gain antibodies,” said Dr Jadhao, adding the district administration is gearing up to tackle the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/omicron-sparks-herd-immunity-debate-once-again/articleshow/88111209.cms||Soumitra Bose

Citing the surge in fuel prices, the drivers are demanding more money than the fare generated by the mobile application and harassing passengers. If the passenger books another auto, the fellow drivers also refuse to pick up the passengers in a show of solidarity. Following the pandemic, a section of people hesitant to take up public transport are preferring app-based autorickshaws. The rain also increased the demand for online autorickshaw service. However, for months now, residents are constantly facing harassment from the auto drivers. “Ola auto drivers demand Rs 30 to Rs 40 over the actual fare generated. If we refuse, the drivers get rude and insist us to cancel the booking,” K P Rangaprasad, joint secretary, Sattapanchayat Iyakkam, said. Stating that the diesel fare has surged, auto drivers said that they have no other option than to seek additional fare from the customers. For a passenger who booked a ride from Big Bazaar Street to Thiruvanaikoil (5.50 km distance), an auto driver has sought Rs 100 against the actual fare of Rs 60. While app-based cab service in Trichy city has increased their fares by 20% due to the fuel price hike, the autorickshaw service continues with the old fare. “Only RTOs can revise the tariff, we cannot. Based on the complaints, autorickshaw drivers who misbehave with customers are being blacklisted, they cannot serve on our platform,” a representative of Ola Auto said. Passengers preferring digital payment due to the Covid-19 scare were also discouraged by the auto drivers who claim that the money would reach their accounts delayed. “We will inquire with the service providers about the fleecing complaints. Simultaneously, we will conduct a drive to ensure meters are fitted in the autorickshaws,” S Gajapathi, RTO (Trichy East) said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/app-based-autorickshaws-fleece-customers-in-trichy/articleshow/88111207.cms||Deepak Karthik

Teachers said that students are not as well-versed in Class X and XI syllabus and would have to put in extra effort for doing well in NEET as there is no reduction in syllabus as well. “The major challenge for students this time is that students usually have to start preparing from Class XI to get good scores. Even in the previous NEET exam, we found that covering topics in the entire Class XI, XII syllabus is enough to cover up to 90% of questions. However, this year’s first-time aspirants have not covered Class X and Class XI syllabus properly as is needed to better study Class XII syllabus,” said S Nagarani, a Class XII biology teacher. “I am really anxious for NEET preparation as I have to be prepared for both board exams and NEET. We have also not written any board exam in Class X and XI and this year, we will be writing it for the first time. While in school, Class XII syllabus is being taught by teachers, I am also taking tuitions to learn Class XI syllabus on the side,” said K Deepika, a NEET aspirant. Teachers also said that especially physics has always been tough part for many students in NEET. For the government NEET e-box coaching, around 1,000 students had enrolled earlier this year. “For those preparing for NEET, we would have to cover the entire syllabus including deleted portions.

Nadira of Kalluvettankuzhy under Vizhinjam police station limits is the accused. Her son, Siddique, 20, was found dead in September 2020. The police said that Nadira was charged with the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder (IPC 304) as the killing was allegedly committed while trying to save her young daughter from her son’s attack. “The victim was a substance abuser who reportedly used to physically torture his mother and sister,” said Vizhinjam station house officer inspector Prajeesh Sasi. The alleged crime took place on September 14, 2020. As per Nadira's statement, Siddique assaulted her and her daughter on the day of his death under the influence of ganja. He grabbed his sister by her hair and started strangulating her. Nadira tried to pull him away to rescue the daughter. When she failed, she put her shawl around his neck and pulled harder until he fell unconscious. During the scuffle, the daughter had managed to free herself and ran out of the house. Nadira told the neighbours that he had attempted suicide by hanging himself using the shawl. They tried to hold the burial ceremony without informing the police. However, police received an anonymous tip off following which they took the body for post mortem. The surgeon opined that the cause of death was strangulation. Since the deceased was a substance addict and a public nuisance, the police initially suspected that he might have been killed by someone who held personal grudge with him, however, the probe finally led to Nadira.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/woman-held-for-sons-murder/articleshow/88096811.cms||---

Goa IPB recently held a board meeting where four investment projects valued at Rs 104.9 crore were cleared. The projects could create employment for around 380 people in the state. “The agenda was efficiently classified into various categories and the status of the pending applications were categorised as per the compliance status of the requirements to be eligible for approvals,” said GCCI president Ralph de Sousa. Sousa said there was a “very good coordination” between the chief executive officer of Goa IPB Swetika Sachan and the managing director of Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) Mekala Chaitanya Prasad, which helped iron out the issues of land allotments for new projects. “The board members also discussed the issue of land allotment to previously approved projects and allotted land to 11 pending projects. The IPB fast-tracked two projects of investors with their own land through the new single window clearance system,” Sousa said. Goa IPB has also launched an online web application for investors to apply for clearances. The new methodology utilises a point system to evaluate and score project proposals received against the advertised land bank of IPB. A merit list is to be prepared for each advertised plot and the project scoring the highest points will be offered the said plot, the GCCI president said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/initiative-to-ease-land-allotments-a-welcome-change-gcci/articleshow/88111233.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Varanasi||PM Narendra Modi to gift fertilizer plant, AIIMS to Gorakhpur: Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||GORAKHPUR: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday announced that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will gift development projects worth Rs 10,000 crore to Gorakhpur on Tuesday. Speaking at Gorakhnath temple on Sunday, the CM said PM Modi will inaugurate Rs 8,603 crore fertilizer plant, Rs 1,011 crore AIIMS in Gorakhpur and a hi-tech lab at RMRC lab in BRD Medical College on Tuesday. “PM Modi is coming to make East UP’s dream come true. The region’s dream of development was not fulfilled by the previous governments and the inauguration of three big projects is the biggest investment in east UP so far,” the CM said. Criticizing the previous governments, he said, “The Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI) plant was closed in 1990 and the previous governments only gave assurances. The closure affected the farmers and common citizens by taking away employment.” “In 2016, PM Modi laid the foundation of the new fertilizer plant and it is now ready for production of neem-coated urea that will benefit farmers. The plant will fulfil the demand of fertilizer and generate employment opportunities.” CM also attacked the opposition on the issue of Encephalitis and said, “This disease had become the identity of east UP and more than 50,000 children died due to it. We succeeded in controlling Japanese Encephalitis by about 75% and deaths by 95% in the past three years.” The people of Bihar and Nepal will also be benefited by the three projects to be inaugurated by PM Modi, he added. “For a long time, there was no arrangement for detection of virus in Gorakhpur and samples had to be sent to NIV Pune, but now a high-tech lab at Regional Medicine Council of Research (RMRC) is ready for inauguration,” he added. “More than Rs 8,600 crore has been spent on the construction of fertilizer factory that is spread over 600 acres; Rs 1,011 crore on AIIMS built in 112 acres, and Rs 36 crore on RMRC lab,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pm-to-gift-fertilizer-plant-aiims-to-gorakhpur-cm/articleshow/88111216.cms||---

The health department has lodged a complaint with the Perambalur police seeking an inquiry into the deaths. Health officials identified the deceased as D Selvarani, wife of Dileep Kumar, who works in a fuel station near Perambalur. She hailed from Anukkoor village near Vempanthattai and the couple already has two children studying in class IX and class XII. Selvarani was pregnant for 32 weeks, but officials said the couple did not register the pregnancy in the nearest PHC for routine examination and no RCH (reproductive and child health) ID was obtained, which is mandatory to register the child’s birth. On Friday night, Selvarani developed labour pain although she was in her eighth month of pregnancy. A baby girl was delivered at her home but the health condition of the mother and baby deteriorated thereafter. Subsequently, the family rushed both of them to Perambalur government hospital in an ambulance, but they succumbed to complications on the way. As the family prepared for the last rites, Mangalamedu police rushed to their house and sent the bodies to the government hospital for autopsy. “Nobody including neighbours and our rural health workers were aware of the victim’s pregnancy. It seems the family tried to hide it,” Dr S Senthilkumar, DDHS, told TOI. He has lodged a complaint about suspicious death involving childbirth at home and Mangalamedu police are investigating. This is the second such incident in the district this year after a 29-year-old woman lost her life in a childbirth attempt at her home in Poolambadi village in January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/woman-baby-die-in-home-delivery/articleshow/88111214.cms||---
---||Kolkata||KMDA fences off vacant govt land to thwart encroachment||Kolkata: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) has started putting up barbed wire fences on the vacant government lands off EM Bypass and in other parts of the city. The move came in the wake of an instruction from the state to protect the government lands from unauthorised encroachments. The authorities have already identified some vacant plots on the eastern and western side of the Bypass as well as on the northern side of Rashbehari connector. They have initiated the process to engage agencies that will put up barbed wire fencing along with notice boards saying that the plots have been acquired by KMDA or KIT. According to officials, there are around 700 to 800 such vacant plots — total 30 acre of land — owned by the KMDA and KIT across the city. The authorities have identified another vacant land, which is vulnerable for encroachment, near Nonadanga bus stand. These plots will be fenced off with boundary walls. “It has been noticed that several vacant government plots have been encroached in the city. The urban development department has instructed us to ensure that the government lands are fenced off properly and that there is no encroachment,” said a KMDA official. The authorities have been doing surveys on the eastern fringes of the city to check the conditions of all the KMDA plots. “There are several such vacant KMDA plots on either side of the Bypass, especially the stretch between Nonadanga and Garia, which comes under the east Kolkata area development project scheme. Many of these vacant plots have been occupied by people illegally. The KMDA will reap financial benefits if these plots can be recovered and utilised commercially,” said the KMDA’s Development Employees Joint Action Committee’s joint general secretary, Pranbandhu Nag. Under the east Kolkata area development scheme, the KMDA had earlier sold several plots, especially in Nonadanga and the Baisnabghata-Patuli area off the Bypass. During the Left Front regime, the authorities had also auctioned several plots off the Bypass for commercial utilization and earned huge revenues. In 2005, KMDA had sold off a 6.2acre plot to a real estate company for the construction of a five-star hotel. The price of the land was pegged at Rs 209 crore or Rs 33 crore per acre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmda-fences-off-vacant-govt-land-to-thwart-encroachment/articleshow/88110670.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Trichy||4 caught with weapons escape from station, 1 held||Trichy: Four men who were caught with a bag of sharp weapons escaped from a police station in Thanjavur on Saturday evening after threatening the police with knives. While one of them was caught later, the three others are absconding. The incident happened at Thogur police station when sub-inspector Ayyapillai and special sub-inspector Velmurugan brought four youths who were found in suspicious circumstances near a bridge at Sukkambar village. They were roaming on a scooter while the policemen were conducting a vehicle check. The police team took all the four along to the station to question them. During the process, they found that there was a travel bag in the scooter. SI Ayyampillai asked the men to bring the bag to his table for checking, but the four objected to it. When the officer ordered them to open the bag, suddenly the four of them picked up knives and iron rods from the bag and threatened the police. When the SI tried to catch hold of one of them, he hurled a knife at him. One of the police constables swiftly closed the door, but the four broke the glass panels of the door and fled. “Before we could act they fled leaving the scooter. Hearing the sound, nearby residents rushed in. After a few minutes, one of the accused named Naresh Raj, 28, came back to take his scooter. He tried to flee again, but we chased him down,” Ayyampillai told TOI. Naresh’s father is a retired railway employee and mother a school teacher. He became addicted to ganja and developed friendship with some antisocials, the SI said. The others were J Reuben, G Vineeth and P Santhakumar, all aged 21. Several petty criminal cases are pending against two of them. Inquiry is on to ascertain why they were roaming around with weapons, the SI stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/4-caught-with-weapons-escape-from-station-1-held/articleshow/88111228.cms||---

He also instructed the management to pay lay off compensation to the employees and also take measures to pay the salary dues. The minister made these directions during a meeting held here on Saturday with the representatives of the factory management and the labour union leaders in the presence of the district collector. During the meeting, the minister heard the various complaints raised by the employees and directed the senior officials of the labour department present in the meeting to take appropriate action. The minister also told the factory management that the concerns of the employees were just and if they continued to turn a blind eye towards their problems the government would be forced to take legal action against them. The EICL had shut down their factories at Kochuveli and Thonnakkal in August last year citing shortage of raw materials. They chose to resume partial operations at Thonnakkal unit following the government’s intervention. However, the unit at Kochuveli remained shut and the employees have been waging an indefinite protest outside the factory here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/minister-wants-kochuveli-unit-to-resume-ops/articleshow/88096824.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Govt’s crypto law move puts Nagpur’s new age pros in a bind||NAGPUR: The booming trade in cryptocurrency has attracted many new age entrepreneurs to the industry, including a few professionals from Nagpur. However, uncertainty over the fate of the virtual money in the country after the government planned to bring in a law has derailed the plans of a few. A city professional Sandeep Agrawal and his parents had created a digital coin Speedon, which he along with associates based in Delhi had planned to launch in September. The venture has been withheld now. There were plans to start with coins backed with real currency worth Rs20 lakh. The plan was to generate liquidity through the pre-sale. This means sale of cryptocurrency before it is listed on an exchange. This would have led to gradual backing up with real currency, which in cryptocurrency terms is known as liquidity. The plan was to start with listing it with CoinMarketCap, a virtual exchange, said Agrawal. Agrawal said they had planned to invest funds generated from cryptocurrency trade in projects related to virtual reality, gaming and animation. “There are a lot of theories concerning cryptocurrency. However, it is actually backed by real money. We are now waiting to get clarity on the legality,” he said. Agrawal says the government should not bring the legislation in haste. There have been losses to investors, but many have earned too. All the pros and cons of the system must be studied first, he added. In another development, a city startup ProCohat Technologies has provided technological support to a payment aggregator through which funds can be transferred to one of the major crypto exchanges. “We are providing the services to payment aggregator, which in turns caters to a leading exchange. The name cannot be disclosed due to a non-disclosure agreement with the client,” said Wasudev Mishra of ProCohat. Our company has provided technological support for routing payment of the exchange’s customers into their e-wallet. The funds are transferred in rupees. The order was bagged recently. There have been investment in cryptocurrency by individuals in Nagpur also, say sources. Though the estimates vary. Agrawal said in Nagpur, cryptocurrency is not seen as an investment yet. Those who are parking their money are speculating and are open to risk. Mishra said youngsters are interested in the virtual money and he put up the number of investors running into tens of thousands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govts-crypto-law-move-puts-citys-new-age-pros-in-a-bind/articleshow/88111229.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Goa||Govt finalises draft rules for mining corp||Panaji: The directorate of mines and geology has finalised the draft rules for the functioning of Goa mining corporation. The draft rules will be sent to the chief minister Pramod Sawant for administrative approval before referring it to the law department for vetting.  A senior officer said that the mining corporation has been formed and once the rules are finalised and notified, the corporation will start functioning. “We will send the file in the coming week to the chief minister for financial approval,” the senior officer said.  The chief minister is the chairman of the corporation with MLAs representing mining belt constituencies as its members. The Act that paved the way for the corporation’s formation was passed during the last assembly session. Earlier in September, the governor granted his assent to the bill, making it an Act and setting the stage for the corporation. Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018, after the Supreme Court quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases. On September 7, the apex court dismissed an appeal filed by mining companies to allow them to operate mining leases till 2037.  The state government has tentatively finalised eight mining leases to be auctioned in Bicholim and Sattari talukas. Out of the eight leases shortlisted by the government, five are at Bordem in Bicholim and three in Sattari, including two in Pissurlem and one in Poriem.  A senior government official said that the Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd (MECL) will conduct a detailed study to ascertain the iron ore reserve in these mines, as well as the vegetation around the leases and submit its report to the mines department.  The mining concessions in the state were granted under the decree of 1906. On December 19, 1961, Goa, Daman and Diu were liberated from Portuguese rule and Goa became a part of India. However, the concessions were deemed to have expired on December 12, 1961, which was the appointed date as per the Abolition Act, 1987, from which date the concessions were treated as deemed leases under MMDR Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-finalises-draft-rules-for-mining-corp/articleshow/88111258.cms||---

Seldom would they get rewarded and yet they never lose their heart. The one day handicraft expo for differently abled students held here on Friday was a major boost to students from around 31 schools. The children of Happy Valley Special school who participated in the exhibition are very happy. They used to make and sell products, including umbrellas, handmade greeting cards and skeleton leaf paintings. They have received only a little money so far. Through this programme, they have got Rs 2000 from the products. It may not be a big sum, but for them, it means a lot. “The children here are from very poor homes and it is a great recognition for them. This event encouraged them to make more such handcraft products,” said Philip Mathew, the director of Happy Valley Special School, Aruvikkara. Samvikas A V, a 21-year-old student of Navajyothi BUDS School, Karakulam, was so happy to share his experience about attending the training session led by his teachers at school. He was overwhelmed by seeing people buy the products made by him. He spent around one month to complete the making of handcrafted drums. The miniature drums made by him gained attention from people. The drum looked so perfect with the wooden brown colour painted on the coconut shell. Around 187 students from 31 schools took part in the. Each school was given a stall to showcase their products. 15 BUDS schools, 15 special schools and 1 BRC participated in the event. It was held as part of the international day of disabled persons. The winners of the online arts competition “Unarv 2021” were also awarded with trophies. The slogan for the event was “Thanichalla ningal njangal oppam und”. The students were accompanied by their teachers and parents. The children had a training session about manufacturing handicrafts products. The handicraft products including candles, soaps, lotion, umbrellas, jewelries, penholders, carpets, bags, paper pen, plant pots, bottle arts, photo frames, dish wash, hand wash, greeting cards and soft toys were displayed in the stalls. “The disabled kids are the ones who were severely affected by the pandemic. They were not able to go out and socialise. The pandemic caused severe anxiety disorder in them. This platform will surely help them to refresh their mind and also helps them to showcase their talents,” said Shiny Mol, district social justice officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/big-hearts-swell-with-small-rewards/articleshow/88096855.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Jacqueline Fernandez stopped at Mumbai airport from travelling abroad||NEW DELHI: Actor Jacqueline Fernandez was briefly detained at Mumbai airport on Sunday and prevented from travelling abroad on a pending lookout circular against her issued by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money-laundering case. Fernandez, who has been allowed to go home, has been questioned several times in the past six months by the ED in connection with a case linked to the alleged money-laundering of Rs 200 crore by alleged conman Sukesh Chandrashekar. According to the ED probe, Chandrashekar transferred ‘proceeds of crime’ to Fernandez and her siblings. Some of the alleged money extorted by the conman, who is in Tihar jail, was laundered in Dubai bank accounts of Fernandez, according to ED’s chargesheet. The chargesheet in the case was filed on Saturday and mentioned alleged links of Fernandez with the conman. Before being released by ED on Sunday, the actress was asked to remain in the country and present herself for further investigation. Fernandez had skipped summons at least thrice earlier. In August, when she had first recorded her statements she refused to accept that she had any financial links with the Chandrashekar. She may soon be confronted with Chandrashekhar and his actor-wife Leena Maria Paul, who is also behind bars. Actor Nora Fatehi was also questioned recently in the same case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-jacqueline-stopped-at-airport-from-travelling-abroad/articleshow/88111949.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Bypass to get 6th service road near Tagore Park||KOLKATA: KMDA, after acting on multiple proposals from Kolkata Traffic Police, will construct its sixth major service road along EM Bypass that will be a non-stop stretch of around two kilometers from Kasba to Tagore Park. A bridge has been proposed for this purpose that will come up close to Rudramani building on EM Bypass. The proposal will also ensure an important additional vehicular lane on a narrow stretch of the Bypass that will also have a provision for a cycle lane, if indeed it takes shape, in the future. According to Lalbazar traffic cops, the 40 percent narrower western flank (Ruby Crossing to Science City-bound flank) of EM Bypass near Tagore Park due to the presence of Naskarhat Culvert had become a traffic constraint. It is presently leading to accidents with even deaths being reported in the past. The western side service road that caters to the Kasba PVD along with a number of popular eateries around Tagore Park too has lost continuity due to the same. Based on petitions from Kasba Traffic Guard, Lalbazar has sent a letter to KMDA stating that just like the eastern flank (where RVNL has reportedly proposed a bridge to increase the road width), KMDA should construct a similar bridge beside the Naskarhat culvert on the western flank. KMDA has agreed to the proposal and a final joint inspection is expected on Tuesday, said top police sources. The total cost of the project has been pegged around Rs 18 crore. The idea was first mooted by police in March this year. “The proposed Naskarhat bridge will be one of those proposed bridges in recent times that KMDA has sanctioned due to police pursuance. Once complete, it will remove a major choke point on the EM Bypass. As people who handle traffic day in and day out and know the issues faced by motorists, our job does not end by merely managing traffic. It is also important we visualise the requirements of city traffic in the next few years and try and build up physical infrastructure, technological capabilities and manpower accordingly. The KMDA which is evaluating the various infrastructural requirements on Bypass, is essentially on the same page with us. We have agreed to carry out the inspection together and take the matter forward,” said an officer. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha said they have written letters and attached photographic proof and pursued the project in order to push for the new bridge. KMDA officials said they always consider the proposals of the police. “From the traffic point of view, whatever opinion police have given will be considered and after doing a joint survey KMDA will take up the needful work asrequired,” said KMDA chief executive officer (CEO) Antara Acharya. KMDA has already engaged an agency that is conducting a survey of the entire EM Bypass stretch as to the present condition of its carriageway to take profile repairing work. The survey also includes exploring the option to develop road medians and to explore the possibility of having a dedicated bicycle lane on EM Bypass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bypass-service-road/articleshow/88110696.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||Delhi: How this gang honey-trapped over a dozen, extorted lakhs by posing as cops||NEW DELHI: Police have busted a gang that allegedly honey-trapped more than a dozen people and extorted lakhs of rupees from them by posing as policemen during fake raids. The kingpin of the gang, which operated in Paschim Vihar area, has been arrested. Explaining the modus operandi, police said the six-member gang used to create a Facebook profile of a girl and send ‘friend requests’ to potential targets. “Once a request was confirmed, they would chat with the person on Facebook Messenger, obtain his mobile phone number and send photos to lure him. One of the women in the gang would make a video call to further entice the victim,” said an officer. The gang, he added, used to extract complete details from the target to assess his paying capacity. Once they knew his financial background, a woman would invite the victim to a place. “The other gang members would barge into the room posing as policemen, threaten the victim and extort money from him,” the officer said. Delhi Police said they received a complaint recently from a man who claimed the accused had extorted Rs 3 lakhs from him in a similar manner and a case was registered on November 29. Additional commissioner of police (crime) Dheeraj Kumar said investigation revealed that the victim had been taken to a flat in Paschim Vihar and honey-trapped. On Friday, police arrested the main accused, Neeraj, from Prashant Vihar area. “Neeraj and five members of his gang, including two women, were running a sextortion racket and had extorted Rs 5-10 lakhs from each of their victims in the past 18 months,” the officer said. Meanwhile, in another case, police arrested six people from Spa, Ayurveda and Panchkarma Therapy Centre in Malviya Nagar for allegedly running a sex racket. According to police, the accused used to send decoy customers to the centre. “The receptionist would provide three girls to decoy customers for paid sex and took Rs 2,000 as her commission,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-this-gang-honey-trapped-over-a-dozen-extorted-lakhs-by-posing-as-cops/articleshow/88111272.cms||---

Gandhi had arrived in the Sangam City on a short visit to attend a private function. Tiwari said, ‘Since AICC general secretary and UP in-charge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has taken the command, the presence of Congress is now seen at each booth in the state.” “If the same momentum is maintained, Congress would be a major gainer in UP polls which are just two and half months away,” he told Gandhi. Priyanka’s active role and interaction with locals has helped to strengthen the party organisation and its impact would be visible in the coming polls, Tiwari said. He further claimed, “People are looking towards Congress as an alternative to BJP and those felling discontented are shifting to Congress instead of SP and BSP.” Tiwari later told TOI, “While discussing the political scenario, I told Rahul Gandhi that the presence of Congress can now be seen in all booths and things would improve if we keep the same momentum till polls.” Earlier, senior party leaders, including Mukund Tiwari, Kishore Varshney, Haseeb Ahmad, and scores of Congress workers welcomed the ex-Congress president when he arrived at the Bamrauli airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/rahul-meets-up-cong-leaders-in-prayagraj/articleshow/88111271.cms||---

Dr Kanu Prajapati, a resident of Chandramukhi Society near Memnagar lake, said he was walking outside the lake garden on the morning of November 13 when two men on a bike hit him with a stick. Shocked by the attack, Prajapati first enquired around about the incident and then approached the police who began collecting CCTV footage to find out more about the incident. Prajapati told police that he runs a dispensary in Akhbarnagar and stays in Memnagar. He usually goes for his morning walk between 5.45am and 7.45am. “On November 13, when I was walking outside the garden, two men on a motorcycle rode close to me. The man who was riding pillion hit me with a stick. The blow landed on the elbow of my left hand. Before I could react, they fled towards the AEC flyover,” he stated in his FIR. Prajapati said the accused, who were aged around 40 and 45 years, wore caps and had covered their faces with handkerchiefs. He said that he could not register the motorcycle number, but he tried to search them but as he could not find their whereabouts, he approached police. An officer of Ghatlodia police said that they have tried to collect CCTV footage but did not find any clear visuals. He said that the accused came on the motorcycle without number which is a hinderance in the investigation. Cops have also been trying to find out if the doctor has any old enmity with anyone, but it did not appear fruitful as of now, said the officer. Ghatlodia police registered a case of causing hurt and abetment against two men and began an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/75-yr-old-doctor-attacked-during-morning-walk-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/88110697.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Uttar Pradesh: Gau Amritam, made from cow dung, to hit market||PRAYAGRAJ: Throwing a potential challenge to chemical-based pesticides, a gaushala based in Manikpur (Chitrakoot) has developed a natural and biological pesticide from cow’s urine and dung, neem leaves, and jaggery. Named “Gau Amritam”, it is set to hit markets across UP this week. Volunteers associated with the Gau Raksha vibhag of the VHP are taking up mass production of Gau Amritam at many gaushalas in Bundelkhand, Kashi, and many other regions to maintain the fertility and purity of soil. Abhishek Bajpai, convener and associated with mass production of Gau Amritam at Abhay Gausala, Manikpur, told TOI: “For the production of 200 litres of natural pesticide (Gau Amritam), we are using 20 litres of gaumutra (cow urine), 5 kg cow dung, 5 kg leaves of neem, and 5 kg of gur (jaggery).” “Gau Amritam not only helps increase the productivity of soil, it also enhances growth of plants,” he said. The product has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties as well and would not harm earthworms, which increase productivity of the soil, he added. “Often, chemical-based pesticides not only kill earthworms but also prove harmful for human beings,” Bajpai said. VHP gaushalas have earlier made disinfectants (phenyl) based on cow urine and cow dung-based cakes (Gomaykhand) for puja and yajna purposes. The Gau Raksha wing of the VHP has also interacted with thousands of farmers at the village and blocks level, holding meetings across the state and briefing them about the efficacy and value of Gau Amritam. “We have also chalked out plans to promote Gau Amritam at the forthcoming Magh Mela to be held on the banks of Ganga in January,” Rakesh Shukla of the VHP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/gau-amritam-made-from-cow-dung-natural-products-to-hit-market-soon/articleshow/88111255.cms||---

Early morning walkers on the hills and grounds in Pune city said they had not seen such a fog and for so many days in the city for years. Some recalled a similar foggy situation in January in the early 1990s when the temperature had dipped close to zero in the city. Commuters on the roads in the city and on the highway had to drive at very slow speed with headlights on as visibility was hampered beyond 200 to 300 metres. The condition improved by 11am, but the weather bureau officials said a similar foggy condition is likely to prevail during the early hours for the next two days. High humidity and clear skies without windy conditions are making the conditions conducive for formation of fog, they said. The IMD’s Shivajinagar observatory recorded night temperature at 15.6 degree celsius on Sunday, a slide of four degrees at leats compared to the 19.7 degree celsius recorded on Saturday. Similarly, the Lohegaon observatory recorded 17.1 degree C, which was down from 19.4 degree C recorded on Saturday. Cold and, at times, windy conditions prevailed till Sunday afternoon with the drop in the night temperatures. A senior IMD official said, “Night temperature in the city is likely to drop further in the days ahead due to the penetration of the cold northerly winds. From Monday onwards till December 11, the weather is likely to remain partly cloudy in the afternoon hours. It will be clear sky conditions after that. Chances of the rainfall is very less. The night temperature from December 12 onward is likely to drop below the normal range.” On Sunday, the Shivajinagar observatory the city’s day temperature at 28.8 degree C, which was 0.9 degrees below normal while the Lohegaon observatory recorded 29 degree C, which was 1 degree below normal. Flights on Sunday were delayed too. Passengers said the airlines were not providing proper information and many said they would miss connecting flights. “I had booked a flight to Patna via Delhi. The flight from Pune to Delhi has been rescheduled four times already. With no proper information, I will miss my onward connection. I had to reach Patna urgently today,” a flyer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/thick-fog-covers-dist-night-temp-drops-by-over-4-deg-c/articleshow/88111265.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Mumbai||Delete names of south Mumbai elderly couple from domestic violence plea: Court||MUMBAI: In a significant order granting relief to an 83-year-old Breach Candy businessman and his 76-year-old wife in a domestic violence application filed by their estranged daughter-in-law, the family court has clarified that since the two parties have been living separately since the wedding in 2010, no domestic relationship exists between them under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA). The court allowed a plea moved by the senior citizen couple’s lawyer, Kanupriya Kejriwal, to have their names deleted from the woman’s application. The court held that being relatives and being in domestic relationship are two different concepts. “In the case in hand, the applicant [woman] and the non-applicant number 1 [her husband], since their marriage, were residing separately from the non-applicant numbers 2 [father-in-law] and 3 [mother-in-law]. Therefore, the applicant and non-applicant number 1 cannot be said to be having a domestic relationship with non-applicant numbers 2 and 3, according to the PWDVA,” judge Swati Chauhan said. The 42-year-old woman, who is in the midst of a divorce battle with the couple’s son, had cited mental torture and emotional distress by her husband and in-laws and had claimed Rs 25 crore compensation and a flat of her choice at Nepean Sea Road. The estranged couple also have a child. The woman currently lives with her parents and son at Nepean Sea Road. The court accepted Kejriwal’s arguments that mere visits by the in-laws to the premises where the woman was formerly residing with their son, was not sufficient to hold that they shared the same household or were in a domestic relationship with her. Kejriwal also submitted that the woman herself had accepted that they had always lived in separate homes. Until the woman and her husband separated in 2017, they lived at Mahalaxmi. Their building also housed the father-in-law’s office that he visited daily and a temple that her mother-in-law frequented. The woman also claimed her father-in-law was controlling the business, hence, causing economic abuse. She alleged that she had to take permission from the father-in-law for various expenses. The family court, however, said, “For attracting the provisions of the PWDVA, the criteria is not joint business, but living together jointly under one roof.” Among various grievances, the woman also alleged that her in-laws never protected or supported her when her husband was ill treating her. The woman also claimed that her in-laws intruded in her life on a daily basis. But the court said: “These grievances of the applicant would be covered under the provisions of the PWDVA, only if non-applicant numbers 2 and 3 were staying under one roof as a joint family with her.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/delete-names-of-sobo-elderly-couple-from-domestic-violence-plea-in-mumbai-court/articleshow/88111698.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The deceased, Ayush Soni, was a resident of Malhar Flats in Navrangpura and was doing articleship with a CA firm in Anandnagar where he committed suicide early on Saturday morning, said an officer posted at Anandnagar police station. Soni had left home early morning, informing his family members that he had a meeting at the work place and he reached the Titanium City Centre in Anandnagar at around 6am. At around 6.45am, he jumped-off from the building and a security guard, who heard the noise of his fall, rushed there and found him lying in pool of blood. He informed the cops about the incident and a team of Anandnagar police reached the spot and began an inquiry. Another officer posted at the Anandnagar police station said that initially they had doubts that he might have been pushed by someone. “But CCTV footage confirmed that he himself jumped off from the building and died,” said the officer. The officer said that they did talk with family members and friends of Soni but they could not tell any reason which forced him to commit suicide. “His mental and physical health was sound and he did not even have any financial trouble. This has been stated by friends and family members,” said the officer. The officer said that the further inquiry will be conducted after the family completes the post-death rituals.

In their latest, among a series of studies published earlier, a team of scientists have now warned us that the percentage of trace metals in city’s dust is increasing and should be a cause for concern. Track the pollution level in your cityThe study claimed that the mineral dust fraction in particulate matter PM10 over Bapunagar, Narol, Paldi, Income Tax, and Science City was estimated to be around 39%, 45%, 47%, 44%, and 31% during summer respectively and 24%, 55%, 28%, 27%, and 28% during winter respectively. The trace metals will appeared in the mineral dust from a host of human activities like road traffic, biomass burning, paints, garbage, and industrial emissions. A detailed analysis of the city’s dust constituent by Utsav Gandhi, Nitasha Khatri, Viral Brahmbhatt, Ashutosh Kumar Jha from Gujarat Environment Management Institute (GEMI) and Anil Patel and Neeraj Rastogi from Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) revealed a “High mass of metal content in Ahmedabad’s air consisting of zinc, copper, nickel, cadmium and antimony, which was found during winter and was ascribed to human activities.” The study also revealed that atmospheric mass concentration of carcinogenic metals such as chromium, cobalt and arsenic was higher across all five sites in the city. The scientists raised serious concerns for Narol area where they found metals such as lead, nickle and cadmium in addition to the above-mentioned metals. The same research team had published an earlier work on the oxidative potential — a complex chemical process that ensues once they interact with gases in the air before we breathe these particles in. TOI had published this study in January this year. “The average oxidative potential of PM10 over Narol was approximately four times higher compared to Science City, suggesting a higher risk to Narol’s inhabitants from potentially redox-active dust particles,” claimed the study. Narol also recorded about two to three times higher PM10 concentration compared to other areas owing to re-suspension of road dust caused by unpaved GIDC inter-connecting road and nearby waste dumping site at Pirana. Also, organic constituents were observed to be higher over Paldi and Income Tax, mainly owing to traffic, the study claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/carcinogenic-trace-metals-in-ahmedabads-air-scientists/articleshow/88110714.cms||Paul John
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC warns Sonu Sood in new notice on Juhu building||MUMBAI: The BMC has issued a new notice to actor Sonu Sood for failing to restore his six-storey building from a hotel back to a residential building. In July the BMC had asked Sood to convert his Juhu hotel back into a residential building and remove any unauthorised construction that has been carried out in the building. Sood had told the BMC in July that he would on his own restore the building, but a new BMC notice issued by the K-West ward last month said that Sood had not yet restored the building. In the warning notice, the BMC has asked Sood to restore the structure as per the approved plan within seven days, failing which action would be taken without further intimation. “You have stated in your letter….that you discontinued the activity of lodging/boarding in the existing 1st to 6th floors of the building and it shall be used for residential purposes as per sanctioned plan. Also you have mentioned that necessary work for addition/alteration/restoration is under progress …this office has inspected the site on 20.10.2021 and it is observed that you have not yet restored the work as per approved plan,” the BMC notice reads. Sood said he had already converted the Shakti Sagar building on AB Nair Road into a residential structure. “We have already carried out the restoration. We have submitted the details to the BMC and the documentation process is underway. I am not carrying out any unauthorised activity and it will remain a residential structure as per the approved plan,” he told TOI.  Activist Ganesh Kusmulu, who had filed a complaint with the Lokayukta against Sood, said the police must register an FIR against Sood. “The restoration has not taken place. The hotel has been converted into a girls’ hostel now. This also amounts to change of use. The BMC is not carrying out demolition despite the Lokayukta’s order. The BMC is only issuing notices and delaying the demolition action,” Kusumulu said. Sood had allegedly converted the building into a hotel without necessary permission from the BMC. Earlier this year Sood, after getting a rap from the Bombay high court and withdrawing his petition before the Supreme Court, had agreed to restore the building from an unauthorised hotel back into a residential premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-warns-sonu-sood-in-new-notice-on-juhu-bldg/articleshow/88111971.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The new 2 MTPA cement facility is coming up adjacent to its existing unit in Balidih area of the district. DC Kuldeep Chaudhary along with SP Chandan Kumar Jha, JIADA regional director, Kritishree inspected the Dalmia’s site where Soren’s visit is scheduled. The DC took detailed information from Dalmia company representatives regarding the helipad site, venue of the event, its security arrangements, visiting visitors and others. However, local residents were up in arms against the project demanding jobs against their land. Many local residents staged hunger strike on Friday at the construction site, which they called off later in the evening after administrative officials intervened and informed them about the CM’s visit. Public relations officer of Dalmia Cement, Shyamlal Sahu refused to comment on the matter. President of Visthapith Rayyat Grahmin Prabhavit Sangh, Mukesh Kumar Ravidas said, "We have deferred our demonstration because of CM’s visit as administrative officials have requested us. We are going to submit a demand letter to the CM informing him that company is not providing permanent jobs to rayyats and local residents. They are offering contractual job which we refuse to accept. The state government has also asked companies to provide 75 per cent jobs to local youths of the area.” However, the DC said, “Dalmia Company has given in writing to provide contractual job to the rayyats. We are having dialogue with rayyats and local residents to solve the issue.” Jharkhand Industrial Area Development Authourity (JIADA) allotted 16 acres to Dalmia for the cement facility under its expansion project. Dalmia Cement Bharat Limited will invest a total of Rs 577 crore in the facility. Under the Jharkhand Industrial and Investment Promotion Policy 2021, the Government of Jharkhand had organised an investors’ meet in New Delhi in August. The construction of the plant is expected to be completed within a year. It is mentioned that Dalmia already had a cement plant with manufacturing capacity of 2.1 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) in Balidih of Bokaro.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/soren-to-lay-foundation-stone-of-dalmias-new-cement-plant-today/articleshow/88110514.cms||Divy Khare

BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said, “The government must be more sensitive and proactive towards containing the spread of Covid-19. The way that it is callously conducting events like ‘Sarkar aapke ke dwar’ amid the threat of the Omicron variant, it just goes on to show what exactly is a priority for the ruling dispensation. On one hand, ordinary citizens are getting penalized for not wearing masks or violating other safety norms and on the other, the government is organising large-scale gatherings where social distancing and other norms are going for a toss.” He added, “Just a few months back, the ruling parties of Jharkhand blamed the Centre for holding polls and organising election rallies amid the pandemic although in reality the Centre has been continuously issuing advisories to all the states as part of its Covid-19 management plan.” The public outreach programme, which commenced from November 16, is being organised at the block and panchayat levels across all 24 districts by the government in the run up to its completion of two years in office on December 29. On an average, every district is holding at least four to five public meetings to dole out welfare schemes, listen to people’s grievances and seek their feedback about the government’s ongoing developmental works. The programme is drawing huge crowds everywhere and as per the figures released by the government on December 3, close to nine lakh applications for various welfare schemes have been collected till now. But during many of these programmes, not only the public but even the government officials are often seen without masks and violating the social distancing norm. When asked, a health department official unwilling to be named claimed that they had asked all the districts to use the gatherings at the programme for encouraging inoculation and Covid testing as well. “Even proper guidelines for Covid management at such gatherings had also been sent to all the districts,” he said. The official added that statistically, there hasn’t been any evidence to suggest that the outreach programme led to a spike in cases. Rajiv Ranjan, who is the spokesperson of the ruling party of Congress, hit back at BJP and said, “The party has no moral right to accuse the state of callousness after the Narendra Modi-led government hosted ‘Namaste Trump’ and other self-promotional events amid a pandemic.” Ranjan argued that despite the Centre’s apathy towards the state in terms of giving resources to fight Covid, the Jharkhand government’s management of the pandemic was one of the best in the country as many hailed the way it handled challenges that followed the lockdown and the migrant crisis. “Despite having limited resources, our infection rate and mortality rate was lower compared to the BJP-ruled states. Even now, the situation here is better than in other parts of the country,” he said, adding that the reason why BJP trying to defame the public connect programme is because it is rattled by its success. “For the first time, the government is reaching out to the people to listen to their problems and offer solutions and the success of the programme and the growing popularity of our government will naturally make the BJP nervous,” Ranjan said. Shahdeo, who has been critical of the programme ever since its commencement, said, “In the last two years, the government’s only achievement has been its failure to maintain law and order and make false promises to the public.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-criticises-govt-outreach-prog-for-violating-cov-norms/articleshow/88110838.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Bandhu slams babus for denying promotions to SC/ST employees||Ranchi: Bandhu Tirkey, Mandar MLA of the ruling Congress, on Sunday hit out at state bureaucracy over pending promotions to scores of SC/ST employees in state government jobs saying the babus are deliberately attempting to derail the democratic system. He also went on to claim that “babus” consider themselves above the lawmakers and officials don’t even listen to the chief minister. Tirkey was upset over delay in promotions of ST/SC officials for years and many of whom are retiring every month. Due to the government’s apathy, they are losing out on retirement benefits, which in turn is a grave injustice to those hailing from the SC/ST community. Addressing a press conference, Tirkey said assembly speaker Rabindranath Mahto formed a three-member committee of tribal MLAs in March last year following a question raised by him on this issue in the assembly. The committee members included Sarfaraz Ahmed (Congress), Neelkant Singh Munda (BJP) and Deepak Birua (JMM). Tirkey was roped in as a special invitee in the committee. “The committee gave its report six months back to the assembly with recommendations to immediately remove the bar clamped on SC/ST promotions. The CM had ordered stoppage of all promotions in this category in December last year till further orders. During our successive meetings with the CM, he agreed with our findings and recommendations and directed the departments concerned to do the needful within 15 days. But it is ironic that nothing has moved,” rued Tirkey, adding that the bureaucrats are deliberately delaying it. “This is just one example of bureaucracy thinking it is above the lawmakers. It shows that babus don’t even listen to the CM. If things don’t move in another fortnight, I along with other tribal MLAs will be forced to agitate,” he said. The veteran MLA and Congress’s co-working president said despite being a tribal-dominated state, majority of tribals working in different cadres of state government have been devoid of promotions since the formation of Jharkhand. “Junior officials of general category get timely promotions over SC/ST officials. The assembly committee had recommended that promotions must be given immediately and all those who retired over the years in want of promotion must be compensated financially. Not only this, the committee also recommended to identify all such wrong promotions to general class and FIRs against erring officials under SC/ST atrocity act,” he said, sharing a few details of the recommendations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bandhu-slams-babus-for-denying-promotions-to-sc/st-employees/articleshow/88110843.cms||ASRP Mukesh

In its state focus paper for 2022-23, which has been submitted to the state government, it said that a strategy to improve ground level credit flow is in place, but the government also needs to address impediments that hinder disbursement of credit. The paper said that ground level credit flow increased from Rs 4643.5 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 5191.4 crore in 2020-21, out of which the agriculture sector had a share of just 18%. “Land title issue is a serious impediment for issue of crop loans by banks in the state,” said the paper. “Policy reforms in land ownership, community farming and contract farming are needed on a priority basis.” Uncertainty about land rights continues to plague the state, with around 25,000 cases still pending before various authorities. As per statistics released by the legislative assembly in August, there are around 3,500 cases pending under the Agricultural Tenancy Act, 3000 cases stuck under the Mundkar Act, ownership claims under alvara land are around 3,500, while at least 800 individuals are fighting for ownership as per the Mayem evacuee property clause. Aside from this, there are around 10,000 claims by tribals under the Forest Rights Act, all of which remain unresolved. “The land records need to be updated quickly and regularly. Bankers need to be given access to the web portal so that they can check the ownership titles of farmers online and register their lien on providing loans and removing the lien on discharge of loans,” said the paper. The state government has begun the process to operationalise a state-wide property register, which will be online and which will give various departments and stakeholders access to real-time property records. Nabard said that such a system could eliminate the need for farmers to submit a ‘no-dues certificate’, which in turn will enable banks to lend to farmers. It also said that a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) sub-committee tasked with improving Goa’s credit-deposit (CD) ratio has come up with a roadmap to improve the CD ratio to 40% by March 2022. As on March 31, 2021, the state’s CD ratio stood at 34%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-needs-farming-reforms-clarity-in-land-ownership-says-nabard/articleshow/88111314.cms||---

A meting of the district committee members of the Ekikrit Para Sikshak Sangharsh Morcha at Morabadi ground decided that they would submit a memorandum addressed to chief minister Hemant Soren to the MLAs and ministers on December 13 and 14. The para-teachers would also hold meetings at the district and block levels on December 12 and 19 to draw up a plan for gathering at Morabadi ground on December 29 where they would welcome the government if it announces the regularisation of their services. The para-teachers also plan a massive demonstration if their demands are not fulfilled. Education minister Jagannath Mahto has promised the para-teachers that the government would announce implementation of rules regarding their appointment on December 29, which marks the completion of two years of the current dispensation. An association member Rishikesh Pathak said, “We are now fed up by the government’s delay in meeting our demands. We have been given several timelines in the past. However, this time we would stage protests across the state if government fails to fulfil its promise.” He mentioned that the chief minister had promised during the 2019 election campaign that he would regularise the para-teachers and fix their wages within three months of coming to power. Around 65,000 para-teachers in the state are demanding wages on the lines of Bihar. In Bihar, trained para-teachers are getting payscale ranging from Rs 5,200-Rs 20,200 per month with provisions for provident fund and annual increment. The untrained teachers get around Rs 17,000 per month. In Jharkhand,para-teachers are getting between Rs 12,000 and Rs 15,000 per month. Meanwhile, teacher associations of government schools on Sunday decided to postpone their programme to gherao the chief minister’s residence to January. Earlier, the teachers had announced to stage the agitation on December 18 to protest amendment in the timetable of government schools and fulfilment of demands, including modified assured career progression and promotion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/para-teachers-to-approach-mlas-ministers-for-job-regularisation/articleshow/88110885.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The violator was found to have constructed two additional floors on his residential structure without any permissions and was operating a guesthouse from there. While the violator was able to prove that the ground floor of the structure existed prior to 1991, the two additional floors were found to have been constructed later in complete violation of norms. The GCZMA had first issued a showcause notice to the Mandrem resident in January this year. But the violator approached the high court fearing demolition and the court asked the GCZMA to give an opportunity of a personal hearing to the offender. The authority then began the process of hearings and issued another showcause notice to the offender. As per the showcause, the illegal construction of the two additional floors consisted of a total area of 154sqm and the structure was within 200m from the HTL. The violator has told the tribunal that in absence of finalisation of the coastal zone management plan for Goa, it cannot be said that the entire structure falls within CRZ-I or the no-development zone. The tribunal, however, said that the violator had sought permission for repair and renovation of the house. However, in violation of the permission, he had constructed additional structures on the first and second floors, and that the second floor was being “exploited for commercial purposes”. NGT also noted that the violator was given sufficient opportunity for hearings following the high court directives. The offender has constructed the two additional floors at his own risk, this despite being fully aware that the permissions granted were only for repairs, the tribunal further said. Refusing to quash GCZMA’s demolition orders, NGT said, “The first respondent (GCZMA) has already taken into account the relevant facts and circumstances and after offering opportunity of a personal hearing and also by adhering to the principles of natural justice, has rightly reached the conclusion.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ngt-upholds-mandrem-guesthouse-demolition-order/articleshow/88111403.cms||---

The Chandigarh administration has sent a detailed proposal to the ministry of home affairs (MHA), seeking appointment of an agency to kick-start the work on ground. The ministry of power has already given its consent for the project to the UT administration. For the project, an exclusive mobile app will be launched where consumers of all the categories will be able to monitor their consumed power units on a daily basis to avoid any kind of anomalies and ambiguities in the power bills. The entire billing of the consumed power units will be done through the software. “Currently, the bill readers visit consumers’ place to take the reading, after which the hired agency generates the power bills. But with these smart meters, the software will itself take the reading to generate the bill and manual work to take reading will be phased out. Both residential and commercial properties will be covered under this project of smart metering,” sources said. The prepaid meter option will also be a crucial feature of the project, but it will be introduced at a later stage. “Since this project is very crucial for the city, the idea of transparency and hassle-free service for consumers has been kept in the mind,” sources said. The prepaid meter option will work like prepaid mobile SIM cards and consumers will be able to recharge the power units as per their requirements, a senior official told TOI. The deadline to convert the existing meters into smart meters is March 2022, but it will be up to the central government as it has to finalise the agency for the work. “Since the allotment of the said project depends on the directions from the government, we have asked them to finalize the agency in our detailed proposal,” sources said. The project to convert the existing meters into smart meters will be done under the National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM). The Chandigarh administration has already established a control centre in Sector 18, which will work as a command centre for the project, the official added. Pilot project Since the pilot project of smart metering is going on in areas of Sectors 29, 31, 47, 48, Industrial Area Phase-1 and 2, and villages of Faida, Ram Darbar, Hallo Majra, Raipur Kalan, Makhan Majra and Daria, the Chandigarh administration has a plan to convert around 26,000 meters under the pilot project. “Out of these 26,000 meters, we have changed around 17,000 meters into smart meters and the work to replace other meters under this pilot project is under way,” officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/power-meters-to-go-smart-in-chandigarh/articleshow/88111766.cms||Deepak Yadav

While 1,046 of these children lost their fathers, the mothers of 105 kids succumbed to the infection. There are 72 who lost both their parents. The government data has also revealed that while 1,162 children were approved by the government for the Mukhyamantri Bal Seva Yojna, only 666 got the benefits so far. Ghaziabad, the most populated district in the zone, also has the highest number of such children. A total of 406 kids lost one or both their parents in the district. Among them, 353 lost their fathers and 28 their mothers. There are 25 children who lost both their parents, according to the data. Ghaziabad is followed by Meerut (293), Hapur (191), Bulandshahr (169), Noida (105), and Baghpat, which reported 59 such children. In Meerut, 270 children lost their fathers and seven their mothers. The district reported 16 orphans. In Noida, 48 kids lost their fathers while the mothers of nine succumbed to Covid. A few months ago, the state government had launched the scheme for arranging the maintenance, education, and medical facilities for such children. According to the government’s order, an amount of Rs 4,000 a month would be given to such kids. Children studying in classes IX and above would be provided with a laptop each. There is also a provision to admit such students into Atal Residential Schools and Kasturba Gandhi Residential Schools. According to the criteria for identifying such minor children, the victim must be a resident of Uttar Pradesh and should have lost a parent whose annual income was not more than Rs 2 lakh. All children of a family will be able to get the benefit of the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/406-kids-lost-1-or-both-parents-to-covid-in-gzb/articleshow/88111492.cms||---

On the night of November 27, 2019, a 26-year-old veterinary doctor was killed on the outskirts of Hyderabad. Later four men were arrested and subsequently killed in an alleged encounter with the police on December 6. The killing has led to a Supreme court-appointed judicial probe into the encounter, but for the victim's family, nothing has changed. Talking about the gruesome rape and murder, Disha's father told TOI, "Whenever such incidents happen, the judicial system should ensure that culprits are punished at most in a month," he said, and added that unless reforms are brought in the judicial system, victims and their families will not get justice. Life has become a living hell, after her loss: Disha's father  Disha's father said,"After losing my elder daughter, we stopped going out completely. Life has become a living hell." "We are always worried about the safety of our younger daughter," he said. He said that the family did not receive any kind of compensation from anyone and added that a few people tried to earn money by maligning his daughter' and family's name. "My younger daughter is a central government employee. All we wanted from the state is a government job for her in the same cadre under the state government. But, even that did not materialise," he said. The aggrieved father said that the state and the police officials should try to educate girls, especially in schools and colleges, and ensure that they know whom to contact and how to defend themselves when they are in distress. "Why can't police organise awareness programmes in schools and colleges for girls. Teach them how to protect themselves, how to survive in any situation. Even if five out of 10 girls get benefitted and are saved because of these programmes, what more do we need," he asked. Disha's father said that while neighbouring Andhra Pradesh government has introduced Disha Act, nothing much has been done in Telangana to improve women's safety. "After the incident happened, a few people visited us, but no one stood by us. It was our family who has been dealing with the ordeal all alone," he said.

In the last two days, each district reported double the number of vaccination from what it was a week ago. Revenue authorities have also swung into action to speed up the programme and have been persuading individuals to get vaccinated, especially those who are overdue for second dose. Data on second dose overdue shows that smaller districts, such as Jangaon have been proactive in getting second doses, with only about 3,000 persons overdue, whereas larger districts such as Ranga Reddy have lakhs of people overdue for the vaccine. Hyderabad is at the top of this list, with 5.9 lakh people remaining on the waiting list. Telangana's total second dose coverage around 46%  While Jangaon (2,968), Narayanpet (4,251), Wanaparthy (4,575), Jogulamba Gadwal (6,029) and Yadadri Bhongir (9,263) have the fewest eligible people who are due for their second dose. So far, the state's total second dose coverage is around 46 %. Hyderabad has the highest coverage of second dosage at 72 %, followed by Karimnagar (71%), Rangareddy (68 %) and Hanamakonda (68 %). In the remaining districts, second dose coverage is less than 60%. Given the Omicron concern, experts believe that taking a second dose is crucial. "The Omicron is notified as Variant of Concern-6, which spreads quickly, and in the case of such variants, WHO has suggested that taking both doses is vital to prevent the risk of serious infection," said Dr Kiran Madala, an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) certified researcher.

Sarpanch Caetan da Lima announced that the meeting was postponed as they were not allowed to conduct a gram sabha in the absence of a BDO observer. However, those present at the venue insisted that he conduct the meeting. Former panchayat member Caetan Carvalho demanded that the permission issued to a builder for a commercial building at Novimodi in Tilamoll be revoked it was blocking access to over 70 houses. In 2020, acting on a complaint, the panchayat had issued a stop work order to the builder. Carvalho alleged that the builder then produced a revised plan and his proposal was approved without holding a meeting of the panchayat body. Refuting the charges, the sarpanch said, “We will send notices and conduct a site inspection in the presence of a technical person.” Meanwhile, residents of a housing board colony opposed the development of an open space claiming that the space belonged them. Other villagers, however, said that everybody had a right to it as it was under the jurisdiction of the panchayat. Interestingly, the housing board had handed over the space to the Xeldem panchayat which has started developing sporting facilities including a volleyball court, a football ground and a garden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/land-devpt-issues-rock-xeldem-meet/articleshow/88111522.cms||---

Though in 2021 so far, issuance of international driving licences has picked up pace a bit, it is yet to catch up with figures of the pre-Covid years. According to data, the Registering and Licensing Authority (RLA) issued 800 to 1,200 licences each year between 2015 and 2019, but the number dropped drastically to merely 289 in 2020 as many people refrained to go to foreign countries in view of travel ban because of Covid-19. The process also took a hit with the RLA office remaining closed for a few days. Records showed that in the months of April and May in 2020, not even a single licence was issued. Even in 2021, no international licence was issued in May. It happened for the first time in the past seven years (2015 to 2021) that no licence was issued in any month.

---||Goa||Goa: BJP rebels unite under ‘Together for Saligao’ to field independent candidate||PANAJI: In a major setback to BJP in Saligao, a rebel group of its karyakartas, under the banner ‘Together for Saligao’, on Sunday, took the decision to field a candidate against the party’s candidate from the constituency in the upcoming assembly elections. The group is likely to field an independent candidate. The rebel group has shortlisted two probable candidates, Kedar Naik and Rupesh Naik, sarpanch and zilla panchayat member of Reis Magos, respectively. The rebel group organised a massive show of strength on Sunday at Verem to protest the entry of former Saligao MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar into BJP. Over 1,000 people attended the meeting, including former BJP Saligao mandal members, former mahila morcha members, former yuva morcha and former OBC morcha members, among others. Former vice president of the Saligao mandal, Fondu Naik said that they will conduct a survey in Saligao constituency and finalise one of the two names. “We will finalise either Rupesh or Kedar as a candidate for Saligao constituency to fight against the BJP candidate,” he said. Rupesh said that the decision to induct Salgaonkar into BJP was taken without taking the former Saligao BJP mandal and karyakartas into confidence. He said that the decision came as a big shock to all party workers. Kedar said that they will consult all karyakartas while deciding their plan of action. Three days ago, suspecting a revolt by the Saligao karyakartas, BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade had dissolved all the various wings of BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-rebels-unite-under-together-for-saligao-to-field-ind/articleshow/88111526.cms||---

A complaint about the alleged illegal road was filed with the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) recently by the Calangute Constituency Forum (CCF). The complaint states that the 3m-wide and 200m-long road is being constructed in a private property next by destroying beach vegetation, sand dunes and removing sand, and by using mud, and construction debris, which could cause irreversible damage to the beach. The CCF said that the road is being built in violation of the no-development zone (NDZ) of the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ), the Environment Protection Act 1986 and the Biological Diversity Act 2002.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/illegal-beach-rd-being-built-at-calangute/articleshow/88111530.cms||---
---||Pune||7 new detections take Maharashtra's Omicron count to 8||MUMBAI: Seven new cases of the Omicron variant were detected in Maharashtra on Sunday, taking the state's tally of those found infected with the new Covid strain to eight. Six of the infected cases were from Pimpri-Chinchwad and one from Pune. In Mumbai, the count of international travellers under suspicion of the variant went up to 19 with an addition of six cases on Sunday. Dharavi got its first Omicron suspect with a 49-year-old priest, who returned from Tanzania, testing positive for Covid. The city doesn't have any confirmed Omicron detections yet. The state health department said six of the Pimpri-Chinchwad infections were from a single cluster. A 44-year-old woman and her daughters aged 12 and 17 years, who had come from Lagos in Nigeria to visit her brother in Pimpri-Chinchwad, were infected with Omicron. As the trio tested positive for Covid, 13 of their contacts were traced and tested. Subsequently, the woman's 45-year-old brother and his two daughters, 7 and 1.5 years old, were also found to be infected with the variant. Of the six affected from the family, all adults are fully vaccinated. Their samples were sequenced and found positive for Omicron at Pune's National Institute of Virology. The seventh person to test positive was a 47-year-old Pune resident who had visited Finland from November 18 to 25. He was tested on November 29 as he had mild fever and was found Covid positive. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said he has taken both doses of the Covishield vaccine and was completely stable. "Barring the 44-year-old woman, all are asymptomatic.  Even she has very mild symptoms," he said. Awate added that the three adults have taken both vaccine doses -- two have taken Covishield and one Covaxin. A 34-year-old man from Kalyan-Dombivli with a travel history from South Africa was the first to test positive in the state. "The cases we have heard of today are mostly sporadic micro clusters with mild symptoms and history of travel. We are seeing some degree of spread but it will be premature to talk of transmissibility," said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the Covid taskforce. "There is a need to prevent clusters from them and ensure people at large don't panic. It's a new variant and not a completely new virus, so the basics of Covid control will still be effective. People must double-mask." In Mumbai, six more international travellers were found positive for Covid. Overall, 19 travellers and six of their contacts are admitted to SevenHills Hospital under suspicion of Omicron, said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC's executive health officer. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said 16 of the 25 samples are being tested in Kasturba Hospital and nine have been sent to NIV. The results of some Mumbai samples are expected on Monday. The Dharavi suspect, a maulvi of 49, returned from Tanzania on November 4. The KDMC has found four contacts of a family, who had previously returned from Nigeria, to be positive for Covid. The family's genome sequencing reports are awaited. The corporation had traced six contacts, of which four have been found positive, including two relatives from Hyderabad and two from Navi Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/seven-new-detections-take-maharashtras-omicron-count-to-8/articleshow/88120324.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Goa||Next chief minister from Congress, our alliance partner: Vijai Sardesai||PANAJI: Goa Forward Party (GFP) president Vijai Sardesai on Sunday went ahead and said that the next chief minister of Goa will be from Congress even as the party shies away from formalising the alliance between the two. Addressing a political rally at Fatorda, Sardesai urged people to support Congress and GFP in the coming elections. A day earlier, Sardesai made a similar appeal at Mayem. “To send corrupt BJP home, we have made an alliance with Congress. For this we need the people’s support,” he said. “Next chief minister would be from our alliance partner Congress, it being a major partner.” Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao has avoided reference to any alliance and has said that GFP has only given their ‘support’ to Congress and that nitty-gritties of an alliance still need to be worked out. GFP is fielding Santosh Kumar Sawant from Mayem and Sardesai said he expects Sawant to win by at least 5,000 votes. At Fatorda, GFP held a ‘Mull Goykarancho Ekvott Mellavo’ where at least 600 people were present. Sardesai inducted 345 youth from the ST community into GFP. Sardesai also said that BJP has encouraged Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) to contest the 2022 state assembly elections in Goa and divide the anti-BJP votes. Sardesai said that BJP has failed to manage the finances of the state and has emptied the exchequer. “This government has failed even to release salaries of government servants. It is borrowing to pay salaries. It has mismanaged the finance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/next-cm-from-cong-our-alliance-partner-sardesai/articleshow/88111548.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||MC to put stray dogs up for adoption, help train them||Panchkula: In a bid to tackle the stray dog menace in Panchkula, the municipal corporation plans to give stray dogs up for adoption to resident welfare associations or individual residents. The civic body also plans to pitch in for their training and medical upkeep, for which they will keep the dogs in the dog hostel at Sukhdarshanpur dog rehabilitation centre. Earlier, when MC officials caught the stray dogs and kept them in the Sukhdharshanpur centre, various NGOs objected, terming the practice illegal. In the face of opposition, the MC had to free the dogs at their original place. Elaborating on the plan, mayor Kulbhushan Goyal said, “Every day, at least 10 dog bite cases are being reported in the district, which is cause for concern. When we started catching dogs to make the city stray dog free, various NGOs moved against us in a legal way and we had to free the stray dogs on the streets again.” He added, “With this new plan of adoption, dog owners can keep their pets in the hostel. We would be able to keep all stray dogs in the dog hostel at Sukhdarshanpur and provide them basic training, food and health check-ups from time to time. Proper care of stray dogs will be ensured.” The idea has been discussed with officials concerned and once adoption documents are ready, stray dogs will be shifted to hostels. Legal issue Catching stray dogs and keeping them in dog pounds is not allowed under the law unless the dog is injured or has been nabbed for sterilisation. According to the rules, the MC must drop stray dogs back to the place from where they were caught for sterilisation or for medical treatment. NGOs working for the welfare of dogs objected when the Panchkula MC caught dogs on the pretext of sterilisation and kept them in the dog pound. MC plan According to data, 10 dog bite cases are being reported at the civil hospital in Sector 6 every day. Therefore, the civic body is asking people to adopt stray dogs. It will also ask RWAs to adopt and admit them in the dog hostel at Sukhdarshanpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-to-put-stray-dogs-up-for-adoption-help-train-them/articleshow/88111848.cms||Arvind Bishnoi
---||Goa||PC asks workers to unite to secure victory in Navelim||Margao: Congress observer for Goa, former finance minister, P Chidambaram, on Sunday exhorted party workers from Navelim constituency to sink all their differences and put up a united front once the candidature is announced so as to ensure that Congress retains the seat. Stating that the party has zeroed in on two candidates for the constituency, Chidambaram urged party workers to work wholeheartedly for whoever gets the ticket. Congress suffered a huge setback following the exit of its Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro two months ago, who is now the national vice-president of Trinamool Congress (TMC). The Navelim seat, a traditional stronghold of Congress, is likely to witness a fierce battle as Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao — who is likely to severe ties with NCP and declare his next moves soon — is determined to field his daughter, Valanka, from Navelim. Avertano Furtado who had contested against Faleiro in the 2017 polls as a BJP-backed independent, is now in the Congress camp and among its probable candidates. Speaking further, Chidambaram apologised on behalf of Congress for the defection by several of its MLAs to BJP, betraying the people’s mandate. In order to ensure that defections don’t recur, Chidambaram said, “Since you will be choosing your candidates, you have to make them accountable so that they don’t switch parties.” Exuding confidence that Congress will form the next government in Goa, Chidambaram said, “Whoever wins Goa will win the Parliament election. We won the Goa election in 2007, and in 2009 we won the Parliament election. In 2012 we lost the Goa election and in 2014 we lost the Parliament election. This time we are determined to win Goa and then win India.” Hitting out at the BJP government for rising prices, Chidambaram assured that Congress will reduce taxes once it forms the government. He also said that Congress was exploring ways to generate employment and thereby prevent brain drain. Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat said that people were fed up with the BJP government’s false promises, and urged people to bring Congress back in the forthcoming polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pc-asks-workers-to-unite-to-secure-victory-in-navelim/articleshow/88111568.cms||---

Congress functionary and aspirant of the party’s ticket, Altone D’Costa told reporters that have learnt that more than 1,000 migrants voters have applied for enrolment without cancelling their voting cards from their native state. The enrolment drive was held from November 1 to November 30, during which period the Quepem mamlatdar’s office received around 2,500 news application for enrolment. “We don’t want bogus migrant voters. Only genuine voters will elect our leaders. The government must delete these names within 15 days or else we shall be constrained to agitate and come on the road to protest the illegalities,” D’Costa said. Between November 27 and November 30, the mamlatdar’s office received 1,183 applications, of which around 90% were that of migrants who are voters in their native states, D’Costa alleged. Congress functionary Altino Gomes said that they have brought the fraudulently applications to the notice of the assistant returning officer with documentary evidence. Gaonkar said that he will start scrutiny of all names from Monday. “There are around 600 forms without proper documentation. I will take a personal hearing of the applicants who are above 25 years of age and will ask them to produce valid documents. Applications will be rejected if documents are forged,” he said. As per the guidelines last date of disposal of claims and objections is December 20, 2021 and final elections role will be publish on January 5, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/2k-fraud-voters-trying-to-enrol-on-quepem-list-alleges-cong/articleshow/88111565.cms||---
---||Goa||Raise kokum tree cover for Ponda laterite quarry: Panel||PANAJI: The Goa State Expert Appraisal Committee (GSEAC), while considering the proposal for environment clearance for a laterite quarry in Ponda, has recommended that bamboo and kokum tree plantation should be cultivated around the quarry by the leaseholder to control dust pollution. The suggestion was made at GSEAC’s meeting on November 24, after the committee conducted a site inspection in September and approved the case for environment clearance. As per the norms of the Central Pollution Control Board, those carrying out quarrying have to develop a green belt around the area. The selection of plant species for such plantations should be done in consultation with either the forest department or the zonal agriculture office. In the case of the quarry in Ponda, GSEAC has itself identified the species of plantation to be cultivated around the quarry. “The committee recommended the plantation of bamboo and kokum trees along the main road to control dust pollution,” GSEAC said in its meeting. The state has been seeing a series of complaints lately from locals against laterite quarries, either for lacking the required permissions or for flouting different safety norms. Different local groups have alleged lax monitoring by authorities of laterite quarrying activities and the safety measures adopted at such quarries. There is also poor compliance of remediation of quarry site once the laterite is extracted and the quarry is abandoned. In the case of the Ponda laterite quarry, GSEAC has said that transportation of quarried material should be done by covering the trucks with tarpaulin so that no spillage of material or dust takes place along the route. Quarrying activity should only take place from 6am to 6pm, conditions for the environment clearance state. “The mining officer in-charge of quarrying operations on-site shall submit six-monthly report specifying the status of compliance of the stipulated environmental clearance conditions to the Directorate of Mines and Geology (DMG), Goa, this Authority as well as Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB),” GSEAC has stated. It must be ensured that the Ambient Air Quality (AAQ) parameters are measured in January, April and November every year, GSEAC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/raise-kokum-tree-cover-for-ponda-laterite-quarry-panel/articleshow/88111577.cms||---

However, the violators were caught red-handed by municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, who was on his customary 20km run. A team of civic officials soon rushed to the spot, and a complaint was registered with the police station immediately. This is just one of the many actions taken by Radhakrishnan while on his morning walk or cycle ride over last one year. The civic body started asphalting 18 major roads, which were in bad shape, due to the mornings he spends on the roads for fitness. A hardcore runner and cyclist, the 39-year-old Radhakrishnan is very popular among officials of police, railways, income tax department etc. Inspired by him, a deputy commissioner of police (DCP) has launched a WhatsApp group titled ‘Run with commissioner’. “We discuss who all are coming and set the time a day earlier. I run at least 21km or cycle 50km three-four days a week. I begin at 6-6.30am and have covered many localities of West, South-West and South Nagpur. Now my target is East and North Nagpur. I have even cycled to places in Madhya Pradesh. I started running when I was collector at Nashik. I started cycling here,” says Radhakrishnan. A native of Tamil Nadu, Radhakrishnan and his group also completed a 200km cycling brevet in September. DCP Gajanan Rajmane is one who frequently runs with Radhakrishnan. Pictures taken by Radhakrishnan’s running and cycling partners show a person who does not hesitate to drink at public taps when his bottle brought from home is exhausted, rests on footpaths, road-dividers, gardens etc and uses public toilets. “I see the city as a common man in the morning, and solve many problems before even reaching office. Things I see outside help while discussing problems or projects with NMC officials. I am aware of ground situation at some sites. Even as Nashik collector, I used to call up civic officials while running,” he said. The ever-smiling Radhakrishnan is known in NMC for his simple behaviour and nature. During his 24km run on Saturday, he inspected works started on his directives to repair manhole covers on busy Wardha Road at Ajni Square. “I joined at Nagpur in August but was busy containing Covid-19. I started running from October, and happened to discover some workers of private agency collect garbage on alternate days in Gittikhadan. I often interact with locals and get true feedback as I never reveal my identity,” he says. Some public toilets in West and South-West Nagpur are wearing a neat look now as Radhakrishnan uses them. “I hope officials now maintain cleanliness on roads, footpath or public toilets across the city. I stop at public toilets or footpath, garden and check amenities even when on officials visits. I also proposed new roads for convenience of people when I ran in some localities,” he said. For Radhakrishnan and other officials in his group, the morning fitness time is without bodyguards or government vehicles. “Running and cycling have helped me quickly become familiar with the city. I even call up other departments like traffic police, state PWD, NIT, MSEDCL etc,” he said. Radhakrishnan has also spurred cycling culture among NMC officials and workers. NMC is also developing special lanes for cycling and running in the city due to his initiative. He is also planning to keep more roads dedicated for walking and fitness for a couple of hours every day, like Walkers Street or Old Airport Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/beware-citizens-and-officials-the-civic-chief-is-on-the-move/articleshow/88111049.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

In violation of the state government’s decision, NIT has decided to adjust the cost of the land in its share of Rs 250 crore to be disbursed to the civic body for the Smart City Project. These two decisions were taken by the NIT board of trustees in the meeting held on July 13. The minutes of the meeting were approved in the board’s meeting held on October 4. It has come to the fore that the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) raised the issue with the government a few days ago. As per the minutes of the meeting, NIT owns 32.39 acres in mouza Bharatwada and Punapur which comes under the Smart City Project. The NMC has proposed to allot plots and flats to people whose land will be taken for construction of roads and gardens. The proposal is to allot land and flats by taking over NIT’s 32.39 acres. In the meeting, NIT chairman Manoj Kumar Suryawanshi said the Smart City Project’s special purpose vehicle — Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation (NSSCDCL) should take over the land at the market value. He added that the value of the land will be adjusted in the share to be given by the NIT. In the meeting, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said land was very important for systematic development of the city. He also said land should be given for Smart City Project at a nominal rate of Rs 1. He added the process to hand over the land should be conducted after the decision of the government, but the NIT board went ahead and decided to allot the land at market value for the project and adjust the amount in its share. As per NMC sources, the market value of the land is likely to be around Rs 50-60 crore. The NMC had proposed to develop all areas situated in mouza Pardi, Punapur, Bharatwada and Bhandewadi under the Smart City Project. The central and state governments had approved Rs 750 crore and the remaining share of Rs 250 crore was to be borne by the NMC. In May 2016, the government had taken a decision that the NIT will bear the NMC’s share of Rs 250 crore. The government had also decided that the NIT will give Rs 50 crore each in five years beginning from 2016. The NIT was asked to bear the share as collected developmental charges from plots situated in these areas and allegedly did not execute all works. Till date, the NIT had given only Rs 100 crore for the project. Now, the NIT has decided to adjust the value of land in the remaining share of Rs 150 crore. “NIT’s delayed disbursement of Rs 150 crore is itself a violation of the government’s order. NIT cannot adjust the land’s cost in its share,” said NMC officials. As per the reports of various committees, the NIT allotted land to government, private and trust-run organizations at nominal rates in the past. IN A NUTSHELL * NMC proposes devpt of areas in mouza Pardi, Punapur, Bharatwada & Bhandewadi under Smart City Project * Central & state govts clear Rs 750cr, NMC was to bear Rs 250cr * Govt decides NIT will give Rs 250cr to NMC by 2020 * NIT gave only Rs 100cr * NMC sought 32.39 acres from NIT for plots & flats to PAPs * NIT allots land to govt, pvt & trusts at nominal rate * But allots land to NMC at market value * NIT decides to adjust land cost in remaining share of Rs 150cr * Decisions despite civic chief objections||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nit-creates-row-demands-market-rate-for-32-acres-land-for-smart-city-project/articleshow/88111062.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Citing the year 2023 being declared as International Year of Millets by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Union secretary to the ministry Sudhanshu Pandey has also suggested to the state to work on crop diversification, especially for production of millets. Pandey, who along with officials of Food Corporation of India and other state agencies visited paddy procurement centre at Kardha in Bhandara district a day ago, expressed satisfaction over the operations and advised the officials to improve infrastructure. He also interacted with the farmers and encouraged them to avail the benefits of various schemes launched by the government. He informed the farmers about a new testing method, which can detect the age of rice. Pandey also visited a fair price shop (FPS) at Kardha, where he interacted with the owner and some beneficiaries and reportedly expressed satisfaction over the distribution of ration under National Food Security Act and Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana. On his return to the city, the secretary held a review meeting in which secretary of state’s food department Vijay Waghmare, general manager (FCI) MS Sarang, divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare-Verma, collectors Nayana Gunde (Gondia), Sandip Kadam (Bhandara), Prerna Deshbhratar (Wardha) and Ajay Gulhane (Chandrapur), and other officials were present. “Promote solvent extraction plants for manufacturing rice bran oil in the paddy districts. Set up grain-based distilleries for production of ethanol, thereby promoting cultivation of maize,” he said. Pandey said, “East Vidarbha is paddy bowl of the region. The rice varieties grown in this part are traditional. But these varieties do not get satisfactory price. Because of lack of awareness about nutrition values of these varieties, most of the produce goes into the PDS. My department has taken note of all these issues and will write to the state.” Pandey said there is gap of 20% between production and demand of pulses in the country. “Farmers should be encouraged for more production of pulses, soyabean and groundnut,” he said. Sarang briefed the secretary about FCI operations and various issues related to procurement, storage and distribution in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/set-up-fortified-rice-units-in-vid-centre-to-maha/articleshow/88111068.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The CM said that the project will be funded through the district mineral fund Chief minister informed that the water stagnated in about 10 mining pits would be more than the availability in Anjunem dam reservoir. “If this water is channeled using modern techniques, around 350-hectare area will come under the green zone,” he said.  Sawant announced that the project will be funded through the district mineral fund. He said that the project would be handled by a private agency for the first three years and later the government will train the local farmers to shoulder the responsibility.  Chief engineer of water resources department Pramod Badami gave detailed information about the project.

It was due to his key posting in the Police Gymkhana that seniors suspect him to be an informer of the top brass who may have grown close to him during his stint. The senior police personnel, after having completed four years at the Police Gymkhana, was shifted to the crime branch as per his choice by CP Amitesh Kumar who had started a trend of allotting posting as per the preference of the cops due for transfer. He was posted at one of the units of the crime branch. The police personnel was left stunned as he would be kept out of raids, detections and such actions routine in the crime branch’s zonal unit. He would be kept out of most actions by some seniors who themselves had refused to take up postings at police stations despite CP’s order, it’s learnt. Sources stated it was feared that the personnel would leak information to the top brass about the daily developments in the unit and hence he would be asked to sit out of most actions. The cop, who had a case against him in the past, was also behind several detections at police stations. The police personnel was later left stunned as the unit in-charge of the crime branch had influenced a senior officer to transfer him on the pretext of his advanced age. He was shifted to Bharosa cell against his wish. As he refused to join the unit, he was placed at the office of the DCP detection. “The cop was tossed around in the crime branch because everyone thought he would secretly update CP and Addl CP because of his earlier association with them as a gymkhana co-ordinator,” said an insider, The police personnel was sent to a unit which requires only maintaining and updating of records despite his eagerness to contribute to the detections for which he had requested the CP to place him in such unit. “CP had allotted me crime branch after I had promised to prove my mettle and make him proud of my contributions but never did I think of indulging in any unprofessional activities for which I was victimized,” he said while breaking down. According to a source, the police personnel had allegedly become a victim of the internal bickering of some cops in the crime branch and the head office. According to a senior officer, the victim cop should take up the issue with the CP and explain his stand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/previous-posting-haunting-cop-as-others-see-him-as-boss-informer/articleshow/88111095.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Brewing wine and making biz sense out of it||Nagpur: A government agriculture college would be perhaps the last choice for a person dreaming of classy lifestyle. During the times when Pune had begun the journey of growth, it was a hoarding with picture of a woman holding a glass of wine that left Kunal Chug inspired. The advertisement was of an altogether different product, but Chug saw that glass of wine as a symbol of lavish lifestyle. This eventually led him to pursue education in wine-making. The journey began from the Government Agriculture College in Pune. Later, it was education at France’s homeland for wine-making — the Erasmus Mundus campus. He also bagged a Rs50 lakh scholarship for the course, which also made headlines those days. Chug’s Virgin Hills brand, which had taken part in the Nagpur Wine Festival, is now a Rs20 crore business, he says. Coming from a family running grocery retail business, his father wanted to him to take a more conventional career. “I joined the agriculture college and passed out with a specialization in viticulture (science of growing grapes),” he says. “For most other joining agriculture college, the aim was to crack the MPSC exams. It was easy doing with the agriculture-related subjects. I am perhaps the only one from the entire batch, who took up entrepreneurship,” says Chug. Chug says he began in 2014 with starting a wine shop. It exclusively sold wines, but of all brands. Slowly, a winery on the verge of closure was leased out. This followed by buying land for a vineyard. The brand is available all over Maharashtra and recently launched in Nagpur too. There are plans to expand in other markets like Hyderabad and northern states. Nagesh Pai’s family has a chickoo (sapodilla) orchard in Dahanu on Maharashtra-Gujarat border. By 2006, the returns were falling as farmers realized low price for the fruit. Pai was working as a mechanical engineer in the US then. “Life was good, but rather too mechanical,” he says. There were plans to return to India and explore new roads. “My wife came back first and I joined her in 2012. By that time, we had some knowledge about fermentation. “We tried with chickoo wine and soon succeeded. It has now gained the market in Maharashtra. We are the first in the world to make wine out of chickoo,” says Pai, who has the Hill Zill brand of wines which was showcased at the Wine Festival too. The range now include wines out of pineapple, strawberry and lately jamun. “There are plans to come up with orange wine too. Work on it happened during the lockdown and the results are good. The fruit would be procured from Nagpur and around,” says Pai. The company which plans to expand its presence out of Maharashtra is also in talks with the authorities to launch the wines in Gujarat. “We are in talks with the authorities in Gujarat. There is a policy to issue licence for wine shops where consumers having a permit to drink can come and buy, said Pai. For Pai, guidance also came from Canada’s Dominic Rivard — known as a veteran in fruit-wine-making.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/brewing-wine-and-making-biz-sense-out-of-it/articleshow/88111132.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Goa||Extended monsoon may affect fish catch||Panaji: Extreme weather patterns, extended monsoon and unseasonal rainfall are likely to influence the fisheries sector in Goa, said experts from the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO). “It is well known that the structure and abundance of coastal marine and inshore fish communities are known to be greatly influenced by a wide variety of oceanographic factors. Although the abundance of fish can be correlated with various oceanographic variables, the actions and interactions of these variables are often so complex that the ‘cause effect’ relationships cannot be demonstrated unequivocally,” NIO fisheries scientist R A Sreepada said. He said that extreme weather patterns are likely to influence the immigration and emigration of fish species, their reproductive behaviour as well as availability of fish food organisms. This year, in a rare and unusual weather phenomenon, Goa received rainfall every month of the year. A series of cyclones have also proved to be a contributing factor in affecting marine life and fishing activities. “An increase in weather warnings by the India meteorological department due to cyclones, local fluctuations and localised depressions in the sea have resulted in a drastic fall in the number of fishing days. This is likely to result in relatively lower fish catch,” Sreepada said. However, he said that it is “too early to assess” the short-term and long-term impact of extended monsoon and unseasonal rain phenomenon on fisheries and overall marine life and ocean health as the “comparative assessment of data has not yet been synthesised.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/extended-monsoon-may-affect-fish-catch/articleshow/88111268.cms||Nida Sayed

According to police inspector Dnyaneshwar Nalat of Yavatmal ACB, the cops received a complaint from a 41-year-old Mohadi resident about the acting BDO Gautam Thakur demanding Rs50,000 for not filing FIR against his sister, who is the village sarpanch, about irregularities in the implementation of PM Aawas Yojana. Accordingly the ACB laid a trap on the panchayat samiti premises. As soon as the complainant handed over the money to the middleman Sanjay Nagargoje in the presence of Thakur, the ACB sleuths sprang into action. Even before the sleuths could nab the middleman, he handed over the cash to Thakur, who pocketed it and fled from the spot in his vehicle. The ACB team arrested Nagargoje and later also nabbed Thakur and recovered the bribe money. An offence under relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act has been registered against the duo. Further investigations are on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mahagaon-acting-bdo-in-acb-net/articleshow/88111247.cms||---

ASI Ratan Kumar Kar had set out on his motorcycle for Hasimara naka check point on Wednesday. The site where his body was discovered was barely 300m from the naka point where he was to report for duty. Locals spotted Kar in a ditch filled with bushes and shrubs, some 10 feet off the road, around 6am. Police from Jaigaon rushed over and recovered the body, which had already started decomposing. Cops from Kalchini and Alipurduar police stations also arrived, as did Alipurduar SP Bholanath Pandey. Kar’s motorcycle and helmet lay beside his body. His cellphone was also recovered at the spot. According to reports, after his disappearance, Kar’s mobile was located twice — once about a kilometre from the area and then again 8km away, inside Jaldapara national park. A post-mortem of the body was conducted at Alipurduar district hospital. His viscera was collected to be sent to the forensic science laboratory in Kolkata. A source said the preliminary autopsy report indicated that Kar had suffered a head injury leading to a brain haemorrhage, which likely caused his death. Police are now looking into the possibility of an accident having occurred. Alipurduar police formed a special investigation team to probe the assistant sub-inspector’s death. A sniffer dog was employed on Sunday to find leads on Kar’s whereabouts over the last four days.

Sources said 457 students and staffers of the residential school in NR Pura taluk run by the Union government were swabbed for Covid-19 over the weekend after a teacher tested positive three days ago. Students, staff asymptomaticAll the students and employees who have turned out positive for Covid-19 are asymptomatic. The taluk is about 330km from Bengaluru. This comes 10 days after a medical college in Dharwad turned out to be a hotspot with over 300 freshers and seniors testing positive for Covid-19 after attending a cultural event. Besides, Bengaluru, Tumakuru, Hassan and Mysuru districts have been sporadically reporting cases of Covid-19 outbreak in schools and colleges since mid-November. The school in NR Pura taluk has been sealed and sanitised. Senior health officials reviewed the situation after visiting the school. The infected students and employees have been quarantined in a part of the hostel. The school has class 1 to 12, with more than 450 resident students on the rolls. Both teaching and non-teaching employees stay on the campus. Chikkamagaluru deputy commissioner KN Ramesh told TOI swabs were collected on Friday and Saturday. Medical teams have been deputed to provide care and an ambulance has been kept on standby. “No need to panic,” he said.

On the last day of its subscription, the QIB portion was subscribed 215 times. Overall, the issue was oversubscribed by 219 times, the company has said. The QIB portion of the HDFC Asset Management Company was subscribed 192.2 times, followed by Indigo Paints 189.5 times, Tatva Chintan 185.2 times and Bectors Food Specialties 176.8 times. “Robust QIB category bid indicates money is waiting on the sidelines for quality IPOs since interest in the broader markets seems less. Brokerages are of the view that QIB interest is higher in new kinds of businesses where either there are little or no listed companies in that space,” experts added. The offer received bids for 2,09,58,69,600 shares against the offered 95,68,636 equity shares, as per the 5:00 pm data available on the bourses. Retail investors had put in bid 29.4 times the shares reserved for them, while the portion set aside for non-institutional investors was subscribed 666.1 times.

Mandaviya was accompanied by Union minister of information and broadcasting Anurag Thakur, who had visited AIIMS Bilaspur too. Sources said the minister was shown a presentation about the achievements of the institute. After spending almost two hours, the Union health minister also visited the advanced trauma centre, which witnesses highest inflow of patients every day from the adjoining states and union territories of Himachal , Haryana, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. The minister asked the doctors and the patients to send their feedback for the improvement of the hospital. “He spoke with some of the patients in the advanced trauma centre and asked about the problems.

---||Goa||Whom did you vote for, what caste are you? A survey threatens ballot secrecy||PANAJI: It’s late evening and the phone buzzes. The caller, a young woman, calmly asks about voting preferences, her disarming voice lulling the person into divulging information which is meant to be personal and secret. But if you think it is a phishing call to steal your money, you are mistaken. In the multi-cornered fight for the 2022 assembly elections, political parties are pulling all stops to get the campaign strategy right. With a lot more than pride at stake, some have even roped in heavyweight poll strategists but their tactics, particularly a survey to gauge voter sentiment, follow the thin line between adhering to the Representation of People Act and unethical practices. The questions flow easily. “If you don’t mind, may I ask which party you voted for in the last elections?” “Should the next chief minister be from the Bhandari Samaj?… Which party are you going to vote for in the coming elections and why?… Are you satisfied with the performance of the present MLA?” Given the average Goan’s inclination towards political banter, the information flows easily. Once the trust is gained, the questions shift to caste. “Are you a Brahmin, a Maratha or from Bhandari Samaj?” The caller identifies herself as a student of “Delhi School of Politics”, and says the survey is part of an ongoing project. On other occasions, the caller is a student from Damodar College’s department of political science or even a journalist doing a survey on the “political scenario” in Goa. None of this is true. It’s not always that the survey goes according to script. “She asked if I am Brahmin or Maratha. When asked about relevance of the caste, she said she is asking questions from the form. When I said I am an Indian, she concluded the survey,” said lawyer and compere Akshata Puranik-Bhat, who received one such call a few days ago. Many of the callers sound like youngsters fresh out of college and hired by political parties or election strategists to collate data on voters and Goa’s voting patterns. The Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed that secrecy of voting is important. Section 94 of the Representation of People Act, 1951 makes it very clear that every voter is expected to maintain the secrecy of voting. Any person who violates the secrecy, will be booked for an offence under Section 128 of Representation of People Act, 1951. “No witness or other person shall be required to state for whom he has voted at an election,” the act states. “Secrecy is secrecy of the ballot but that does not prevent you from making your vote transparent if you feel so. There is no coercion. It is for people to guard their privacy,” said former State Election Commissioner (SEC) Prabhakar Timble. The emergence of election strategists and political consultants appears to have altered the nature of Goa’s election campaign. Prashant Kishor and his Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC) have entered Goa in a big way and are spearheading Trinamool Congress’ campaign for the Goa assembly elections. Aside from the 300-odd I-PAC employees who are camping in the state, Kishor and his team have also hired several local youth as part of a fellowship programme. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has also hired local youth as volunteers to assist in the campaign and gather data on voters. Information, including phone numbers of beneficiaries of government schemes and government staff, have been obtained and are being used by “call centres” to profile villages, identify political leanings of homes and the caste of voters. “Technology plus competition has made elections into a competitive business. There is a corporatisation of reaching out to the voters. So the voter is viewed as a consumer and not as citizens,” said Timble. No one is spared in this political dragnet, with every one from politically active residents and influential persons to retired teachers and housemaids getting calls, often more than one. Even senior election officials are not spared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/whom-did-you-vote-for-what-caste-are-you-a-survey-threatens-ballot-secrecy/articleshow/88111518.cms||Newton Sequeira

Instead, they ensured withdrawal of cases agaist terrorists,” he said. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath distributed cheques to beneficiaries of different welfare schemes in Chandauli on Sunday ‘Soon, Baba Kinaram’s birthplace to become a spiritual site’After laying foundation of new projects and also inaugurating completed projects of Rs 30.02 crore at a public meeting organized at Baba Kinaram Inter College ground in Ramgarh area of Sakaldiha in Chandauli district on Sunday, Yogi said: “Had they understood the definition of family, they would not have made personal attacks on me on the issue of family. For me, the entire 25 crore population is my family and I work for their development,” said Yogi. Attacking previous alliances of opposition parties, he said, “Kaha gaye Bhai-Bahan (Congress MP Rahul Gandhi general secretary and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra), do ladko ki (Rahul and Akhilesh) aur babua-bua (Akhilesh-Mayawati) ki jodiya (where have the pairs of brother-sister, two boys and nephew and aunt gone?).” These combinations could never ensure development because they don’t have vision for it, said Yogi adding, “Instead of giving roads, power, water, facilities for food grain purchase from farmers and spoiling lives of common man they filled only their own treasures.” Whenever opposition parties came to power, they promoted casteism, imperialism and defamed the entire caste, said Yogi adding, the entire recruitment process of government jobs were crushed with corrupt practices in their regime. Speaking about law and order, he said that in the Opposition parties' regime, their ministers used to harass women and patronize criminal, and mafia elements, but today the empire of those mafia was being bulldozed, he added. Regarding Sakaldiha assembly seats, which were won by SP in 2017, Yogi said that had the people not committed an error this area would also have witnessed development like other three assembly segments of Chandauli district. Recalling his previous visit to lay the foundation of the medical college in the name of Baba Kinaram, he highlighted how his government ensured opening of 33 new medical colleges to boost the health sector in UP, which had only 12 such colleges till 2017. He said that now under the project of the tourism department, the birthplace of Baba Kinaram in Ramgarh was going to be developed as a prime spiritual site. Highlighting achievements of his governments and schemes like free ration for poor families till the festival of Holi he said that not only the menace of criminals and mafia elements had been checked in the state but even Covid-19 pandemic has been controlled effectively due to which celebration of festivals like Dussehra, Diwali and Chhath became possible for all. He appealed to those people, who have not taken their jibe, to get vaccinated as it would also work to check the menace of the new Omicron variant of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/yogi-adityanath-hits-out-at-akhilesh-yadav-on-family-jibe-says-25-crore-people-in-up-my-family/articleshow/88112782.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Besides partial damage to the parapet wall, the ground in the park developed huge cracks. The damage extended to some 10 metres into the park from the boundary wall on the sea side, affecting flooring and cement benches. In terms of length along the shore, the erosion affected about 200 metres area from RK Beach to Durgalamma temple. GVMC and police officials stopped the entry of visitors and tourists into the park as well as into the adjacent service road. The officials have put 'no entry' boards. Sea surge due to Jawad may be a cause  According to experts, the strong winds and high tides due to cyclone Jawad might have led to the erosion. National Institute of Oceanography, Visakhapatnam, chief scientist GPS Murty, said that the sea surge due to cyclone Jawad may have caused the erosion. "It is very difficult to identify vulnerable areas for erosion. A long-term study should be taken up to implement preventive measures," said Murty. The coastal erosion had hit several beaches in Vizag City in the past. Visakhapatnam Port Trust takes up beach nourishment works in the eroded RK beach area every year to improve the beach front. However, the proposed permanent control measures have not made any headway. According to the GVMC officials, who visited the park and the beach area on Saturday and Sunday, the damage would be around Rs 1.5 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/sea-eats-into-childrens-park-on-visakhapatnam-beach-road/articleshow/88112826.cms||---

High-level meetings have also been held between officials of the housing & urban affairs ministry and the department of telecom (DoT) for various relaxations/exemptions from Delhi Development Authority (DDA). The discussions have been undertaken with the respective local authorities to relax the floor space index (FSI) of BSNL/MTNL sites to enhance profit margins before the sale of the properties, top sources told TOI, adding that the same has been conveyed in meetings with the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) during the review of the telecom ministry. “NoC for sale has been received in case of 20 properties in Delhi from the DDA,” the source said. The PMO was also informed that the department of investment and public asset management (Dipam) has invited bids on the MSTC portal for six properties of MTNL and BSNL as efforts to kick-start the non-core asset monetisation programme of the two state-run firms get under way. The auction process is expected to be completed by the end of March. Giving details about MTNL’s plans in Mumbai, a source said that an expression of interest is being invited for the Vasari Hills plot, which can be used for residential purposes. “JLL Property Consultants is overseeing the process. Apart from this, there are around 20 flats at Oshiwara which are also being sold, and the process is being handled by Knight Frank India,” the source said. With regards to BSNL, properties have been identified at Bhavnagar in Gujarat (handled by Knight Frank), Hyderabad in Telangana (CBRE South Asia), Madhyamgram in West Bengal (Cushman and Wakefield), and Rajpura in Punjab (JLL Property Consultants).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sale-bids-start-for-mtnls-mumbai-delhi-properties/articleshow/88112829.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||Kolkata||Seeds of hope: Saline-proof rice debuts in Bengal, to cut farmers' cyclone losses||KOLKATA: Even as Bengal's farmers try to predict losses from the effects of Jawad, a new variety of rice has temporarily helped them minimise the damage from the devastation of cyclones Amphan and Yaas. The first mass-scale harvest of the salinity-tolerant rice - Nona Swarna (which translates to 'Saline Gold') - have been bulk-purchased at the minimum support price of Rs 1,950 per quintal by the Bengal government for free distribution under public distribution schemes. In a bid to stop the repeated damage of standing crops by saline flood waters along coastal belts, the state government has hand-held over four lakh farmers of East Midnapore, North and South 24 Parganas to produce Nona Swarna in over 50,000 hectares. The state hopes to produce 2.7 lakh tonnes of this variety this kharif season. Agricultural scientists developed Nona Swarna in Bengal, said Pradip Majumdar, the chief minister's agriculture adviser. "The Bengal state seed corporation has produced the seeds to helped the farmers," he added. The decision to mass-produce this variety came after successful pilot runs. Nona Swarna is the latest success story as scientists try to balance farmers' demand for traditional high-yielding varieties with salinity-resistant ones. Around 12-16 salinity-resistant varieties are being extensively researched in field trials in the Sunderbans, including one termed 'Dudheswar', by far the favourite. The seeds, distributed initially under the Krisak Bandu scheme by chief minister Mamata Banerjee on June 17, were sown during the June-July kharif season and were ready for harvesting in November. Majumdar said the rice tastes like "normal" rice. "In the coastal belts, after floodwater gushed in and stayed back, the fields had a high concentration of salt and became unusable. First, we used pumps to drain out the water, and subsequently rainwater, too. to reduce the soil salinity. After that, the new variant was sown," he said. Elevated plots selected for new seedsThere were some problems while sowing the seeds, said Pradip Majumdar, the chief minister's agriculture adviser. "Water from all the fields could not be drained out. So, we selected elevated plots for sowing the seeds of the new variant through community farming. The seed beds were formed in 1,840 community nurseries. As much as 1,220 tonnes of seeds were distributed among four lakh farmers. Along with seed kits of 6kg per bigha, they were given micronutrient zinc and seed-testing chemicals," he explained. Cyclone Amphan had led to considerable damage to standing crops in May 2020. It didn't end once the cyclone receded, as breaches in the embankments led to floodwaters seeping in and staying back in the fields. The devastation due to Cyclone Yaas in May 2021 had also been acute along the state's coastal belt. After Amphan led to damages in paddy spread over 88,000 hectares, the chief minister had asked the state agriculture department to find a way to help farmers, who were being forced to migrate, unable to sow paddy in the saline fields. This was a problem first seen after Cyclone Aila in 2009.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/seeds-of-hope-saline-proof-rice-debuts-in-bengal-to-cut-farmers-cyclone-losses/articleshow/88112898.cms||Debashis Konar
---||Kanpur||Doomsday professor in Kanpur clinically executed killings: Autopsy||KANPUR: The details tumbling out from the investigations and autopsy report of the triple murder victims point towards a clinically planned killing by the forensic science professor in Kanpur even though he had cited acute depression and an imminent doomsday from Omicron surge in his suicide note as reasons for wiping out his family. The post-mortem report of the bodies of the professor’s wife, son and daughter indicates that the triple murder was executed in a planned manner. No food was found in the gut of the three bodies though liquid was detected, following which the investigation officers deduce that their morning tea was laced with poison, and they did not have lunch. The woman died due to coma that was induced by severe head injuries while the children died of suffocation on being strangulated. Their viscera have been preserved for further forensic analysis. “No food was found in anyone’s stomach, only 100ml of liquid was there, which makes it clear that if they were poisoned, then liquid was used,” said officials. “The fluid has been preserved to ascertain what chemical or poison was administered to them. The powder recovered from the house has been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory,” he added. As per the post-mortem report’s findings, the accused doctor had inflicted several blows on the head of his wife Chandraprabha with a hammer, due to which many bones of her skull had broken badly. “The letter written by the doctor is also raising suspicions. He listed ‘Covid Related Depression’, ‘Phobia’, ‘Major Depressive Disorder’, ‘Malignant Depression’ in the letter. By mentioning so many ailments, it appears he wanted police to believe that he was really in depression,” said police officials. Professor missing, police float suicide theoryThe last location of accused Sushil Kumar, a professor of forensic science, missing after killing his wife, son and daughter, has been found at the Sarsaiya Ghat on the banks of the Ganga, which has deepened the suspicion that the doctor might have committed suicide by jumping into the Ganga. Police with the help of divers on Saturday launched a search for him from Ganga barrage to Atal Ghat but in vain. According to expert divers, a body submerged in Ganga comes to surface only after about 36 hours. “Going by the divers’ theory, searches were resumed again on Sunday morning to locate the whereabouts of the missing doctor. The divers searched in an 80-km stretch from Kanpur to Fatehpur,” said DCP Crime BBGTS Murti. Doctor’s photo has been sent to police stations of the neighbouring districts. It has come to fore that the doctor came out of the flat at 1.10 pm and took lift to reach the ground floor from where he left the apartment on foot. His last location was found in Mandhana at 6.30 pm on Friday, but later the call detail report of the mobile revealed that the last location was around the DM compound at 6 pm. He reached there via Atal Ghat in Parmat. Police had also questioned shopkeepers at Sarsaiya Ghat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/doomsday-professor-in-kanpur-clinically-executed-killings-autopsy/articleshow/88112874.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

But this does not allow them to pick or drop passengers on the way,” Prashant Tiwari, the assistant regional transport officer (ARTO enforcement) of GB Nagar, said. The department, Tiwari said, was conducting a checking drive on Saturday when they noted these buses, en route from Delhi to Uttar Pradesh west through Noida, were picking up and dropping passengers near Mahamaya flyover without proper permission. “Each bus was fined Rs 10,000 for permit violations. We have also noticed that these buses resort to parking illegally which leads to congestion on the Noida Expressway and slows down traffic movement,” Tiwari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/luxury-buses-pick-up-drop-passengers-on-e-way-fined/articleshow/88111611.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu readies infrastructure to tackle Omicron cases||CHENNAI: One more passenger from the United Kingdom who landed in Chennai tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday. The public health laboratory sent test samples to the whole genome sequencing labs in Chennai and Bengaluru to check if the passenger was carrying the Omicron variant. Health minister Ma Subramanian, who was in Villupuram, told reporters that a 25-year-old man from the UK, who travelled via Dubai and landed in Chennai on Saturday, tested positive for Covid-19. Till Friday, three passengers - two from the UK and one from Singapore - tested positive for Covid-19. It will take anywhere between five to seven days for the state to find which variant has infected them, officials said. While three patients are admitted to the government Covid-19 hospital, one patient is in the government hospital in Trichy. Health conditions of patients are stable, doctors said. "They have been asymptomatic and the infection is mild," a senior doctor said. Passengers from 11 high-risk countries landing at all international airports in the state are tested. "They are not allowed to leave the airport without negative results. We allow passengers who test negative to go home but advise them to remain in quarantine until a repeat test on the eighth day," he said. Passengers pay for the RTPCR tests on arrival. The state also draws samples from 5% of passengers from other flights to keep a tab on the infection rate, he said. The passengers don't have to pay for these tests, the doctor added. Patients who test positive are taken to government hospitals for treatment. The state has 200 beds in state Covid hospital at King Institute campus, special wards in Omandurar and Rajiv Gandhi government hospitals. Overall, the state has more than 72,000 beds including 8,722 ICU beds and 40,000 oxygen beds, besides 35,483 beds in covid care centres for Covid-19 care. In addition, the state has 6,425 additional Covid Care Centres. In Madurai, a special ward for dealing with the Omicron variant has been established in Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai. The 30 beds with oxygen support are set aside for patients coming from high-risk countries. "The treatment or isolation protocols are not different from other Covid-19 cases," director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam said. Isolation wards have also been kept ready in Government medical college hospitals in Trichy and Coimbatore. Government hospitals in Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts have also created wards with piped oxygen supply. The state has stocked up on adequate drugs for management of these cases, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-readies-infrastructure-to-tackle-omicron-cases/articleshow/88112986.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Low pressure may still drench Kolkata, temperature dip likely after December 11||KOLKATA: The city and the coastal districts of Bengal could be lashed by intense showers early on Monday even as a low-pressure area — a ‘remnant’ of Cyclone Jawad that moved towards the state along the Odisha coast on Sunday evening — nears the Bengal coast at midnight on Sunday. The showers in Kolkata, though, could lose intensity by the second half of Monday and cease completely by Tuesday morning, said the Met office. It has also predicted a dip in temperature after December 11. Kolkata received 24mm rain till 5.30pm on Sunday. Jawad lost strength and got reduced to a depression as it came close to Puri on Sunday afternoon, then recurved north-northeastward towards Bengal coast, weakening further as it moved. By evening, it had been reduced to a depression and by the time it would come close to the Bengal coast, it would be a low-pressure area, said weather officials. “Since it’s no longer a cyclone, the system may not have a landfall and dissipate somewhere near the coast. It will still lead to heavy showers in the coastal districts — the two Midnapores and 24 Parganas, along with Jhargram. They may receive heavy rain till Monday afternoon after which the showers could lose intensity since the system is set to move away towards Bangladesh,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das. From the second half of Monday, rain will turn intense at the districts adjoining Bangladesh — Murshidabad, Nadia and North 24 Parganas. “As the showers gradually cease in Kolkata and the coastal districts from the latter half of Monday, the border districts will receive heavy showers as the system moves towards Bangladesh. These districts will be lashed by heavy rain till Tuesday,” added Das. On Sunday, Jawad hovered over northwest and adjoining westcentral Bay of Bengal as a deep depression and moved north-northeastwards with a speed of 18 kmph. At noon, it lay about 70 km south-southeast of Puri (Odisha), 100 km east-southeast of Gopalpur (Odisha), 150 km south-southwest of Paradip (Odisha) and 320 km east-northeast of Vishakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh). Three factors led to Jawad losing its strength, said weather experts. First, the lack of a uniform ‘wind shear’ that was needed to keep the cyclone intact and make it move towards the coast. Secondly, north Bay of Bengal — over which the system is now hovering — turns cool in December which cuts off the supply of moisture to cyclonic systems, rendering them weaker. Finally, cool winds have been blowing into the sea from the land which is making the system disintegrate. Four flights were delayed and 11 trains were cancelled on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/low-pressure-may-still-drench-kol-temp-dip-likely-after-dec-11/articleshow/88110703.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Just over a month ago, a group of alleged Bajrang Dal workers vandalized an Aashram set in Bhopal, smeared ink on filmmaker Prakash Jha’s face and damaged Bobby Deol’s vanity van. “We know how to chase them away from Khajuraho,” Chhatarpur district convener of Bajrang Dal, Surendra Shivhare, warned. Prior to the festival, Bajrang Dal has submitted a memorandum, saying: “We will not tolerate any violation of Indian culture. We will not tolerate anything indecent.” Organized by the Madhya Pradesh government along with Prayaas Productions, the seventh edition of Khajuraho International Film Festival is the first big event at the Unesco heritage town after Covid restrictions were relaxed. As many as 75 films will be screened in ‘Tapra Talkies’, a term given to the makeshift theatre of bamboo set up to screen the movies. “The KIFF's founding principles centre on the discovery, promotion, and support of film-making in all genres, bringing together the diversity of forms, aesthetics, and content,” a government spokesperson said. On the inaugural day, actor Govinda arrived in Khajuraho. Bobby Deol and Mallika Sherawat have also been invited. Actor-turned politician Raja Bundela, who established the festival, said it’s part of the 75th Amrit Mahotsav of Freedom Movement. Talking to TOI, Bundela refused to comment on the protest against Deol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bajrang-dal-protests-invitation-to-bobby-deol-for-mps-khajuraho-film-festival/articleshow/88113029.cms||---
---||Chennai||Death of ex-chief of Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board: Edappadi K Palaniswami seeks CBI probe||CHENNAI: Former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Sunday demanded a CBI probe into the suicide of former chairman of Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board A V Venkatachalam. Venkatachalam, who was facing corruption charges, ended his life on December 2, even as a probe was underway by the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) against him.  In a statement on Sunday, EPS said he strongly suspected that Venkatachalam took the drastic step because he was threatened and asked to give false statements against the previous AIADMK government.  "The target of the DVAC was to extract false statements from him to indict the previous AIADMK government. That's why we believe he died under suspicious circumstances," EPS said and demanded a CBI probe.  "The DMK government has been misusing the police, particularly the DVAC, to foist cases against former ministers and search their houses as well as those of their relatives and friends," EPS alleged in the statement.  There were media reports that if officials refused to follow the commands of the government to foist cases on former ministers, they are transferred or forced to resign, EPS said. "There were reports that Venkatachalam was also pressured to give statements, indicting the AIADMK government. He was threatened that he would have to resign if he failed to do so," EPS alleged. It was against this backdrop that DVAC searches were conducted in his house.  "Venkatachalam has held various posts in his 35 years of government service. There was no way that such an officer would resort to suicide. Hence, we suspect that he died under mysterious circumstances,'' EPS said.  EPS appealed to the police to act by the rule book, in a fair manner and take action against the wrongdoers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/death-of-ex-chief-of-tamil-nadu-pollution-control-board-edappadi-k-palaniswami-seeks-cbi-probe/articleshow/88113096.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Winter here, air quality worsens||BHOPAL: The air quality of major Madhya Pradesh cities has turned poor. Pollution levels have sharply gone up after clearing of the monsoon in the state. The pollution levels of major MP cities had gone up to at least 100 points compared to last year. Among the four main cities, pollution in Jabalpur increased almost double while there was no major change in the pollution level of Gwalior. Track the pollution level in your cityIn Bhopal and Indore, the air pollution level turned from moderate to poor in the past one year. Officials said pollution levels go up after monsoon. Dust gets heavy in showers and does not fly in the air. The vehicular pollution also gets down as tyres could not lead to flying of pollutants and dust in air, as it settles down on ground. It is the reason why pollution levels come down during rains. But damaged roads, flying dust from vehicles and increase in construction activities after showers leads to increase in the pollution levels. Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, the increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage, among others. PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases. Air quality index between 0 and 50 is termed as good with minimal possible health impacts while air quality between 51 and 100 is satisfactory but may lead to minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people. Air quality above 100 is moderate and leads to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. AQI above 200 leads to breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. AQI between 300 and 400 is very poor and leads to respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. Officials said the air quality remained best during the corona restrictions when the AQI of major MP cities was around 50.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-winter-here-air-quality-worsens/articleshow/88113120.cms||---

Soon, police began a probe to identify the students. They believe the students are from government schools in Pulianthope. "We are taking efforts to identify them and have decided to advise them on the dangers involved in footboard driving," said a senior officer. The video, believed to have been captured by a person travelling in a car behind the bus, shows several children hanging from the window rails of the bus on route 64K (Broadway to KK Nagar). One of them is seen climbing to the roof, while a few others stand on the footboard, leaning out and screaming. The bus was not crowded, but the boys continued to be on the footboard, performing wild gyrations. As soon as the bus reached Pulianthope, the boys jumped out, scaring away the commuters waiting at the bus stop. "We also received complaints from the bus crew about the footboard travelling and a special squad has been formed to nab commuters who continue to travel on footboard despite being warned," said the officer. The video, shot by someone in a car, shows several school students hanging precariously from the window rails of a… https://t.co/cz8qf8avac— TOIChennai (@TOIChennai) 1638757917000Police have for years been attempting to address the issue by counselling commuters and registering cases against footboard travellers. Despite this, such violations continue. Another senior police officer said that they regularly held counselling sessions in colleges and schools, warning students of the dangers of travelling on footboard. "We narrate incidents and even show them photographs of the cases of deaths due to footboard travelling. Despite seeing all this, they are yet to realise the seriousness of the issue," he said. In 2018, a student of Class IX fell to his death from the footboard of a moving MTC bus at Thiruvottiyur in North Chennai when the straps of his bag got tangled in a transformer and he was pulled down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/video-of-students-doing-stunts-on-mtc-bus-goes-viral-probe-begins/articleshow/88113133.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Rain to prolong dengue-malaria season in Kolkata: Experts||KOLKATA: The unexpected December rain could prolong the dengue-malaria season, which started late with number of patients suffering from the vector-borne diseases often surpassing that of Covid in some private hospitals in Kolkata, fear experts. Intermittent rain since Saturday may proliferate mosquito-breeding grounds yet again and keep the transmission going till temperatures start dropping. Even though dengue deaths have occurred in December in Kolkata, number of cases and casualties have been few and far in between during the last month of the year. Belle Vue Clinic has 15 dengue and three malaria patients against 15 Covid patients. The number of dengue and malaria admissions have been steadily rising since mid-October and have often overtaken that of Covid patients, said CEO P Tondon. “The count has remained fairly consistent and close to Covid since the Pujas. Several cases have been very severe,” added Tondon. Till end-November, Belle Vue had more dengue and malaria patients than Covid. “Dengue transmission is generally confined to the warmer, wetter months. Unpredictable and inconsistent rain this season led to a late outbreak that has made vector-borne diseases linger till December,” said Belle Vue internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. Ruby General Hospital has seven dengue and malaria patients, one more than the number of Covid patients. “After a spurt last month, number of dengue patients has dropped but cases continue,” said Ruby geberal manager (operations) Subhashish Datta. At Peerless Hospital, the number of dengue and malaria patients has been climbing steadily this month, which is unusual, say doctors. While on December 2, the hospital had six dengue and two malaria patients admitted, the number of dengue patients climbed to 10 on December 4. Peerless now has 34 Covid patients. Dengue cases first saw a spurt in mid-October when some hospitals reported a sudden rise in cases even as the Covid third wave was being apprehended. At Woodlands Hospital, 15% of patients admitted then had dengue. The number had touched 17 on October 12, including a group of nurses, which forced the hospital to set up a dengue ward. It had more dengue and malaria patients than Covid till a week ago. It now has seven dengue and two malaria patients. “A week ago, we had nine dengue and three malaria patients and a fortnight ago, 14 dengue and eight malaria patients were admitted. We have 11 Covid patients admitted now,” said CEO Rupali Basu. At AMRI Hospitals, daily dengue admissions have been 1-2. “It is unusual at this time of the year,” said CEO Rupak Barua.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/experts-rain-to-prolong-dengue-malaria-season/articleshow/88110707.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

He had taken possession of at least 22 cars and lent them on lease. According to police, Arun Kumar, the accused from Labour Colony, Guindy, had a few months ago approached one Appavu, 62, a transport owner from Nungambakkam, and asked him to lend his car for a significant rental. Appavu lent one car and was paid 20,000 as rent in the first month. After that, Arun Kumar stopped the payments and refused to answer his calls. Appavu then visited the house of Kumar, but found it locked. Subsequently, he filed a complaint with Nungambakkam police. During an inquiry, it came to light that claiming the cars as his own, Arun Kumar had pledged those vehicles for several lakhs of rupees. Police said that in 2016, while working at a car showroom, Arun Kumar had duped over 26 people and was subsequently terminated. He was arrested and later released on bail. Investigations revealed that he ran a firm in Nungambakkam, where he hired a few women employees. He collected bank databases of customers who bought cars on loan recently and selected his next catch. He would lend the cars for a lease amount anywhere between 3 lakh and 5 lakh. Police seized 11 cars from him and remanded him in custody. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-man-32-held-for-selling-rented-cars/articleshow/88113166.cms||---

What was feared, turned out to be true on Sunday. Much of the accumulated garbage at the vat inside Rabindra Sarobar was drained into the Lake water, thanks to incessant rain because of a deep depression in Bay of Bengal. Lake lovers, morning walkers and environment-activists feared serious pollution of the water where surfacing of dead fish is a common occurrence. TOI had earlier reported on this issue. The morning walkers and Lake lovers insisted on clearing the garbage from the vat at Buddha Mandir gate side. But the agency engaged in clearing garbage took away only a part of it. “The assorted garbage, which includes dry leaves, plastic bags, pet bottles, papers and many other things, first left the pathway littered, muddy on Saturday evening. On Sunday, they moved further into the tank water following the natural gradient of the land,” said Sumita Banerjee, former member of the Lake Monitoring Committee. A Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) official said, “The garbage will not accumulate further as we are having a composting plant there. The fund was allocated. But the Covid pandemic delayed the project.” As per plan, two compost plants of 0.5-tonne capacity each were proposed — one near the dump side and another towards the Rabindra Sarobar Metro Station. The authorities had earlier floated expression of interest for implementing the bio compost plant project but not many showed interest in the proposal. “On November 24, I noticed smoke coming out of the heap of garbage at the vat of the Lake near Tollygunge station. The smoke is highly poisonous as the garbage is assorted and it includes plastic and rubbish,” said Professor P K Bose, former director of NIT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rain-washes-vat-garbage-into-sarobar-water-body-walkers-raise-concerns/articleshow/88110723.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Noida||Soon, Noida to get its own Times Square||NOIDA: A huge video wall, an amphitheatre, a play area for kids… Noida will try to replicate the most famous slice of New York in an ambitious plan to give Sector 18, one of the popular places for hangout in NCR, a makeover. To be called Noida Times Square, a part of the shopping hub will be modelled on the actual Times Square — the Manhattan intersection that gets its name from the office of the New York Times. The huge billboard — a video wall that is synonymous with Times Square in NY — is being planned on the façade of the multilevel parking complex. But the Noida Authority also needs to pull crowds. So, it has already commissioned development work worth Rs 7.5 crore for a play area for children and an amphitheatre. The area is also being landscaped. Indu Prakash Singh, an officer on special duty at the Authority, said the tender to set up the LED façade had been floated recently. The size of the billboard will, however, be much smaller. While the billboards in Manhattan range between 18,000 sqft and 30,000 sqft, the video wall in Noida will span over an area of about 6,500 sqft. The entire project will be developed on a public-private-partnership model. While the Authority will provide space to an agency to manage the billboard and the surrounding areas for 10 years, the company will have to hand it back after the lease expires. The operator will also have to pay a monthly revenue of Rs 6.6 lakh. The video wall will face the amphitheatre, which will have a seating capacity of 172. Entry to the facility will be gated. Experts in the field of advertising, however, said the Authority’s idea to keep a gated entry and exit could backfire in the long run. “The billboard has to be placed at the most prominent part of the commercial area. At Times Square, the corners of the buildings between the intersections are exploited to their maximum capacity. The facility has to cater to pedestrians and vehicle owners. More the footfall, more the eyeballs for the advertisers,” said Nishikant Mishra, one of the directors of an NCR-based advertising firm who has an experience of almost two decades in the industry. “The video wall should be set up on a stretch that has free-flowing movement of both pedestrians and motor vehicles. The amphitheatre and park can be set up nearby,” he added. Mishra said the Authority should offer space for opening food stalls, restaurants, small shops and other commercial facilities. “They must create a play zone with the latest rides for children, eating joints and other options for the youths to hang out. The operator needs to be given the option to monetise the space. Else, there may not be many visitors,” he added. Officials said they would consider more viable options during discussions with agencies that showed interest. In another development related to advertising and publicity, the Authority has managed to garner Rs 14 crore till November 30 this fiscal. While Rs 10.7 crore has been realised, the Authority has to recover the remaining amount from vendors and agencies. In the last fiscal, advertising revenues for the Authority were extremely low due to the pandemic. During the 2019-20 period, the Authority had raked in close to Rs 18 crore through outdoor advertising.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/soon-noida-to-get-its-own-times-square/articleshow/88111417.cms||Shalabh

I joined 69 Armoured Regiment on September 5 and turned 20 on September 13 that year. Indian and Pakistani Arm officers after the war in Rangpur, Brig Inder Mohan is the officer standing in the third place from rightThe regiment was stationed at Bagdogra. From there, we went to Debijhora tea garden and then in stages moved to Hilli,” said the brigadier. “We were rushed to Hilli in November as 8 Guards and 5 Garhwal Rifles had suffered heavy casualties. B squadron of Regiment under Major S C Mehra was rushed to salvage the situation, but it was too late and our attacks were completely defeated. Between November 23 and December 3, no progress was achieved in capturing Hilli. On December 3, we realised that the only way to progress the operation was to bypass Hilli from the north and attack from behind.” He added even as a pitched battle was going on at Hilli, there was no cohesive plan to capture it from December 3 to 10. The retired army officer said the regiment, less a squadron, moved through Charkhai to intercept the Rangpur Bogra road in the area of Pir Ganj on December 3. He added on December 7, their regiment managed to cut the Rangpur Bogra road in the area of Pir Ganj and C Squadron of the regiment under Major H S Mann cut the Rangpur Bogra road a little distance away from Pir Ganj. “The leading tank commander, 2nd Lt Sunder Singh, missed capturing Pakistan Army’s Major General Nazir Hussain Shah, commanding officer of 16 Infantry Division, on December 7. On the same date, 2nd Lt C P Singh who was following him reached a road where he found Maj Gen Shah’s vehicle. He towed it to Pir Ganj and the vehicles’s flag and star plates were displayed in our regiment,” said the brigadier. “It was the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Pawittar Singh which carried the day for 20 Mountain Division,” he said. Saved a Pak soldierBrig Inder Mohan said he was on the leading tank from Hilli to Ghoraghat on December 11. On the way, he saw a big crowd of civilians. On reaching close, he saw a Pakistan soldier with a bullet in his lower leg being pelted with stones by the crowd. “I remember he had a rifle. Since I have spent a big part of my life in Kolkatta and I knew Bengali, I talked to the civilians and saved his life. Later, we called an ambulance, which took us to our military hospital. In the war, one of our tanks was hit on December 12 near Meetha Pukur and the tank driver, Lance Dafedar Sahab Singh, who was presumed to have died, was saved by a Punjab battalion of Pakistan Army and sent to their hospital in serious condition. This was conveyed to us by their CO to our CO when we first met them on December 16 after the ceasefire, north of Meetha Pukar: that one of our boys is a prisoner of war with them. So a life saved by us was life gained,” said Brig Inder Mohan. “We took the surrender of 29 Cav (Tigers) of Pak Army”. The officer said that after the surrender, Pakistan Army had laid out tea, snacks for them at North of Meetha Pukar on December 16 around noon. “There, within a few minutes, we forgot we were killing each other,” he added. Punjabi bonhomie“Immediately after the war we were friends as if we had never even fired at each other. Most Pakistani officers had roots in Indian Punjab. We spoke mostly in Punjabi. CO 29 Cav, Lt Col Sajad Haidar Bukhari, addressed me as son on the first day after surrender. I had accidentally walked into his residence where he was having tea with his officers. His 2 IC (second-in-command) Major Mukhtar Ahmed longed to visit Jalandhar, his ancestral place,” said the retired officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/couldnt-capture-pak-major-general-so-they-took-his-vehicle/articleshow/88111412.cms||Shariq Majeed

At the same time, many air-conditioned low-floor buses allotted to the city under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) scheme, introduced by the Union government, are left to rust away at the Kerala Urban Transport Corporation (KURTC) bus station at Thevara. The KSRTC has already started low-floor city service buses in Thiruvananthapuram. “The government plans similar services in Kochi and Kozhikode as well. We are taking the preparatory measures. We will start the services only after the government asking us to begin it,” an official with the KSRTC in Ernakulam district said. “The plan is to provide bare minimum ticket rates in the beginning. A passenger who boards the low-floor city service bus may be able to travel anywhere in the city at low fares,” the official said. Meanwhile, around 90 airconditioned low-floor buses and many non-air-conditioned low-floor buses allotted to the city under JNNURM scheme have been either alienated or damaged. The government deployed some of the air-conditioned buses for long distance service. “The design of the airconditioned Volvo buses was to suit the needs of the city. It can’t be used for long-distance services. If used for long-distance services, the buses would get damaged,” an official who had associated with the services in the initial stage said. It was in 2009 that the Union government allotted around 90 air-conditioned Volvo low-floor buses to Kochi. The objective was to lure more passengers, including those use cars, to the public transport system by offering the comfort of air-conditioned low-floor buses. The plan was to decongest the city roads as well as to decrease pollution. But Kochi corporation failed to float a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for operating the buses. Then, the KSRTC was entrusted with thr responsibility. The government floated a special wing called KURTC under KSRTC for operating lowfloor services. A bus station was started near the boat jetty at Thevara and KURTC started services from there. “Now, almost all the buses have been damaged. The government should take urgent steps to repair the buses and resume services,” T J Vinod, MLA, said. “Our concept is not to conduct services in the city limits. Rather, the buses should connect the city and its suburbs. There were airconditioned low-floor services connecting Kothamangalam, Aluva, Perumbavoor, Muvattupuzha, Piravom and Angamaly areas with the city. Such services had been helpful to those who commuted to the city for the purpose of job. I have given memorandum to the government seeking that those services should be resumed,” Vinod said. But the officials with the KSRTC said that many of the air-conditioned low-floor buses which were damaged were repaired. “Now, some of them have been deployed for conducting Sabarimala services while another batch of the buses are plying between Kochi and other cities. Now, there may be some 30 buses lying at the yard at Thevara. A few among them will have to be scrapped while others can be repaired and used,” an official with the KSRTC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ksrtc-plans-to-roll-out-low-floor-city-bus-service-in-kochi/articleshow/88113189.cms||---

The factories were found using diesel gensets and boilers, both of which have been banned in the region in the wake of deteriorating air quality. All three have been fined Rs 30 lakh each. “Our teams found that in Sarai Kale area of the district, three garment units were running without any permission. Moreover, they were using diesel gensets and boilers. The units were sealed and a penalty of Rs 10 lakh each was imposed on each one of them,” said Kuldeep Singh, the regional officer of HSPCB in Gurugram. Meanwhile, as the wind speed picked up on Sunday, the city’s air quality improved from the “very poor” to “poor” category. On Sunday, the AQI was at 227, down from 334 the day before. The wind speed on Sunday was 6kmph as against 4kmph on Saturday. The Vikas Sadan monitoring station recorded the highest AQI at 326, followed by Sector 51 at 307 and Teri Gram at 197. The AQI was not recorded at Gwal Pahari because of insufficient data. The minimum temperature in the district was recorded at 10°C on Sunday and the maximum at 24.8°C. Officials hoped the air quality would improve further and the region would witness foggy days ahead. “The air quality has already improved marginally. On December 6 and 7, a western disturbance could bring more rain and wind to Delhi-NCR, which will help in improving the air quality. A warmer day helped create an escape route for the trapped pollutants, with moisture holding in the lower atmosphere,” said Sachin Panwar, a scientist. According to guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board, when the AQI is in the “moderate” category, it could lead to breathing discomfort among those suffering from asthma, lung or any heart disease. When the air is “poor”, those staying outside for long can have breathing distress. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), winds are likely to be relatively high with increasing ventilation over the next two days. The temperatures, however, are likely to drop. On December 8, wind speeds are expected to decrease, but the AQI is likely to remain in the “very poor” category. Neighbouring Faridabad also registered a similar trend, with the AQI sliding to 311 on Sunday from 356 on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/pollution-body-seals-3-illegal-textile-units-for-using-dg-sets/articleshow/88110831.cms||Ipsita Pati
