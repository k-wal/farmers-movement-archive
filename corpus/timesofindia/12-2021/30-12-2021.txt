---||World||NHL cutting isolation time to 5 days, change applies in US||The NHL is following other leagues and the CDC by cutting Covid-19 isolation times to five days under certain conditions and where it is allowed by local laws.  The change went into effect Wednesday and applies only in the US because of stricter pandemic regulations in Canada. The league has 25 teams based in the US and seven in Canada and on Tuesday postponed nine games scheduled for north of the border because of attendance limits imposed by provincial governments.  Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly confirmed the new protocols, which were first reported by Daily Faceoff. They apply for 14 days, at which time league and players' association officials will reconvene to review the situation.  Players, coaches and staff who tested positive for the coronavirus can return after five days if symptoms are gone or resolving themselves with a negative PCR test or two negative rapid test results taken more than two hours apart.  "I think that's a good step," Nashville Predators forward Filip Forsberg said on a video call. "Obviously testing will still be a regular thing, I'm sure, and that's something that we dealt with all last year, so we're used to that. But I think that's the way to do it as long as we can keep everything in the way it's been, which has been pretty safe to me."  The 10-day isolation requirement remains in Canada. The NBA and NFL previously reduced to six and five days, respectively, after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance.  Hockey players this week had expressed a desire for shorter isolation times. Daily testing and enhanced protocols, including mask-wearing at team facilities unless on the ice for games or practices, are in effect through at least Jan. 7.  The league has postponed 80 games so far this season, counting the nine in Canada because of crowd restrictions in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba. Another game, scheduled for Jan. 12 between the Canadiens and Bruins, was moved from Montreal to Boston, where fans are permitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/nhl-cutting-isolation-time-to-5-days-change-applies-in-us/articleshow/88575728.cms||---

The two leaders will discuss "a range of topics, including upcoming diplomatic engagements," National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne said in a statement announcing the call.  The talks come as the US and Western allies have watched the buil-dup of Russian troops near the border of Ukraine, growing to an estimated 100,000 and fuelling fears that Moscow is preparing to invade Ukraine.  Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.  State Department spokesman Ned Price said Blinken "reiterated the United States' unwavering support for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity in the face of Russia's military buildup on Ukraine's borders."  Price said the two discussed efforts to peacefully resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine and upcoming diplomatic engagements with Russia.  Putin said earlier this week he would ponder a slew of options if the West fails to meet his push for security guarantees precluding Nato's expansion to Ukraine.  Earlier this month, Moscow submitted draft security documents demanding that Nato deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back its military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe.  The US and its allies have refused to offer Russia the kind of guarantees on Ukraine that Putin wants, citing Nato's principle that membership is open to any qualifying country. They agreed. however, to hold talks with Russia next month to discuss its concerns.  The US and Russia are to hold high-level talks on January 10. Moscow and Nato representatives are expected to meet that same week as well as Russia and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which includes the United States.  In Thursday's call, which was requested by the Russians, Biden is expected to stress to Putin that the US is united with its allies but will demonstrate a willingness to engage in "principled diplomacy" with Russia, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the upcoming call. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity. The two leaders held a video call earlier this month.  The official added that the White House sees the leader-to-leader engagement as important as the administration looks to find a way beyond this "moment of crisis" over growing worries of a further Russian invasion of Ukraine.  In 2014, Russian troops marched into the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and seized the territory from Ukraine. Russia's annexation of Crimea - one of the darker moments for former President Barack Obama on the international stage - looms large as Biden looks to contain the current smoldering crisis.  White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan has made clear in public comments that the administration is ready to discuss Moscow's concerns about NATO in talks with Russian officials, but emphasized that Washington is committed to the "principle of nothing about you without you" in shaping policy that affects European allies.  "We're approaching the broader question of diplomacy with Russia from the point of view that... meaningful progress at the negotiating table, of course, will have to take place in a context of de-escalation rather than escalation," Sullivan said at an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations earlier this month. He added "that it's very difficult to see agreements getting consummated if we're continuing to see an escalatory cycle."  The two leaders are also expected during Thursday's call to discuss efforts to persuade Iran to return to the 2015 nuclear accord, which was effectively scrapped by the Trump administration.  Despite differences on Ukraine and other issues, White House officials have said the Iran nuclear issue is one where they believe the U.S. and Russia can work cooperatively.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that Putin would speak with Biden on Thursday but provided no details.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-putin-to-hold-call-over-stepped-up-security-demands/articleshow/88575734.cms||---

Her son and mother, who were travelling with her, sustained injuries but were out of danger. According to Sadar police station SHO Arun Kumar, a car rammed into the hired vehicle in which the family of four were travelling. Jhimli (49), seated right behind the driver, bore the brunt of the impact. “Three other persons were also injured in the accident: her son Vaibhav (14), her mother Bulbul Mukherjee (75) and the car driver Indranil. Her husband, Ramesh Pandey, is fine,” he said. The family had tavelled from Ahmedabad to Jaisalmer and were returning after visiting the fort. Police said the accident took place shortly after 4pm on the Jaisalmer-Jodhpur highway near the war museum at Thaiyat village, about 12 km away from Jaisalmer city. “A preliminary examination of the accident scene indicates that a car travelling towards Jaisalmer smashed into the right side of the vehicle in which the family was headed towards Jodhpur. The taxi thereafter skidded before it careened off the road,” Kumar said. Jhimli was a Senior Assistant Editor with The Times of India, Kolkata. She had worked in the organization for over two decades, covering education, communities and heritage with distinction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/senior-toi-scribe-dies-in-jaisalmer-road-accident/articleshow/88575864.cms||---
---||World||S Africa holds colourful, musical farewell to Desmond Tutu||CAPE TOWN: A musical memorial to South Africa's revered anti-apartheid icon Desmond Tutu had a rabbi and a monk dancing in their seats on Wednesday as Cape Town said farewell to its first black Anglican Archbishop.  The colourful interfaith service at City Hall to Tutu, who died at the weekend, was attended by family members and politicians, and peaked with a rendition of the 1980 chart-topper "Paradise Road".  The hit, which became an unofficial anthem for the struggle against apartheid, was emotionally performed by bare-footed South African singer Zolani Mahola.  Tutu died peacefully at a care centre on Sunday, just three months after his 90th birthday, prompting tributes to pour in from around the world.  Ahead of his funeral on Saturday numerous events are being held across South Africa to remember the apartheid foe and stalwart of the liberation struggle, who was also an outspoken critic of human rights abuses across the world.  He coined the phrase "Rainbow Nation" at the advent of South Africa's democracy, and that ideal was on full display at the memorial on Wednesday night.  Despite limited numbers due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there was plenty of pomp and ceremony at the event, with music from the South African Youth Choir and guitarist Jonathan Butler, among others.  Butler, whose music was popular during the apartheid struggle, had some in the audience, including a rabbi and a Buddhist monk, dancing in their seats. 'We will pick up your baton'Prayers were offered from Christian, Buddhist, Jewish, Traditional African and Muslim leaders.  Indigenous Khoisan people, dressed in skins and holding aloft an animal skull, also presented a tribute to Tutu.  Many of the members of the Tutu family, politicians and members of the public in attendance wore purple in honour of Tutu's famed purple robes.  Cape Town's famous Table Mountain and the City Hall building are also being lit up in purple at night all week.  Cape Town mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis told AFP the colour also had darker historical relevance because during the years of white-minority rule in the 1980s police often sprayed pro-democracy protesters with water cannon and purple dye to make them easier to identify and arrest.  Cheryl Carolus, a member of the ruling ANC party attending the event, called on South Africans to keep striving for a better democracy.  "Freedom is not a spectator sport, it needs to be hands-on... Tata, we will pick up your baton," she said, using Tutu's nickname.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/s-africa-holds-colourful-musical-farewell-to-desmond-tutu/articleshow/88576084.cms||---
---||World||Deputy shot to death in Illinois; gunman at large||MILL SHOALS: Authorities in two states are searching for a gunman who killed an eastern Illinois deputy early Wednesday and is suspected in a carjacking in neighbouring Missouri a couple of hours later.  The Wayne county sheriff's office said in a Facebook post that deputy Sean Riley responded to a motorist assist call on Interstate 64 near Mill Shoals around 5 am. Wednesday. A second officer who arrived at the scene found Riley dead. The deputy's squad car was later found abandoned on I-64.  The search for the suspect extended to St Peters, Missouri, where police believe a man involved in a shooting and carjacking shortly after 7 am Wednesday at a QuikTrip convenience store was the same person who killed the deputy.  St Peters police spokeswoman Melissa Doss said in an email that "there was evidence at the QuikTrip scene, which indicates the suspect was also involved in the series of crimes, which occurred in Illinois earlier this morning". She declined to elaborate, citing the ongoing investigation.  St Peters police said the man drove away from the convenience store in a car that was later found near Interstate 70 in nearby O'Fallon, Missouri. The suspect then stole a white pick-up truck, police said.  The Missouri carjacking victim was hospitalised with injuries police described as not life-threatening.  Mill Shoals is about 115 miles (185 km) east of St Louis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/deputy-shot-to-death-in-illinois-gunman-at-large/articleshow/88576127.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbaikars opt for low-key New Year festivities; keep spirits high||Due to the rising cases of Omicron variant of coronavirus, the state government shared new guidelines on December 24. It included a nine-hour night restriction (9 pm to 6 am) to ensure no crowding in public places. Restaurants and theatres will continue to operate at 50% capacity even post 9 pm. As per the directive, there’s a ban on New Year celebration, programme, function, gathering, party, activity or happening in any closed or open space, in municipal limits of Greater Mumbai. Speaking about the rules in place, BMC Additional Commissioner Suresh Kakani had told BT, “The restriction of less than five people in a group are for public places, like Marine Drive. Cinemas and restaurants have restricted entry. These entries can be monitored, so they can operate as usual, even after 9 pm, but at 50% capacity. These are not considered public places, but that does not mean they are exempted from rules. If COVID cases in the state go higher, we may think of implementing stringent rules on these sectors as well.” Though the celebrations will be low-key, this hasn’t dampened Mumbaikars’ spirit to welcome the New Year. Mumbaikars opt for low-key festivitiesMany Mumbaikars head to places like the Marine Drive and Worli Seaface on New Year’s. However, that is off the charts this year, too. Many people have altered their plans, and are opting for low-key celebrations. Bhavin Parmar, a 29-year-old businessman, said, “With things opening up in the last month and COVID cases under control, my friends and I had planned a proper New Year celebration. But now, we have changed our plans, and just only five of us will hang out at my home tomorrow and ring in the New Year. It is disappointing, of course, but then precautions have to be taken, and we all need to stay safe.” While some will stay put in their homes, others plan to venture out. Andheri resident Diksha Singh, said, “My friends and I have been meeting at malls as all of us are fully vaccinated, and for New Year’s eve, we plan to do the same. Around five to six of us will be at a restaurant tomorrow night. With 50 per cent capacity, and us taking all precautions of social distancing, using sanitisers, and wearing masks. We will be cautious.” ‘We want to reiterate that hotels and restaurants are fully aware of the guidelines’While the usual big bashes at various establishments will be missing, restaurant owners are all set to welcome patrons on New Year’s Eve. Shivanand Shetty, President, AHAR, said, “The restrictions and ban on assembly of more than five people between 9 pm-6 am is imposed upon public places. It does not apply to establishments like restaurants. We will continue to operate during regular hours of business at 50 per cent of the available capacity, as clarified in the latest circular.” Pradeep Shetty, Senior Vice President, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) & Joint Honourary Secretary, Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations Of India (FHRAI), says, “We want to reiterate that hotels and restaurants are fully aware of the guidelines. The staff is vaccinated and we are following all the guidelines and protocols. Restaurants will continue to operate as usual, and we are ready to welcome our guests.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaikars-opt-for-low-key-new-year-festivities-keep-spirits-high/articleshow/88573668.cms||Debarati S Sen
---||World||US: Another round of snow before thaw comes to frigid Northwest||SEATTLE: A thaw-out is coming for frozen Seattle and Portland, Oregon, but not before another round of snow that could compound problems for a region more accustomed to winter rain than arctic blasts.  And in Nevada the governor plans to declare a state of emergency due to snow and storm conditions affecting travel in the Lake Tahoe area of northern Nevada.  Forecasters say parts of western Washington could see up to 3 inches (7.6 cm) of snow Thursday and northwestern Oregon could see a similar amount.  The normally temperate part of the Pacific Northwest has shivered with temperatures hitting the single digits in some areas this week after extreme cold air from Canada's Fraser River Valley blew in on Sunday.  Snow and ice has made travel treacherous in some parts, forced closures and travel delays and prompted people to take shelter in emergency warming centers.  Temperatures could rise above freezing in Seattle Thursday and be even warmer in Portland, before airflow from the Pacific blows in on the weekend and causes the mercury to rise to more seasonable highs in the 40s Fahrenheit (4.4 Celsius).  State officials in Oregon have declared an emergency. In Multnomah County - home to Portland - about a half dozen weather shelters were open this week. A similar number of shelters were opened in Seattle's King County, which also declared an emergency.  Seattle leaders said city shelters will remain open through the new year.  Winter weather and a return to pre-pandemic levels of traffic have resulted in hundreds of accidents on Oregon roads this holiday season.  Oregon Public Broadcasting reported that between Dec. 23 and Dec. 28 there were 915 traffic accidents in the state. During that same period last year there were 365 accidents and 237 in 2019, according to Oregon State Police. The number of deaths has not been calculated yet.  David House, a spokesperson for the Oregon Department of Transportation, said the high number of accidents over the last week is a reminder to travellers to use caution and prepare for slick conditions.  "If you can sit tight for a couple more days, just avoid getting out there, that's going to be the safest thing you can possibly do," House said.  In Nevada, a statement released by Gov. Steve Sisolak's office said the emergency declaration will allow state officials to order vehicles traveling in on mountain highways to turn around and return to lower elevations until weather conditions subside and the roadways are safe to use.  "This will help prevent motorists from becoming stranded overnight on the roadways, potentially running out of gas in subfreezing temperatures without access to emergency services," the statement said.  It said the US 50 and State Routes 207 and 28 were experiencing long delays and dangerous conditions and that authorities need to be able to clear the roadways to make room for emergency vehicles and snow plows.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/another-round-of-snow-before-thaw-comes-to-frigid-northwest/articleshow/88576305.cms||---

Daily cases have more than doubled in just two days at a faster growth rate than ever seen during the pandemic in the country. By late Wednesday night, India had recorded 13,155 new cases during the day, with data from two states yet to come in. The tally on Tuesday was 9,155, which was an increase of nearly 47% over the previous day’s numbers (6,242), as per TOI’s Covid database. On each of the last two days, Covid cases have risen by more than 40%. Such high rates of growth over two successive days are unprecedented, although cases have previously jumped by a higher percentage on Tuesdays following a customary dip in detections on Mondays due to lower testing over the weekend. During the second wave, the highest growth rates (over two successive days) were recorded on March 31 and April 1, when cases spiked by 35% and 13.5%, respectively. The explosion of cases has been sudden and widespread since overall Covid numbers had been falling till last week. At least 18 state and Union territories, spread across the country except the northeast, have registered a rise in cases this week as compared with the corresponding days of the previous week. The notable exception to the rise so far is Kerala, which reported a higher count in the first three days of the previous week. Maharashtra recorded the highest daily jump in cases, logging 3,900 fresh infections, nearly double the number recorded on Tuesday (2,172). This was the highest single-day rise in cases in the state in 110 days, with Mumbai accounting for 2,445 new infections on Wednesday —by far, the highest daily number reported in any Indian city in the past several months. Maharashtra also posted the highest single-day Covid count for the first time since June 7. Other states where infections have surged sharply include Delhi (923 cases, up from 496 on Tuesday), Bengal (1,089, from 752), Karnataka (566, from 356), Gujarat (548, from 394), Jharkhand (344, from 155) and Haryana (217, from 126). Cases are also on the rise in Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Rajasthan, Telangana, Bihar, Punjab and Goa. While the surge coincides with the rise of the Omicron variant in the country, there’s no concrete evidence yet (based on studies or numbers) linking the two in India. The country has so far recorded less than 1,000 Omicron cases. Meanwhile, deaths remained below 100 for the sixth consecutive day, with 68 fatalities on Wednesday. This toll excluded old deaths added by Kerala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/national-daily-covid-cases-double-at-record-pace/articleshow/88576293.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

Several speakers at the meeting had then lashed out at the minority community, with one even threatening to kill former PM Manmohan Singh for his alleged “appeasement views”. Mahant Ravindra Puri of Mahanirvani Akhada said such remarks were “irresponsible” and “damaging to the religious and social harmony of India”. The mahant, who was elected president of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP) by one faction of the apex seer body in October this year, said, “Negative comments against any religion are regrettable and should be avoided.” Niranjani Akhada seer Ravindra Puri, elected ABAP president by another faction of the seer body around the same time, said in a similar vein that “those assembled for the Dharam Sansad should have chosen their words wisely while making public comments”. Jairam ashram peethadhishwar Brahmachari Brahmaswarup was more empathic in his condemnation of the hate speeches. “Those making such statements cannot be called seers. If seers speak such a language, people will cease to have faith in them. The speeches that were made at the Sansad have truly lowered Haridwar's dignity.” Times ViewIt is commendable that a group of seers have raised their voice against those making provocative speeches at the ‘Dharam Sansad.’ Top politicians too should speak up and discourage such rabble-rousers. Their silence emboldens them and encourages others to follow suit.The three-day Dharam Sansad, a closed-door event addressed by over 50 seers, was held from December 16 to 19 at the Ved Niketan Dham at Bhopatwala in Haridwar. It was organised by Yati Narsinghanand, the controversial priest of Dasna temple in Ghaziabad, who has often made provocative statements against certain communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/seers-slam-hate-speech-at-haridwar-dharma-sansad/articleshow/88576447.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||India||ICMR-NIV isolates Omicron Covid strain||PUNE: Scientists at the Pune-based Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV) have successfully isolated the Omicron strain of the novel coronavirus at the high-end bio-safety laboratory in Pashan. The step is critical in assessing the efficacy of vaccine as well as natural infection-induced antibodies in thwarting severe disease. “The Omicron variant of the virus, with all its signature changes (mutations), has been isolated. This is a milestone achievement that will further facilitate vaccine efficacy studies. In the next two weeks, we will be able to effectively gauge vaccine efficacy of Covishield and Covaxin against the new variant,” an ICMR official told TOI on Wednesday. The exercise will also find an answer to another critical question: Will the new variant outsmart existing antibodies in those who have had Covid from old strains? “Virus isolation is a significant achievement and the first step forward to know this. Now, we can take up a neutralization study to assess the efficacy of Covaxin and Covishield-induced antibodies and natural infection-induced antibodies against the Omicron lab-grown strain,” the official said. A neutralization study is the best way to assess vaccine efficacy and chances of reinfection. Through this, the scientists will also be in a position to compare the level of neutralizing ability of the vaccine-induced antibodies and natural infection-induced antibodies against the older strains (like delta) and the new Omicron variant. “And beyond cell culture experiments, the protective ability of vaccine-induced as well as natural infection-induced antibodies can also be studied now in animal models against Omicron,” said another virologist. Infection by any strain of SARS-CoV-2 kicks off an immune response against the entire virus, and not just against certain parts such as its ‘spikes’. This is why many experts believe mutations are unlikely to significantly affect the protective shield. There are 1,273 amino acids on the SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein that triggers the immune response. The new Omicron variant has 32 amino acid changes or mutations in the S protein. So, the assumption that vaccines will offer some protection against the new strain sounds logical, experts have said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/icmr-niv-isolates-omicron-covid-strain/articleshow/88576698.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Jakhar said the high command’s declaration of Captain Amarinder Singh as its CM candidate in the run-up to the 2017 polls was an exception. “This time, the high command has decided that the Punjab polls will be fought under its collective leadership, whether someone likes it or not,” Jakhar said, adding that only elected legislators would choose their leader. After the Congress screening committee meeting in Delhi on Wednesday, Jakhar said the final list of candidates would be released by the central election committee headed by AICC president Sonia Gandhi. Despite Jakhar’s assertion, Sidhu reiterated on Wednesday that the people of Punjab wanted to know “who will take them out of the kichar (mud) and how? People also want to know about the roadmap,” he told a TV channel. He said that during the 2017 polls he himself used to ask Aam Aadmi Party “where the groom of their marriage procession was? So naturally the people will ask me the same question this time”. At the same time, Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi urged people indirectly at a public gathering in Patiala district to give him a chance to become CM again. “AAP has said that you have seen Akalis and Congress, so give us a chance. I say that you have seen Captain (Amarinder Singh) and (Parkash Singh) Badal also. If you are satisfied with my work in these two months, give me a chance again,” Channi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-polls-sidhu-wants-cm-face-party-says-no-channi-eyes-top-job/articleshow/88576889.cms||Sanjeev Verma
---||World||New global Covid cases up 11%, govts urge caution: A world wrap||NEW DELHI: As new Covid-19 cases worldwide increased 11% last week from the week before, with World Health Organization saying on Wednesday that nearly 4.99 million infections were reported from December 20-26, governments have urged people to be cautious during new year's celebrations. The United Nations health agency, however, noted a decline in cases in South Africa, where new Omicron variant of the coronavirus was first detected just over a month ago, while new Covid-19 infections in the US soared to record highest levels on Tuesday. Here’s a wrap on the Covid cases and curbs around the world: US at over 265,000 per day average: The US have soared to the highest level on record at over 265,000 per day on average, a surge driven largely by the highly contagious omicron variant. The new cases per day have eclipsed the old mark of 250,000, set in mid-January, according to data kept by Johns Hopkins University. ‘No need to cancel small home gatherings’: Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious-disease expert, said Wednesday that there is no need to cancel small home gatherings among vaccinated and boosted family and friends. But “if your plans are to go to a 40- to 50-person new year's eve party with all the bells and whistles and everybody hugging and kissing and wishing each other a happy new year, I would strongly recommend that this year we not do that,'' he said. `Tsunami' of cases: World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he is worried about the Omicron combining with the Delta variant to produce a ``tsunami'' of cases. That, he said, will put ``immense pressure on exhausted health workers and health systems on the brink of collapse''. Europe’s winter surge: Several European countries, including France, Greece, Britain and Spain, reported record case counts this week, prompting several restrictions. According to updated British government figures, there were 10,462 people in hospital with Covid in England on Wednesday morning, the highest level since March 1. The UK also reported 183,037 daily cases in the last 24 hours, a new record. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have limited social contacts and closed nightclubs. Greece ordered ban on music at new year's celebrations, as it announces a new 24-hour record of 28,828 Covid-19 infections. Greece's health minister said the restrictions, originally planned to take effect on January 3, will start early Thursday after the daily number of infections rocketed to nearly 22,000 on Tuesday, more than double the record number reported the previous day. France set a new national record for Covid-19 with 208,000 new infections recorded over 24 hours in what Health Minister Olivier Veran calls a "tidal wave". In the country, more than 4 million adults remain unvaccinated. Germany: On Wednesday, official data showed 40,043 reported new cases over the past 24 hours and an infection rate, or incidence, of 205.5 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days in Germany. International development minister also said her country plans to donate another 75 million doses of coronavirus vaccines to poorer countries. Minister Svenja Schulze told the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland newspaper group in comments published Wednesday that Germany reached its target of donating 100 million doses in 2021. Poland reported a new daily toll of 794 deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday, a record high in the latest wave of infection, though a number that also reflects some delayed reporting due to Christmas. Deputy health minister, Waldemar Kraska, said that the number of new infections had declined by about 13% over the last week but that another wave fuelled by the Omicron variant is still expected to hit the country next month. Denmark, which has the world's highest infection rate per person, smashes its own record with 23,228 extra cases in 24 hours. Spain followed the United States in shortening the mandatory isolation period for people who test positive for the Covid-19, reducing it from 10 to seven days. Spain's prime minister has also ruled out any immediate national restrictions in response to the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. The Czech government is planning to test all employees for the coronavirus in effort to manage the expected new wave of infections caused by the Omicron variant. In Asia, South Korea is extending measures to guard against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus for another four weeks. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said Wednesday that short-term foreign travellers from 11 African countries will continue to be banned from entering the country, while all other international arrivals will be required to observe a 10-day quarantine until February 3. The agency says South Korea reported 109 new daily Covid-19 cases, involving the Omicron variant, the highest 24-hour tally since the country confirmed its first such case on December 1. Meanwhile, China showed no let up in its policy of zero tolerance to outbreaks, keeping 13 million people in the city of Xian under rigid lockdown for a seventh day, with 151 cases reported on Tuesday. Deputy Health Minister Waldemar Kraska said more than 75% of those who died were unvaccinated. Also, armed police in Jingxi in southern China, near the border with Vietnam, paraded four alleged violators of Covid rules through the streets, state media reported, a practice that was banned. Surge in Australia: Coronavirus cases surged across Australia on Wednesday as an outbreak of the Omicron variant exploded, prompting Prime Minister Scott Morrison to schedule an emergency national cabinet meeting. New daily infections in Australia spiked to nearly 18,300 on Wednesday, eclipsing the previous pandemic high of around 11,300 a day earlier. New infections in Sydney and surrounding parts of New South Wales state skyrocketed to more than 11,000, up from 6,000 a day earlier. Djokovic pulls out of ATP Cup: Novak Djokovic has pulled out of the ATP Cup in Sydney, organisers say, amid speculation about his vaccination status and whether he will defend his Australian Open title. Barcelona and Real Madrid players test positive: Three more Barcelona players, Ousmane Dembele, Samuel Umtiti and Gavi, have tested positive for the Covid-19, as have four more at Real Madrid: Thibaut Courtois, Federico Valverde, Eduardo Camavinga and Vinicius Junior, the clubs announce.

The chargesheet named Deshmukh’s two sons, Hrishikesh and Salil, and their CA Bhavik Panjwani as accused in the case. The chargesheet includes statements of former chief secretary of Maharashtra Sitaram Kunte and former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. The ED is yet to record Hrishikesh and Salil’s statement about the suspicious transactions they found during the investigation. It is stated that during investigation, the ED examined several suspicious deals executed by the companies associated with the Deshmukh family and sources of the funding. The ED inquired with Panjwani and others associated with most of these transactions, but was unable to get satisfactory explanations from them. The ED is yet to conclude if state transport minister Anil Parab of Shiv Sena had any role in the case, and the chargesheet does not include the statements of the 12 IPS-SPS officers that had been recorded during investigation. These officers had obtained their postings through the personal recommendation of Deshmukh, and the ED is investigating if it was done for monetary consideration. The ED will continue its investigation to find out if Parab had recommended the names of police officers for specific postings for any consideration. The ED was unable to get a copy of the report of former state intelligence department commissioner Rashmi Shukla, who had recorded telephone conversations of some influential persons allegedly discussing transfer-posting of police officers in exchange for money. Earlier in August, the ED had filed its first chargesheet against Deshmukh’s Nagpur-based trust, Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, his then private secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde, among others, including now-dismissed police officer Sachin Waze. In the first chargesheet, the ED had established money trail of Rs 4.8 crore cash that Waze had collected from bar owners in Mumbai when he was working with Mumbai police, and the money was diverted to Deshmukh’s trust as donation with the help of hawala operators. Deshmukh has been accused of misusing his post and asking Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from bar and restaurant owners for him .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/anil-deshmukh-family-laundered-rs-50cr-says-ed-chargesheet/articleshow/88577223.cms||Vijay V Singh

Politicians, family members of the slain civilians and commoners took to social media after the SIT cleared the security forces of any blame on Tuesday. They suspected the probe team’s findings, prompting the SIT to issue the warning. “Several people have called the ongoing probe a 'concocted cover-up story,' 'ornamental probe,' 'clean chit to killers,' 'fairy tale of police,' etc,” SIT head and central Kashmir DIG Sujit Kumar said. “Such speculative statements from political leaders have a tendency to create provocation, rumour, fear and alarm among the masses or a particular section of society,” he said. “This approach is against the law and may attract appropriate penal provisions.” The probe is not over yet, the SIT said a day after it announced that a doctor and a businessman killed in the shooting were either used as human shields by terrorists or shot dead by them. The SIT also said Dr Mudasir Gul had harboured terrorists, while businessman Altaf Bhat had concealed information about their presence in his commercial complex. The two men’s death had triggered outrage and widespread protests, with many calling the shootout a “staged encounter”. According to the SIT, members of the public were invited to depose before an inquiry officer with whatever evidence they may have on the Hyderpora deaths. “All such persons making statements (on social media) should have approached the inquiry officer with genuine evidence for corroboration or contradiction of facts in the case,” Kumar said and asked people to come forward with “any evidence” since the probe is still on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dont-speculate-jk-sit-on-hyderpora-shootout-warn-politicians/articleshow/88577265.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The state government has so far fully vaccinated 76% of the targeted population in the 18-plus bracket. Health officials said achieving 100% double-dose administration is still a priority and added that efforts were also on to administer anti-Covid vaccination for the 15-18 group that has not been vaccinated even once. Arundathi Chandrashekar, mission director, national health mission, told TOI: "The state will need to cover 31 lakh people in the 15-18 years age group and 12 lakh seniors with comorbidities." Another official said the number of seniors could be higher since the group is nearly 9.5% of the total population. "From our experience, a majority of the people in this category have at least one ailment," the official said. BBMP special commissioner Dr KV Trilok Chandra, who was health commissioner earlier, said meetings have been conducted with schools, colleges, industrial technical institutes and labour department officials to ensure that all eligible teens are vaccinated. "In Bengaluru, we have to cover 5 lakh students and 10 lakh seniors. We are making efforts to ensure nobody is left out," he said. On strategies for out-of-school children, he said: "In the first phase, those from all these institutions and those walking in (at PHCs) will be covered. The labour department is mandated with identifying students who may have entered the labour force." Vaccination data as of 5pm on December 29 shows 3.8 crore of the 4.9 crore people in the said category have been administered both doses. In Bengaluru city — BBMP plus Bengaluru Urban district — more than 79 lakh (or 76%) of 1.05 crore have been fully vaccinated. The state has administered more than 8.5 crore vaccine doses covering 4.7 crore people. More than 7.5 crore doses out of the 8.5 crore are of Covishield, while Covaxin accounts for more than 99 lakh. More than 4.2 crore doses have been administered to women compared to 4.3 crore doses to men. As reported by TOI on December 26, at least 48 lakh people are due for the second dose in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-to-jab-31l-in-15-18-age-group-12l-seniors-from-jan/articleshow/88577319.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||Hyderabad||In Hyderabad, rush for nikahs to beat marriage bill curbs||HYDERABAD: A scramble to solemnise nikahs that might run into legal hurdles if and when the Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021 becomes a law is keeping mosques in Hyderabad's Old City busy and buzzing. The brides at these hurried ceremonies are all between 18 and 20 years of age. Most were supposed to get married sometime in 2022-2023, but fear of the bill being passed has made their families wary of waiting until then. The marriage bill, supposed to be applicable to all communities, seeks to raise the legal age of marriage for women from 18 to 21 years. "I have three daughters – one of them differently-abled. How can I wait another two years to get at least one of them married?" said Samarunnissa, mother of a 19-year-old who was taken to a local mosque on Tuesday for a low-key nikah. "We had planned to have the ceremony in mid-2022 as her father recently went to Sri Lanka in search of a job. We were hoping he would come back with some money for us to arrange the wedding. But when we heard about the bill, we had to rush," the Babanagar resident said. TOI spoke to at least half a dozen families living across the Old City that have advanced the wedding dates of their daughters for a similar reason. In almost all cases though, the ‘vidaai' has been put off for financial reasons. "It is mandatory that we send our daughter off to her in-laws with some furniture, gold, clothes and cash. But right now, I am struggling to even earn a meal for the family," said Rehmat Ali, who lost his job as a driver during the 2020 lockdown. "So, while the nikah is done (on December 26), I have sought time (four-five months) for the vidaai," said the 50-year-old father of five daughters and a son. The Chandrayangutta resident is banking on KCR's "Shaadi Mubarak" scheme to fulfil his parental duty. Rolled out by the TRS government in 2014, the scheme extends financial aid of Rs 1 lakh to girls – SC/ST/EBC or minorities – who are at least 18 years old and eligible for marriage. "Families are getting the nikah done so that they can apply for the scheme immediately and get the money in the next few months. Once that is processed, they can proceed with the vidaais," said Feroz Khan, a local leader from the area. According to him, more than 40 nikahs are lined up for the next few days. Among them is Aziz Ahmed's 18-year-old niece, who was initially supposed to get married next February. "The girl is an orphan and was being looked after by her grandmother until she died a few months ago. Now, if the bill comes into force, who will take care of her for another three years?" Ahmed said. She will now be married on December 31. Reacting sharply to the proposed bill, Muslim cleric Maulana Jafar Pasha, who is the ameer (president) of Amarat-e-Millat-e-Islamia Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, said it is nothing but an "intrusion" of the Muslim personal law. "In Islam, a Muslim girl can get married once she attains puberty. If the bill is passed, imagine the multiple issues – of safety and security of these girls – that it will invite," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-city-rush-for-nikahs-to-beat-marriage-bill-curbs/articleshow/88577346.cms||---

Loss of taste and smell isn’t being reported as commonly as it was during the second wave driven by the Delta variant in April and May this year, but doctors say it’s still early days in the current surge to say with a degree of certainty that the symptoms have changed.Body ache, rashes and stomach cramps are among other initial symptoms manifesting in recently infected Covid patients. Overall, the symptoms appear to be milder than earlier, the doctors say. Besides the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, which has spread to several countries, including India, a significant difference between the second wave and now is vaccinations. The immunity shield was low during the second wave as inoculations had just begun, but vaccines have reached most of the population now (officially, the city has administered both doses to its entire estimated eligible population).A 32-year-old resident of Sector 45, who had no symptoms other than headaches, got his Covid-positive report on December 24. “My family members were shocked. I am in home isolation now and have no other symptoms of cold and flu. But the headaches have persisted,” he said.Dr Tushar Tayal, senior consultant, internal medicine, Narayana hospital, said, “Symptoms like headache, sore throat, fever, cough and cold and fatigue are commonly seen among recent Covid patients. While loss of smell and taste does not get reported a lot, there is no significant change in symptoms yet.”Dr Ashutosh Shukla, senior director, internal medicine and medical advisor, Max Hospital, said, “The symptoms are similar to what we have been observing in the past. But some people with a travel history or close contact with other Covid patients do not have any symptoms.”The biggest concern now is the significantly higher transmissibility of the Omicron variant, according to doctors, who have advised people to get tested immediately if they have flu-like symptoms. Dr Arunesh Kumar, HOD and senior consultant of pulmonology, Paras Hospitals, said, “Omicron has the same symptoms as common cold. But the difference is the transmissibility. The RT-PCR test is the only option to differentiate between the two.”Health department data shows more than 60% of the new cases are asymptomatic, making detection of infections a challenge. The health department is carrying out sentinel surveillance to check which variant is currently infecting people the most. Of the 502 Covid patients in the city now, 492 are recovering at home and 10 are admitted to hospitals. “What we are observing is that this is just like in the initial phase of Covid when patients had mild symptoms. But then people developed severe conditions. We are sending 2% of the samples for testing to know which variant is currently affecting people more,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon.“More and more people are testing positive, which was also the trend during the second wave. Many are suffering from acute gastroenteritis. But I have not put a single patient on high-flow oxygen in the past four months,” said Dr Sushila Kataria, an intensive care expert at Medanta.Doctors stressed people should continue Covid-appropriate behaviour such as handwashing, sanitisation and social distancing. They added that people, whether fully vaccinated or not, should not let their guard down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/initial-symptoms-mild-over-60-patients-asymptomatic/articleshow/88577348.cms||Ipsita Pati

On his way, he stopped at a general store to buy household items. When he got out of the store, his cousins allegedly hit him from behind with an axe and killed him on the spot.One of the accused, identified as Sonu or Bura, has been arrested, but the other three are absconding. Police claimed that the brothers had been arguing over the repair of a tubewell for the past month. The victim had started the repair work but his cousins criticised his move and wanted to install a new one. The fields, police said, are shared between five brothers but it was their sons who got into a dispute over the tubewell and the electrical connections. A week ago, the dispute had allegedly got ugly, with the cousins hitting the victim with bricks. After another argument on Tuesday, the cousins took matters into their own hands and used an axe to hit the victim on his neck and head.The victim was rushed to the hospital but was declared dead on arrival. “An argument escalated into a fight and took an ugly turn. Nearly 4-6 attempts were made to murder Rakesh with the axe till died on the spot,” a police officer said.Police have filed an FIR against Lalit, Nitesh, Sonu and Bhavinder at the Dhauj police station under sections 148 (armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (Unlawful assembly), 302 (punishment for murder) of IPC. “We have arrested Sonu and are tracking down the other accused with the help of the crime branch,” said the cop added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/four-kill-cousin-after-dispute-over-a-tubewell/articleshow/88577349.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||Gurgaon||Flower market likely to come up on city outskirts||Gurgaon: The Flower Market and Centre of Excellence of Flowers that was supposed to be set up in Sector 52A will most likely to come up on the outskirts of Gurgaon, with the additional chief secretary (agriculture) exploring available options. According to officials, although the facility, which was supposed to be developed jointly by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board (HSAMB), was earlier supposed to come up on an 11.41 acre piece of land in Sector 52A, it was decided during a meeting last month that the land on offer was "not suitable" for the purpose."We had a meeting with the Additional Chief Secretary (ACS) Agriculture in November, where it was decided that the land offered by GMDA in sector 52A was not suitable for the project and, instead, the Chief Administrator of the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) would identify an alternate piece of land of 8 to 12 acres for development of the flower market," said a senior GMDA official who did not want to be named. The issue was further discussed during the ninth Authority meet of the GMDA held earlier this month, where Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who is also the Chairman of the GMDA, directed that the flower market should instead be developed on the outskirts of the city. "The Chairman has directed the ACS Agriculture to scout for a site in some outskirt area of the city, such as near Dwarka Expressway, to ensure the project does not cause any kind of congestion within Gurgaon," said the official quoted above, adding that the possibilities in this regard are now being examined by the ACS Agriculture in consultation with the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/flower-market-likely-to-come-up-on-city-outskirts/articleshow/88577350.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||Gurgaon||Queues get longer at Metro stations as cap on seating capacity enforced||Gurgaon: Long queues were witnessed outside several metro stations in Gurgaon on Wednesday after Delhi announced that trains will run at 50% capacity with no provision for standing for commuters.Passengers, seen jostling to move ahead in queues, expressed concern over the rush and the wait time. Lowering the passenger capacity, they said, was pointless as many were forced to stand in queues on stations and platforms sans social distancing.Amid a rise in Covid cases in the national capital, the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) imposed fresh restrictions and capped the seating capacity on Delhi metro to 50% seating capacity and disallowed standing passengers. Sarita Yadav, 38, from Dharuhera, who was travelling to Delhi, said she would have started earlier if she had known there would be a delay. Yadav, who was due to reach Delhi at 11.30 am for a work-related appointment, had to wait in the queue outside the metro station till noon. Another Satish Kumar, 34, who also had to stand in a queue for nearly half an hour, claimed he missed an important meeting at work. “What’s the point? We are standing outside in a long queue back to back. Won’t we contract Covid here in the queue and take it along inside the metro station? Isn’t this entire exercise by the government futile and meant to create inconvenience for us,” Kumar said.Two CISF personnel, stationed outside IFFCO Chowk metro station to manage the queue, said that the gates were shut for 5 minutes after each batch of 10 people was being sent inside the station. “We have received orders that a batch of 10 people will go inside after which there will be a wait of a few minutes before another batch is allowed. This is being done in the backdrop of the Covid situation,” one of the CISF personnel said.While a few commuters appreciated the government’s decision, some said the authorities should have made provisions to manage the crowd outside stations better. “The metro authority and CISF personnel are not able to manage the crowd well. People are pushing each other, leaning on to one other, defeating the entire purpose of Covid-appropriate behaviour,” 38-year-old Kavish said.Meanwhile, serpentine queues and waiting periods to enter a Metro station that sometimes stretch longer than the journey itself were back in Delhi also on Wednesday, along with massive crowding at bus stops during the rush hour as Level 1 of the Covid Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) was imposed. To regulate the number of passengers inside stations and trains to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour, DMRC has kept only 444 out of the total 712 gates in the network open. It has also requested passengers to travel only if essential and keep some additional time for travel. DMRC has deployed 15 flying squads to ensure that the safety protocol is maintained.“Not everyone has the luxury of working from home and since private offices have been allowed to open, people like me have no option but to go to work. I can’t afford the Metro and buses are allowing very few passengers,” said Rajesh Pal, a resident of Kapashera.Amit Bhatt, executive director (integrated transport) at WRI India, said something should be done to reduce the demand on public transport now and encourage more people to work remotely, excluding those whose job demands that they be out in the field. “In the global experience, there has not been any empirical study that says that public transport has helped in spreading Covid,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/queues-get-longer-at-metro-stations-as-cap-on-seating-capacity-enforced/articleshow/88577351.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||Gurgaon||U-turns force commuters to hit ‘dirt track’ on Pataudi Rd||Gurgaon: Commuters may have to grapple with the non-motorable stretch of the Pataudi Road that connects to the Dwarka Expressway near Sector 88 longer as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has no plan to alter the U-turn diversions in place for the construction of the elevated portion of the expressway.The two temporary U-turns — one to facilitate traffic movement from Dwarka Expressway to Pataudi road and the other on the opposite side — were opened by the NHAI after construction of the elevated portion of the expressway began. According to commuters, both these U-turns are effectively dirt tracks that make commuting difficult, especially during winter and monsoon.“Every winter, the authorities talk of pollution and dust mitigation. This year, too, schools have been closed and construction activities banned. Yet, diversions like these continue to remain open. Dust flies on the stretch throughout the day, adding to the poor air quality that affects the residents of gated colonies and villages in the vicinity the most,” Trisha Singh, a resident of Sector 89, said. The uncertainty over the completion of the Dwarka Expressway, which has been already been delayed so many times, only added to the concern, she said.An employee of a private firm at Sector 88A, Vinay Malik said the NHAI should have made a concrete road to minimise the inconvenience caused to the residents and commuters. “Every monsoon, travelling to and from this area is a complete nightmare simply because of these diversions. Whenever it rained, the entire stretch was filled with slush and parts of it become flooded, making driving extremely difficult. This also led to a lot of congestion. The authority should undertake on the stretch now to make our lives a little easier,” he said. NHAI officials, however, told TOI that they have no plans to undertake any work on the two U-turn diversions. “These diversions have only been made because work is being undertaken in that section. Once that work is completed, the original route will be restored,” a senior NHAI official said. Stating that a timeline for restoring the route would first require information as to how much work was left at that junction, the official said, “The entire expressway does not have to be completed for the normal traffic route to be restored. It will be done once that particular junction is completed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/u-turns-force-commuters-to-hit-dirt-track-on-pataudi-rd/articleshow/88577352.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Only 20% EWS admissions yet, panels to clear hurdles||Gurgaon: The directorate of school education, on Tuesday evening, issued a directive to the district education department to constitute special committees to expedite EWS admissions in private schools. To date, 20% of eligible students in the EWS category have been admitted to district schools, even as the last date for admissions is December 31.Earlier this month, a list of 887 students eligible to get free education in private schools under Rule 134A of the Haryana Education Rules was published. Initially, the government had set December 25 as the last day for completing all the admissions but later extended it to the end of this month. However, private schools are delaying the admissions, citing issues with the income certificates of the parents.“While a few schools have cited issues with documents of parents, others are unnecessarily delaying the admissions. We are issuing directions to all the schools to comply with orders and ensure that students get admitted,” said an education department official.The department claimed that ironing out the issues with the documents would expedite the admissions. According to the department, the special committees would ascertain the authenticity of the income certificates.“Many parents have not uploaded correct details. In a few cases, there are mismatches. Additionally, schools have rejected admissions, alleging that parents submitted false income certificates. The department has asked us to constitute a committee and address these issues. We’ll soon iron out the issues and ensure all eligible students get admitted in the schools,” said district education officer Indu Boken.School authorities, on their part, said that many of them are not in favour of admissions this year, and the ones that followed government orders have had to deal with the tardy process of document verification.“It is almost the end of the session. Already, schools are struggling with the constantly changing orders regarding school opening and have to adjust their pedagogy accordingly. On top of that, we are getting forced to give admissions in a process that is in disarray. We don’t understand the need for such hurried implementation of the order,” said Drona Public School principal Bhisham Bharadwaj.Schools also cited issues such as non-payment of the pending dues for the past two academic sessions to deny the admissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/only-20-ews-admissions-yet-panels-to-clear-hurdles/articleshow/88577353.cms||---

Recently, these stretches were internally transferred within GMDA, from one division to the other, further delaying repairs.Now, however, annual repairs have been initiated, with the GMDA first targeting the stretches between sectors 81 and 115, which house several gated condominiums, hotels, office complexes and commercial spaces.“We have started a drive to make the entire road network free of potholes by undertaking maintenance and patchwork along the stretches. This is routine work, normally done after the monsoon. We expect that although the task will take place in continuity later on as well, we will be able to make all roads in these parts pothole-free in the next two or three months,” said Amit Godara, executive engineer, GMDA’s infrastructure I division. He added that the roads will be ready in time for the next monsoon.Godara further pointed out that if the problem is resolved in one go in the entire area, maintenance would become easier later.Several residents TOI spoke to expressed relief.“Removal of potholes is a much-needed intervention in the new sectors of Gurgaon. I hope the work done is of good quality that is able to manage the traffic load and sustain, at least for some time. If the work is poor and potholes develop again within days, there is no point,” said Nishant Upadhyay, a resident of Sector 84.Nalini Kumar, a resident of Sector 86, said, “Potholes have been a constant problem for everyone who lives in or visits this area. They not only increase traffic congestion, but can also lead to mishaps. So, any work being done towards their removal is welcome. My only concern is that this doesn’t just end up being one of the claims made by GMDA and that it actually materialises on the ground.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gmda-kicks-off-repair-work-on-key-new-sector-roads/articleshow/88577354.cms||Sakshi Dayal

My husband was in hospital for 10 days and got discharged around 3-4 days ago. I came to meet the commissioner of police and hand him a letter demanding protection for the family. I feel the associates of Ghaziabad municipal council chairman would try to attack my husband or our family members again,” Singh said.She also stated that the attack seemed to be ‘planned’ and claimed that when her husband was posted in Ghaziabad, the same people had tried to attack him.Meanwhile, in the clash on December 14, a counter-FIR has also been filed against Bhadana.

Previously, it had conducted a similar survey in Ghaziabad and four other districts, but results are yet to come.For the current survey, the state government, officials said, provided lists of groups and individuals from whom samples got collected in each district. The survey included two sets of people – those who contracted Covid and those who did not. In total, 1,500 samples got collected in five different categories, including health care workers and older people.Gautam Budh Nagar district public health expert Dr Amir Kumar said that officials completed the collection of samples on Wednesday and sent 100 for the study. The results of a previous sero-surveillance in the district by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had revealed that 66.7% of the participants had antibodies, he added.Ghaziabad district surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta said, “This survey will also investigate how long after recovering from the Covid infection and getting the vaccine, antibodies can be present in people. In Ghaziabad, the government identified 125 people for the survey, and 104 samples will be part of the survey.”The present survey would also investigate the effects of the infection on public health. “The study would look into the chance of re-infection and permanent or temporary health-related problems after the viral infection,” Dr Gupta added. The other 13 districts include Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Moradabad, Meerut, Prayagraj, Bareilly, Banda, Agra, Kanpur Nagar, Maharajganj, Deoria and Azamgarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/15-dists-part-of-second-sero-survey-in-up-1-5k-samples-collected/articleshow/88577359.cms||Aditya Dev

Under the umbrella of Yuva Adhikar Rozgaar Andolan - an amalgamation of about 10 farmer outfits – a group of 70 farmers led by Kisan Ekta Sangh leader Manish BDC and advocate Indraveer Bhati met Chaudhary and apprised him of their demands and sought support for the farmers sitting on protest at two separate places in Greater Noida. The farmers say that they have been denied of the benefits under the new land acquisition law and a group has been sitting in protest in Bodaki village for the past 176 days while another group has been on protest in Palla village for the past 16 days.Talking to TOI, Manish BDC, national treasurer of Kisan Ekta Sangh said that the RLD chief assured the party’s support to the farmers. "The meeting went on for over an hour. We met Chaudhary and informed him that the farmers who have been affected by the land acquisition for the DFCC and DMIC projects have been denied of the benefits under the new land acquisition law. Our land is gone and our youngsters do not have employment. We also demanded that the abadi land of the affected farmers be left untouched," he said.The group also demanded employment for the farm labourers who are dependent on farm lands for their livelihood."There are different kinds of farm labourers who are dependent on farming for their livelihood. With our land gone, many of them too have lost their livelihood. We demand that they too should get benefits," he said.Farmers stop Ganga water pipeline work Hundreds of farmers sitting on protest in Palla village have demanded that the Greater Noida Authority (GNIDA) officials meet them and resolve their issues. "The Greater Noida Authority is not listening to us. So, we had no choice but to stop the work of the gangajal pipeline. We have stopped the work for the past one week and it will remain stopped till our meeting is held with the DM and the GNIDA CEO," Jai Jawaan Jai Kisaan Morcha leader Sunil Fouji told TOI.While about 1700 families have been affected by the land acquisition process in Palla, Chithera, Pali, Kathaira villages, farmers are demanding that the 4000 families from whom land has been directly purchased should also be considered as the beneficiaries and extended the benefit of the acquisition as per the land law.Fouji said that a meeting with the DM followed by the GNIDA CEO is likely to take place on Friday after which a call will be taken on the future course of their protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/farmers-protesting-projects-in-gr-noida-seek-rld-support/articleshow/88577363.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Noida||Sewage rules flouted, societies under scanner||Noida: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has recently come down heavily on the Noida Authority and the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board and expressed unhappiness over the way they have dealt with sewage generated by group housing societies since November 1, 2019.After a case was filed in the NGT over sewage discharge and treatment by group housing societies in Noida in 2018, the pollution control board and the Authority had conducted joint inspections at all the 95 group housing societies in Noida and submitted a report to the tribunal. During the inspection, the teams had found that sewage treatment plants were installed in only 72, but only 12 societies had treatment plants that were compliant with the Ministry of Environment norms and followed the zero-discharge norms of wastewater.The tribunal has now asked the Authority to initiate criminal action against the erring societies and impose penalties — about Rs 8.40 crore each — on them for causing environmental hazards. The green panel also made strong objections to the working of the Authority and asked it to issue partial occupation certificates to developers only if STPs were made functional before families were allowed to move in.On Wednesday, Noida Authority’s chief executive officer Ritu Maheshwari said they will now undertake fresh inspections to check discharge standards of faecal coliform and initiate criminal action or impose penalties on erring societies.“We have noted down the points raised by the tribunal. A fresh action plan is being prepared and will be implemented. Some developers had sought time to complete the STP work till January and we will revisit those projects. Strong action against the violators will be taken. The water and sewerage department is under directions to leave no gaps while checking for compliance,” Maheshwari said.The petitioner in the case, Abhisht K Gupta, meanwhile, said that while the Authority has done some work in the past six months, a lot still remained. “Only a handful of societies are following zero discharge norms of wastewater. The Authority needs to particularly focus on societies in 7x sectors as thousands of families have moved in,” he said.Amit Gupta, a resident of Sector 77’s Prateek Wisteria, said, “I have been sending photographs and videos of societies that are discharging wastewater directly into drains in Sectors 74 and 75 to the Authority but action is rarely initiated.” Gupta also pointed out the pollution control board and Noida Authority should work closely for better enforcement of sewage discharge norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/sewage-rules-flouted-societies-under-scanner/articleshow/88577364.cms||---
---||Noida||Noida airport: Farmers want more landowners to attend govt camps||Greater Noida: A large number of farmers from the six Jewar villages that are likely to be impacted by the second phase of the Noida International Airport project are expected to participate in the camps to be organised by the district administration from January 7 next year.To finalise their next strategy, farmers had recently approached advocates and experts and were informed that under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 2013, the administration assumes that a landowner who does not visit such camps -- where consent is noted down -- is in favour of the project.Advocate Saurabh Yadav told TOI that under the Act it is believed that the one who wants to register their protest will take extra effort to visit the camp and mention their objection or reservations in writing. “The person protesting has to register his objections before the administration or the acquisition agency in person, otherwise it is assumed he/she is willing to give up the land,” Yadav said.Farmers have now taken initiative to create awareness about the provisions of the Act among the landowners, urge them to visit the camps and submit their dissent note in writing to oppose the project.On Sunday, a group of villagers had also held a panchayat in Ranhera and decided against giving their consent for the acquisition of land for the second phase of the airport project unless the government met all their demands. The farmers had maintained that the social impact assessment (SIA) report, which has been approved by the government, did not include many of their demands. Among the other demands that the villagers want to be fulfilled is four-time compensation over the prevailing circle rate, a roadmap for skill development of children and equal rights for unmarried women from each family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-airport-farmers-want-more-landowners-to-attend-govt-camps/articleshow/88577366.cms||---

Senior cleric and Shia scholar Maulana Zaheer Abbas Rizvi said that till the Dharma Sansad incident in Haridwar, some elements would make provocative statements, but now they are so emboldened that they openly call for ethnic cleansing of a community. “This is a serious law and order issue and the government must act against those who are vitiating the atmosphere. Our country is at a critical juncture and we must join hands to defeat the forces who want to disrupt peace and harmony,” said Maulana Rizvi.M A Khalid of All India Milli Council suggested that legal action should be initiated against those who made provocative utterances. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/muslim-groups-meet-in-city-condemn-call-for-genocide/articleshow/88577367.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Fresh Covid cases in Mumbai almost double to 235-day high of 2,445||MUMBAI: Covid detections almost doubled in the city and the state on Wednesday, a day when Maharashtra confirmed 38 Omicron cases without any of the patients having international travel history. Mumbai reported 2,445 cases, up from 1,333 just a day before. Driven by the Mumbai surge, Maharashtra saw 3,900 cases. The state’s case detection was highest in 110 days. Mumbai’s cases were the highest since May 8 (2,664). Mumbai’s daily positivity rate touched nearly 5% on Wednesday, the highest in almost eight months. In just seven days, it grew from 1.2% to 4.8%, a strong indicator of the beginning of the third wave. It has led to a corresponding rise in the state’s positivity rate to over 3.6%, its highest in almost three months. State and civic experts, however, said the positivity rate as a parameter has to be considered in the context of the Omicron variant that is highly transmissible, but has not led to a significant surge in hospitalisations yet. The state may consider imposing additional curbs. Calling the surge “alarming”, health minister Rajesh Tope said, “A decision will be taken in a meeting with the CM and the state Covid task force.” The state feels the situation in Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, Pune, Solapur, Sangli and Satara is disturbing owing to non-adherence to norms. The number of active cases in the state increased from 6,481 on December 14 to 11,492 on December 28. In Mumbai, it increased from 1,769 to 5,803 during the same period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fresh-cases-in-mumbai-almost-double-to-235-day-high-of-2445/articleshow/88577369.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Two walk in, shoot staffer & rob Rs 2.5 lakh from Dahisar SBI||MUMBAI: Two masked men walked into a State Bank of India (SBI) branch at Dahisar West on Wednesday, fired at a contractual employee and fled with Rs 2.5 lakh in cash. Sandesh Gomane, the 25-year-old employee, died. The branch did not have a security guard for at least a year. Eight police teams have been formed to hunt for the robbers. The State Bank of India branch in Gurukul society in Dahisar (West)The incident occurred around 3.25pm at the SBI branch in Gurukul society, less than a kilometre from Dahisar railway station. Two young men-- one of them sporting slippers and the other wearing a cap-- walked in. Gomane, who was seated close to the entrance, immediately stood up. One of the robbers whipped out a pistol he was hiding behind his bag and fired a single round at his chest. As Gomane sank into a chair, the men threatened other staffers of the bank, brandishing their pistol. They kept saying that Gomane would survive when taken to a hospital. The duo went to a female cashier's desk where they found Rs 2.5 lakh. One of the robbers asked a clerk where the bank's lockers were but the other gestured that it was time for them to leave. "I was seated in the society compound when I saw two men running away. My neighbours and I decided to check at the bank premises when we learnt of the firing," said Pravin Makwana, a resident of Gurukul society. Makwana said this was the first time in decades that a violent crime had occurred in the neighbourhood. "The bank has not had a guard for at least a year which could be one of the reasons it was targetted. We believe the robbers had conducted a recce at the premises as they knew where the cashier's desk was," said a police officer. The branch is small in size and a majority of employees are women. About seven to eight employees were present when the incident occurred. Police recorded their statements till late on Wednesday. Gomane was part of an outsourced agency and was working as a helper at the branch for the past eight months. He lived in Virar with his brothers and was single. His parents reside at Chiplun. Police said the robbers may have panicked and shot him, fearing he would thwart their plan. A parallel probe is being carried out by the crime branch. Police are scanning surveillance camera footage from adjacent societies and establishments. Investigators suspect the robbers to be amateurs. TOI reached out to SBI for a comment but did not receive a response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/two-walk-in-shoot-staffer-rob-2-5l-from-dahisar-sbi/articleshow/88577372.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Deshmukh family laundered Rs 50 crore via companies, says ED chargesheet||MUMBAI: Former state home minister Anil Deshmukh and his family have laundered Rs 50 crore through companies associated with them, the Enforcement Directorate said in its over 7,000-page chargesheet submitted in the special PMLA court on Wednesday. The chargesheet, which is the ED’s second one, has named Deshmukh’s sons Hrishikesh and Salil and their CA Bhavik Panjwani as accused in the case. It includes statements of former state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh. The agency is still to record Hrishikesh and Salil’s statements about suspicious transactions found during the probe. It had examined several suspicious deals executed by the firms under lens and sources of the funding. The ED chargesheet on Wednesday named, among others, the Deshmukh family's CA Bhavik Panjwani as accused. The ED inquired with Panjwani and others associated with most of the suspicious transactions they had found, but was unable to get satisfactory explanations from them. The agency is still to conclude if state transport minister Anil Parab of the Shiv Sena had any role in the case, and the chargesheet does not include the statements of the 12 IPS-SPS officers that had been recorded during the investigation. These officers had obtained their postings through the personal recommendation of Deshmukh, and the ED is investigating if it was done for monetary consideration. The agency will continue its probe to find out if Parab had recommended the names of police officers for specific postings for any consideration. The ED was unable to get a copy of the report of former state intelligence commissioner Rashmi Shukla, who had recorded telephone conversations of some influential persons allegedly discussing transfer-posting of police officers in exchange for money. Deshmukh was arrested on November 2, and he is in judicial custody. Earlier in August, the ED had filed its first chargesheet against Deshmukh's Nagpur-based trust, Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, his then private secretary Sanjeev Palande, PA Kundan Shinde and ,now-dismissed police officer Sachin Waze, among others. In that chargesheet, the agency had established the trail of Rs 4.8 crore cash Waze had collected from bar owners in Mumbai and the diversion of the money to Deshmukh's trust as donation with the help of Delhi-based hawala operators. The ED is investigating two aspects in the money laundering case it has registered against Deshmukh based on the CBI FIR. The former minister has been accused of misusing his post and asking Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from bar and restaurant owners for him every month. The ED is also examining the allegation related to the transfer-posting of policemen in exchange of money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/deshmukh-family-laundered-50cr-via-cos-ed-chargesheet/articleshow/88577373.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Bengaluru||Flipkart treats gig workers best among platform cos||BENGALURU: Flipkart treats gig workers the best among 11 of the largest platform-based companies in India, according to a study. Most companies fare quite poorly in the study, which was conducted by Fairwork India, part of a global organisation that highlights the best and worst practices in the platform economy. Even Flipkart’s score (of 7 out of 10) has not improved over 2020. But it has risen to the top, from its No. 2 position in last year’s study. That’s because last year’s topper, Urban Company, lost three points and was down to No. 2 this year. Swiggy, Zomato and BigBasket improved their points and rankings. Dunzo lost three points from last year, Amazon lost a point and this year has only 1 of 10. Uber and Ola had fared poorly last year — this year they are worse, with zero points each, and are at the bottom of the list. Gig workers are those who work on-demand, mostly through the apps of the platform companies. In Uber and Ola’s case, these are mostly drivers. In the case of many others, it is delivery personnel, and in the case of firms like Urban Company, it is those who provide domestic and personal care. This is the third year that Fairwork India has done this exercise. The Fairwork India team includes the Centre for IT and Public Policy (CITAPP), and IIIT Bangalore, and the study is done in partnership with the global Fairwork network and Oxford University. The evaluation relies on five Fairwork principles — fair pay, fair conditions, fair contracts, fair management, and fair representation. Scores are awarded out of 10, based on whether a platform meets the basic standard (one point) and a higher standard (an additional point) for each of these five principles. The report said that the take-home earnings of gig workers declined this year, and part of it is due to lower demand for some services, increase in fuel expenses and platform commissions due to the pandemic. The report said BigBasket, Flipkart and Urban Company were the only ones that in 2021 committed to ensuring that all gig workers on their platforms would earn at least the hourly local minimum wage, after factoring in their work-related costs. The report said that while several platforms introduced Covid-19 safety measures, along with improvements to their insurance policies for their platform workers, only Flipkart and Urban Company were awarded the basic and advanced points under the ‘fair conditions’ principle. These two platforms, besides offering Covid-specific income protection this year, have also committed to compensating loss of income that would extend to situations beyond the pandemic. Flipkart, Swiggy, and Zomato received both the basic and advanced points for ‘fair contract’ because they modified their contracts for gig workers to reduce the asymmetry in liabilities between gig workers and platforms. Often, platforms tend to unreasonably exclude liability on the part of the platform, and put the onus on gig workers. BigBasket, Flipkart, Swiggy, and Urban Company scored both the basic and advanced points in ‘fair management’ as they adopted policies against the discrimination of their gig workers, and have committed to regular, independent audits to ensure there are no biases in their work allocation systems. No platform earned either the basic or the advanced point on the fair representation principle, which refers to worker representation through a collective body or trade union. “It is disconcerting to note that despite the rise in gig worker collectivisation in the country, none of the platforms studied expressed a willingness to recognise a collective body of workers,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/flipkart-treats-gig-workers-best-among-platform-cos/articleshow/88577375.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

Hotels have been directed to operate with 50% occupancy. The court also made it clear that celebrities visiting Puducherry should not take part in any New Year celebration in public places, as it would attract crowds. Counsel for Puducherry government submitted that the administration had already taken measures to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour during the New Year celebrations.The interim directions were issued in response to a petition by G A Jagannathan, a former panchayat president of Karikalampakkam village panchayat, seeking a direction to the Puducherry government to restrict all New Year celebrations. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/court-allows-ny-revelries-in-pondy-restricts-liquor-sale/articleshow/88577381.cms||---

A fortnight ago, the civic body began a door-to-door survey and collected data from 10 lakh households of the total 17 lakh households that fall under their limits. The 3,621 domestic breeding checkers (DBC workers) and the urban health nurses have been pressed into this survey mainly to improve the city’s vaccination numbers as they fear an increase in the spread of Omicron cases. From 129 new cases on December 19, the city recorded 294 cases on December 29. This has made the civic body intensify its efforts on containment and vaccination. Corporation staff found that nearly six lakh people have missed their second dose out of fear as they got a mild fever after taking the first dose. “This was observed only in the slum localities,” Gagandeep Singh Bedi, city corporation commissioner said. All workers have been given details of vaccinated people and the list of house addresses. They will inspect the houses. There are a total of 17 lakh households under the Greater Chennai Corporation. “There are two reasons for this survey. We are aware that there are 55.3 lakh people in the city above the age of 18 years. But how many of them have been vaccinated needs to be surveyed and recorded. The data on the COwin portals and other government portals will always have outsiders and include people from other cities who are non-residents in Chennai. This kind of targeted survey will only help us identify the city’s actual vaccinated population. Since we hold a mega vaccination camp every weekend, the data is also helpful as we motivate those who haven't taken even a single dose to get vaccinated,” said Dr M Jagadeesan, city health officer. As of December 27, the city’s 50 lakh people have been vaccinated with at least one dose of the vaccine. About 37.75 lakh have been administered the second dose. The civic body officials want to improve their second dose coverage and achieve 100% first dose coverage. The city has about 3,621 workers to check on vector control activities and the city has been divided into 2,080 sectors to be studied and disinfected. “They anyway have to go to households every day to check for breeding of mosquito larvae. Additionally, we have given them lists of households and divided streets among them. They will also ask for symptomatic people to isolate and identify them early,” said a senior corporation official. This data will also throw light on better policies in case of rising covid cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/1-6l-in-city-yet-to-take-even-1-dose/articleshow/88577385.cms||Omjasvin M D

---||Chennai||Concern as sewage water drains into Ambattur lake in Chennai||CHENNAI: The quantity of pollutants draining into the Ambattur lake has increased phenomenally over the last one year. Residents blame civic authorities for failing to set up underground sewage network in several localities. This has led to draining of all domestic waste into the sprawling lake, they allege. President of Tamil Nadu Progressive Consumer Centre, T Sadagopan, said there are hundreds of encroachments surrounding the lake, between Ambattur and Tirumullaivoyal. "No one knows how these houses came up along the lake boundary." Sathish, a resident of Tirumullaivoyal, said sewage is being let out into the lake because there is no underground sewage system in Moondru Nagar, Periyar Nagar, Anna Nagar, Sathya Nagar and Ganapathy Nagar. Recently, the Avadi municipality had constructed storm water drains in Sivasakthi Nagar, Annai Anjugam Nagar and Gangai Amman Nagar. But this drain carries only sewage from residential areas. "The purpose for which the drain was built has been lost," he said. Residents of housing board complex in Ayappakkam are no exceptions either. The complex had a sewage treatment plant, but became defunct some time ago. As a result, sewage from residential apartments is being let into the Ambattur lake. The Avadi Corporation commissioner R Saraswathi chose not to respond to queries from TOI. Last year, a case had been filed in the southern bench of the National Green Tribunal, which had directed authorities to take action to stop flow of pollutants into the lake. But nothing was done in this regard, residents said. When it rains, the excess water from Ambattur lake drains into the Korattur lake. Quite often during monsoon, the overflowing Ambattur lake transfers sewage from the area into the Korattur lake, one resident said. Naturalists are concerned that the sewage entering the lake contaminates the groundwater table, as there is a proposal to declare both Ambattur and Korattur lakes as ecologically-sensitive wetlands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/concern-as-sewage-water-drains-into-ambattur-lake/articleshow/88577392.cms||P Oppili
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: No more extension charges for new Tangedco meters||Chennai: Apartment owners and industrialists across Tamil Nadu can heave a sigh of relief as Tangedco has barred all field officers from collecting extension costs. Every time a consumer applies for a new electricity connection, Tangedco collects a certain amount for extension of electric lines and installation of new infrastructure. For instance, an apartment in Chennai, which is located a hundred metres away from an existing power line, paid .90,000 as extension cost for a new three-phase connection. Collection of extension charges is against the Tamil Nadu Electricity Distribution Code. In 2009, the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) directed Tangedco to not only stop this violation but also refund the money collected from consumers. Despite repeated directions from the commission, Tangedco continued to collect extension charges. Some of the aggrieved consumers approached TNERC seeking assistance. On such occasions, the commission penalised Tangedco up to a maximum of 1 lakh. K Kathirmathiyon, a consumer rights' activist, had petitioned TNERC stating that Tangedco did not mind paying hefty fine and then collected crores every year under this head. “It seems to be their strategy,” he said. Tangedco argued that its infrastructure expenses had risen and they were left with no other option but to collect extension charges for new service connection requests. Kathirmathiyon said that only to meet such increased expenses, Tangedco started collecting development charges from all the consumers (invariable of whether extension works are done or not) and more recently in 2019 it increased these charges by 400%. Therefore, there is no need to collect extension charges illegally, he said. The Commission, which took suo motu cognizance of his petition, seconded his claims and on Tuesday (December 28) ordered Tangedco to take corrective action to avoid consumers knocking on their doors for relief. Based on this, Tangedco has now sent a circular to all district-level authorities to stop collection of extension charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-more-extension-charges-for-new-tangedco-meters/articleshow/88577393.cms||Ram Sundaram

When his attention was drawn towards seizure of over 200 crore cash from a businessman in Uttar Pradesh, Owaisi said Modi should answer as to how so much of cash was found despite the demonetisation of bigger notes in 2016. The AIMIM chief demanded the government come clean on who the money belonged to.  “Modi should tell how a businessman’s house in UP gets cash worth 180 crore despite demonetisation. Demonetisation was a failure as only poor people and small scale industries suffered the most and the rich still had huge cash,” he said. On BJP’s Andhra Pradesh state president Somu Veerraju announcing that the saffron party would give liquor at 70 if voted to power, Owaisi said the BJP has no morals and will go to any extent to grab power. “Another BJP leader in Kerala had earlier said that beef would be given if voted to power. Why don’t the BJP leaders say they would give milk and nutrition to children. Why is BJP in so much love with liquor,” he asked. Asked about Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s comments on Malegaon blast, Owaisi lashed out at the BJP government for not filing an appeal in Malegaon, Hyderabad and Samjhauta blast cases. “Muslim youth jailed on their alleged involvement in blasts are being acquitted after seven to eight years. There is no accountability. A new law should be brought to punish all such officers who book false cases or implicate the innocent. By the time youth were released from jail, their parents had died in many cases. Then they go and cry on their parents’ graves. The miscarriage of justice has occurred with Muslims, Dalits and Adivasis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pm-should-accept-demon-was-a-total-failure-owaisi/articleshow/88577395.cms||Roushan Ali

The facility, which is expected to come up at a special food processing zone near Gajwel, will come up at an investment of Rs 500 crore and is expected to create around 500 direct jobs. To be set up by one of Amul’s largest cooperatives – the Sabarkantha District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Ltd, more popularly known as Sabar Dairy, the facility will see the investment being poured in phases – 300 crore in the first phase and 200 crore in the second. The first phase will see the facility will have a capacity to process 5 lakh litres of milk per day, which will be expandable to 10 lakh litres per day later. The proposed plant will not just package fresh milk but also process value-added milk products like curd, buttermilk, lassi, yogurt, paneer and sweets, among others. Pointing out that this would be Amul’s first owned facility in south India, GCMMF general manager-marketing Manorajan Pani told TOI that it would take about a couple of years for the facility to be ready for operations starting with a 5 lakh litres per day capacity. He said plans were afoot to come up with a bakery division at the proposed facility in the second phase where products such as breads, biscuits, traditional sweets and baked snacks would be manufactured. The proposed Amul facility is also expected to provide a boost to Telangana’s local dairy industry as well as ancillary industries as Amul will procure the required milk and other raw materials from farmers as well as the various cooperatives and FPOs operating in the state. Sabar Dairy managing director Babubhai M Patel said Amul decided to set up their plant in Telangana after seeing the state’s industry-friendly policies and vibrant investment ecosystem. “We will soon deliver ‘Made in Telangana’ milk products,” he said while signing an MoU with the Telangana government in the presence of Telangana industries minister KT Rama Rao on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amul-to-set-foot-in-t-with-500-crore-unit-in-gajwel/articleshow/88577399.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

He wondered why BJP state president Bandi Sanjay and Telangana in-charge Tarun Chugh sat on deeksha in BJP office to protest unemployment when their government at Centre failed to live up to its promise of giving two crore jobs to youth every year. Bandi should explain what happened to BJP’s promise of depositing 15 lakh each into the bank accounts of poor after bringing black money stashed in foreign banks.

The camps will focus on screening for hypertension, diabetes and oral cancer in those above 30. For other age groups, there will be screening for vision issues, tuberculosis for those with symptoms, etc. District administrations and health officials have also been told to organise vaccination camps at the sites if needed. “This initiative will help us understand the burden of some diseases while patients will get treatment without delay,” said a health official. “Non communicable diseases are one of the leading causes of death in India and they are minimally addressed throughout the country, especially in rural areas. These multi-pronged approaches through screening camps... will help with follow-up as well as decrease the burden,” Anirban Dalui, public health expert attached with Swasthya Bhawan, said. While experts called this a welcome initiative, they said mobilising manpower could be a huge task. District health officials have been told to engage Asha workers in addition to medical officers. “Ultimate diagnosis and provision of regular medicines and operative procedures are to be done at local health facilities. But this will enable us to detect the submerged portion of the iceberg,” said public health expert Asis Manna, MSVP at ID & BG Hospital Beliaghata. District officials have also been told to submit a weekly report on the Duare health camps. A format has been shared with details like number of camps held, head count, ailments detected, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-to-launch-duare-sarkar-health-camps-next-month/articleshow/88577401.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Four of the five new Omicron patients had no recent foreign travel history, pointing to a possible transmission of the new variant in the community. Doctors feared this could be the reason behind the sharp surge in Covid cases in Kolkata and rest of Bengal in the past 24 hours. The transmissibility of Omicron is five times more than that of the Delta strain. Kolkata on Wednesday recorded 540 new Covid cases, up from 382 on Tuesday and the highest in 202 days. The last time Kolkata had recorded these many Covid cases was on June 9. The state on Wednesday sent 225 more Covid-positive samples for genome sequencing while 700 more samples will be sent on Thursday. “We received the genome sequencing reports for 107 samples last night. Of these, five are Omicron-positive. One of them has travelled internationally, the others — two from Kolkata and one each from Dum Dum and Howrah — have no recent travel history. The contact-tracing cell is collecting information for containment measures as per protocol,” said state director of health services Ajay Chakraborty. The five new patients have either mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. Apart from the 10 Omicron cases detected in the state, there were two other patients who tested positive for the new variant in other states following their arrival from abroad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/5-more-o-cases-city-covid-count-surges/articleshow/88577402.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Around 22% of students are dropouts in class 10 in the state. There are over 48 lakh teenagers in the age group of 15-18 across Madhya Pradesh. In Bhopal alone, around 1.13 lakh students will have to be vaccinated. DEO Bhopal, Nitin Saxena said that there are around 700 schools in Bhopal wherein 1 lakh eligible students will have to be vaccinated. “We have launched the preparations in association with the health department for the vaccination of students. In Bhopal district, there are 40,297 students in the 15 years age group which is the highest number of students to be vaccinated in the 15-18 years age group,” said Saxena. Asked about the drop-out students, Saxena said, “We have asked the officials to take help from NGOs and other private organisations and civil societies to track the students who have left after class 10. Either they will be brought to the schools where vaccination is to be done, or they will be vaccinated at the nearby centres,” said Saxena. The school education department has appointed cluster school principals as the nodal officers for the smooth conduct of the vaccination programme. “These principals will have the responsibility to ensure that all children get the vaccination properly. They will have also ensured that the students’ attendance during vaccination dates will be 100%,” said Saxena. All schools will remain open from 8 am to 5 pm on the day of the vaccination programme. “All schools have been directed that they will conduct a meeting with parents-teachers association to inform them about the vaccination programme which is to be done for the students. Vaccination programme details will have to be uploaded on the official portal on the daily basis by the concerned officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/teens-to-get-vaxxed-in-schools-but-tracking-dropouts-an-uphill-task/articleshow/88577408.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Bhopal||In pandemic yr, MP earned 12,400cr in taxes on fuel||BHOPAL: The year 2021, marked with lockdown induced by a deadly second wave of Covid-19 infections, Madhya Pradesh earned more than Rs 12,400 crore through tax on petrol and diesel. This tax collection was about 17% higher than the year 2020. If earnings till October 2021 are compared with the same period it has increased by 30% compared to previous year. The earnings on petroleum products have been increasing year on year. And despite the toll on health due to Covid deaths and infections and lockdown when people were losing jobs and facing severe financial constraints, the state government looked the other way and did not reduce taxes on fuel. To make it simpler the taxes of fuel are so high in the state that if they are removed, petrol will cost a consumer about Rs 70 per litre. This information was known in a reply to a query under right to information Act by Neemuch-based RTI activist, Chandra Shekhar Gaur. Replying to queries by Gaur, office of commercial tax commissioner, Madhya Pradesh has informed that ‘a tax of 29% on petrol, then additional tax of Rs 2.50 per litre and a cess of 1% is levied on petrol and on diesel it is 19%, additional tax of Rs 1.50 and cess of 1%.” In the same reply the government informed that in year 2017-18 government earned Rs 9,317.83 crore, in 2018-19, Rs 9,581.23 crore and in 2019-20 government earned Rs 10,608.28 crore and in year 2020-21 government earned Rs 12,415.03 crore as taxes on fuel. Between April to October 2020-21 government had earned Rs 5,472.81 crore and between April to October in year 2021-22 government has so far earned Rs 7,393.74 crore which is 35% more than what it earned in the corresponding period the previous year. “In the current scenario tax payers are burdened with tax on tax, i.e. the taxes levied by state governments is levied on the price which also includes the tax charged by Union government. Imposing tax on tax does not sound just. GST was brought in to rectify these disparities and it is high time that petroleum products should also be brought under GST. Government should take initiatives on this issue on an urgent basis, because inflation on petro products has a cascading effect in overall economy”, Chandra Shekhar Gaur, who filed the query told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/in-pandemic-yr-mp-earned-12400cr-in-taxes-on-fuel/articleshow/88577410.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Bhopal||75 active cases in Bhopal, 40% are hospitalised||Bhopal: In almost a month, Hamidia hospital had about a couple of Covid-19 patients on Wednesday. Overall, the state capital has about 75 active cases and about 40% are hospitalized. Less than a dozen patients are considered to be in ‘critical condition’. Most people who are suffering from upper respiratory syndrome — common cold — are testing ‘negative’ for Covid-19 but are being treated with protocol similar to Covid patients at Hamidia hospital. Three such patients have died in the last few days at the hospital, according a senior consultant. They were negative for Covid-19, he said.The situation seems to be under control in the state capital. For the most part, it has to do with testing for Covid-19. Around 93% of all Covid-19 tests in the past two weeks in Bhopal are on higher efficacy RT-PCR. It also means that some escape of infection being not diagnosed is being minimized. Efficacy of rapid antigen test is lower to RT-PCR.Bhopal has also reported 30 infection cases deemed as ‘breakthrough cases’ in the past two weeks. On Tuesday, one person who returned from Dubai to Bhopal, was sampled for genome sequencing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/75-active-cases-in-bhopal-40-are-hospitalised/articleshow/88577409.cms||---

They are enthusiastic on the prospect of getting their teenaged children vaccinated and expect that the vaccination of smaller children would also be undertaken at the earliest. Pankaj Sharma, who has his daughter Shreya in school, said that the government should do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic. “Vaccinate children, give the booster dose to elderly, anything required to tide over the pandemic should be done. I am sure, everything has been taken care of in the right earnest and I am waiting for the date when the registration for vaccination begins.” Shantanu Sharma, who has a teenaged son Aniruddha, said that it is a welcome step and once the children are vaccinated, parents would feel reassured of their safety from the deadly virus. Shantanu, who is also director of a school, said that parents of students in his school are also excited over the prospect of getting their children vaccinated. “In fact, we are receiving calls from parents as to when smaller children would be vaccinated because they are more concerned about their protection. The fear among parents which is stopping them from sending their children to school would also be mitigated", he said. Sharma further said as far as his information goes, children will be vaccinated in schools and it would only be the right thing to do rather than asking parents to come with children to vaccination centres.” Dhanraj Ahirwar, whose son is in class 10th, said, “Me, wife and my daughter are already vaccinated. My son is the only one left unvaccinated. Once vaccination for children in the age group of 15 to 18 years begins, I would also get him vaccinated without delay.” President of MP Parents’ Association, Kamal Vishwakarma, said decision of the government to vaccinate children in the age group of 15 to 18 years is commendable but parents have small queries on how registration for vaccination would be carried out, whether vaccination would take place at schools or vaccination centres, whether there will be two jabs of vaccines or one and administration should issue guidelines on the issue soon. He further said that the parents’ association would demand that all children of up to 12 years of age be vaccinated for Covid at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/parents-wait-eagerly-for-vax-drive-for-teens-to-begin/articleshow/88577411.cms||---

Just two days earlier, a tigress was killed in Dindori, apparently after someone poisoned its kill, a bison. This is one of the highest annual tiger death tolls in MP in decades.The tiger carcass was found in Chhindwara’ s Sahanwadi forest area, which is in Kanha National Park. Officials are waiting for the autopsy report to ascertain the cause of death.Chhindwara is a region where tigers have often been killed by locals for black magic, in the hope it will ‘raining currency’. This tiger carcass, however, had all its body parts intact.Last week, the government had informed the assembly that 85 tigers, including 32 cubs, have died in the past four years in MP. In November, the high court issued notices to the state and central governments and NTCA, seeking an explanation for the death of 36 tigers (till then) in the first 10 months of the year.Since then, the toll has risen to 44, including some that wore radio collars. One of them was tigress T30, who was shifted from Bandhavgarh to Sanjay National Park. Its poachers are yet to be arrested.On July 6, three poachers were arrested while trying to sell a tiger hide and claws for Rs 10 lakh. The same month, a farmer was arrested with a tiger hide. More poachers were arrested in August for killing a tiger near Satpura tiger reserve.MP had won the ‘Tiger State’ crown in the 2018 census for being home to 526 big cats, two more than Karnataka. MP had lost this tag to Karnataka in 2010, primarily due to poaching in Panna Tiger Reserve.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/tiger-found-dead-in-kanha-2021-mp-toll-44/articleshow/88577423.cms||P Naveen

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Prabha Varma’s kritis to be part of Carnatic concert||Thiruvananthapuram: Kritis written by poet Prabha Varma will be featured in a Carnatic music concert at Vyloppilly Samskrithi Bhavan on December 30. It will be performed by K R Shyama who has also composed the `Kritis`.Vylopilly Samskrithi Bhavan is hosting the Carnatic music concert as part of efforts of a group of classical music lovers to regain the glory of Carnatic music.R Ramachandran Nair was the last Malayalam poet to write Carnatic music ‘kritis’ under the pen name Thulaseevanam. Writing and composing ‘kritis’ for Carnatic Music, often considered an arduous task, requires a combination of excellent vocabulary, musical awareness and classical music listening skills.In Carnatic music, the ‘kriti’ is arranged in tune with the melody. All the Carnatic musical kritis so far have been composed with requests to the deities, their praises and synonyms for the deities. Prabha Varma’s works are distinguished by beautiful imagery and symbolism. Prabha Varma adopts a different approach when writing ‘kritis’ in the tradition of Swathi Thirunal, Irayimman Thampi, Thulaseevanam and many other writers.Carnatic music concerts should always have a variety of melodies and rhythms. Even the rhythms themselves have to be prepared at different speeds to make the concerts extremely heart-warming. Carnatic music must blend melody and musicality. All these qualities are plentiful in Prabha Varma’s works and they are full of literary beauty, according to the organisers.Prabha Varma’s ‘kriti’, such as “Neelabha Prabha nee... neerazhiyil veenayo.... nin neelimayal kadalalaneelichaayo” shows that his Carnatic hymns are rich in poetic beauty. The work on Hanuman, which begins with “Pavanam Paripavanam” in the Nattakurinji Raga, is arranged in a ‘Misra chapa’ rhythm.

Aneesh George, son of George and Dolly of TC 93/2226 at Pettah is the deceased. The police have recorded the arrest of his friend’s father, Lalan, 51, on charges of murder. The arrest was recorded at Pettah police station. The alleged crime took place at Lalan’s residence, CRA 508, Chayakudi Lane near Pettah. Lalan, a father of two girls aged 16 and 14, found Aneesh in the girls’ bedroom on the first floor of the house during the early hours of the day and attacked him using a kitchen knife, inflicting fatal injuries. According to the police, the incidents related to the case happened sometime between 3.30 am and 4.30 am. The police received a phone call from Lalan’s wife informing them about the attack and requesting assistance to take the injured to the hospital. A team of police immediately reached the residence and took him to the hospital. But, he succumbed to his injuries while on the way. The doctors pronounced him dead on arrival. ‘’When the police reached the crime scene Lalan was not there as he had set out to the police station to turn himself in immediately after stabbing the youth,” Pettah station house officer inspector Riyas Raja said. He initially told the police that he attacked the youth thinking that he was a burglar. However, the police have not bought this statement entirely. He said that the police are probing into the aspects of how Aneesh got into the residence. He is assumed to have set out on foot from his residence, which is located hardly a kilometer away from Lalan’s residence around 3.30 am. His parents were unaware of his absence until the police informed them about his fate. An inquest done on the body of the deceased revealed two stab injuries, one on the chest and the other on the back. Meanwhile, sources in the police said that Aneesh and Lalan’s elder daughter were very close to each other. Lalan knew about it and had even warned Aneesh to stay away from her. However, more verification is needed in this regard. The statements of Lalan’s wife and daughters needed to be recorded to confirm this, sources said. Aneesh was a second year BCom student of Bethany College, Nalanchira. Besides parents, he is survived by a brother Anoop. His post mortem examination was conducted on Wednesday and the body was later released to the relatives for funeral. Lalan was an NRI working in a Gulf country. He had returned home around 18 months ago following the advent of Covid 19 pandemic. He never returned to the Gulf after that. He is likely to be produced before the court on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/19-yr-old-intruder-stabbed-to-death-by-neighbour-in-city/articleshow/88577439.cms||---

They have also arrested a man in connection with the case. The police identified the accused as Mohanan, 55, of Bhajanamadam near Kadakkavoor. Jessi, 54, an insurance agent residing at Vakkom under Kadakkavoor police station limits, is the deceased. She was found dead on the railway track near Ayanthi bridge near Varkala. The police had initially under the assumption that it could be a case of suicide as the spot where the body was found was a secluded area where many suicides by jumping in front of moving trains were reported in the past. However, the police launched a detailed investigation after Jessi’s family pointed out that the gold ornaments she was wearing were missing from the body. The police soon launched a detailed investigation using scientific methods and zeroed in on Mohanan, with whom Jessi maintained a close relationship. The police said that Jessi, a widow with two daughters, maintained a close relationship with Mohanan. They even had some financial dealings between them. ‘’Mohanan had asked for financial assistance from her to go abroad for a job, which she could not give. On the day of the crime, Mohanan took her to the crime scene in an auto rickshaw pretending to introduce her to a new potential client for an insurance policy. He then strangled her using her saree and dumped the body on the railway track and left. The investigation was led by Kadakkavoor station house officer inspector V Ajesh under the supervision of Varkala DSP Niyas. The police also recovered one of the ornaments from Mohanan’s residence. He told the police that he had sold another ornament at a jewellery. He even secured a visa to a Gulf country using that money and was planning to escape soon when the police arrested him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/man-arrested-for-murdering-woman/articleshow/88577442.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Lok Rakshak Recruitment Board shrunk their height in 2 years!||AHMEDABAD: As many as 10 persons have moved the Gujarat HC with the grievance that the Lok Rakshak Recruitment Board measured their height in 2019 and found that they met minimum requirements, but in 2021 their height was found to be less than what was measured two years ago. Candidates for Lok Rakshak Dal and police sub-inspector (PSI) posts moved the HC challenging the Board’s decision to disqualify them on physical criteria during the recruitment process. According to case details, the petitioners are from Bhavnagar district. They participated in LRD recruitment process in 2019 and their height met the minimum criteria – 165cm for males and 155cm for females. They did not succeed in other exams, and participated again in recruitment in October 2021. This time, the board found the height of nine male candidates to be less than 165cm and of one female candidate to be less than 155cm. They raised a question about measurement by the board, and demanded re-measurement. They submitted that from results of the two measurements, board’s decision to reject their candidature and recent measurement clearly appeared to be erroneous. After a preliminary hearing, Justice Nikhil Kariel on Wednesday directed the board and state government to have the height of all 10 candidates re-measured at Sola Civil Hospital. The HC ordered the government to place the result of re-measurement of height before it ahead of the next hearing, posted for January 19. The court made it clear that in case, if their height was found to be 165/155 cm or above minimum criterion, the board would permit them to take written exams by cancelling their rejection. It also said that its interim order to have their heights re-measured and permission to appear in written exams would be subject to the final outcome of this litigation. Meanwhile, one petitioner in this litigation, Manish Nandaniya, also challenged rejection of his candidature after the board measured his height as below 165cm. He cited a certificate from a hospital declaring him to have a height of 165cm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/board-shrunk-their-height-in-2-years/articleshow/88577444.cms||---

According to the executive summary of its detailed project report (DPR), the project is estimated to cost Rs 63,940.67 crore, of which Rs 33,626.97 crore is expenditure excluding land cost. It says the maintenance cost will go up to Rs 694 crore/year after 10 years while salaries and benefits to employees are estimated at Rs 271 crore/year. However, the summary estimates an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 24.04% on the basis of benefits accruing to the society — savings in travel time, vehicle operation cost, accident cost and road stress. It says the project is economically viable as it is self-sustainable as seen from the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and has an EIRR above the mandated levels. The project has led to a major showdown between the government and opposition, with both sides sticking to their stands and deciding to directly present their arguments to people. There were reports of opposition to the project even within the LDF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/maintenance-alone-to-cost-5420-crore-for-first-10-years/articleshow/88577445.cms||---

A TOI team visited the Usmanpura Riverfront Park, Flower Garden and Law Garden on Wednesday, and found that certificates were not asked for even at access-controlled public places. No certificates were sought for use of the BRTS or AMTS as well. Ironically, at a mall in Vastrapur a long queue was seen at the entrance and security guards were seen diligently checking certificates.In September, the AMC had announced that only those who had at least one vaccine dose would be able to avail of various municipal services. The civic body said it would deny entry at AMC facilities such as public gardens, swimming pools, civc centres and also at the AMTS and BRTS, to those who cannot furnish vaccine certificates. From November 12, the civic body made the rule stricter, making both doses mandatory for access.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amcs-no-vax-no-entry-rule-remains-on-paper/articleshow/88577448.cms||---

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh achieves 100% first dose Covid vaccine coverage||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh achieved 100% first dose Covid-19 vaccine coverage on Wednesday. The state has inoculated all the 3.952 crore eligible beneficiaries with at least one dose. Telangana is the only major state to have attained this feat before Andhra Pradesh. Nellore was the first district in the state to cross the 100% first dose mark about two weeks ago. AP has so far administered 6.88 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses, including the 2.93 crore second dose recipients. The second dose coverage stands at 74%. It is not an ordinary accomplishment for a state like Andhra Pradesh with its varied geographical conditions, thickly forested areas, and urban-rural divide in terms of awareness and literacy rates. The health workers had to reach many tribal pockets and villages on foot, passing rivulets and forest areas, which would otherwise have very low vaccination rates. There were even instances of the farmers or the labourers getting inoculated in the agricultural fields itself. In a renewed push during the second half of the year, the door-to-door drives touched all the unvaccinated individuals by offering the jabs at their doorstep. Even though Andhra Pradesh already had an optimal cold chain capacity for its regular immunisation programmes, the state further scaled it up for the Covid-19 vaccine storage and distribution. The state rolled out the mass inoculation drive against the novel coronavirus disease, starting with healthcare workers and frontline respondents on January 16. The state could administer about 2 lakh doses in January. The drive was subsequently extended to people aged 60 and above, and those within the age bracket of 45 to 59 years with co-morbidities. Even before the 18-45 age group was included in the priority groups, the state jabbed the young mother having children less than five years of age and the pregnant women. This was done at the recommendation of an expert committee that the third wave may disproportionately affect the young kids.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/state-achieves-100-first-dose-covid-vaccine-coverage/articleshow/88577461.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

With technology becoming the silver lining during the Covid-19 pandemic as personal interactions and businesses moved online, cyber crooks stole over 9.24 crore from Vizagites by duping them using various methods this year. Though the cybercrime cases slightly decreased by over 13 per cent in Vizag city in 2021 compared to 2020, the property loss is more than 50 per cent this year compared to last year. A total of 307 cybercrimes were registered in Vizag city in 2021 while it was 354 in 2020. Cyber fraudsters looted 6.13 crore in 2020.  Of the total 307 cybercrimes, 104 cases relate to part time job, OLX and loan frauds. Inspector of cybercrimes police station, Vizag, RVRK Choudhary, said taking advantage of the pandemic situation, cybercrooks came up with innovative ideas to dupe the people through part-time job offers, ‘earn more money from home’ and a few other false promises.  Property lost in offline offences have come down in Vizag city. But cases of property loss in online frauds have been increasing. “The whopping amount that was siphoned off by online crooks indicates that that police will have to deal with different types of crimes in the coming days,” the police added.  Police said apart from job and loan frauds, 45 cases relating to One-Time-Password (OTP), 30 cases relating to Nigerian frauds (lottery and matrimonial frauds) and 32 cases of social media abuse were reported in Vizag city in 2021. Due to the Covid-19 situation, the police couldn’t visit other states as part of investigations into cybercrimes. Police managed to arrest only 21 accused in 18 cases in 2021.  Underscoring that awareness is the only tool to escape cyber fraud, RVRK Choudhary advised that no matter whoever calls you, never disclose your confidential information and don’t make insecure transfer of money online. He said scammers also use fake apps to steal money from people. Sometimes, crooks ask smartphone users to download an application that gives them remote access to their mobile phone and steal money. So, people shouldn’t download any mirror apps,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/cyber-crooks-stole-9-cr-from-vizagites-this-year/articleshow/88577464.cms||Nalla.Babu

The vaccination drive was launched in the state on January 16, along with the entire country at close to 50 session sites — two each in every district with the facility to inoculate 100 people in each of these sites. Around 1,700 people took their jabs on the first day after health officials carried out massive drives to hammer out hesitancy and apprehensions.Once the drive started, various issues cropped up with time — exchange of barbs between the Centre and state being one of the most important issues. While the state blamed the Centre for erratic and irregular supply of vaccine consignments, the Centre blamed the state for passing the buck of inefficiency. In the initial months, when vaccines were available to frontline and health care workers — the consignments received from the Centre were sufficient. Soon after senior citizens and those with co-morbidities above the age of 45 were also included, putting pressure on the system for mobilising more vaccine stocks. Convincing people for vaccines — both in frontline and health workers category and commoners, was a big challenge for the health department. National Health Mission, Integrated disease survillence programme (IDSP) and state health department had to push its machinery at the panchayat level to address concerns of common people and fight rumours spread on social media.By the time vaccinations were open for 18-plus population, health department had to fight on two fronts —countering vaccine hesitation and managing vaccine supply. Health teams were assaulted in various parts of the state, when they went for registration of beneficiaries. Assistant nurse and midwives (ANM) and health workers were held captive, assaulted and even threatened.The first reports of vaccine shortage started emerging by April when awareness levels were increasing and the supplies from Centre were not regular. By July 2021— five months since the launch of the drive, there were as many as eight occasions when the vaccine stocks exhausted putting brakes on the speed of vaccination drive.The state created a record of sorts by inoculating highest 1.72 lakh people in one day on July 16 at 1,566 session sites across the state. As many as 67,36,731 people took their first jabs on this day. A couple of months prior to this escalated drive, the Centre had accused Jharkhand of wasting vaccine doses at a rate far and above other states. Central officials pegged this wastage at 37.3% of the total consignment sent to the state. None other than chief minister Hemant Soren came out with a rebuttal claiming that the wastage was as low as 4.65%.As of date, 1,83,84,480 people have taken their first dose and 1,10,08,958 people had taken their second dose taking the total vaccine figure to 2,93,93,438 doses. On Wednesday alone, as many as 1,35,173 doses were administered across 2,276 session sites comprising 23 private sites. East Singhbhum with 90% coverage of first dose and 64% coverage of second dose is the best performer while Pakur and Sahebganj with 38% coverage and Chatra and Latehar with 39% coverage of second dose are at the bottom.Additional chief secretary health Arun Kumar Singh admitted that the excitement and awareness among people for the vaccines seem to have lost steam with time. “We are doing our best to improve the coverage. Addressing hesitancy by spreading awareness and arranging vaccine stocks in case of shortage is possible but when people become careless and casual, its difficult to convince them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/yr-of-vax-from-hesitancy-to-complacency/articleshow/88577465.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

---||India||SC’s ‘triple test’ criteria may identify new set of OBCs for political quotas||NEW DELHI: The outcome of the impasse over OBC reservation in local bodies may cut very deep, to the extent that the ‘triple test’ criteria laid down by the Supreme Court to decide backward quota in politics may result in the identification of a new set of backward communities eligible for political quotas, different from those availing the Mandal quotas for education and employment. It is because of this reason that many experts believe that the Centre‘s decision to seek a review of the SC judgement may not yield much, with many pitching in that only a Constitutional amendment can retrieve the situation. However, Even that may not be a sureshot solution given that the SC has explained in detail its rationale for “triple test” for political quotas. The judicial red flag to the OBC quota in local bodies elections, first raised in Maharashtra and then extended to Madhya Pradesh and Odisha, lays down that states have to set up a commission to collect “contemporaneous data” on the nature and patterns of backwardness, among other things. The SC’s orders are based on the Krishna Murthy judgment delivered in 2010 by a five-judge Constitution bench, which dwelt on the issue of quotas in local bodies. At the heart of its prescription of “contemporaneous data” was its conclusion that “barriers to political participation are not of the same character as barriers that limit access to education and employment”. It stressed, “Social and economic backwardness does not necessarily coincide with political backwardness. In this respect, the state governments are well advised to reconfigure their reservation policies, wherein the beneficiaries under Articles 243-(D6) and 243-T(6) (dealing with OBC quotas) need not necessarily be co-terminus with the SEBCs for Articles 15(4) and 16(4).” It added, “…not all of the groups which have been given reservation benefits in the domain of education and employment need reservations in the sphere of local self government.” The apparent implication of the judgment is that backward communities in local bodies can be different from the “state lists” of OBCs used for jobs and education quotas. As Shashank Ratnoo, an advocate specialising on OBC issues, says, “The repeated Supreme Court judgements imply that communities that are educationally and socially backward may be politically empowered. The contemporaneous data can lead to a separate list of OBCs for political quotas, with possible weeding out of the existing state lists.” The possibility of some OBC communities not being eligible for political quotas in future can be a sensitive issue for the political class, given the numerical clout and the aspirations of the stronger Mandal groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/scs-triple-test-criteria-may-identify-new-set-of-obcs-for-political-quotas/articleshow/88577454.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

He said the Rs 25 reduction on petrol price would be limited to 10 litres or Rs 250 per month per beneficiary. It will be implemented from January 26. The CM also said his government is preparing a development road map for the next 20 years and tore into the BJP-led opposition which had termed his ruling dispensation as “anti-women”.“My opposition colleagues claimed that I was against women empowerment after our government closed the registry scheme (where women could register properties up to Rs 50 lakh for Re 1). How many poor, Adivasi women can buy a flat so expensive? The scheme was for the rich. So, we closed it and used the money to provide old-age pension, dhoti, saree and lungi to the poor,” he said.Soren, however, did not distribute any job letters on the occasion even though his government had termed 2021 as the year of recruitments. A handbook released for the government’s second anniversy said over 4,881 job letters were distributed to beneficiaries during the 45-day-long ‘Apke Adhikar- Apki Sarkar Apke Dwar’ programme which concluded on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/from-jan-26-petrol-to-cost-25/l-less-for-2-wheeler-owners-in-state/articleshow/88577467.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||BJP takes to social media to ‘expose failures’ of state govt||Ranchi: Members of opposition BJP, including MPs and MLAs, conducted live sessions on Facebook on Wednesday to “expose the failures” of the Hemant Soren-led coalition government, which is celebrating its second anniversary.While the JMM-Congress-RJD government held a function at the Morhabadi ground here, the BJP MPs and MLAs skip it to hold lives sessions on the social media platform from 11 am.State party president Deepak Prakash, in his 10-minute live session, dubbed the two years of the government as a total failure and questioned the hosting of such a grand ceremony by spending crores of rupees at a time when the Covid-19 cases are on the rise in the state again. He said, “The Soren government must be given credit for the growing lawlessness, atrocities on the poor and the Dalits, rising unemployment, corruption across all departments and the loot of natural resources. This government promised to give five lakh jobs per year but failed. This government has also failed to bring any investment to the state. While it claims to be working for farmers, the government continues to rob them of their dues by not paying their pending money for the paddy procured last year. The list is endless.”In his live session on his official page, Ranchi MLA C P Singh said the biggest credit the government must be given is for constantly working to appease a particular community. “We have seen how special arrangements were made for a particular community to offer prayers (namaz room). Similarly, for availing welfare measures, students of the particular community are permitted to provide self-attested caste certificates,” he alleged, claiming that the youths who voted the government to power are today left in the lurch as they are denied employment and equal opportunities. The recently held JPSC exams where several undeserving first got qualified and were later disqualified is a burning example of the kind of corruption under this current government,” he claimed.In a separate statement, BJP’s ally, Ajsu-P, too, attacked the government over its failure to provide employment and other promises made to the people before the assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-takes-to-social-media-to-expose-failures-of-state-govt/articleshow/88577468.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren limits petrol waiver at 10 litres/month per beneficiary||RANCHI: Chief minister Hemant Soren announced a waiver of Rs 25 per litre on petrol for ration card holders who have two-wheelers from January 26, 2022. He said the reduction on petrol price would be limited to 10 litres or Rs 250 per month per beneficiary. "While the rich do not seem to be affected by the skyrocketing prices of petrol and diesel, the poor and labour class are suffering. Hence, it is being announced that the price of petrol is being reduced by Rs 25 a litre," Soren said. "This announcement was made within a very short span of time and its modalities need to be worked out," Soren added. While he did not elaborate, Soren's Twitter handle later declared that the new arrangement will be extended to only two-wheelers (motorcycles and scooters). "As per the initial plan, those with ration cards will only be eligible for the benefit and the subsidy amount will be transferred directly to their bank accounts," a source in the CMO said. As on Wednesday, a litre of petrol in Ranchi was priced at Rs 98.52. Deepak Prakash, Rajya Sabha MP and the state president of BJP, dared the CM to reduce prices of diesel. "For every rupee reduced on diesel, the government will provide financial relief to the common public as the prices of commodities will come under control," Prakash said. Soren's announcement came as a surprise to the petrol pump operators of the state. Earlier this month, the government had declined the Jharkhand Petroleum Dealers’ Association’s (JPDA) proposal to reduce VAT, being levied by the state on every litre of petrol and diesel being sold, to 17% from 22%. JPDA welcomed the announcement. "We welcome the decision. However, this move will not reduce inflation because it is still expensive given that 99% of the public transport and commercial vehicles run on diesel," JPDA president Ashok Singh said in a statement. Petroleum dealers were left to wonder about the efficacy of the announcement. "Jharkhand levies 22% VAT or Rs 16.10 per litre, whichever is higher, along with Rs 1 cess on a litre of petrol. From where will the government reduce the remaining amount?" said a city-based petrol pump owner. Finance minister Rameshwar Oraon did not respond to TOI's calls when contacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cm-limits-petrol-waiver-at-10-litres/month-per-beneficiary/articleshow/88577471.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Besides, Tana Bhagats in their traditional outfit and JMM supporters dressed up in party colour made it an action packed event.The event started with cultural troupes in traditional attire who welcomed the dignitaries by performing Oraon and Nagpuri folk dances. Anima Kumari, a Class IX student of Aadivasi Balika Vidyalaya Lapung, attended the event as she enjoys the dance form. Tana Bhagats from Lohardaga too attended the event. Sohrai Tana Bhagat said: “We have come to meet Guruji and we will be raising our pending demands.”The other major attraction at the venue was one Feroze Ansari who had come dressed in a green colour outfit with JMM design embedded on it. Ansari was spotted with a large JMM flag with Shibu Soren’s picture on it. On being asked where had he come from and the reason behind sporting green outfit, Ansari said: “I have got this dress stitched especially for the event as I am an ardent disciple of Guruji. He is the only person who has really fought to protect the jal, jungle, zameen of the state and the green colour of the party also signifies the same.”There were around half a dozen vaccination camps at the entry and exit gates installed by the district administration and many who had missed out on their second dose were seen taking the jabs. Shakuntala Devi of Patratu said she missed her second dose a couple of days ago. “It is good that I got a centre here or else i would have to go to the nearest vaccination centre near my village,” she said. Around 250 people were vaccinated by afternoon at these centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/folk-dancers-light-up-event-banners-flexes-flood-ground/articleshow/88577472.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The new arrangement has been implemented from December 25. A team of volunteers has been formed to manage entry of food carts and look into parking issues in Sarafa market during evening hours.Indore Sarafa association president Anil Ranka said, “Sarafa is a traditional market but it’s losing its sheen due to heavy traffic and parking issues that is discouraging customers from visiting our shops. No one would want to take a 10-15 min walk to reach our shop because there is no place to park. To ease the situation, we have set a time for the chowpatty.”Jewellers said food carts start entering the market as early as 7 -7:30 pm and this disturbed the business.

He said heads of religious institutions must oppose the law. Speaking at Vishwamanava Day, the birth anniversary of Kannada writer Kuvempu, organized by University of Mysuru Researchers Association and Dalit Student Federation at Manasagangotri, Vishwanath said, “What is the necessity of wearing the Linga if they cannot oppose the law? We have several seers and dharmadhikaris who have constructed mutts in the name of castes. Until now, they have not opened their mouth on the proposed law. If the law is implemented, will the government put the seers in jails?” “We have thrown the principles and ethics taught by Dr BR Ambedkar, Buddha and Basavanna into the air. We have failed in our responsibility to respect their ideals as we are silent on issues like anti-conversion law,” he said. Pointing out that the Constitution has given rights to every citizen to choose or reject his religion, Vishwanath asked since when did elected representatives get the right to curb the rights of citizens. “There are more than 25 lakh Indians in Christian countries. There are Indians living in Gulf countries. With such a situation, why is there an attack on Christians in India? There is still time for the seers and dharmadhikaris to oppose the law. If they do not oppose it, then they have no right to wear a Linga,” he said. UoM vice-chancellor G Hemantha Kumar, Hosa Mutt seer Chidananda Swami, Adhichunchanagiri Mutt seer Someshwaranatha Swami, Urilinga Peddi Mutt seer Jnana Prakash Swami, Buddhist Banthethissa, Sufi saint Ruhulla Shakadri and writer Krishnamurthy were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/seers-must-oppose-anti-conversion-law-says-vishwanath/articleshow/88577481.cms||---
---||Mysuru||Innocents being misled to convert to Christianity: MP||MYSURU: MP Pratap Simha stated that as Christianity is losing its popularity in European countries, the missionaries are trying to convert more people in India, and build a base in the country. Addressing the media in the city on Wednesday, he stated that churches are being sold in Western countries, as no one is visiting them, and hence innocent people in India are being lured to convert to Christianity by misleading them. “Don’t treat your religion as a consumer product. Don’t sell the religion like selling a product in the market,” he urged Christian religious leaders. On Congress leaders’ assurance that they will withdraw the anti-conversion law if they come to power in 2023, he stated that if the Congress comes to power, the state would get a government of the Taliban model. “That is why people are rejecting the party everywhere. Its leaders are forced to search for a new constitution every time,” he said. On the proposed Congress padayatra between the Mekedatu project site and Bengaluru, demanding the early implementation of the project, he alleged that former chief minister Siddaramaiah is known for making hit-and-run statements. “Even at the time of discussion on the anti-conversion bill on the floor of the state assembly, he failed to defend his statements. He never takes anything to a logical end. We don’t want to learn any lessons from the Congress,” he said. On the possibility of leadership change in the state, he made it clear that Basavaraj Bommai will continue in the post. “The CM has knee pain and will not be changed for that reason. Atal Bihari Vajpayee ruled the country with the same pain. There is no question of changing the CM in Karnataka,” he said. “There is a vastu problem in the Vidhana Soudha. Out of 224 MLAs, 223 dream of becoming CM. A few of them gossip, with the dream of becoming CM,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/innocents-being-misled-to-convert-to-christianity-mp/articleshow/88577482.cms||---

However, there is no change in the applicability of 50% of the seating capacity for eateries in the same period. Meanwhile, Bandipur, Nagarahole and Kodagu are witnessing a huge flow of tourists for the New Year, while the inflow is yet to pick up in Shivamogga and Chikkamagaluru. “We are allowed to fill 100% rooms as per the revised guidelines,” said C Narayana Gowda, President of Mysuru District Hotel Owners’ Association. However, according to him, the night curfew is affecting the hotel, tourism and hospitality sector. According to the revised order shared by the Mysuru district police, 50% of the seating capacity restriction with respect to hotels is applicable only for eating places of the hotels. There is no restriction on room occupancy in hotels. Hotels are free to operate the rooms’ accommodation as per the approved capacity. According to Gowda, the order is welcome and beneficial to hotels. “However, the decision not to allow the celebrations after 10pm will affect the business. Enthusiasts are moving to hotels in neighbouring states where there is no night curfew,” he said. BS Prashanth, honourary president of Mysuru Travels Association also echoed a similar opinion. “The confusion regarding the celebrations, tourism activities were unwanted. In Mysuru, daily cases have come down to single-digit. Both the cases of Omicron reported in the district are from foreign countries. There is no rationale in these kinds of orders,” he said. Mixed bag for tourism sector Meanwhile, the New Year tourism activities brought a mixed bag for the sector in the Old Mysuru region. The homestays and resorts in Bandipur and Nagarahole have witnessed nearly 100% bookings said president of Mysuru Travels Association CA Jaya Kumar. “The bookings are 100%,” he said. The situation is any different in Kodagu. There are hardly any rooms available in the homestays for which the district is known. “We have no rooms in our homestays for the New Year,” said Coorg Homestay Association president BG Ananthashayana. However, in Shivamogga, the December tourism continues to be dull. “Tourist arrivals are not at our expected level,” said Vikram R Udupa, Barekal Farmstay, Arodi, Hosanagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/50-occupancy-curbs-not-applicable-to-hotel-rooms/articleshow/88577483.cms||---

In all, 4,200 employees across the state-run transport corporations of the state went on strike for 15 days from April 7, demanding the implementation of the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission. However, the government did not meet their demands and all the protesting employees were suspended.

Drivers, conductors and trainee employees were among those suspended. Mahesh, a KSRTC driver-conductor, who was among those suspended, said that, while they were relieved with the state government’s decision to reinstate them, they had been deprived of salary and benefits for months together. “We will not be paid salary for the many months were suspended, nor compensated for the benefits we were denied in that time,” Mahest told TOI. KSRTC Mysuru Rural division controller M Srinivas said that the suspended employees would be reinstated after a Lok Adalat, which would be held at the Corporation Office in Bengaluru. “The adalat will be held roughly four weeks from the date of the government’s order. The case of the suspended employees will be resolved in the form of a settlement,” Srinivas told TOI.

The activists from Rangayana Ulisi Horata Samithi held a protest rally from Kukkarahalli Lake to the east entrance gate of Rangayana against Rangayana director Addanda Cariappa. The protest was flagged off by repertory’s former director H Janardhan who sang a song composed by Kuvempu.However, as the rally progressed, right-wing activists led by MK Prem Kumar started shouting slogans against the Samithi activists. Although the police officers present at the venue tried to convince Prem Kumar to stop the protest, the activists did not pay heed. Prem Kumar told police that they had to hold a protest near the DC’s office on Tuesday after they were denied permission to hold a demonstration near Rangayana to express support to Cariappa, and so, they will not allow the left-wing activists to hold protests near Rangayana.The situation turned tense when Samithi activists started singing Kuvempu songs by clapping hands and beating drums and on the other side, right-wing activists raising slogans against the left-wing activists, and shouting Jai Shri Ram.Soon after, senior police officers arrived and warned protestors saying they don’t have permission to hold a protest at the spot. When socialist P Mallesh, former director Janardhan, social activist BP Mahesh Chandra Guru refused to budge, police said they would be forced to arrest them if they did not leave the spot immediately. The activists later returned to the Kukkarahalli Lake area where they had been protesting. The right-wing activists too left the place after the police warned them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/right-and-left-activists-in-verbal-clash-at-rangayana/articleshow/88577486.cms||---

Vibha has called the allegations ‘baseless’ and said she has gone to police against a social media campaign to discredit the family. She even raised suspicions over the circumstances of her husband’s death, saying no post-mortem was carried out despite her request.Devvrat Singh, a four-time MLA and former MP, died of a heart attack at the age of 52 on Diwali this year. A long-time Congress leader, he had switched to JCC ahead of the November 2018 assembly polls and was elected from Khairagarh.He married Vibha Singh on April 28, 2017, two years after his divorce from his first wife Padmadevi Singh. Vibha Singh is a relative of Raghuraj Pratap Singh aka Raja Bhaiyya, the MLA from Kunda in Uttar Pradesh.On Tuesday morning, Devvrat’s children from his first wife, Aryavrat and Satakshi, appeared before the media at Khairagarh and alleged that they were being ‘harassed’ by Vibha Singh. Some royal family members came out in their support and reportedly sought the backing of people living in areas that come under the erstwhile princely state.A large crowd marched towards Kamal Vilas Palace on Tuesday evening, raising slogans against Vibha Singh, accusing her of forcibly occupying the palace and locking up the late MLA’s office. Police tried to prevent them from entering the palace. The crowd insisted on talking to Vibha Singh, who came out and spoke to them after which the protesters dispersed. Later, she held a press conference to reply to the allegations against her.She told mediapersons that she has custody of Devvrat’s children, and that she had taken the keys of the vehicle ‘out of concern for their safety’. The office keys were removed since some important documents were kept there, she said.Vibha Singh maintained that Padmadevi Singh has no right to stay in the palace as she is divorced, but she continues to live there without any court order.Stating that she had good relations with her husband, Devvrat Singh, Vibha said she has filed a complaint with police over ‘attempts to discredit the family by circulating certain messages on social media’.Additional SP Pragya Meshram said police have received a request from the palace for security in the wake of Tuesday’s developments. “Two PSOs have been posted there,” she said, adding: “It appears to be a property related issue with the family.” The situation is normal and the complaints will be examined, she said.Devvrat Singh was first elected to the assembly of undivided Madhya Pradesh in 1995 in a bypoll from Khairagarh, which was earlier represented by his mother. He represented the same seat four times, thrice for Congress and the last time for JCC. He was elected to Lok Sabha from Rajnandgaon in a 2007 bypoll and also served as chairman of Food Corporation of India. In the 2018 assembly elections, when Congress didn’t give him a ticket, he switched to JCC and won the Khairagarh seat.Khairagarh assembly constituency may go to the bypolls along with assembly elections in a couple of states, including Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/royal-family-feud-erupts-after-devvrat-singhs-death/articleshow/88577491.cms||---

State Congress president Mohan Markam welcomed chief minister Bhupesh Baghel’s direction to police to send a team of cops after him for his arrest after a case has been registered against Kalicharan after his remarks against Mahatma Gandhi. He said Kalicharan’s social media profile is a clear indication that he is a protagonist of BJP’s anti-Gandhi and pro-Nathuram Godse ideology. CGPCC senior spokesman R P Singh said in a statement that the Kalicharan’s speech controversy was part of a ploy by the BJP and the RSS to disturb peace and harmony in the state. He claimed that BJP and Sangh leaders went to receive and greet Kalicharan besides mobilizing the crowd through social media platforms at the Dharam Sansad where he made derogatory remarks against Mahatma Gandhi. Asserting that the Bhupesh Baghel government would not allow anyone to disturb peace and harmony, he said all evidence have been handed over to the police for investigation into the complaint against Kalicharan. However, former chief minister Raman Singh had earlier maintained that his party had nothing to with the event or the controversy. After the derogatory and abusive speech went viral on social media, Raipur’s former mayor Pramod Dubey lodged a complaint with the police, which registered a case against Kalicharan under the IPC section 505(2) and 294 for making derogatory remarks against Mahatma Gandhi. During the investigation, Police seized the video of Kalicharan making remarks against Mahatma Gandhi and against a particular community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/fit-case-to-arrest-kalicharan-says-cong/articleshow/88577492.cms||---

Somu Veerraju had committed that one crore people in the state consume liquor every day and if they all voted for the BJP, liquor prices would come down. CPI state secretary K Ramakrishna was the first to react sharply to the liquor offer. He wondered how the BJP, which talks about nationality and Hindutva, promises liquor to the voters. He wanted to know if the liquor promise is the national policy of the party or an exclusive offer for Andhra Pradesh. AP deputy chief minister Narayana Swamy said BJP had stooped down to the lowest just to win the election. “Is Somu Veerraju heading a political party or a liquor company?” he asked. Another minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy heckled at the “liquor for vote promise” and said that the BJP is desperately trying to woo the voters. AP Congress coordination committee member Sunkara Padmasree came down heavily on Somu Veerraju for his liquor offer. She suggested that the BJP leaders take their president to a psychiatrist for his liquor promise to the people. She said that the liquor promise indicates the power-monger attitude of the BJP leaders. Somu Veerraju’s liquor offer went viral in the social media too. Netizens have been trolling the BJP leader for his frantic statement to lure the voters. Telangana minister KTR also reacted to the liquor offer. He tweeted saying “AP BJP stoops to the new low.” He also wanted to know if the policy is limited to AP or extended to the nation. “National policy of BJP to supply cheap liquor at Rs 50 or is this bumper offer only for states where the desperation is high.?” Wah…what a scheme!

The scheme under Jagananna Pala Velluva programme will procure milk from 264 villages across the district by Amul.Amul, Gujarat’s milk cooperative, was introduced in the state last year and it is collecting milk from farmers in 1046 villages spread over Guntur, Chittoor, Kadapa, Prakasam and West Godavari districts so far.Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said that the Amul’s entry into milk procurement had broken the monopoly where the milk producers were exploited. Now, the entry of Amul is giving better returns to the farmers in the state, he added.The chief minister stated that Amul is the largest cooperative in the country and globally stands at eighth position in milk processing. From last December, in all the five districts, the company had procured over 168.50 lakh litres of milk and paid a sum of Rs 71 crores to the dairy farmers, who were able to earn up to Rs 15 additionally per litre.In Krishna district alone, 37,474 farmers have been identified along with 51 milk centres.

In order to ensure all the women are being paid in a transparent manner on the basis of quality checks, bulk milk cooling units and automatic milk collection units would be set up as part of the Amul project in the next two years.The chief minister stated that many dairy cooperatives have turned into private firms, as those in government have interests in private dairies, they never bothered to develop cooperatives or the welfare of dairy farmers. Because of Amul, all the other dairies are also paying a decent price to the dairy farmers, he added.The chief minister said the government had established a Market Intervention Fund to avoid farmers from selling their crops at lower prices because of middlemen, and also procured all sorts of crops through price stabilisation fund by providing remunerative prices.Minister for fisheries and animal husbandry S.

---||Surat||Union minister Darshana Jardosh, Gujarat BJP chief C R Paatil want GST on textile reduced||SURAT: Union minister for textile Darshana Jardosh and Gujarat BJP president C R Paatil on Wednesday sided with the textile traders demanding a reduction in GST on textile goods from 12% to 5%. The two senior BJP leaders during the pre-Virbant Gujarat Global Summit — Weaving Growth for Textile — in Surat on Wednesday said that they have made representation to the Central government to keep the GST on textiles at 5%. Paatil claimed that chief minister Bhupendra Patel will be writing a letter to the central government while Jardosh assured a positive outcome. A bandh call has been given by various traders’ associations in Surat for Thursday with regard to the issue. Around 70,000 traders from 175 textile markets are likely to join the strike. Meanwhile, a group of traders held a symbolic havan in the Saroli area to protest the hike in GST. The tax slab is to come into force from January 1, 2022. “Some people are trying to protest and plan a movement against the hike in GST. They must be aiming for some political benefit. But I and Darshana Jardosh along with players from across the country have made representation to the government,” said Paatil. “We clearly demanded that the rate should be 5% otherwise consumption will drop and impact production, leading to employment issues. It will damage the industry. The finance minister heard us and I appealed to CM to raise the issue as well,” he added. “The CM told me that he will write a letter to the central government to maintain the 5%,” he said. In her address, Jardosh said, “There are concerns about a hike in GST on textiles. The decision was taken by the GST council which has finance ministers and secretaries from all states.” “We have made the representations in the past and the best part of this government is they discuss and take decisions after discussion with stakeholders,” said Jardosh. Later in the day, while addressing the media, Jardosh said, “We have discussed the issue with the government and requested to resolve it. We are hopeful for some positive outcome.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/union-min-state-bjp-chief-want-gst-on-textile-reduced/articleshow/88577508.cms||---

However, the chappals did not hit anybody and fell short of the judge’s dais. The court of additional sessions judge P S Kala, a special judge under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, had earlier convicted Sujit Saket on December 23 on charges of kidnapping and murder of the minor girl in Hazira area of Surat. There were some anxious moments in the courtroom on Wednesday after Saket flung two chappals at the judge, when the formalities were being completed after the verdict. Vinay Sharma, a lawyer who witnessed the incident, told TOI: “I had gone to hear the judgment. The convict was sitting with folded hands. He was shouting that ‘I did not do anything.’ He then took out both chappals and flung it one after the another towards the dais.” Saket was later taken out of the court but no offence was lodged till late night. “It is an unfortunate incident and everyone should respect the sanctity of court. I was told by other lawyers about the incident but no complaint has been lodged in it,” said Nayan Sukhadwala, district government pleader. According to case details, Saket had kidnapped, raped and had unnatural sex with the minor before strangling her on April 30. The accused had also hit the girl with a brick on the head. The body of the girl, a native of Madhya Pradesh, was found in bushes around 150 metres away from her house. The girl had gone missing from near her house in the morning of April 30. Talking about the court verdict, Sukhadwala said, “The court observed that it was a heinous crime and deserved maximum punishment. We will approach higher courts after examining the judgment for enhancing the punishment further.” The court had examined 26 witnesses and 53 documentary evidence before giving the judgment. “The conviction is the result of the police’s hard work,” said city police commissioner Ajay Tomar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/rapist-sentenced-for-life-hurls-footwear-at-judge/articleshow/88577509.cms||---

I have inherited a love for plants from my mother, whom I call a crazy plant lady, who has grown 65 varieties of hibiscus, adeniums and other flowering plants. It was a college trip that made me realise that I have an interest in gardening.

My work hours are from 9am to 6pm. I spend an hour before log in, and after work hours with my plants. Weekends are dedicated to cleaning and repotting. I use only organic manure, and since last year, I have invested nearly Rs 80,000 only on succulents. I have got these plants from various parts of India, and whenever I have extra plants, I post them on my Instagram page, and have been able to sell a few,” said Prerana, the daughter of Pooja P Shenoy, a homemaker and Purushotham Shenoy, a businessman.

This development comes after a BTech student was found hanging in the institution’s hostel room on Sunday. The on-campus counselling facility for students was available till the Covid-induced lockdown was announced, and classes were shifted to the online mode. NITK director K Umamaheshwar Rao said, “We will reach out to students and ask them to speak to our counsellors, or take help for any issues.” The institution has one full-time counsellor at the healthcare centre, and has additional counsellors from private hospitals visiting the institute. Narendranath S, dean, students’ welfare, said, “We have planned a session for 100 students by an expert counsellor from the region. We will have more counsellors to help students deal with depression, suicidal thoughts or any financial difficulties that are hindering their academic performance.” Further, he said the institute has been helping students with financial problems. “Last year, the faculty helped a student from Bihar financially, and our alumni spread across the globe are always there to help such students,” he added. Another faculty member said students hesitate to take the help of counsellors due to the social stigma and fear of isolation from other students. Currently only the third-year and fourth-year students are on campus, after a gap of nearly 18 months. A few second-year students have also returned on campus. Meanwhile, second and first-year BTech students are yet to arrive on campus. 30 NIT students committed suicide in 8 years Minister of education Dharmendra Pradhan informed the Lok Sabha on December 20, that about 30 students studying in NITs across India committed suicide between 2014 and 2021.

Yakshaganas are a dusk-to-dawn musical plays. Its episodes are based on the Ramayana, Mahabharata and the Bhagwad Gita. The plays are performed mostly in Uttara Kannada, Shivamogga, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts and in Kerala’s Kasaragod region.Just as the Yakshagana melas began touring, the rising cases of the Omicron variant and the imposition of the 10-day night curfew has resulted in uncertainty not just among artistes, but those who organise the performances. Many Yakshagana troupes quickly changed the performance timings, scheduling them between 3 pm and 9.30 pm. However, the timings have become a problem for the performers.An artiste from the Kateel Yakshagana Mela said that starting the performance early was a challenge especially for those who have a job and are performers. They will have to apply for a half-day leave. Also, since it’s an open performance and not in a closed hall, wearing heavy make-up and costume before sunset is definitely a challenge taking into consideration the weather. The options are few, in case it is here to stay this season, art lovers may get used to it. The sevas by the Sri Durgaparameshwari Dashavatara Yakshagana Mela of Mandarthi, in Udupi district, are booked till 2043-44. The president of the Mandarthi Shree Durgaparameshwari temple, Dhananjaya Shetty, said, “There is uncertainty. Those who have got a slot are not happy with the new timings. Hopefully, this is a temporary change. We are hardly left with any option because it is difficult to get a fresh slot. Also, there are devotees who are opting for sevas held during the rainy season at the temple premise,” he said.The temple has five melas and conducts an average of 950 shows per year. The harake seva expense is around Rs 50,000. Each troupe has around 47 members.A troupe member from Udupi told TOI, the second wave has left a deep scar on the income of most people, especially those in the hospitality sector. Those who organise the Yakshagana harake sevas every year are continuing to do so, but among those who got an opportunity to offer the harake seva this year, there are few who have requested, if it could be postponed to a later date due to financial crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/artistes-worried-over-change-in-yakshagana-timings/articleshow/88577520.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Mandhare said the use of nylon manja is done on a large scale every year during Makar Sankranti. However, nylon manja is banned. He said while the departments concerned will take action against the manja sellers, citizens also need to stay away from using nylon manja in view of their safety and the safety of others. The departments will visit shops and seize the stock of manja, which will also affect the shopkeepers concerned financially. Every year many people suffer injuries from the nylon manja. Last year on December 28, a 35-year-old woman lost her life when her throat was slit by nylon manja. As the sharp string was entangled on her throat, she fell from her two-wheeler. When the police took her to the civil hospital she was declared brought dead. The incident had taken place on the Mumbai-Agra flyover near Dwarka, when she was returning home.Apart from a threat to humans, every year hundreds of birds are injured due to the nylon manja. Many are killed as well.Meanwhile, senior police officials said like every year, they will take strict action against people selling nylon manja. The officials said patrolling teams will step up intelligence to find out the illegal sale of nylon manja and take action against the vendors. It is also advised that for safety, those riding two-wheelers should cover their neck with a handkerchief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-collector-appeals-to-vendors-to-not-sell-nylon-manja/articleshow/88577523.cms||---

The NMC recovers 2% fine per month on tax dues from the last day of paying taxes. Moreover, it also recovers expenses of notices and warrants issued to the defaulters.Under the amnesty scheme, a rebate of up to 90% on penalty amount was given to the defaulters. The NMC could collect only Rs 27 crore from 75,000 tax defaulters with penalty of Rs 4.70 crore being waived since August 15.The NMC official said that with poor response to the amnesty scheme they have now decided to start a drive against big defaulters who will now be issued warrants from next month, giving them a 21-day ultimatum to clear their dues or their properties will be confiscated.There are over 4.50 lakh properties across six divisions — Panchavati, Nashik East, Nashik West, Satpur, Nashik Road and Cidco — of the civic body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-act-tough-against-property-tax-defaulters/articleshow/88577526.cms||---

Speaking to reporters during his visit to Nashik on Wednesday, Raut said the union minister had refused to inform the whereabouts of Nitesh.“My feedback is that Nitesh is incommunicado. He must have been given shelter in a neighbouring state. Maharashtra police is making an all-out effort to nab Nitesh from anywhere. In fact, the Union minister should inform the location of his son,” said Raut.The Sindhudurg police are investigating the role of Nitesh in connection with the recent alleged attack on Shiv Sena activist Santosh Parab. BJP has denied Nitesh’s involvement in the case and accused the ruling coalition of ‘framing’ the MLA.Reiterating that the ruling MVA government will complete its term, Raut took a dig at senior BJP leader Sudhir Mungattiwar, who recently commented that he will change his name if the MVA government is not dismissed in near future.“How can a government that has support of 170 MLAs be dismissed,” questioned Raut, adding that even the law and order situation in the state is stable. In response to a query, Raut said that the note sent by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to Maharashtra Governor B S Koshiyari was not in ‘threatening tenor.’“Our CM is not the kind of person, who can threaten anyone. His note to the governor was about the election of the assembly speaker,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rane-should-reveal-his-sons-whereabouts-sanjay-raut/articleshow/88577528.cms||---

---||Hubballi||Rangoli replaces garbage heaps at black spots across twin cities||DHARWAD: Even though door-to-door garbage collection has been implemented in all wards in Dharwad city, the practice of dumping garbage in vacant places has not ended. To address this problem, HDMC has come up with a new measure. The pourakarmikas lift the dumped garbage, clean the place, plant saplings and draw ‘rangoli’ with a message - ‘Stop littering, keep the place clean and tidy’. This exercise has been made into a movement and even awareness is being created among the public on sanitation. The garbage dumping spots which were emitting foul smell and were resting places for pigs and stray dogs are now looking clean and attractive with colourful rangolis. HDMC Commissioner Suresh Itnal said they have identified 467 spots in the twin cities where people dump garbage. So far 112 such places have been cleaned, saplings have been planted and rangoli has been drawn. HDMC has identified 349 black spots in Hubballi, of which 79 have been cleared and 33 out of 118 in Dharwad have been cleaned and saplings planted. Narasimha, a civic worker, said, “Even after visiting every household and collecting garbage, some people are still throwing garbage in the open. This problem is more on the roads where small eateries are located. They operate late at night and dump all the waste in vacant areas and close their business.” This exercise has gone well with the public as they have stopped dumping waste in areas which have been cleaned, he added. The outskirts in Dharwad near Kelgeri tank, Haliyal road, TV tower, the road connecting Uday Hostel Circle to railway station and the road to Hosayallapur crematorium are places where garbage is dumped in huge quantity and it has become an eyesore for morning walkers. “The action by pourakarmikas should shame those who dump garbage on the roadside. People should understand that keeping the city clean and scientific management of waste is in their interest and they should cooperate with the civic authorities” said Sandeep, an engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/rangoli-replaces-garbage-heaps-at-black-spots-across-twin-cities/articleshow/88577535.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

Anchatageri has alleged that Walikar did not follow due procedure while entering into a contract with M/S Tekmark, a Dharwad-based solar power company, which was tasked with the installation of a 100kW solar power plant in 2014. In his complaint filed with the superintendent of police, ACB, Anchatageri has stated that, while a sum of Rs 1,05,99,000 was allocated for the power plant, the company was paid Rs 36 lakh in advance, and the reminder paid after the installation, but without verifying whether the unit was functional. Anchatageri said that the VC, along with others at the helm of the varsity’s administration, agreed to the deal with the company with the aim of misappropriating funds.ACB SP for North Zone wrote to the ACB additional director general of police (ADGP), Bengaluru, seeking permission to conduct a probe into these allegations. The ADGP, in turn, sought the governor’s permission to order a probe into complaint against Walikar and other senior officials of Karnatak University.Additional chief secretary for the department of higher education Kumar Naik G said that the governor, in his capacity as the chancellor for the university, was the competent authority in whom was vested the power to order a probe into these allegations against Walikar, since the VC was appointed by the chancellor of the varsity. “However, in the case of retired registrar CS Kanagali and retired resident engineer for Karnatak University Bagali, the incumbent vice-chancellor and the syndicate have to give the nod for the probe,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/nod-for-acb-probe-into-graft-allegations-against-retd-ku-vc/articleshow/88577536.cms||---

Affirming his resolve to go ahead with preparations for the bandh on New Year’s Eve, Nagaraj said, “Regardless of whether other outfits support me, there will be a state-wide bandh on Friday.”Nagaraj expressed disappointment over the state cabinet’s failure to ban the MES during the recently concluded Winter Session of the Karnataka legislature. Fuming at the acts of MES activists, Nagaraj said that those burning the Kannada flag, and defacing the statues of Karnataka’s icons such as Sangolli Rayanna and Basavanna had no right to stay in the state. “It is to protest their actions that we have called for a state-wide bandh from 6am to 6pm on Friday,” said Nagaraj, adding that he was not aware of any letter from Karnataka Rakshana Vedike president Praveen Shetti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/vatal-nagaraj-followers-detained-by-belagavi-police/articleshow/88577537.cms||---

Karnataka has 34,563 temples under muzrai deptThrough the muzrai (Hindu religious endowment) department, the state controls 34,563 temples. These temples are grouped into ‘A’ (207) , ‘B’ (139), and ‘C’ (34,217) categories based on revenue. The government earns Rs 650 crore annually from these temples. The free-temples movement started in Tamil Nadu with people questioning the need for laws to govern the Hindu places of worship. Recently, the Uttarakhand government decided to scrap the Chardham Devasthanam Board. The board managed the affairs of 51 temples across the state, including Kedarnath, Badarinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. “Just as churches and mosques are controlled by the diocese and the waqf, it is much required that temples are also monitored by our own trustees rather than depend upon the government for every development work,” said a senior BJP office-bearer, who attended the party’s executive meeting. It is said the party functionaries impressed upon the CM that the government control over temples was a colonial practice through which the British earned revenue. “With the government now securing revenue from other lucrative avenues, the control over temples must be reduced,” said a party worker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/next-ktaka-set-to-free-temples-from-state-govt-control/articleshow/88577543.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

After attending the two-day state executive committee meeting in Hubballi, Bommai urged pro-Kannada activists to call off the proposed bandh on December 31. “We’re considering all legal options to ban the MES. I’m in talks with the legal department and the advocate general on this issue. I urge the organisers of the bandh to withdraw it,” he said. Bommai also reasoned that the economy is still picking up post the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic and a bandh call at this point will hurt the middleclass and the common man further. “Bandh is not an answer for everything. At a time when we are slowly coming out of the pandemic crisis but still witnessing a rise in cases once again in the state, let the organisations not call for a bandh. We’ll welcome every other manner of lobbying to air their concerns,” he said. The CM said his government has already agreed to the pro-Kannada organisations’ appeal to act against those who are anti-Kannada. Asked if the state is prepared to deal with the situation with “force”, he said: “We’ll take a call at that time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/govt-taking-legal-recourse-to-ban-mes-says-cm-bommai/articleshow/88577547.cms||---

---||Bareilly||India records 124 tiger deaths in 2021, highest in a decade||BAREILLY: A total of 124 tiger deaths were recorded in 2021, the highest in a decade. Data sourced from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) till December 29 this year revealed that 60 of the 124 big cats that died fell prey to poachers, accidents and man-animal conflict outside protected areas.  According to a 2018 census, India was home to 2,967 tigers. NTCA has maintained a record of tiger deaths publicly since 2012. TOI had reported in October that the toll in 2021 could be the highest in a decade as it had already hit 99 by September 30. The number in 2016 was almost as high, at 121. The figure this year has raised alarm, with experts calling for rigorous conservation efforts, especially in places such as forest reserves. Statewise, Madhya Pradesh, with 526 tigers, had the highest loss at 41, followed by Maharashtra, which has 312 tigers, at 25, and Karnataka, which hosts 524 tigers, at 15. Uttar Pradesh, home to roughly 173 tigers, recorded nine deaths. However, experts believe that the death toll could be higher, as a considerable number of natural deaths inside forests often go unreported. A senior official working with the UP forest department, who does not wish to be named, told TOI, “These are the number of deaths that are actually reported. Many tigers die of natural causes inside the forest area and their deaths go unreported... the total number of tigers that India lost in 2021 could be higher." The official said that the need of the hour was to ensure better conservation plans to mitigate man-animal conflicts. He added that this could be done by ensuring a clear passage for the animal to migrate to other forests. "Tigers can cover hundreds of miles searching for their territory, provided they have clear corridors," he said. Many experts believe that the situation is alarming as wildlife habitats are shrinking. They said humans exert enormous pressure around reserved forest areas, which in turn has led to blocked forest corridors at many places across the country. When the tiger population overspills, it is unable to move to another habitat. Experts say the animals have been trying to adapt to the situation in their own ways. In UP, over two dozen tigers live in sugarcane fields or social forestry areas. This has increased challenges for people as well as the forest department. After initial hiccups, the situation in the social forestry region is under control, mainly because of conservation efforts by NGO World Wide Fund for Nature-India (WWF-India) and the UP forest department. However, accidents and poaching are still being reported from unprotected areas. A tiger died due to electrocution at Dokarpur village in Lakhimpur Kheri district in March, while a sub-adult tigress died after being hit by a speeding car while crossing the Gola road in the same district in September. She was migrating towards another forest range. Dr Mudit Gupta, state coordinator of WWF-India, who is working closely with the forest department on several projects in UP and Uttarakhand, told TOI, “The increase in tiger deaths is alarming, especially because many deaths are reported outside the forest area. We started a campaign called Bagh-Mitra in UP, in which we shortlisted people from villages adjacent to forest areas. The role of these bagh mitras was to sensitise local residents, help them understand the behaviour of tigers and leopards, identify pug marks, and provide support during rescue operations. This worked quite well. Similar measures could be taken in other states to reduce deaths due to conflict.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/india-records-124-tiger-deaths-in-2021-highest-in-a-decade/articleshow/88577564.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The money meant for development projects of the district was reaching these people (SP),” he said. “Not a single poor person got free houses under the SP government. Now, the money is coming out of the walls," he said addressing a gathering at the Christian College ground on the occasion of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Jan Vishwas Yatra reaching Farrukhabad on Wednesday. “It’s due to good governance that money has been tumbling out from walls since the past four days. If there was a previous government, then this money would have gone to the opponents’ house, but now in our government,this money will be used for the development of the people,” the CM said, adding that the BJP provided accommodation to the poor. But, the feelings of the SP government were not for the poor. CM Yogi said that the government will respect those who work for the betterment of the society. “Let the BJP government come again, the link of Ganga Expressway will go through Farrukhabad,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/175cr-cash-seized-from-trader-tells-why-babua-opposed-demo-yogi/articleshow/88577578.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Kanpur||SP suffers jolt as its 6 corporators join Cong||Kanpur: The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Wednesday suffered a jolt in Kanpur when its six corporators, including Suhail Ahmad left the party and joined the Congress Party before state Congress president Ajay Kumar Lalloo.Those who left the SP are Suhail Ahmad, who is the leader of Samajwadi Party corporators in Kanpur Municipal Corporation house, Shibboo Ansari, Shashi, Rakesh Sahu, Abid Ali, and Mahendra Pratap Singh. Congress MLA Suhail Ansari was present on the occasion when Suhail Ahmad and others took membership of the Congress Party in Lucknow.All these corporators come from the Sisamau Legislative Assembly seat. The SP candidate Irfan Solanki had won this seat after defeating the BJP candidate Suresh Awasthi in the 2017 elections.The switching of loyalty of the SP corporators is a big blow to the party as it is being presumed that it will pose a big challenge to the BJP in the forthcoming Assembly elections.Talking to TOI, Suhail Ahmad said, “Everybody knows about the status of the Samajwadi Party in Kanpur. Its MLA Irfan Solanki has not done anything for his constituency in the last four years, and no development works were done in Sisamau in the last two decades. Moreover, Solanki’s personal behavior is also questionable”.Suhail's differences with Irfan Solanki are not new. He had become a rebel in 2017 elections and even filed his nomination from the Sisamau Assembly constituency. But after the interference of religious leaders and strategists, he withdrew his nomination.According to sources in the Congress party, Suhail Ahmad might get a ticket to contest the election from the Sisamau constituency.Suhail’s switching of loyalty from SP to Congress would not only make the road difficult for Irfan Solanki but also make election of Sisamau constituency more interesting||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/sp-suffers-jolt-as-its-6-corporators-join-cong/articleshow/88577580.cms||---

---||Goa||Govt will reintroduce OTS scheme for power consumers shortly: Cabral||Panaji: The state government will soon relaunch the electricity department’s one-time settlement (OTS) scheme, so that power consumers who could not avail its benefits earlier can do so now, power minister Nilesh Cabral said on Wednesday. Soon a tender will also be floated to install smart meters for all power consumers in the state. At present, 500 smart meters installed on a trial basis are being monitored and their functioning is satisfactory, Cabral said.“The OTS scheme is presently with the finance department. The CM has already approved it,” he said.He said that his government aims to make Goa a state which meets all its power requirement through renewable energy by 2027. A German consultant has been appointed for Goa to meet this target under a central government scheme.“We are testing a hybrid power system for implementation, which is a combination of solar energy, wind energy and battery system,” the minister said.He said 45 more charging stations will be added across the state, in addition to the existing five, to enable the shift to electric vehicles.Cabral said that, due to various initiatives of his government, power supply in Goa has gone up by 40% since 2012, after BJP formed the government in Goa.He said that 200 hamlets which had no electricity connections earlier have been provided solar power connectivity and that supply is being monitored round-the-year by officials.“We will also be introducing special day charges for power consumers. Consumers will be provided a special tariff, if they use washing machines and other such appliances during the day, to reduce the load in power usage during the night hours,” Cabral said.Goa has benefited from the central government’s one nation one grid scheme, which allows the state to purchase electricity from any grid. Cabral said that the demand for electricity in Goa has increased by 40-50% for which the government has made watertight arrangements by installing 32 power transformers.The government has further set up new substations at Bogda Vasco, Karaswada, and Sal, besides which a GI sub-station has been set up at Davorlim and work on Dabolim sub-station is set to be inaugurated soon. Likewise, work on a substation at Altinho is underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-will-reintroduce-ots-scheme-for-power-consumers-shortly-cabral/articleshow/88577583.cms||---
---||Goa||Anganwadi workers march to Goa CM Pramod Sawant’s residence in protest||Panaji: Hundreds of anganwadi workers marched to chief minister Pramod Sawant’s official residence at Altinho on Wednesday evening and continued to camp there in protest till late night. The anganwadi workers’ union had been protesting at Azad Maidan over the last few days, but said that as no official came there to discuss their issues, they were compelled to march to the CM’s residence. Late Wednesday evening, Youth Congress and Goa Forward activists who were supporting the striking anganwadi workers were detained. Police said that they were instigating the workers to intensify the stir. The union is demanding a hike in anganwadi workers’ salaries and pension. At midnight, chief minister Pramod Sawant met the striking anganwadi workers and assured them that he is willing to hear them out on Thursday. He said no one had sought an appointment to meet him on their behalf. Sawant assured them that the government is open to discuss and resolve their issues. Earlier in the evening, reacting to the protest at a different venue, the CM said that the committee of the original anganwadi workers’ union is satisfied with the solution he had come up with. The protesters, however, rejected this claim and said they were the actual union and had the numbers with them. “Those who met the CM today and claimed they are happy with their salaries were part of the earlier committee which has been dismissed,” one protester said. The workers refused to move from outside the CM’s official residence and fearing a law and order situation, police force was called in. During the arguments with officials, the protesting workers also alleged that a female worker had been manhandled by the police. “A male constable kicked a female anganwadi worker in the stomach,” said a protester. Director of women and child development Deepali Naik came to the site of the protest late at night, urging the workers to disperse. “The CM has left for the day. We will personally accompany you tomorrow as you meet him with your issues, but we request you to move out of here at present. Do not make a scene and safeguard your reputation. You’ll have never crossed the line until now, don’t do it today. Do not force law enforcing agencies to take action,” Naik told the workers. Meanwhile, another group of angawadi workers who had met the CM earlier in the day claimed that those protesting do not belong to the original union and had organised themselves recently. The protesters, however, said that this was an attempt to sabotage their protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/anganwadi-workers-march-to-cms-residence-in-protest/articleshow/88577584.cms||---

NSUI said that with Covid-19 cases on the rise and given the apprehensions about the Omicron variant, appropriate measures need to be taken to protect children and college students are are unvaccinated.“We request you to kindly allow student community to attend class from home.

---||Goa||After unseasonal rain, now fog likely to impact fruit setting of cashew, mango trees||Panaji: Consistent incidents of fog in the mornings for a prolonged period are likely to impact the cashew and mango fruit setting process, say agriculture experts. This is especially worrying in the face of the late flowering season which was delayed due to unseasonal rain this month.“After the last rain, there has been dry weather prevailing which has led to the initiation of flowering. Continuous fog incidents may however have an effect on the fruit setting on the mango crop,” said principal scientist, fruit science at ICAR-CCARI, AR Desai.He further said that the cashew crop will be more affected by the continuous incidents of fog.“There is a lot of difference between day and night temperatures. The contrast of lower night temperatures and high day temperatures will lead to a sudden exposure to heat in the day and cold at night. The flowers will not be able to withstand such extreme changes which may lead to them drying,” Desai said.As a result, both the fruits will flower but its fruition may be delayed beyond the regular time which may affect production.Despite the longer prevalence of fog incidents, if the management practices are good, the effect will be somewhat reduced. This entails properly supplementing the cashew and mango trees with nutrients.“Immunity development is necessary to withstand the adverse weather patterns. There are mechanisms to ensure proper plantation of the crops. If the management practices are good, the impact of weather changes will be nullified,” Desai said. He added that any possibility of reduction in fog incidents may help with the mango and cashew flowering process.This is the third year of unseasonal rain affecting the two cash crops and as a result, productivity is likely to be impacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-unseasonal-rain-now-fog-likely-to-impact-fruit-setting-of-cashew-mango-trees/articleshow/88577587.cms||---

He also said that those who’ve already paid need not seek recovery, since the advance payment would be deducted once the fresh bill is sent. Sawant said that while implementing the zero water bill scheme, the technical team and engineers created some confusion, which has resulted in these exorbitant bills. Sawant said that he has ordered an inquiry against some officers who “committed these mistakes knowingly”. Sawant said that the state scheme to provide 16,000 litres of free water to the people stands. He added the government has been getting good response for the one time setlement scheme for water consumers to pay dues, and that this has been extended to March 31, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rectified-water-bills-will-be-issued-soon-cm/articleshow/88577589.cms||---
---||Goa||Centre grants 306cr to acquire land for Borim bridge approach roads||Ponda: Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) has sanctioned Rs 306 crore to acquire land for approach roads to the proposed Borim bridge over Zuari river. Following the Union government sanctions, actual work of land acquisition for the approach road from Dhavali bypass circle in Kavlem to Murme-Tamshirem in Borim, that spans about 7 kms, would begin from March or April 2022, said a public works department (PWD) official.The state national highway wing of the PWD had proposed the bridge in 2016. The bridge has been sanctioned under the annual plan for the fiscal year 2021-22.This bridge, after completion, would serve as an alternative route to the existing three-decade-old link over the Zuari. The new bridge will connect Borim in Ponda taluka to Angadi, Loutolim in Salcete via Murme ward of Borim.Technogem Constructions Pvt Ltd, a Thane Maharashtra-based consultant company which was entrusted the work of consultancy since 2016, will pursue the project and hand it over to PWD, said Shashikant Desai, an executive engineer of PWD’s NH wing.The consultant company has conducted the geostatical study for the bridge in 2017, and had suggested three different routes over the Zuari. The Union ministry has finalised the route between Loutolim and Borim.The need of the third bridge arose after the existing bridge has created issues within three decades. However, the work of its rehabilitation has been conducted in 2015-16 by Fressinet India Limited, Mumbai.The first bridge at Borim was constructed by erstwhile Portuguese rulers, and the second (existing) by the Goa government in 1986.The bridge serves as the only link between Ponda and Salcete talukas and for heavy vehicular traffic after it was diverted due to the weak condition of Zuari bridge more than a decade ago. Presently, the bridge experiences movement of over 30,000 passenger car units (PCU), wherein a motorcycle is half of a PCU, a bus is equal to three PCUs and a truck is four PCUs.The steel used for the bridges suffers from the heavy impact of corrosion due to high salinity of Goan rivers and loses its tensile strength.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/centre-grants-306cr-to-acquire-land-for-borim-bridge-approach-roads/articleshow/88577590.cms||---

In the same breath, he said that politics and religion should be kept separate. “It is our faith that brings us here. I pray that we keep this fraternity, peace and unity, that is the rich multi-cultural legacy of Goa intact,”said Banerjee. The TMC MP said that “divisive forces” are desperately trying to tear down the secular fabric of Goa by mixing religion with politics.

GFP, which met GIDC managing director IAS officer Mekala Chaitanya Prasad, also called for an investigation into the duties of the field officers who manage industrial estates.GFP has given the government four days to take action, after which it will organise a formal protest and approach the higher authorities.“We will not allow the GIDC to be mismanaged and go bankrupt because of the greed and incompetence of the political appointees on the IDC board,” said party general secretary Durgadas Kamat.GFP has asked Prasad to upload the financial statement for the last three years and audit reports on GIDC’s website. “Conduct an investigation of all the duties of the field officers, and find out why only three or four field officers are assigned duties at the local IDC office whereas the rest of the 23 are posted in the head office,” said Kamat. GFP said BJP is treating GIDC as a “personal ATM or job factory”, with rampant corruption in the plot allotment process.“People who were successfully allotted plots have not yet been given possession. The delay in processing applications for allotment of plots was highlighted in the 2020 CAG report. In reality, only a select few who have allegedly paid money, have been given possession of the plots. The rest of the applicants are facing huge financial losses due to the delay in plot allotment. Such instances have a negative impact on the economy and employment situation,” said Kamat.GFP also asked GIDC to discourage warehouses, which are a lucrative business but create very few jobs compared to a manufacturing unit. “It has been observed that multiple warehousing units are springing up in various IDCs with no checks on whether such units are within or exceed the 10% limit on land allotted for such purposes,” said Kamat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-cries-corruption-in-gidc-plot-allotments-seeks-probe/articleshow/88577595.cms||---

Sawant said around 20 million tonne of iron ore is lying in the form of dumps and for next four to five years there will be no issues for carrying out mining activities in the state. “We will allow this ore to be exported,” he said. “The state government has formulated the policy for regularisation of the mining dumps on government as well as private land and related issues,” he said and added that “the decision has been taken in accordance with the government of India policy.” In 2013 and 2014, the state government had fined mining companies around Rs 200 crore for dumping outside mining leases as per the land revenue code. “The ore of those lessees that have not paid fines will come to the government and we will handle it and those lessees who have paid the fine will be allowed to handle the dumps,” Sawant said. “The dumps can be handled after taking all the permissions from the Indian Bureau of Mines and paying royalty to the state government,” the chief minister said. “There is no need to get environment clearance to handle the dump,” he said. Sawant said that as per the Centre's policy, the state government is empowered to frame the policy to handle dump outside and inside the mining leases. The chief minister said that unused iron ore is lying across the state. He said that the next e-auction of iron ore will be done in the next 15 days to restart mining activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-cabinet-approves-policy-to-mine-export-iron-ore-from-dumps/articleshow/88577600.cms||---

However, the order does not mention anything about New Year events including music festivals and outdoor parties. While the condition would apply to restaurants, pubs, bars, auditoriums, cinemas, river cruises, and entertainment parks, it also pertinently applies to wedding venues. The end of December and early January constitutes the peak wedding season in Goa. Importantly, the state has put the onus of enforcing these conditions on the owner/manager or licensee/organiser of these places. Apart from this restriction, Wednesday’s order was identical to another order issued by the state in September. Just as it was earlier, all of these venues will be allowed to operate up to 50% capacity, and will be subject to Covid safety norms.  On Tuesday, CM Pramod Sawant ignored recommendations from the state expert committee and refused a night curfew, claiming he didn't want to interrupt tourism activities. “We don’t want to disturb the tourism business, and if the positivity rate continues to increase, strict steps would be taken,” he had said. “The decision to impose strict curbs to control the spread of Covid would be taken on January 3 at the task force meeting.” Thousands of tourists have thronged Goa’s beaches and nightclubs to usher in New Year festivities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-rule-for-partying-in-goa-fully-vaccinated-or-covid-ve-certificate-must/articleshow/88577601.cms||---

While this is normal for festive seasons, when overall testing goes down due to fewer centres being open or fewer people stepping out for testing, Goa is among five poll-bound states that have been asked by the Centre to ramp up testing. Director of health services Dr Ira Almeida said that they have already instructed health centres to increase testing, and that even asymptomatic people are to be tested.

State infectivity rate jumped to 5.25% which was 4% a day earlier. As many as 170 fresh cases were reported on Wednesday, taking the tally of active cases to 657. During the last three days alone, the state has logged 349 fresh infections.  State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said that if the present rise is being driven by Omicron variant, then the state can expect a sharper growth. “It is difficult to predict on the basis of the rate of infections during the last three days. But, if the rise is due to Omicron, we will have a growth much more than what we had due to the Delta variant,” Betodkar said.  The delta variant caused the second wave of the pandemic, and Goa was one of the worst-hit states, with the highest infectivity rate of over 50% in May.  Results of the majority of the samples sent for genome sequencing to a laboratory are yet to be received.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/for-1st-time-in-months-states-case-positivity-rate-goes-past-5-mark/articleshow/88577603.cms||---

It was ready in 2019, when he, for the first time, conducted a festival in December. The temple, which is named ‘Ammaiyappar’, features the bust of his parents.“I love my parents and I am here because of them. I was not able to bear their loss. I constructed the temple to express my love for them. I was particular about building the temple on farmland. So, I bought two acres of agricultural land at Deepalapatti village,” Kumar told TOI.As he couldn’t organize the temple festival in December last year because of the pandemic situation, it was held in a grand manner on December 19 this year, by inviting his relatives and the villagers.“More than 500 people participated in the function and there was a feast for all of them. I also gifted dhoti and sari to more than 100 people,” Kumar said.The video of temple festival went viral on social media and out of curiosity many people from nearby areas have started visiting the shrine.Kumar is married to 36-year-old S Uma Maheshwari. They have a son - 8-year-old Prasath - and a daughter - 5-year-old Dhivya Bhakyasree. Kumar has five sisters, who are settled in various parts of Coimbatore district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-41-builds-temple-for-parents-conducts-festival/articleshow/88577605.cms||---

He said Harsimrat had used the ‘takkadi’ of the first Sikh master for her political agenda by saying, “For us, this takkadi (election symbol of SAD) is no less important than the takkadi of Guru Nanak Sahib. This takkadi reminds us that if people believe in this with Baba Nanak’s takkadi, their faith is returned a hundred fold.” Sandhwan said comparing the scales of the SAD with the scales of the first Sikh master was a transgression of Indian electoral code and also a violation of the sentiments of all followers of Guru Nanak Dev. He appealed to Giani Harpreet Singh, jathedar of Akal Takht, to summon Harsimrat for hurting the religious sentiments of the Sikhs and to apologise immediately.The controversy became more serious because the Shiromani Akali Dal is into Panthic politics and appeals largely to Sikh vote bank. It is also trying to come out of the serious damage caused to it by sacrilege incidents that happened int the state during its term in power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-harsimrat-hurt-religious-sentiments/articleshow/88577617.cms||---

Jagmeet has been arrested along with his mother and a friend for allegedly promoting a referendum advocated by banned outfit Sikhs for Justice.Questioning the police action, Panjoli posted on his Facebook page: “On one hand, the Constitution of India grants freedom of speech and expression, while on the other hand the police is registering cases against those who are trying to express their views. Shockingly, the police claimed that campaigning material, including pamphlets of referendum recovered from Jagmeet, his mother and another person, was a threat to the nation and was an act of promoting hatred between different groups or religions. If only a few pieces of paper are a threat to our country, who will save the country from the threat of weapons from China and Pakistan?”“The motive behind such illogical arrests is to defame the Sikh community and create an atmosphere of fear. Can police tell how these recovered paper pieces had promoted hatred between any different groups or these papers had blast like a bomb thus killing numerous citizens? I appeal to the CM of Punjab and Punjab DGP to release these Sikhs, including Jagmeet, from custody of Patiala police,”said Panjoli’s Facebook post.He said there was nothing wrong in expressing the views on referendum or Khalistan as it was common to see the raising of Khalistan slogans.He added evem the jathedar of Akal Takht had spoken on the subject. He said farmer unions should have supported Jagmeet or any other section of society that had extended support to farmer agitation.Meanwhile, Dal Khalsa too criticisedthe arrests and demanded Punjab CM’s intervention and cancellation of the FIR. Party spokesperson Paramjit Singh Mand said, “The charges against three were frivolous and based on flimsy grounds. As per SC guidelines, distributing Khalistan-related material, pamphlets or raising slogans peacefully was neither seditious nor a crime. The act of arrested activists has neither triggered violence nor created any disharmony or enmity within the communities. The three were propagating their ideology by using democratic means. Hence, the charges leveled by Patiala police against them were illegal and undemocratic,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/nothing-wrong-in-expressing-views-on-khalistan/articleshow/88577619.cms||Bharat Khanna

No incentives were offered for vaccination at these camps and the focus was only on awareness and education.Later, incentivised vaccination camps were organised from June 24 to July 4, and ‘lucky draw coupons’ were offered to visitors. Dr Vitull said the study documented a higher response to incentivised vaccination camps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/incentives-attract-more-people-to-vaccination-camps-study/articleshow/88577621.cms||Neel Kamal

He said the government was determined to gradually close down mandis by weakening them continuously. By not paying the amount of Rs 508 crore to arhtiyas, the government wants to achieve the same objective, with which it had brought in three black farm laws, he said. He said this was government’s strategy, so it could implement the now-repealed farm laws.He said when the process of paddy procurement by the government was over on November 15, 2021, payments were yet be made to arthiyas and labourers. “Does the government want that the farmers’ wheat should not be procured, because if the previous outstanding payment of labor is not made, then how the labor would be available for the ensuing wheat season?” he said.Surjewala said Union agriculture minister Narendra Tomar had also recently given a statement that the three agriculture laws would be brought back, which made it clear that the PM Modi government once again intended to bring back the farm laws after elections in five states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hry-not-paying-arhtiyas-mandis-shut-surjewala/articleshow/88577624.cms||---

---||Agra||‘If women vote for Cong, they will vote for empowerment’||Agra: Indian National Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra sought the support of women in the upcoming assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. "If women unite and fight for their rights, they will be able to have a sizable presence in state and national politics. If women vote for Congress, they will be voting for their empowerment," she said at the Shakti Samvad programme in the Sirsaganj sub-division of Firozabad district.Priyanka highlighted the problems women have to face in their lives, ranging from struggles to get a proper education to facing difficulties after marriage. She said, "Political parties only make tall promises at the time of polls and forget them after elections are over. Leaders know that they would get votes in the name of caste and hence they do not bother about fulfilling their promises."The Congress leader said that after she launched the campaign for women, other political parties have begun recognising the power of female votes. "The time has come to elect a party that does not talk about caste and wants to empower you. If you unite and vote on issues, leaders will also stop taking you for granted," she said.Addressing a large gathering of women from Firozabad and nearby districts, Priyanka said that her party had released a separate election manifesto for women, which includes many promises. "Give us a chance and see the change in your lives," the Congress leader told one of the women, who narrated the problems being faced by her. In a reply to a question from one Shina, a local resident who worked at a bangle manufacturing factory, about creating employment opportunities for women at villages, Priyanka said that the Congress was working on a plan to provide jobs to women in rural areas. The Congress leader said that her party has promised to recruit 25% women in the police force and will also provide legal help to them in times of need.Priyanka targeted the Centre for "increasingly opting for privatisation." She said that it meant that "the benefits of reservation will slowly dry up.""The government is working for the benefit of its rich friends, while the poor are suffering.

Both Rajashri and Ritu died on Tuesday night while undergoing treatment.The district health administration has sent a team to Shindewadi which is a small village with a population around 900 people. The sugarcane cutters staying in the village have come from Dhule district.Yogesh Sale, district health officer, said, “The gastro seems to be the main reason for the deaths. The admitted people are showing signs of improvement. We have deployed a team of doctors to check each and every person from the village and bring them under treatment if they show any sign of gastroenteritis infection. We suspect that the infection has spread due to drinking water from a nearby well. We have sent samples of water from the well as well as the samples of the patients for testing to find which vector caused the disease.”The stomach gets irritated and inflamed due to infection caused by the virus and bacteria that reach through the drinking water. The water is usually contaminated by sewage seeping into the water bodies. The locals have claimed that the well is the only source for drinking water in the village as there is no supply of water through tap. Sale said the grampanchayats are usually asked to decontaminate water before supplying it for drinking purpose and an inquiry will be carried out to check whether the advised procedures were followed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/2-succumb-to-gastroenteritis-in-panhalas-shindewadi-village/articleshow/88577631.cms||---

The rescue operation was over after 28 hours of efforts from the forest department, wildlife rescue teams, police, fire-brigade, revenue department and the Sangli city administration.Veterinary doctor with the forest department Dr Santosh Walvekar said, “A special ramp was created for the bison to enter the transport vehicle. The vehicle was readied with around one trolley of fodder. We even sprayed cow urine and cow dung inside the vehicle to attract the animal, as it tends to run away from human body odour.” He added that after they had contained the bison in one lane of the APMC market for around 18 hours, it walked into the vehicle in the dark. After carrying out the necessary basic observations and checking the medical status of the bison, the animal was finally released into wildlife around 9am on Wednesday morning.” Earlier, the Sangli administration had imposed section 144 of the CrPC in the market yard area on Tuesday to prevent any disturbance and loss to the humans and also to provide free passage to the animal. The daily business of the APMC is of around Rs 10 crore and had to be halted on Tuesday due to the bison.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/bison-in-sangli-caught-released-into-wild-by-forest-department/articleshow/88577632.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Their main target, however, is NCP leader and minister Hasan Mushrif. Patil, speaking at a rally held in Kolhapur city, said, “We wanted the election to be held unopposed. It was because we don’t want the bank to be a political target. We tried to adjust as many leaders as possible from across parties. However, unfortunately Sena has set up its own panel. The allegations against us is welcome, but Sena leaders should not criticise the bank and its administration. Mushrif helped it to generate profit and himself hit the road to recover loan dues. Sena leaders should at least say few good words for the bank and its achievements.”Congress leader Balasaheb Khade said this time president of KDCC should be from Karveer tehsil. Mushrif is currently the president who comes from Kagal tehsil. “I second the view put up by Khade. Karveer tehsil should get a chance to lead the bank. The farmers from Karveer tehsil has contributed immensely in the growth of the bank,” Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sena-should-refrain-from-criticising-kdcc-satej-patil/articleshow/88577634.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Radhanagari dam gate malfunction leads to 6,000 cusec water discharge||Kolhapur: A service gate of Radhanagari dam got stuck on Wednesday morning due to a technical glitch, leading to discharge at around 6,000 cusec into the Bhogavati river — a tributary of the Panchaganga river. The technicians from the water resources department (WRD) succeeded in stopping the discharge from the dam by installing an emergency gate. Owing to the massive discharge, fishing and venturing near the river was prohibited by the district administration. Mahesh Surve, WRD superintendent engineer, said, “Our primary information suggests that at 9.10am on Wednesday, the starter switch might have malfunctioned due to which the service gate of the dam automatically opened to 18 feet height and got stuck. This led to discharge of water at 6,000 cusec into the Bhogavati river. Through the help of district administration, we had appealed to the villagers living on the banks of the river to remain alert as the water level is expected to increase by 3 to 4 feet.” He added, “At 3:15pm emergency gate was installed bringing the situation under control. Our teams are still working to install the service gate and it will hopefully be installed back by Thursday. Currently, with the installation of emergency gate the discharge from the dam has been brought down to 400 cusec. No scarcity will be experienced in the summer due to the fiasco.” Hasan Mushriff, rural development minister for Maharashtra, said, “I will discuss the issue with state water resources minister Jayant Patil and ask him to carry out an enquiry to find out if this was an accident or an intentional act.” Radhanagari dam is one of the oldest dams in India which was designated in 1907 and the actual construction began in 1909. Legendary King Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj funded the construction of the dam which is now used for hydro-electricity power generation, irrigation and for consumption. This gravitational dam is also one of its kind to have automatic gates that are self-operated by the water pressure. Meanwhile, district collector Rahul Rekhawar said, “Regarding the Radhanagari issue, people are requested not to panic. Teams from WRD are there at Radhanagari dam. People in the downstream villages are being alerted and advised to stay alert and avoid venturing near the river.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/radhanagari-dam-gate-malfunction-leads-to-6000-cusec-water-discharge/articleshow/88577636.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

The council meeting started in the morning and ended two minutes after the chairperson declared all 22 agendas had been passed. The brawl started after that. Opposition councillors from the LDF had been demanding to get a copy of the minutes of the previous council meeting, and they were informed that the minutes of the meeting would be given on Wednesday. When the council started in the morning, LDF councillors demanded the copy, and the UDF chairperson asked them to wait for a few minutes to get the copies to all the councillors. “However they refused to abide by this and started to disrupt the meeting. Since I have a majority in the council, I read all the agendas, passed and left for my chamber. But the opposition councillors made ruckus in my chamber and threw away files. I don’t know pages of how many files had been lost in the ruckus. It was an unnecessary incident,” said Seema Kannan, chairperson. LDF councillor Bindu Manoharan said the current UDF council failed to give minutes of all the council meetings held so far. “The agenda was passed to circumvent the objection raised by the opposition against manual tendering regarding waste removal from the local body limit. We demanded to select the contractors through e–tendering. Their move is to give the work to their patrons,” said Bindu. The agenda passed on Wednesday includes one for selling off the unused 12 vehicles, which are in bad condition. It also decided to remove the advertisement boards and banners erected illegally at various places of the municipality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/council-meet-ends-in-brawl-3-councillors-suffer-injuries/articleshow/88577638.cms||---

According to councillors, drug trafficking and sales are rampant in many parts of the city with youth and adolescents falling prey to it.As per a resolution moved by Kajal Salim, a councillor, the city badly needs de-addiction centres as more and more people are falling in the trap set by the drug mafia. The council unanimously passed the resolution. “A few days ago, mother of a teenager approached me. She wanted my help to rescue her son who had become a drug addict. Though I inquired about de-addiction centres in the city, we could learn that such centres are not there in the city,” Salim said. “Then, I arranged a place for housing the boy and treating him. I had to face the wrath of family, friends and other local residents for helping the kid and her mother. We need a de-addiction centre in the city,” Salim said.Mayor M Anilkumar said that the penetration of drug mafia in the city is worrisome. “We were thinking of starting a de-addiction centre at Ernakulam general hospital. But there is lack of space in the hospital. So, we will have to explore other options,” Anilkumar said.Councillor Deepthi Mary Varghese said that there are many shops which deal in drugs. “Stadium Link Road has become a haven for all anti-social elements including drug peddlers and users. A shop in the stadium complex remains open up to 3am every day. It is reported that they are selling drugs. The police have asked Kochi corporation to take immediate measures to cancel the licence of the shop,” Varghese said. “On the basis of a letter by Palarivattom circle inspector, the officials with the corporation’s regional office conducted an inquiry and submitted the report to the main office of the local body. I brought the issue to the notice of health standing committee chairperson T K Asharaf. Unfortunately, even two weeks since the report was submitted to the main office, no concrete action has been taken so far. It is deplorable,” she said.At the same time, Asharaf said that the corporation officials have sent a notice to the shopowner seeking explanation. “As per rules, we have to send two notices to the shopowner before taking action. We have charged the shopowner with violations under Disaster Management Act,” Asharaf said. He added that stringent action against the shopowner will be taken the next day.Councillor Sasikala said that a shop on Sreekandath Road dealing in drugs was closed down recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/drug-abuse-issue-takes-centre-stage/articleshow/88577640.cms||---

In India, appropriate public health measures and investigations are being conducted for surveillance of Omicron, INSACOG said while noting that globally there appears to be significantly reduced ability of vaccines or prior infection to protect against symptomatic infection by the Omicron variant. “While Delta continues to be the most prevalent VOC globally, Omicron has completely displaced it in southern Africa and is on track to become the dominant variant in UK and elsewhere,” INSACOG said in its bulletin on Wednesday. The genomic consortium, citing global data, said there is now clear experimental and clinical data supporting very high immune escape potential of Omicron, which appears to be the major component of its growth advantage over Delta. “Initial estimates of severity of illness have, however, been lower than seen in previous outbreaks. Whether these initial observations are generalisable to older non-immune subjects is not clear and the threat level is still considered high,” it said. The INSACOG reports genomic surveillance of SARS CoV-2 through sequencing of samples from sentinel sites and also detailed state-wise district analysis for some states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/data-now-clearly-backs-high-immune-escape-insacog/articleshow/88577646.cms||---

The department has also set a guideline for the purchase of tablets. The state has mandated students to buy a tablet that at least has an 8-inch display, 2GB ram and 4G compatibility. According to the government's announcement, an amount of Rs 12,000 will be given to those studying in Class X and XII in UBSE board schools and state-run degree colleges. So far, the government has released over Rs 190 crore for the scheme. A majority of Class X and XII students, who will write their board exams in 2022, have already received the money. In the next phase, college students will be extended the benefit of the scheme.“We have instructed school principals to make sure that students buy the tablet devices soon after they get the money in their bank accounts,” said a senior education officer.

Categorized as ‘vulnerable’ in the IUCN red list, the mugger crocodile is a declining species of freshwater crocodile. It is a Schedule I reptilian species protected under Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.In Uttarakhand, Khatima's Kakra forms a perfect habitat and breeding zone for these marsh muggers. Now, the area has been turned into a tourism spot. The crocodile safari was inaugurated by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Wednesday.In the entire Terai Arc Landscape (TAL), 126 crocodiles were found in Kakra Nala. The trail is spread across 4km in which at least 81 adult muggers, 33 sub-adult and around a dozen juveniles exist as per latest forest department study. “This is the first such crocodile trail where people can watch the species from a very safe yet close distance. There are wetlands containing crocodiles in different states in which boating is allowed. But, no such trail exists that exclusively aims at educating the people about the significance of marsh crocodiles,” said Sandeep Kumar, DFO, Terai East. This species of crocodile is found in India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.Senior scientist and expert at Wildlife Institute of India Dr K Sivakumar said, “Promoting ‘crocodile tourism’ is a right approach taken to change the perspective of people from seeing it as an animal of conflict to that of significant value in our ecosystem. All they require is good nesting sites and food.”The crocodile trail is aimed at ensuring that their habitat is secured from the effluents of industries and the area remains free of enrichment for letting its population thrive. Muggers are opportunistic predators and they prefer fish, snakes and turtles, birds and mammals (monkeys).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/croc-trail-a-first-comes-up-at-surai-ecotourism-zone/articleshow/88577652.cms||Aakash Ahuja

To develop herd immunity, mass immunization is essential. Without any hesitancy, all the citizens must get fully vaccinated at the earliest,” said a health official adding that vaccine hesitancy is one of the main reasons behind a section of beneficiaries not getting inoculated.Aurangabad Immunization Officer Dr Smita Nalgirkar could not be reached for her comments.As per the official data, Aurangabad city has 10.5 lakh target beneficiaries, of which 81% have received the first dose, whereas 47% are fully vaccinated.Notably, the district administration has already made partial vaccination mandatory for visiting different government offices, besides introducing the ‘no vaccine no travel’ rule, among other efforts to enhance the vaccination coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/over-1-9-l-citizens-yet-to-take-1st-vax-dose-in-aurangabad/articleshow/88577653.cms||---

That’s how Chennai’s parks, which will also be tools for flood mitigation, are going to be. The Greater Chennai Corporation plans to construct 28 new parks and eight playgrounds in Madhavaram, Manali, Royapuram, Perungudi and Sholinganallur zones. This is in addition to the 54 parks being developed at present. The secretary for municipal administration and water supply has instructed the civic body to ensure that the parks have less than 15% concrete structures, which includes the walking path. He has asked the civic body to look at parks are water retention ponds so that the areas around them do not flood during the rains.  “We have mooted the proposal. The government will soon issue an order after which we will begin the tendering process. The idea behind the design is to keep the parks greener with more trees and minimum grass. Right now, there are 718 parks. And work on 54 parks began in 2019,” said a senior official. “We have identified these parks based on the demand in the area and availability of land,” said deputy commissioner D Sneha, in charge of the parks department. Radha R, a resident of P T Rajan Salai, told TOI that in December several areas had been waterlogged because Sivan park lacked any drain system or water retention capacity. “Parks are actually the lung spaces of the city and planting more native trees instead of ornamental ones is a welcome move. However, it is the maintenance that has always been an issue. We hope the toilet and cleanliness contracts are also monitored,” she said. Perungudi resident P Sajeevan, said the zone had several OSR (open reserve space) areas, but minimum green cover. “This new strategy of greener parks will improve the lung spaces of the localities as well,” he said. OMR resident G Sathish said the area didn’t have many GCC playgrounds or sports facilities. “More than parks, children and adults require more playfields in the city,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/gcc-plans-to-build-28-parks-with-more-trees/articleshow/88577673.cms||Komal Gautham

More than a decade after the 8.8acre facility at Shenoy Nagar was closed for metro rail construction, several concrete structures have come up at the cost of greenery as part of the underground commuter amenities centre and restoration of the park. The centre was planned by CMRL soon after the underground Shenoy Nagar metro station was opened and just when residents expected the park to be restored and open to the public. The facility is coming up amid protests by residents who moved the courts to save the park.While CMRL said it will restore the park with new facilities and greenery, residents and regular park visitors alleged they have lost the green space forever.“The park was a lung space for not just Shenoy Nagar residents but also for those in the neighboring TP Chatram, Kilpauk and even Anna Nagar. Metro rail has taken away all the greenery and we have nowhere to go. The corporation too has remained a mute spectator. No one asked for a public utility at the cost of greenery,” said K Rajan, of Anna Nagar, who was a regular visitor to the park.CMRL earlier claimed it had cut only 138 trees out of the 328 and transplanted 20. But photographs and images on Google Maps show an open land with several small structures and a few trees and miyawaki saplings planted last year on the periphery of the park. CMRL also said it will plant 10 saplings for each tree taken down. The park has been shut since 2011.“Facilities which were present at the park earlier like fountain, jogging track and children play area will be restored with new features,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/infra-overload-by-cmrl-strips-shenoy-nagar-park-of-greenery/articleshow/88577674.cms||---

We would give the reallotment to the tenants and not the owner,” he said. While it was mostly the tenants who lost valuables after one of the blocks collapsed at the Thiruvottriyur tenement, many people who were the original allottees three decades ago, suddenly turned up at the tenements to seek the 24,000 per head aid announced for relocation from the C, E and D blocks. This caused a ruckus on the slum board premises as the owners asked the tenants to vacate while the tenants fought back saying it was they who lost valuables and were morally eligible for the compensation. “We have questioned them on letting the houses for rent, that too for decades,” said Udhayakumar, an assistant engineer with the TNUHDB. The board gave compensation to the tenants who lived in the collapsed houses. “Out of the 28 families that lived in the building which collapsed, nine were tenants. We have given the compensation only to the tenants and not the owners,” Rao said. The team of experts from Anna University who inspected the stability of the remaining blocks may sumbit a report in three days. Meanwhile, most of the evacuees are living on the premises of the collapsed building as they could not find affordable houses.

The flight arrived around 11.30pm.The passengers found that they were at the wrong terminal after they could not find the immigration counters. Meanwhile, the airline staff who were present at the terminal found something amiss and alerted their counterparts who take care of international arrivals. The passengers were taken to the international terminal to process immigration procedures and other arrival formalities.An Airports Authority of India (AAI) official said that the driving permit of the driver of the shuttle bus has been seized and action would be taken for the error. Sources said that international passengers need to undergo immigration and customs clearance before entering the city and the error must have resulted in people walking out of the airport without any such checks. There are no checks at the domestic terminal. An Air India Express official said, "The shuttle coach driver made a mistake and brought the passengers to the domestic terminal. A few shuttle buses were used to move the passengers to the terminal. Only one bus went to the wrong terminal. There were only a few passengers in it and the airline staff at the terminal contacted the immigration and also arranged for their transport to reach the international terminal to clear the arrival formalities. We have contacted the ground handling agency about the error." The AAI official said that the shuttle buses are operated by drivers who are trained for airside driving. "They have a permit after completing the training. This could be a mistake due to a communication error. The incident will be checked and corrective measures will be taken."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/air-india-express-shuttle-bus-drops-13-intl-passengers-at-domestic-arrival/articleshow/88577677.cms||---
---||Chennai||Transport staff seek better pay||Chennai: The state government is trying to put an end to frequent tiffs between government bus drivers, conductors and passengers who are allowed to travel for free.  Women, students, transgenders and differently abled are exempted from paying ticket fare in most of the government town or city buses. This led to a drop in revenue through ticket sales and the government compensated it by sanctioning 1,450 crore as subsidy to transport corporations. But some conductors and drivers had their own problem with free commute. Usually, these staff receive an amount (incentive based on daily ticket sales) over and above their monthly pay.  Carrying more passengers for free meant their incentive was taking a hit. This led to tiffs. So, the transport workers' union in a meeting with Transport minister RS Rajakannapan, requested him to include the incentive even for free commute. Besides, they demanded an increase in pay (14th wage agreement). The minister, who advised them to treat all passengers with respect, assured their demands will be discussed with top bureaucrats and appropriate action will be taken. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/transport-staff-seek-better-pay/articleshow/88577678.cms||---

After opposing the TRS on paddy and unemployment issues, the state saffron unit will now target the ruling party on the power issue. The BJP claims that Telangana’s success in the power sector is solely due to the Centre’s efforts in connecting the northern and southern grids. The BJP will also organise protests against the proposed increase in power charges.“We were told to highlight the failures of the state government one by one. During the Intermediate results issue, it was we who have highlighted lapses in Telangana State Board of Intermediate,” a BJP leader said. The party leadership will now highlight the issue of hike in power tariffs. “When the state was united, there was a debate if a separate Telangana can survive power shortage if united AP was divided. TRS has continuously taken credit for uniterrupted power supply after the formation of the state. On power supply issue, we will tell people about Centre’s contribution in ensuring 24/7 power supply,” a senior leader said. According to BJP sources, two factors will help the party’s victory in the coming elections.

His son managed to revive him with CPR and rushed him to hospital where he suffered another attack on the operation table even as doctors were preparing for TAVI. After 15 minutes of CPR, when the team of doctors saw there was no improvement in his condition, they decided to go ahead with the TAVI procedure. Explaining the patient’s condition, Dr Abhishek Mohanty, interventional cardiologist at Continental hospital, said, “This patient had a condition called aortic valve stenosis. In such cases a cardiac arrest while undergoing surgery is usually a fatal incident. The only reason this patient could be saved is that our team of anaesthetists were already doing CPR and we decided to go ahead with TAVI on seeing that there was no result. CPR was briefly stopped for 10-15 seconds and it took 5 minutes to replace the valve (with an artificial one). After that CRP was continued for another 10 minutes and his heart started to beat again. This is the first recorded case in our country of the simultaneous procedures.” Aortic valve stenosis is a condition where one of the four valves inside the heart doesn’t open properly. It creates pressure inside the heart, leading to chest pain and loss of consciousness. An open heart surgery is the traditional way to deal, but was deemed as a high-risk procedure for this patient and alternately TAVI was decided upon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/89-yr-old-first-to-undergo-tavi-during-cpr/articleshow/88577683.cms||Amrita Didyala

Terming it as the world’s longest single cycle journey, Rajpurohit travelled with a sapling in his backpack and a national flag on his cycle, leaving people intrigued. “When I reached Charminar, many people came forward and asked me about the sapling in my backpack. That’s when I spoke to them and made them aware about my efforts towards saving the environment. I donated the saplings to few people and took an oath from them to protect it,” said Rajpurohit, who claims to have planted 91,650 saplings across Rajasthan alone and 20 per cent saplings in other states. Despite having 38 stitches in one leg and 10 per cent disability, his spirits are high. “I will be covering all the districts in Telangana during my journey. Instead of taking the highway, I will visit villages and speak to people so that they plant more saplings with me on the way,” said Rajpurohit. The ace cyclist from Barmer in Rajasthan started his journey from Kashmir in January, 2019 and has been travelling to various states ever since. In the field of wildlife protection, he has saved almost 169 deer, seven peacocks among other animals and birds. “When these wild birds or animals are found in an injured condition, I readily cooperate at my level and inform forest department officials for proper treatment in private hospitals,” said Rajpurohit, who has also placed 21 water pools at his personal expense in Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/greenman-to-cycle-his-way-into-t-hinterland/articleshow/88577685.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Sabyasachi now awaits political rehab in TMC||Kolkata: Six years ago, Sabyasachi Dutta was a much-sought-after man leading the Trinamool Congress charge in Bidhannagar. Today, he is not even sure of getting a party ticket for the January 22 Bidhannagar corporation polls. “The party’s decision is final. I will take up any role the party will ask me to. My leader’s (Mamata Banerjee’s) decision is my decision,” Dutta said, cautious not to overstep the mark and seal his own political fate.From a Trinamool MLA representing Rajarhat-New Town, Dutta became the mayor of Bidhannagar in 2015 and stayed in favour until he became defiant and finally defected to the BJP in 2019. In the political gamble, he surrendered his mayoral post, lost in the assembly polls earlier this year and returned to the Trinamool to start his career from scratch. In Dutta’s absence, Sujit Bose shot to prominence in the Trinamool camp. Dutta used to be the councillor of Bidhannagar’s ward 31. After he defected to BJP, the Trinamool appointed Supriyo Chakraborty — who is close to Bose — as the coordinator from the same ward. A section of Trinamool leaders in Bidhannagar does not want Dutta to get a civic poll ticket. “He (Dutta) didn’t bother about the party when the BJP garnered all its resources to oust Mamata Banerjee from Bengal. Dutta was then busy meeting people on his own, sending out signals of joining the saffron camp. People of Bidhannagar gave him a sharp rebuff in the Bengal assembly polls,” a local leader said, indicating that Dutta had lost much ground in Bidhannagar to minister Sujit Bose.Apart from the controversies surrounding Dutta’s “once colourful” political career, he seems to have lost the edge he had over others in the Trinamool six years ago. The party took extra care to nurture ward 31 while he was away. Dutta has learnt it the hard way that the “luchi-alur dum courtesy politics” he began with Mukul Roy, then in the BJP, as a prelude to his entry to the party didn’t work for him. Now, he has no choice but to wait for the Trinamool chief to rehabilitate him in some form in the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sabyasachi-now-awaits-political-rehab-in-tmc/articleshow/88577687.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad cops back to sniffing mouths, FIRs state||AHMEDABAD: In the run up to New Year, city police launched a drive against drunken driving. Here there is a dilemma, after the strict no-no on smelling mouths to detect alcohol which was implemented in 2020, cops now rely on driving patterns and sobriety walking tests to determine if a person is drunk, at least according to FIRs. However, about 40% of the FIR against drunken drivers, the FIRs state that the cops and panch witnesses smelled the mouths of the accused for alcohol. Senior cops had in 2020 barred the practice, after the advent of Covid, to avoid infection. Scanning through the cases registered over the last few days, one finds that the police already caught a two-wheeler rider for driving in a zig-zag manner and was then not able to stand upright, and others slurred while speaking. For example, Rambhavan Sinh, a resident of Vejalpur, was caught by Anandnagar police on Tuesday night as he was allegedly driving his motorcycle in a serpentine fashion. In another case, police received a call from a woman stating that her husband, Anil Thakore, was fighting with her after drinking liquor. Chandkheda police reached the spot and allegedly found Thakore to be inebriated. The cops and panch witnesses then smelled his mouth, the FIR states. Another FIR states that Ajaysinh Rathod was stopped for driving in a zig-zag manner. He was then allegedly unable to stand and the cops smelled his mouth to ascertain whether he was drunk. In Vastrapur, one Shailesh Thakore was riding his two-wheeler in a serpentine fashion and when he was stopped the cops say that his eyes were red and he could barely stand. Milan Hadiya, who was driving a car, was stopped and could barely stand. He had also met with an accident and had a bandage on his hand. In his case the cops did not smell his mouth. “There are many ways one can describe a person being drunk such as inability to stand properly, unstable movement, slurred speech, etc, to justify taking the suspect for a medical check-up to confirm that he is drunk. However, in the majority of cases, cops do resort to their old method of smelling the mouth,” said a senior police official. Sniffing was extensively used to catch those breaking prohibition laws. A senior cop who asked not be named said he believes it has become a fixed format in FIRs, when it comes to catching drunk people, and is mentioned on paper, even if nobody had smelled the mouth of a suspect. Mostly in all the FIRs registered against an inebriated person ‘smelling of the mouth’ is mentioned. Police had been instructed to remove this practice in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cops-back-to-sniffing-mouths-firs-state/articleshow/88577693.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

---||Ahmedabad||Wife can’t be forced to cohabit, even by decree, says Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: In an important judgment, the Gujarat high court made it clear that according to the law no person can force his wife to cohabit and establish conjugal rights, and upon refusal by wife to cohabit, the wife cannot be forced to do so by a court decree. The court’s conclusion came in a case involving a Muslim couple from Banaskantha district. They got married in 2019 and had a son in 2015. The woman works as a nurse at Palanpur Civil Hospital. She left her matrimonial home with her minor son in 2017 and went to live with her parents.  Her grievances were harassment by her husband and in-laws and their pressure to migrate to Australia and then call her husband there. This is because her siblings have settled in Australia. The husband filed a suit in a family court in Palanpur for restitution of conjugal rights, and the court ordered the wife to live with the husband. This order was challenged by the woman before the high court. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Niral Mehta quashed the family court’s order to the wife to go and live with her husband and establish conjugal rights. In overturning the family court’s order, the bench cited various judgments and discussed that a marriage between Mohammedans is a civil contract and a suit for restitution of conjugal right is nothing more than an enforcement of the right to consortium under this contract. Disobedience to the court’s order would be enforceable by imprisonment of the wife or attachment of her property. It further said that such a decree cannot be enforced except by way of attachment of property of the woman. But in this case, the woman does not have any property so there is no question of attachment. The HC cited Order XXI Rule 32(1) of the Civil Procedure Code and said that the object behind the provision of law is that “no person can force a female or his wife to cohabit and establish conjugal rights. If the wife refuses to cohabit, in such case, she cannot be forced by a decree in a suit to establish conjugal rights.” The court also discussed the Mohammedan Law in detail to state that if wife decides to walk out of her matrimonial home, its section 281 deals with the issue of restitution of conjugal rights, “but does not throw any light as to in which circumstances, a decree for restitution of conjugal rights can be granted or declined”. The judges then listed various grounds on which such a relief can be declined for Muslim husband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wife-cant-be-forced-to-cohabit-even-by-decree/articleshow/88577698.cms||---

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh saves 25 lakh vaccine doses, wastage drops to below zero||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh witnessed about 11% Covid-19 vaccine wastage in the initial months of the launch of mass inoculation drive. State was in the second place among all the states in the country in terms of vaccine wastage by March.  But the wastage has now dropped to below zero or the minus levels, which means that the state has administered more doses than what it received from the manufacturers.  According to the officials, each vial contains an extra dose to overcome various factors such as vial overfill volume, syringe dead space, the degree of expertise in withdrawing the accurate dose, etc. Andhra Pradesh has so far saved about 25 lakh vaccines by conducting the drives in an efficient manner. The training programmes on the mass immunisation programme also helped the state to take the vaccine wastage to negative levels from 11% in March.  The initial vaccine hesitancy, low turnout, logistical challenges, and the then local body polls were said to be the reason for the increased quantum of vaccine doses going waste in the first weeks. The vaccine wastage in the beginning was also partly attributed to opening the vials, the quantity of which would be sufficient to vaccinate 10 or 20 people based on the brand, for even one or two recipients turned up at the vaccination sites.  State administered about 6.88 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses as of 6 pm on Wednesday. Covishield accounts for nearly 86% of the total doses given to the beneficiaries in the state, while Covaxin makes up for the remanding doses. Only some 63,000 doses of Sputnik-V have been given to the beneficiaries. The Russian vaccine was procured by only private hospitals in the state, while the government vaccination sites administered either Covaxin or Covishield. Amid the Omicron fears, the state has now focussed on vaccinating all the beneficiaries with two doses by January-end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-saves-25l-vaccine-doses-wastage-drops-to-below-zero/articleshow/88577704.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Nashik||Deolali Camp cops nab man posing as Major after military intelligence alert||Nashik/Pune: Acting on an input provided by the Army Southern Command’s military intelligence (MI) unit in Pune, the Deolali Camp police in Nashik on Tuesday night arrested a man who was found posing as an army Major and scouting for aspirants by promising them jobs for money.The Deolali Camp police have booked the 26-year-old suspect on charges of cheating, forgery and other sections of the IPC and the Official Secrets Act, 1923.The MI officials had passed on information to the police about agents approaching job aspirants and seeking money to get them jobs during the ongoing recruitment rally at the Artillery Centre in Nashik.The police arrested one Ganesh Walu Pawar, a resident of Harsul in Chandwa tehsil of Nashik district, and recovered fake army uniforms and documents from his possession.Army Subedar Rachappa Lingappa Banram has registered a complaint against Pawar with the Deolali police. According to Rachappa’s statement given to the police, on Tuesday morning, he got the information that an imposter was traveling in an SUV bearing registration number MH 15 GX 4888. “When the vehicle reached the MH gate, we stopped it and asked for an identity card, which Pawar did not show. He said that he is currently posted with the army unit in Haryana. We checked with the unit concerned and found that he had given us false information. Subsequently, we alerted the military police and the local police and he was arrested,” the statement said.“Upon interrogation, we found that the driver with whom he was traveling in the vehicle was also a job aspirant. He had taken Rs 3 lakh from him,” added the statement.During the search, the Army and police officials have recovered forged documents like character certificate, service certificate, and even Form 16, a certificate of deduction of tax at source, identifying him as an officer, making use of fake seals, and letterheads.A preliminary probe revealed that he had taken a loan from a bank in Nashik by using his fake credentials, an official said.Inspector Kundan Jadhav of Deolali Camp police station said, “Pawar was produced before a court and has been remanded in two-day police custody. Pawar has taken money from job aspirants on the pretext of giving them jobs in the Army. With his fake uniform of Major rank, he was possibly going around in cantonment area trying to cheat people.”— With inputs from Santosh Sonawane||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/deolali-camp-cops-nab-man-posing-as-major-after-military-intelligence-alert/articleshow/88577715.cms||---

Nand Lal Sharma, chairman and managing director, SJVN, held a meeting with deputy chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh Chowna Mein in New Delhi on Wednesday to discuss the roadmap for development of hydro electric projects in Arunachal Pradesh.The projects, namely Etalin HEP (3,097 MW), Attunli HEP (680 MW), Emini HEP (500 MW), Amulin HEP (420 MW) and Mihumdon HEP (400 MW) are located in the Dibang Basin of Arunachal Pradesh. The SJVN chairman and managing director said he has always been advocating the concept of integrated river basin development approach, wherein allocation of hydro projects in one single river basin to one developer would enable optimum utilization of manpower, infrastructure and financial resources. He expressed satisfaction this novel concept has been accepted by Government of Arunachal Pradesh in allocation of these projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/sjvn-bags-projects-in-arunachal/articleshow/88577717.cms||---
---||Patna||Patna’s air quality improves to ‘moderate’ category after rain||Patna: Scattered rainfall and wind gusts brought down the pollution level in the state capital significantly on Wednesday. The overall air quality index (AQI) level of Patna, which remained in the “poor” and “very poor” zone for more than a month, improved to “moderate” category on Wednesday.According to the daily bulletin of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Patna recorded the AQI level at 159 at 4pm, 93 notches lower than previous day. On Tuesday, the AQI level in the city was recorded at 252. In December, the city has experienced 16 “poor” days, 12 “very poor” days and only one “moderate” day as far as AQI is concerned.The overall AQI of Patna was based on the readings of six continuous ambient air quality monitoring centres, including planetarium (179), Patna City (123), S K Memorial Hall (154), BIT-Mesra (133) and Eco Park (208). The most prominent pollutants in these areas were PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns) and PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 microns).An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor” and 401 and 500 “severe”. A ‘moderate’ AQI essentially means that air quality is acceptable. However, pollution in this range may pose a moderate health concern for a very small number of individuals.The Air Quality Early Warning System of the ministry of earth sciences, however, predicted that the coming two days will again see a spike in pollutant levels due to meteorological conditions, including decline in minimum temperature and moisture incursion. Ashok Ghosh, chairman of Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), said the improvement in AQI level of Patna was temporary as it occurred only due unseasonal rain and rise in wind velocity. “The temperature will dip once the skies become clear and the city will experience foggy days which may increase the pollution level,” he added.On Tuesday, the PM2.5 concentration was at 114 micrograms per cubic metre and PM10 was at 237. The concentration of PM2.5 level came down to 69 micrograms per cubic metre and PM10 to 135 on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patnas-air-quality-improves-to-moderate-category-after-rain/articleshow/88577719.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Goa||Mhadei sanctuary road gets ‘nod’ amid concerns||Keri: Health minister and Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane had recently given the go-ahead for construction of a road linking Satre in Sattari to Parwad in Karnataka. It was a long-standing demand of villagers from Satre and Parwad, who said the road would help strengthen socio-economic and cultural ties. However, as the road will run through dense and untouched forest patches, the move has worried ecologists.Presently, only an old route passing through the forests of the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary exists.The Nagargao sarpanch had recently visited Parwad and inspected the existing road passing through the forest. He had said that a new road would reduce travel distance by 20km for Satre villagers to reach Belgavi.“The road will shorten the distance to Kankumbi. During the Portuguese rule, the road was used by villagers coming to the weekly Friday market in Kankumbi,” sarpanch Prashant Marathe said.Parwad deputy sarpanch Bhikaji Gavade said, “Our villagers want this road to be completed as it will strengthen the socio-cultural ties with Sattari.”However, environmentalists have expressed apprehensions over the move. They have pointed out that this stretch had recently experienced a landslide at Satre, destroying a major portion of the old route passing through the jungle.Animal Rescue Squad, Bicholim, president Amrutsingh said, “The proposed road passes through the core area of the natural habitat of the tiger and of other wild animals. Already, the road via Chorla Ghat exists and no new road is required.”Additional principal chief conservator of forests Santosh Kumar said they have not yet received any such proposal. “The area falls in the Mhadei wildlife sanctuary and clearance from the National Board for Wildlife of India is necessary in the case of any such proposal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mhadei-sanctuary-road-gets-nod-amid-concerns/articleshow/88577723.cms||---
---||Goa||South Goa PDA accepts Rs 15.5 lakh bid for wholesale fish market sopo collection||PANAJI: The South Goa Planning and Development Authority (SGPDA) met on Wednesday where the board members appointed a contractor to collect ‘sopo’ from the wholesale fish market. SGPDA chairperson Wilfred ‘Babashan’ D’Sa told reporters that Milagres Fernandes has been asked to collect sopo from the fish market wholesale vendors till a fresh sopo collection contract is finalised. D’Sa also stated that the tender for sopo collection is expected to be issued by mid-January. “The fish market sopo vendors have now approached the court and offered to pay us. The highest bid received was Rs 15.5 lakh. We had got two bids before the meeting and have awarded the contract to Milagres Fernandes to continue sopo collection till the tender process is completed,” said D’Sa. The SGPDA did not issue a tender for selection of the sopo collection contractor. “By January we will be able to float the tender for a new sopo contractor. Seventy per cent of the process has been completed. We intend to float the tender for the purpose by January 18, but if there is some delay from the PWD, this may get delayed too,” said D’Sa. An application from a sopo contractor offering Rs 17 lakh to the SGPDA was rejected because it reached late, he said. “We went with the agenda, and when the agenda was prepared, there were only 2 applications,” the Nuvem MLA said. He also said that two sub-committees have been appointed for the Margao ODP and the Ponda ODP, with two members each. “The Ponda and Margao ODPs were kept open for 60 days for objections and suggestions and the 60 days period got over on December 28. We now have to appoint a two-member sub-committee, which is why a meeting was called on Wednesday,” said D’Sa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/south-goa-pda-accepts-rs-15-5-lakh-bid-for-wholesale-fish-market-sopo-collection/articleshow/88577725.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa finally submits coastal plan to Centre||PANAJI: Ahead of the December 31, 2021 deadline that was set for Goa by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the state finally submitted its final draft of Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) to the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC). Once the ministry gives its nod, the plan is set to be notified and Goa will get its first coastal plan. A CZMP is crucial for issuing permissions under Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules to various activities along the coast. Goa has been functioning without such a plan so far. “The plan was couriered by air to the Union environment ministry and our representative confirmed submission of the CZMP to the ministry. Officials from Goa will thereafter be summoned for any discussions that may be required. We will be told of any corrections needed. Once the coastal plan is approved, it can be notified,” said member secretary of the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA), Dashrath Redkar. In October, wary of repeated delays by Goa to finalise its CZMP, the NGT had set December 31 as the final deadline for the state. The tribunal had, however, said that if Goa failed to meet the new deadline, as a penalty, the state secretary concerned will not be paid a salary from January 2022 till the time the default continues. The tribunal had been first approached in the year 2015 over claims that there is rampant degradation of coastal stretches in the country, which led the NGT to ask the Union environment ministry to file an affidavit explaining why the CZMP for different states has not been finalised. The tribunal had also issued notices to a total of 13 defaulting coastal states and Union Territories. While a deadline of April 30, 2018 was set for different states to complete their coastal plans, the time was extended by the NGT twice since then. On expiry of these deadlines, Goa asked for further extensions, stating that the delay was at the end of the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management, Chennai, which was tasked with drawing the plan. In August 2021, Goa sought its fourth extension in deadline. The state’s request for six months’ extension till February 28, 2022, was turned down by the Tribunal. The state government had asked for the latest extension stating that it will require time to consider the objections received from public on the draft CZMP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-finally-submitscoastal-plan-to-centre/articleshow/88577727.cms||---

More number of women self-help groups (WSHG) than last year have been deployed in the work this year.Altogether 102 WSHGs with over 1,000 workers - the highest in the state - have been engaged in the procurement activities. Last year, 64 WSHGs had worked in the procurement process in the state.“Last year, they had done well in procuring crops across the district. Considering their past experience, we have engaged more WSHGs this time in the procurement process,” said Ganjam collector Vijay Amruta Kulange, who has initiated the process of procurement at Pochilima, Hinjili block.“We have imparted a three-round training to the WSHG members, engaged in the procurement activities. They will verify the quality of the paddy and procure from farmers and disburse to millers,” said deputy register of the cooperative society Biswa Ranjan Das. The SHGs will get a commission of Rs 32.25 per quintal for the work, sources said.Besides the WSHGs, 383 primary agriculture cooperative societies and one pani panchayat have also been engaged in the procurement process, added Das. After verification, 1.22 lakh farmers across the district have shown interest to supply the paddy.“The government has set a target of 36.04 lakh quintals to procure from the farmers in the first phase. Last year, they had procured over 45 lakh quintals of paddy. The government was likely to increase the target,” said chief civil supply officer Pusha Munda.They have targeted to open 470 mandis (procurement centres) across the district to facilitate the farmers. On the first day, they have opened at least one such centre in each block, added Munda.Meanwhile, the farmers’ organisations have demanded the quality norms of the paddy to be relaxed this time as farmers across the district suffered due to unseasonal rains in the first week of December. “The harvested paddy in some areas has become discoloured due to waterlogging followed by rain. We want the government to procure the entire paddy from the farmers, irrespective of its quality,” said Simanchal Nahak, secretary, Rushikulya Rait Maha Sabha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/102-women-shgs-start-paddy-procurement-in-ganjam-dist/articleshow/88577608.cms||---
---||Kochi||Woman’s charred body found in Ernakulam||KOCHI: Ernakulam rural police team, probing the incident in which a charred body of a young woman was found in her house in North Paravur on Tuesday, is yet to reach a conclusion due to lack of enough evidence to confirm whether it was an accidental death or murder. The victim was identified as Vismaya (25) by her parents with the help of a locket she wore on her chain, which was found on the body. However, the police have sent the samples from the body for DNA test for reconfirmation as the charred body was difficult to be identified. Moreover, the victim’s 22-year-old sister Jithu is missing and the police are yet to solve the mystery behind her disappearance. Also, bloodstain was found at the house and a detailed analysis is needed. The charred body was found inside the room on Tuesday afternoon after neighbours alerted the police and fire and rescue team when they saw fire emanating from the house at Peruvaram. The victim’s parents were not at home at that time, and when they had left Vismaya and Jithu were at home. The police initially registered a case of unnatural death. But as the younger sister disappeared since the incident, they suspected foul play and launched a probe. The missing woman suffered from mental health issues and had gone missing twice earlier, said police. The police had found her both times and lodged her in a shelter home after being produced before the magistrate. The parents later brought her back home. Whenever the parents went out, they would tie her up or lock her in a room. She was confined to the house on Tuesday too, said police. Vismaya disapproved of Jithu’s alleged love affair and they would often quarrel over it, said police sources. The police suspect that the younger sister has a connection with Vismaya’s death. “The medical reports said there were no external injuries on the body or any sign of assault. It suggests that she was charred to death. But there was a smell of kerosene at the crime scene and there were bloodstains. We can reach a conclusion only after finding the missing girl,” said a police officer. Jithu might have scaled the house boundary wall as the gate remained locked, said police. A CCTV footage of the missing girl walking along the road on Tuesday afternoon was found from the nearby areas. K Karthick, district police chief (Ernakulam rural), visited the crime scene on Wednesday and reviewed the investigation progress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/womans-charred-body-found-in-ekm/articleshow/88577730.cms||---

Bamu registrar Jaishree Suryawanshi said the local civic body has given permission for axing of trees, which were obstructing the site of the proposed statue. “We have also paid required amount of money towards the civic authorities. Only four trees are planned to be cut,” she said.Honorary wildlife warden Kishor Pathak questioned the permission. “The local tree authority stands dissolved as the term of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has got expired around two years ago. How can an authority, which is no more in place, grant permission for tree cutting,” he reasoned. Pathak, who himself was the member of local Tree Authority when it was existing in recent past, said sufficient amount of trees must be planted by the university as per norms to make up for the latest loss of around four trees. AMC garden superintendent Vijay Patil could not be reached for his comments as he was on leave. Notably, the statue was earlier to come up at the botanical garden of Bamu, but its location was shifted in front of the main building, following growing pressure from different sections that were apprehensive about ecological loss at garden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/tree-cutting-at-bamu-stokes-controversy/articleshow/88577732.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Power theft of Rs 83 lakh exposed in 3 districts of Marathwada||AURANGABAD: In a latest crackdown, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has exposed power thefts worth Rs 83 lakh from Jalna, Beed and Parbhani districts. MSEDCL deputy chief public relations officer for Aurangabad division Sunil Jadhav said a total of 146 cases of power theft by different consumers have been detected in the these areas. “The state power utility has invoked legal action against the errant consumers that include hotels, road-side dhabas, businessmen, industries and even some hospitals. All consumers, in general, are warned that the crackdown against power theft would continue and no one should draw power in an unauthorized manner,” he said. As per the Electricity Act, 2003, in case of detection of Unauthorized Use of Energy (UUE), tariff equal to twice the tariff applicable for the relevant category is recovered if the MSEDCL officials reach to the conclusion that unauthorised use of electricity has taken place. Also, section 135 of the Act stipulates initiating police action among other stern actions. Parts of Marathwada are vulnerable to power theft which in the past had made the region the first choice for load-shedding as and when power crisis occurred in the state. “The unethical ways of drawing power are illegal as well as highly unsafe. The use of metal-hooks for drawing power directly from overhead cables can lead to fatal electrocution. The tampering of meter is also highly unsafe as the device has direct supply of power from the pole,” Jadhav said. Besides power theft, the MSEDCL has also unearthed 32 cases in which irregularities were found in regard to payment of bills and corrective measures have been ordered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/power-theft-of-83l-exposed-in-3-districts-of-marathwada/articleshow/88577733.cms||---

---||Lucknow||BJP-SP campaign war to peak with Yogi Adityanath’s rally in Azam bastion||Lucknow: The political battle between BJP and Samajwadi Party is set to touch a fresh tipping point in the New Year with the saffron party lining up a public rally of CM Yogi Adityanath in Rampur, the bastion of SP MP and party’s Muslim face Azam Khan, on January 1. BJP sources said Yogi will reach Rampur which has been planned as the culmination point of the party’s Jan Vishwas Yatra in west UP region. Union minister of road transport & highways Nitin Gadkari had flagged off the Jan Vishwas Yatra in west UP from Bijnor on December 19. Yogi’s rally has been planned in Rathaunda locality of Bilaspur assembly seat which is represented by UP’s minister of state (Jal Shakti), Baldev Singh Olakh. The rally ground is close to a ‘Shivalaya’ revered by Hindus in the district. CM’s presence in Rampur coincides with BJP’s intensifying its onslaught on SP which has been emerging as the most potent rival to it in the upcoming elections. In the 2017 elections, BJP had won two — Bilaspur and Milak (reserved) — of the five assembly seats in the district, while the SP won Chamraua, Suar and Rampur segments. BJP’s Rampur district president Abhay Gupta told TOI on Wednesday that the Jan Vishwas Yatra will pass through Chamraua and Milak, after which Yogi will address a rally in Bilaspur. He said party workers from all 2,058 booths in the district have been asked to galvanize maximum people for participating in the Yatra and CM’s public rally. Azam, who represents Rampur in the Lok Sabha, has been languishing in Sitapur jail since February 2020 on charges of land grabbing and using a fake birth certificate of his son Abdullah Azam who won the Suar assembly seat in 2017 elections. Abdullah’s election was challenged by BSP’s Nawab Kazim Ali who alleged that Abdullah was born in 1993 instead of 1990 mentioned in his poll affidavit, thus making him ineligible for contesting 2017 UP assembly polls. Abdullah had earlier been accused of possessing two PAN cards as well. In February 2020, he was disqualified from the UP assembly with effect from December 16, 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-sp-campaign-war-to-peak-with-yogis-rally-in-azam-bastion/articleshow/88577735.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Business||Apple pulls up Indian iPhone maker Foxconn for lapses||Chennai: Tech giant Apple said on Wednesday that it has placed its key supplier in India – Foxconn’s Sriperumbudur facility near Chennai – “on probation” after improper working conditions in the facility came to light as some employees suffered food poisoning at the hostel managed by the firm. Apple is monitoring the situation and will ensure standards are met before the facility reopens, it added. While Apple did not specify what probation meant, sources said the company would likely stop offering new business temporarily to the Taiwanese electronic maker’s facility that assembles iPhone 12 and iPhone 13. “We hold our suppliers accountable to the highest standards in the industry, and regularly conduct assessments to ensure compliance. Following recent concerns about food safety and accommodation conditions at Foxconn Sriperumbudur, we dispatched independent auditors to undertake additional detailed assessments. We found that some of the remote dormitory accommodations and dining rooms being used for employees do not meet our requirements, and we are working with the supplier to ensure a comprehensive set of corrective actions are rapidly implemented,” an Apple spokesperson said. Foxconn Technology Group said on Wednesday that some of its offsite dormitory facilities in Tamil Nadu’s Sriperumbudur do not meet the required standards. The company said it is investigating the issues and restructuring the local management team. “We are very sorry for the issue our employees experienced and are taking immediate steps to enhance the facilities and services we provide at the remote dormitory accommodations,” a Foxconn spokesperson said. “All employees will continue to be paid while we make the necessary improvements before restarting our operations and we will continue to provide support for our employees as they return to work,” the spokesperson said, without specifying when production would resume. The Foxconn issue is also the second such involving an Apple supplier in India. In December 2020, contract workers at Bengaluru’s Wistron factory destroyed equipment and vehicles over alleged non-payment of wages. Apple had then put Wistron, which also makes iPhones, on probation. Earlier this month, a large number of Foxconn India employees — a majority of them women — took to the roads in protest after reports of more than 150 being hospitalised after consuming food provided at a hostel managed by the firm. The state government intervened to end the protest. Foxconn then assured the state that it will provide standard food and other quality facilities to the employees, and also said it will work to build new hostel premises spanning at a cost of Rs 570 crore to accommodate about 18,750 employees. Labour issues are not new for Foxconn, especially in China. The company was earlier in the spotlight in 2010 when harsh living and working conditions of the employees led to a spate of suicides, forcing the electronics maker to revamp operations. The incident comes at a time when India is gaining prominence as a global contract manufacturing destination post the US-China trade war. Chinese media on Wednesday used the issue to allude that there is a growing risk for foreign companies in the Indian market. This could lead to disruptions in Apple's shipment of the iPhones, the Global Times wrote, adding that Foxconn's factories in China are on a massive recruitment drive, in contrast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/apple-pulls-up-indian-iphone-maker-foxconn-for-lapses/articleshow/88575733.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Speaking to media persons, Kunhalikutty said that though UDF raised six questions about the project regarding its feasibility and environmental impact, the government has not cared to provide any answers. Meanwhile, Jamaat-e-Islami said that CPM was going ahead with the propaganda that the organisation was opposing the K-Rail project to further strengthen the party’s agenda to create communal polarization. “CPM raised the allegation that Jamaat-e-Islami was against the project even before we announced our stand. It is CPM’s latest instance of trying to further the communal polarization agenda and maintain an Islamophobic environment and to defuse opposition attacks,” said Jamaat-e-Islami state assistant ameer P Mujeeb Rahman. IUML adopting extremist stand, says Pinarayi Meanwhile, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan continued his attacks against IUML, saying that the party was trying to don the cloak of Jamaat-e-Islami and trying to adopt the extremist stand of SDPI. He was speaking at the valedictory function of CPM district meeting in Malappuram. “IUML is trying to insult and deride all those who take a secular stand and even defame those whom they held in high esteem. IUML should explain where this stand would take the party,” he said. On K-Rail project, Vijayan said that it is the government’s duty to implement a project if the state needs it. The government was able to acquire 200 hectare of the 203 hectare for NH widening in Malappuram without complaints by providing Rs 2,772 crore as compensation. “We will adopt the same method for SilverLine project too.

Naidu said the law and order situation in the state is appalling and alleged that the broad daylight recce to eliminate a former MLA highlights “reign of jungle and goonda raj in Andhra Pradesh.” He said such incidents are happening repeatedly in the state as no serious action has been taken on the unlawful and violent incidents happened earlier. He said people have been closely observing and watching the movements of the TDP leader, which exposes the failure of the police, particularly the intelligence wing. He said the government will be held responsible in the event of any harm or attack on Radhakrishna. He wanted action against the culprits after the inquiry. He emphasised the need to safeguard the fundamental rights of the people from anti-social elements. Meanwhile, Radhakrishna refused to accept the security offered by the state government. He said his followers would be able to protect him from the rivals and he does not require protection from the government. His refusal to accept the government security comes even after minister for civil supplies Kodali Sri Venkateswara Rao (Nani) and Gannavaram MLA Vallabhaneni Vamsi Mohan held talks with him. The two leaders, though in the ruling YSRC, have been good friends of Radhakrishna for years and said to have common business interests too.

The central bank’s clarification comes in the wake of the February 2021 Supreme Court order, which said that any sale or gift of property by a foreigner without prior permission from the RBI would be invalid. The order had quoted Section 31 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973. The court was dealing with a property that was transferred by the widow of a foreigner and owner without obtaining prior permission of the RBI. The apex court had set aside a Karnataka high court order. “The concerned Supreme Court judgment dated February 26, 2021 in Civil Appeal 9546 of 2010 was related to provisions of FERA, 1973, which has been repealed under Section 49 of FEMA, 1999,” said the RBI in a press release. “At present, NRIs/OCIs are governed by provisions of FEMA 1999 and do not require prior approval of the RBI for acquisition and transfer of immovable property in India, other than agricultural land/farm house/plantation property,” the central bank said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-approval-not-needed-for-property-deals-by-nris/articleshow/88576117.cms||---
---||Business||LIC flaunts e-initiatives for global investors||MUMBAI: Top officials of LIC have been busy giving presentations to global and frontline domestic investors on how it’s moving ahead to transform into a digital-driven insurer. The presentations have been made with the aid of merchant bankers during initial meetings in the run-up to the insurance giant’s record-breaking IPO planned for next year. LIC officials have told investors that it has spent about Rs 565 crore since it started investing heavily on digital transformation initiatives three years ago. As a result, from about 26% of its total premium collection being paid through digital channels in FY19, this number is now up at 43% — a jump of 17 percentage points. Its officials also told investors that till March 2021, LIC’s portal had nearly 53 lakh registered users. In FY21, it had registered 95% annual growth in premium paid through its app, they said. Since markets regulator Sebi bars IPO-bound companies from disclosing future projections, LIC didn’t disclose its annual targets for premium payments through the digital channels. However, sources said the share of premium paid through digital channels in overall premium payment is now near the 50% level already. The government-owned life insurance major is currently working to file its IPO prospectus with Sebi and has a timeline to complete the offering by March 2022 — that has been reiterated by several top finance ministry officials as well. At about Rs 1 lakh crore, LIC’s IPO is seen to be the largest in India’s history, much ahead of the Rs 18,300-crore that Paytm mobilised through its offering that closed in November this year. To fast-track its digital transformation initiative, LIC about 10 days ago came out with a document for consultants to express their interest to work with it to take this process forward. LIC invited “expression of interest (EoI) from bidders who provide strategy consulting services, to develop a strategy road map for digital transformation of LIC of India in line with its business strategy”. According to the timeline given in the document, LIC would finalise the consultant for this project in about three weeks. Sources said LIC is in the process of implementing a new and unique customer identification and de-duplication system. This is part of efforts to bolster its digital initiatives and will allow the life insurer to cross-sell its products more efficiently. Further, it is expected to simplify customer experience, allow for customisation of services and make the claims management system more efficient. The document published by LIC said that its proposed technology strategy will be developed with a host of objectives. These include key technology shifts for the life insurer, technology infrastructure & architecture to support digitisation processes, better integration with partners, front-end & core technology system change, design thinking-led approach, build effective practices, build a world-class analytics capability, an integrated road map and analytics capabilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lic-flaunts-e-initiatives-for-global-investors/articleshow/88576083.cms||Partha Sinha
---||Business||Economy faces headwinds from Omicron, inflation: RBI guv||MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das has said that the Indian economy faces headwinds from global developments and Omicron. Also, inflation continued to remain a concern buffeted by the build-up of cost pressures. The RBI governor’s observations are part of the financial stability report (FSR), released by the central bank on Wednesday. In the report, the RBI said that even ahead of Omicron, global growth and trade had begun to lose pace, stalled by formidable headwinds from supply disruptions and bottlenecks, logistics dysfunctions, shipping charges and port congestions as well as a shortage in key intermediates and personnel. "These forces, along with elevated commodity prices, have rendered inflationary pressures persistent across geographies, posing a serious risk to global economic prospects." The RBI also said that the government’s fiscal deficit target of 6.8% for the current financial year is likely to come under strain following the second supplementary demand of grants (Rs 3.7 lakh crore) presented in December 2021. On the positive side, there is an element of fiscal consolidation as the demand for grants includes the retirement of high-cost payment obligations relating to Air India. Despite the fiscal deficit challenge, the RBI said that it expects government borrowing to remain within projections. The report said that the IMF has indicated the likelihood of further downgrades in its projections due to the emergence of the Omicron variant, which triggered the worst ‘Black Friday’ plunge by the Dow Jones. Omicron has also led to a drop in inflows from foreign portfolio investors. “After recording net inflows of $7.6 billion during H1:2021-22, net outflows have occurred during Q3:2021-22 so far,” the report said. While the economy has expanded beyond the pre-pandemic level, the virus is adding to inequality. “The pace of the recovery remains uneven across sectors, inflation formation is being subjected to repetitive supply shocks and the outlook is overcast with global risks. Omicron haunts near-term prospects,” the RBI said in the report. On the positive side, Das observed that strong supply-side measures to contain food and energy prices are helping moderate price risks. “While the pandemic induced bouts of volatility, spillovers and heightened uncertainty are challenging, the Indian financial system has stood up well and remains well prepared to meet the funding requirements of the economy,” Das said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/eco-faces-headwinds-from-omicron-inflation-rbi-guv/articleshow/88576058.cms||---

A key — and much welcomed — change is that a personal hearing via video conferencing/ telephony will be available in all cases when the taxpayer makes such a request. Another important issue that has been addressed is that the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), or CIT(A), will draft and finalise his/her order which will be shared with the taxpayer through the National Faceless Appeals Centre (NFAC). The multi-layered process of reviews, contained in the earlier scheme, has been done away with. The old scheme had been challenged in different high courts on various grounds, including its constitutional validity. The Bombay high court is also hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Chamber of Tax Consultants (CTC). Its next hearing is slated for January 4. While several of the points raised in these lawsuits have been addressed by the revised faceless appeal scheme and will vastly help high net worth individuals (HNIs) and corporate entities who face heavy demands, a few others remain. “Under the earlier scheme, the taxpayer as a matter of right had no opportunity for an oral hearing via video conferencing. The discretion to grant such an opportunity vested with the Chief Commissioner or Director General, in charge of the Regional Faceless Appeals Centre,” CTC president Ketan Vajani said. Ved Jain, past president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), said, “The revised scheme is welcome as it has addressed the main grievance of the taxpayer. Now, an oral hearing via video conferencing can be claimed by the taxpayer as a matter of right.” However, the faceless appeals scheme does not talk of early hearing. The portal should enable a request for an early hearing — this is important for high pitched assessments, stated chartered accountant Anish Thacker. The earlier scheme provided for review of an order passed by one appeal unit by another appeal unit before it was finalised. If the disputed tax, penalty and interest inclusive of surcharge and cess exceeded the specified amount, it was mandatory for the NFAC to refer it to another appeal unit for review. In other cases, a risk management strategy was adopted for determining whether or not a second round of review was required. In some cases, a draft order went through the lens of three appeal units. This multi-layered process has been done away with. In addition, Jain pointed out that the power of condonation in case of delays in filing the appeal or those relating to accepting additional grounds of appeal also now rests with the CIT(A). An issue now arises. Vajani pointed out, “Though the actions taken under the old scheme have been saved, the fact that the old scheme had to be replaced by a substantially different scheme may raise doubts on the orders passed under the old scheme.” Some other issues raised in the PIL, like penalty for non-compliance of a notice issued by the NFAC and requirement to produce additional evidence at the request of the I-T department, have not been addressed in the revised scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/faceless-tax-appeals-to-have-video-hearings/articleshow/88576071.cms||Lubna Kably

However, the stress already in their books is likely to keep profitability under check for FY22. “The disruptions caused by the second wave impacted the growth of the industry in H1FY22 as the movement of people was greatly hindered and entities focused on collections instead of disbursements. The pandemic-induced disruptions moderated the portfolio growth to around 5% (annualised) in H1FY22 as compared to growth of 9% in FY21. Nevertheless, favourable factors provide hope for better growth prospects in FY22 with an estimated growth rate of 12-15%,” said ICRA VP & sector head (financial ratings) Sachin Sachdeva. Stress in MFI books rose sharply in H1FY22 because of the localised lockdowns, which impacted borrowers’ cash flows. With the gradual opening of the economy, microfinance activities resumed in Q2FY22 and collections also bounced back to March 2021 level. Despite improvement in collections, delinquencies rose with the 90+ days past due (dpd) at 6.2% as of September 30, 2021, compared to 5.3% as of March 31. The delinquencies had risen significantly in May-June. However, restructuring helped bring them down by September 30, by when the industry had around 10% of its loan book restructured. What has also helped the MFIs are the various steps undertaken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government, including liquidity-enhancement measures and the introduction of guarantee schemes for the stressed MFIs. “Notwithstanding the expected improvement in business during H2FY22, the persisting asset quality pressures would keep the credit costs elevated and consequently the profitability subdued in FY22,” said Sachdeva.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/micro-fin-kitty-back-at-march-level/articleshow/88576032.cms||---

The CEC stressed on proper mapping of vulnerable sections, monitoring change in criticality as compared to last election, paying heed to political parties’ complaints, being impartial, bringing innovative ideas to increase electoral participation, and most importantly ensuring strict adherence to Covid protocol and vaccination of all staff deployed on election duty, said sources. “Each district officer showed a presentation on preparedness and important factors like proximity to international or interstate border, infrastructure and other vital things,” said an officer seeking anonymity. ECI emphasised on proper mapping of vulnerabilities to ensure fair elections. We were asked to take care of voters who might face problems due to political, caste, and communal conflicts. We have also been told to monitor influential and ‘bahubali’ candidates. We were told to ensure that our actions are based on facts, past records and not on perception,” said an officer. Another officer said, “ECI said that all complaints of political parties should be handled impartially, leaving no scope for any allegation against the commission and authorities from them.” “ECI asked us to think of innovative ways to bring electors to polling booths and increase voting by women and those from marginalised sections,” he added. Concerned over the pandemic, the ECI instructed all officers to ensure that staff deputed on election duty is fully vaccinated. “Covid protocols have to be followed strictly as there is fear of a third wave of coronavirus. It is likely that we have more polling booths to ensure social distancing to prevent further spread of infection,” said another officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/eci-mulls-more-booths-bats-for-strict-covid-norms-in-polls/articleshow/88576778.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The party, which opposed Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, found nothing wrong with K-Rail plan in Kerala, where the party is in power, he said. In a Facebook post, he said CPM, which opposed the bullet train project and branded it as anti-poor, had no qualms in supporting a similar project pushed by CPM politburo member and CM Pinarayi Vijayan. Things are very different for CPM in Kerala. There is no discussion, no study and no answer to questions here, he wrote. “We will commission the project and run it successfully. We are against capitalism, but will hold the hands of monopoly. We are dead against globalisation, but will take loan from international behemoths. We are with the people, but will drive them away from their narrow strip of land. We stand for freedom and democracy, but we will brand those who tell a different opinion as terrorists. This is how CPM responds in Kerala. Is it the Malayalam translation of dialectical materialism?” he asked. Satheesan ridiculed CPM’s leadership by sharing the tweets of CPM and general secretary Sitaram Yechury against the bullet train project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-has-double-standards-oppn/articleshow/88575651.cms||---

Both vehicles had tried to overtake at the same time, bringing them in the middle of the long straight stretch, leading to the head-on collision. The accident happened around 4.30am as the family of three was going to Secunderabad Railway Station to catch a train to Bellampalli. The bus was coming from Ramgopalpet and heading towards Nampally. Gandhi Nagar police said that the incident took place near ‘Love Hyderabad’ structure on the Tank Bund. None in the bus suffered any injuries. While 3-year-old Sree died on the spot, her grievously injured parents, D Shiva Kumar and Samanyha, and cab driver Koushik are in hospital. The three were admitted to Gandhi Hospital, but the couple was later shifted to a private hospital. Shiva Kumar, a manager in a construction firm, was seated next to the driver and holding his daughter in his lap, cops said. “Kumar’s family were supposed to board a train to reach Bellampalli in Mancherial,” a cop said. Police registered a case under IPC Sec 304 A (negligence causing death).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/car-bus-collide-in-overtaking-bid-on-tank-bund-3-year-old-killed/articleshow/88575646.cms||---

K Surender, the special counsel for the probe agency, told this to Justice Ujjal Bhuyan while arguing against any relief for retired IAS officer BP Acharya who was made an accused in the Lepakshi Knowledge Hub part of the quid pro quo case. The CBI counsel was responding to the plea of Acharya who questioned the trial court’s decision that took into cognisance the role he played in the case. “The Centre had already given us the sanction order. As far as the review plea filed by Acharya against the sanction, he did not get any favourable order in that and the issue is pending with the Centre,” the CBI counsel said. Refuting the allegation that it is wrong to take the cognisance under the old Prevention of Corruption Act when the Centre has amended it recently, the CBI counsel said that the amendment is not applicable to the incidents that took place in the past. “CBI court was right in passing the cognisance order against Acharya and hence his plea deserves to be dismissed,” he said.  The case was posted to Jan 3 for hearing Acharya’s argument in Hetero case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centres-consent-aloneneeded-to-try-acharya/articleshow/88575648.cms||---

---||Chennai||Crypto bourses can’t get cover for cyber risks||CHENNAI: In the absence of regulation, cryptocurrency exchanges in India are not being able to get insurance protection against cyber risks like ransomware attacks and business interruption. This is primarily because the RBI, which places a higher risk for the insurance underwriter, does not recognise cryptocurrencies. A senior executive at Future Generali India Insurance said that insured loss can be settled only in rupee and dollar — the currencies in which cyber insurance claims are settled. Insurers said that they can come up with a definition of insured loss for this segment only after a law on cryptocurrency is introduced. In ransomware attacks, hackers typically demand ransom in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Insurers pay out 50-60% of the premium they collect through cyber risks as claims. “There is no insurance underwriter who has a product to cover our risks — cyber theft or ransomware attacks — in this country. With the lack of any clear regulation to acknowledge cryptocurrency trading exchanges, insurers do not want to cover us. If an exchange loses large sum against ransomware theft, it has to bear the loss,” said Nischal Shetty, CEO of WazirX, a crypto bourse. Most exchanges are international companies with much higher exposure to risk, a non-life general insurance company exectuve said. Insurers have placed crypto exchanges under the decline list or those businesses that are excluded from coverage, another insurer said. Sharan Nair, chief business officer at CoinSwitch Kuber, a crypto exchange, said, “There is no insurance cover in India to cover us from the consequences of cyberattacks. Even those covers offered abroad are inadequate and cannot provide coverage to the entire crypto assets that exchanges hold.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/crypto-bourses-cant-get-cover-for-cyber-risks/articleshow/88577762.cms||Mamtha Asokan

While there will be one recharging station for every 5 km in the city, one station for every 27 kilometres will be set up on national highways. “Guidelines are being prepared for setting up 600 charging stations in the state in addition to 138 stations by the Telangana State Renewable Energy Development Corporation (TSERDCO). Tenders will be floated soon,” TSREDCO vice-chairman and managing director N Janaiah said. Private land owners and entrepreneurs can jointly set up recharging station on revenue sharing basis and the state government would help them, he said. TSERDCO has already started setting up 138 recharging stations, including 118 in Hyderabad and 10 each in Warangal and Karimnagar. Officials said while the number of EVs in March this year were just 2,465, it rose to about 3,800 in June. In the past six months nearly 5,500 new EVs were registered with the transport department, he said, “The sudden rise in the number of EVs in six months was mainly due to spike in fuel prices in the past few months and also an EV policy was announced by the Telangana government,” a senior official of TSREDCO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-to-allow-pvtev-rechargestations/articleshow/88577763.cms||Koride Mahesh

In November, 6%-7% of scooter sales are estimated to have been electric. The surge has prompted large ICE (internal combustion engine) two-wheeler players to look at this segment even as electrics make inroads into tier-2 and -3 cities via no-frills dealerships that cost a fraction of ICE showrooms. Electric two-wheelers will comprise 8%-10% of the market (scooters and motorcycles) by 2025 at 1.5-1.8 million units, according to Rohan Kanwar Gupta, VP and sector head at ratings agency ICRA. “A higher percentage of the electric two-wheelers will be scooters — already 6-7% of scooter sales in November were electric,” he said. November, however, was not a one-off month. Greaves Cotton-owned e-scooter maker Ampere, has 4-week waitlist on its flagship model Magnus. “December is turning out to be better than October due to strong demand on two-wheeler side,” said Nagesh Basavanhalli, group CEO & MD, Greaves Cotton. “We have seen accelerated growth of electric two-wheelers in 2021, with more than 70% sales coming in the last five months of the year. Going by the recent trends, the next 12 months may see 5-6 times growth,” said Sohinder Gill, director-general, Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV). The EV (electric vehicle) pick-up comes even as scooters themselves have seen some growth this year. “Scooter sales have grown 8.9% in April-November this year. In November, the numbers were over 3 lakh units compared to 21,400 units of electric sales,” said Ravi Bhatia, president, JATO Dynamics. EV’s scooter share is much higher than its share of total two-wheelers, which is about 1.5%, added Bhatia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/electrics-make-up-7-of-scooter-sales-in-nov/articleshow/88577764.cms||---

Ahmedabad’s affordability ratio was at 23% in 2020. As against this, the ratio stood high at 46% in 2010.The real estate consultant’s index captures movement in key constituents like property prices, home loan interest rate and average household income to determine the buyers’ ability to purchase a house.“Ahmedabad has emerged as the most affordable city in our index mainly on account of relatively lower residential property prices compared to other major cities. Strong transit-oriented infrastructure and abundant land availability in the city have ensured that housing prices in the city remain affordable for homebuyers,” said Vivek Rathi, director-research at Knight Frank India.“Besides,development of housing supply in peripheral residential locations and willingness to travel from these catchments to place of work have helped the affordability cause,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-indias-most-affordable-housing-market/articleshow/88577765.cms||---

People will isolate those who are trying to torpedo this project, he said. "IUML is also following the same approach. They are aiming to divide people communally and create riots," he alleged, adding that the government will take on those who are trying to start riots. UDF government had decided to implement a similar project which was more expensive. Those who did not oppose it then are opposing it now due to political reasons.

---||Patna||CJI’s remark on liquor ban hasa little injustice to it, says JD(U)||Patna: JD(U) spokesperson Ajay Alok on Wednesday said Chief Justice of India N V Ramana’s remark on liquor ban in Bihar has “a little injustice to it”.“I firmly believe that a law was passed unanimously by 243 MLAs and 75 MLCs of the Bihar assembly and it was also accepted by the governor of Bihar and the President of India. Still CJI had described it as a short-sighted decision. It is a little injustice to it,” Alok told mediapersons here.“I also believe that if legislators would do their work under the limits of the Constitution, the comment of the judiciary is not right. When it comes to pending cases, I must say that pending cases were there in the court before the implementation of the liquor ban in Bihar,” Alok said.“We should pay attention to how the hearing of the cases and their decisions would come in quick time. There is a phrase in English called justice delayed is justice denied. There are 4 lakh cases pending in the courts of the country,” he said.“If bureaucracy, judiciary and legislature comment on each other, it would create confusion in society. The Chief Justice of India is an institution which is respected by everyone in the country. If my point is wrong by any means, I am also apologising for it,” he said.“As a citizen of the country, I firmly believe that bureaucracy, judiciary and legislature should not interfere in their respective work and avoid commenting on each other,” Alok said.The CJI had said that decisions like the liquor ban in Bihar in 2016 “put a huge burden on courts”.“There are three lakh cases pending in the courts. People are waiting for justice for a long time and now the excessive cases related to liquor violations put additional burden on courts,” the CJI had said at Sidhartha Law College in Vijayawada on December 27 while putting forth his point of view during a discussion on the subject of futuristic challenges in the Indian judicial system.Ramana pointed out that every policy needs to be addressed with futuristic planning, its evaluation and constitutionality before its implementation on the ground.“The applications pertaining to bails in liquor prohibition act are submitted in large numbers in the high court. Due to short-sighted policies implemented by different governments, it is affecting the work of courts in the country. Every law needs to be discussed thoroughly and with solid points before implementation,” Ramana had said.

---||Bhubaneswar||Govt may rethink move to resume primary classes||Bhubaneswar: The Odisha government may reconsider its decision of reopening primary classes from January 3 due to surge in Covid-19 cases across the state, said director of medical education and training Rama Raman Mohanty on Wednesday.Health experts and academicians, however, said there is no need to panic as Omicron is not fatal and has less impact on children across the globe. Odisha reported 221 cases in the past 24 hours on Wednesday, while 156 cases were reported on Tuesday. The number of Omicron cases in Odisha has increased to nine on Wednesday.“The state government decided to reopen primary schools when Covid-19 cases dropped in the state. But now cases are rising again and there is also the threat of Omicron. I think the government may reconsider its decision of reopening primary classes,” Dr Mohanty said.The state government on Tuesday announced reopening primary schools for classes 1 to 5 on January 3 with standard operating procedures (SOP) in place.Senior physician Dr Niraj Mishra said, “The government need not panic and can allow children to attend school as most variants of coronavirus, including the latest Omicron, are not fatal to children.” “But parents must ask their children to strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and avoid gatherings. Even countries with high rates of Omicron, such as South Africa and UK, have not closed schools yet. Teachers must ensure that children do not touch each other or remove masks during class hours,” he added.Academicians asked when markets, malls, cinema, gym and fairs remain open, why should children be forced to stay at home. “Is it fine if adults go out and come home contracting the virus while children at home? Not attending schools has a very serious impact on children. The government should not be in a hurry to rethink the school reopening decision and let children come to school. If something goes wrong, they can always shut the schools again,” said Pritish Acharya, an academician.Parents remain divided over whether to send their children to school or wait till the third wave subsides. “A day after experts said Odisha will face a third wave by February end, the government's announcement to reopen schools is really shocking as well as confusing. I don’t think it will be wise to send children to school when everywhere there is an alert of increased Covid-19 cases once again. Omicron may not be fatal, but why get infected in the first place?” asked Saswati Mishra, a parent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/govt-may-rethink-move-to-resume-primary-classes/articleshow/88577776.cms||Minati Singha
---||Goa||Poet Verenkar, who brought alive pain & suffering, wins Sahitya Akademi award||Margao: Sanjiv Verenkar plunged into the world of Konkani literature in 1978 and has been serving the language for over four decades since. On Thursday morning, when he got a call from Sahitya Akademi informing him about the prestigious award he has won for his poetry collection, he wasn’t a bit overwhelmed. “It was a nice feeling, no doubt, just the way one feels when something pleasant happens. The news came in when I was least expecting it,” Verenkar told TOI. Verenkar won the Sahitya Akademi award 2021 in Konkani for his collection of poems ‘Raktachandan’. The annual Sahitya Akademi awards 2021 in 20 languages were announced on Thursday. In Konkani, apart from Verenkar, Shraddha Garad bagged the Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puraskar award for her collection of poems 'Kavya Parmal', while Sumedha Kamat Desai won Bal Sahitya Puraskar 2021 (children's literature) award for her short novel 'Sumiche Cottangree’. Dessai has written extensively in both Konkani and Marathi, and has several books to her credit. She has also won several awards for her work. Speaking about his award-winning work, Verenkar said that the title of his poetry collection represents the way he views his literary creation. “Raktachandan is the name of an herbal ointment, blood-red in colour, and would be used as an analgesic in olden times,” he said. “The restlessness in the society inadvertently gets reflected in my poems. So I consider poetry as some sort of an analgesic ointment which when applied relieves the person of his pain to some extent and he feels good. In these times, man is suffering more from mental ailments; and I consider poetry as an antidote to it – that which gives the reader a healing effect just the way Raktachandan would by relieving pain.” Verenkar, who loves to describe himself as “a social poet,” has so far authored 17 books, nine of which are poetry collections. Some of his poems have been translated into Konkani by Prakash Thali and published in a collection, ‘Village Evening’. Noted writer and translator Mukesh Thali has this to say about Verenkar: “There is this sense of rustic feeling in Verenkar’s poems. His works evoke a string rural aroma that hits the reader instantly. This has probably come about with the maturity the poet has attained from his long literary voyage. The symbolism, similes and imagery all come alive in his poems at once. There’s no unnecessary rhetoric and the poems are easy to comprehend for a lay reader. A reader sees his pain and sorrow in the mirror of Verenkar’s poems.” In ‘Raktachandan’, Thali says, the poems have successfully conveyed Verenkar’s philosophy of life by “enlightening” the reader about ideas to handle his problems. Brewity, he says, is the hallmark of his poetry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/poet-verenkar-who-brought-alive-pain-suffering-wins-sahitya-akademi-award/articleshow/88601113.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

The EC meeting was convened by Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia to revise budgetary allocations for various purposes after taking stock of the expenditure by the LMC during the current financial year so far. The Mayor said she had received a number of complaints regarding poor lighting arrangements on city streets from people and corporators during the ‘Lok Mangal Diwas’. In many areas, power supply to street lights was snapped due to non-payment of dues. “Besides maintenance of existing facilities, each of the 110 wards in the city will get at least 40 additional streetlights,” Bhatia said. Other decisions included hike in fuel expenditure budget from Rs 45 crore to Rs 47 crore in view of 110 additional tipper trucks, Rs 1.5 crore for the statue of Lord Laxman, and Rs 20 lakh for ‘Sabhizade Park’, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lmc-hikes-budget-to-spruce-up-streetlight-facility-in-city/articleshow/88576795.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Cyber crooks stole Rs 9 cr from Vizagites this year||Visakhapatnam: In a major shift in conduct of thefts, fraudsters have made more money by sneaking into the accounts of Vizagites than striking at their houses. With technology becoming the silver lining during the Covid-19 pandemic as personal interactions and businesses moved online, cyber crooks stole over Rs 9.24 crore from Vizagites by duping them using various methods this year. Though the cybercrime cases slightly decreased by over 13 per cent in Vizag city in 2021 compared to 2020, the property loss is more than 50 per cent this year compared to last year. A total of 307 cybercrimes were registered in Vizag city in 2021 while it was 354 in 2020. Cyber fraudsters looted Rs 6.13 crore in 2020.  Of the total 307 cybercrimes, 104 cases relate to part time job, OLX and loan frauds. Inspector of cybercrimes police station, Vizag, RVRK Choudhary, said taking advantage of the pandemic situation, cybercrooks came up with innovative ideas to dupe the people through part-time job offers, ‘earn more money from home’ and a few other false promises.  Property lost in offline offences have come down in Vizag city. But cases of property loss in online frauds have been increasing. “The whopping amount that was siphoned off by online crooks indicates that that police will have to deal with different types of crimes in the coming days,” the police added.  Police said apart from job and loan frauds, 45 cases relating to One-Time-Password (OTP), 30 cases relating to Nigerian frauds (lottery and matrimonial frauds) and 32 cases of social media abuse were reported in Vizag city in 2021. Due to the Covid-19 situation, the police couldn’t visit other states as part of investigations into cybercrimes. Police managed to arrest only 21 accused in 18 cases in 2021.  Underscoring that awareness is the only tool to escape cyber fraud, RVRK Choudhary advised that no matter whoever calls you, never disclose your confidential information and don’t make insecure transfer of money online. He said scammers also use fake apps to steal money from people. Sometimes, crooks ask smartphone users to download an application that gives them remote access to their mobile phone and steal money. So, people shouldn’t download any mirror apps,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cyber-crooks-stole-rs-9-cr-from-vizagites-this-year/articleshow/88575667.cms||Nalla.Babu

In an emergency meeting, district magistrate Abhishek Prakash, issued directions to resume operation of Covid hospital in Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) campus in next four days.

---||Pune||Bavdhan garbage depot plan scrapped after locals protest||Pune: A garbage depot proposed in Bavdhan has been scrapped by the Pune Municipal Corporation after the local residents opposed the move. Dilip Vede-Patil, a corporator from Bavdhan, said, “Garbage from other areas was to come here and then taken to a different location for processing. This project was not feasible for more than one reason. Local people had opposed it too. The civic body carried out a site inspection, and then scrapped the proposed facility. The general body of the PMC approved the cancellation recently.” C M Joshi, a resident of Bavdhan, said the project is not going to be feasible economically. “The whole process of bringing the trash to Bavdhan and shifting again for further disposal is going to cause lot of money. It is not a financially viable solution and may lead to wastage of public money. The ramp should be built at a location which is suitable for the transport,” he added. Aba Rawat, a local resident, said, the spot in Bavdhan, where the ramp is planned, is now densely populated. “Many construction projects like schools, housing societies and business places have come up in this area. Setting up a garbage plant at the middle of this location will lead to many problems for residents,” Rawat added. The farmers, who own the land, said that it was taken for different purposes like infrastructure projects and it was then proposed to be used for dumping garbage. This change of purpose, without keeping its impact in mind, was wrong. “The civic body should not set up a garbage depot on land which we have given. We have not got any compensation for the land as yet. The land was taken from us claiming that an octroi check post will come up, then the purpose was changed to public transport. Then again a new project (garbage ramp ) was planned. There is no clarity on the exact use of our land and when will we get the compensation for it,” Dagadu Karanjawane, a farmer, who gave up his land to the PMC, said. According to civic officials, the proposal approved by the GB states that one acre of land at the site has to be reserved for a charging station. A contract with the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) has been signed for allotment of this space. Around 7,200 sqm has been given to PMPML. “The decision of doing away with the project has been taken by the elected members. The implementation of the GB’s order will be done accordingly. The civic body will find an alternative site for carrying out the garbage project,” a senior PMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bavdhan-garbage-depot-plan-scrapped-after-locals-protest/articleshow/88575702.cms||---

This is the journey of UP in the last 4.5 years, said Sharma. He said before 2017, Purvanchal was synomymous with mosquitos, clogged drains, criminal activities and power shortage. “There were hardly any medical and education faciities and mass migration defined Purvanchal. Subsequent governments ignored the negative image of Purvanchal and were least bothered. Government officers considered postings in the region as punishment,” he said. “All this has changed in 4.5 years. Today, Purvanchal is known for development and economic and social security,” the deputy chief minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/infamous-for-tamancha-up-set-to-make-brahmos-dy-cm/articleshow/88576843.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||AP move hits New Year liquor sale plans in T’s border dists||Hyderabad: Is it going to be a case of no hic, hic, hurray in the run-up to New Year, particularly in Telangana’s border districts? With neighbouring AP slashing the liquor prices, liquor shop owners in the border districts and the excise department are heading for a major dip in sales in New Year’s projections. In Khammam, Nalgonda, Suryapet and erstwhile Mahbubnagar, over 20 traders had bid for each shop during the recent auction in the hope that high liquor rates in AP will fetch them good business and healthy returns. Because of high rates in the neighbouring state, many people used to cross the border and buy liquor and in some cases, liquor was illegally transported to Krishna, Guntur, West Godavari and East Godavari in AP. “However, anticipating a drop in the sales, these districts are returning New Year’s extra stocks from depots. Now, the concern is how to stop illegal transportation of liquor from AP to Telangana and people going from here to fetch liquor at lower prices in the neighbouring state,” an excise official said. In the last two years, several shops and the excise department raked in a lot of moolah. Excise officials had even exceeded their sales targets by 35%. However, with AP reducing liquor prices on December 20 offering a discount between Rs 10 and Rs 150, sales since Christmas have decreased in Telangana border areas, particularly in Khammam district. Surprisingly, this district had the highest number of bidders (6,212 applications) for 122 shops in the recent auction. According to sources, before AP slashed the prices, the auction of liquor shops in Telangana saw a huge turnout, with some winners offering goodwill in the range of Rs Rs 1 crore Rs 2 crore in exchange for their licence. The excise department has set a target of Rs 1,000 crore in revenue in last three days of the fiscal year, but that appears unlikely in the new scenario. However, officials are confident that tipplers will have a field day and sales will zoom with pubs and bars to operate till 1 am and liquor shops till 12 midnight on December 31.  In other parts of the state, liquor is expected to see massive sales ahead of New Year, as shopkeepers have lifted Rs 482 crore worth stocks in last three days alone. The excise department earned Rs 212 crore on the last day of 2020 year, which is expected to double this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ap-move-hits-new-year-liquor-sale-plans-in-ts-border-dists/articleshow/88575736.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The facility, which is expected to come up at a special food processing zone near Gajwel, will come up at an investment of Rs 500 crore and is expected to create around 500 direct jobs. To be set up by one of Amul’s largest cooperatives – the Sabarkantha District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Ltd, more popularly known as Sabar Dairy, the facility will see the investment being poured in phases – Rs 300 crore in the first phase and Rs 200 crore in the second. The first phase will see the facility will have a capacity to process 5 lakh litres of milk per day, which will be expandable to 10 lakh litres per day later. The proposed plant will not just package fresh milk but also process value-added milk products like curd, buttermilk, lassi, yogurt, paneer and sweets, among others. Pointing out that this would be Amul’s first owned facility in south India, GCMMF general manager-marketing Manorajan Pani told TOI that it would take about a couple of years for the facility to be ready for operations starting with a 5 lakh litres per day capacity. He said plans were afoot to come up with a bakery division at the proposed facility in the second phase where products such as breads, biscuits, traditional sweets and baked snacks would be manufactured. The proposed Amul facility is also expected to provide a boost to Telangana’s local dairy industry as well as ancillary industries as Amul will procure the required milk and other raw materials from farmers as well as the various cooperatives and FPOs operating in the state. Sabar Dairy managing director Babubhai M Patel said Amul decided to set up their plant in Telangana after seeing the state’s industry-friendly policies and vibrant investment ecosystem. “We will soon deliver ‘Made in Telangana’ milk products,” he said while signing an MoU with the Telangana government in the presence of Telangana industries minister KT Rama Rao on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amul-to-set-foot-in-t-with-rs-500-crore-unit-in-gajwel/articleshow/88575739.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Cyberabad police seek RBI lens on illegal business by foreigners||HYDERABAD: Cyberabad police have urged the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to keep surveillance on foreign nationals doing illegal business after coming to India on a business visa. In a letter to the RBI in the first week of December, police had recommended several measures to curtail the illegal app-based loans and investments. “Several foreigners are coming on business visa and starting business in India. The RBI in coordination with the ministry of home affairs, ministry of corporate affairs and immigration should monitor such foreigners coming on business visa and doing illegal business here. A close watch should be maintained on these foreign nationals, their receipts, payments and financial transactions should be monitored in coordination with Financial Intelligence Unit,” Cyberabad police said. Based on the investigation findings, police made the recommendations to curtail the illegal activities of instant loan app organisers. “The app or non-banking finance company (NBFC) should be prevented from accessing any confidential personal information of customers such as his/her contacts, location, gallery, files, etc.,” police said. Prior to writing the letter, police held a meeting with RBI, officials from ministry of finance and others to share their opinion on the ways to curb the illegal activities of people behind the instant app-based loan businesses. In Cyberabad and different parts of Telangana, six persons took their lives due to harassment and shaming by call centre executives-cum-recovery agents through different means, including accessing the phone contacts of the loanee. Exorbitant interests were collected from the loanees. Cyberabad police commissioner Stephen Raveendra, who was part of the multi-departmental meeting, said chargesheets will be filed shortly in different harassment cases filed by the loanees, who were harassed during the recovery of money by shaming them as defaulters. Police said RBI should make it mandatory for every NBFC to intimate its mobile app used for facilitating loan disbursement or collection to inform the bank. The central bank should, in turn, upload the names of NBFCs and their apps concerned on its website. When an official from RBI, Hyderabad was contacted for reaction on police recommendations, the officer without disclosing any details said, “RBI will be taking necessary regulatory action as suggested by police authorities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/police-seek-rbi-lens-onillegal-biz-by-foreigners/articleshow/88575747.cms||Srinath Vudali

After opposing the TRS on paddy and unemployment issues, the state saffron unit will now target the ruling party on the power issue. The BJP claims that Telangana’s success in the power sector is solely due to the Centre’s efforts in connecting the northern and southern grids. The BJP will also organise protests against the proposed increase in power charges. “We were told to highlight the failures of the state government one by one. During the Intermediate results issue, it was we who have highlighted lapses in Telangana State Board of Intermediate,” a BJP leader said. The party leadership will now highlight the issue of hike in power tariffs. “When the state was united, there was a debate if a separate Telangana can survive power shortage if united AP was divided. TRS has continuously taken credit for uniterrupted power supply after the formation of the state. On power supply issue, we will tell people about Centre’s contribution in ensuring 24/7 power supply,” a senior leader said. According to BJP sources, two factors will help the party’s victory in the coming elections. People’s disinterest in Congress and anti-establishment sentiments towards the TRS will alter the equations in favour of the BJP, a party leader said.

Terming it as the world’s longest single cycle journey, Rajpurohit travelled with a sapling in his backpack and a national flag on his cycle, leaving people intrigued. “When I reached Charminar, many people came forward and asked me about the sapling in my backpack. That’s when I spoke to them and made them aware about my efforts towards saving the environment. I donated the saplings to few people and took an oath from them to protect it,” said Rajpurohit, who claims to have planted 91,650 saplings across Rajasthan alone and 20 per cent saplings in other states. Despite having 38 stitches in one leg and 10 per cent disability, his spirits are high. “I will be covering all the districts in Telangana during my journey. Instead of taking the highway, I will visit villages and speak to people so that they plant more saplings with me on the way,” said Rajpurohit. The ace cyclist from Barmer in Rajasthan started his journey from Kashmir in January, 2019 and has been travelling to various states ever since. In the field of wildlife protection, he has saved almost 169 deer, seven peacocks among other animals and birds. “When these wild birds or animals are found in an injured condition, I readily cooperate at my level and inform forest department officials for proper treatment in private hospitals,” said Rajpurohit, who has also placed 21 water pools at his personal expense in Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/greenman-to-cycle-his-way-into-t-hinterland/articleshow/88575756.cms||---

Shameek will receive a grant of Rs 30 lakh from SAG through the Goa Football Association. The 17-year-old defender rose through the ranks of Dempo Sports Club where he was nurtured by coach Remus Gomes. After his impressive performances, Shameek was scouted by India U-16 head coach Bibiano Fernandes. He went on to represent India in the AFC U-16 Championships and SAFF U-15 Championships from 2017.

BJP sources said Yogi will reach Rampur which has been planned as the culmination point of the party’s Jan Vishwas Yatra in west UP region. Union minister of road transport & highways Nitin Gadkari had flagged off the Jan Vishwas Yatra in west UP from Bijnor on December 19. Yogi’s rally has been planned in Rathaunda locality of Bilaspur assembly seat which is represented by UP’s minister of state (Jal Shakti), Baldev Singh Olakh. The rally ground is close to a ‘Shivalaya’ revered by Hindus in the district. CM’s presence in Rampur coincides with BJP’s intensifying its onslaught on SP which has been emerging as the most potent rival to it in the upcoming elections. In the 2017 elections, BJP had won two — Bilaspur and Milak (reserved) — of the five assembly seats in the district, while the SP won Chamraua, Suar and Rampur segments. BJP’s Rampur district president Abhay Gupta told TOI on Wednesday that the Jan Vishwas Yatra will pass through Chamraua and Milak, after which Yogi will address a rally in Bilaspur. He said party workers from all 2,058 booths in the district have been asked to galvanize maximum people for participating in the Yatra and CM’s public rally. Azam, who represents Rampur in the Lok Sabha, has been languishing in Sitapur jail since February 2020 on charges of land grabbing and using a fake birth certificate of his son Abdullah Azam who won the Suar assembly seat in 2017 elections. Abdullah’s election was challenged by BSP’s Nawab Kazim Ali who alleged that Abdullah was born in 1993 instead of 1990 mentioned in his poll affidavit, thus making him ineligible for contesting 2017 UP assembly polls. Abdullah had earlier been accused of possessing two PAN cards as well. In February 2020, he was disqualified from the UP assembly with effect from December 16, 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-sp-campaign-war-to-peak-with-yogis-rally-in-azam-bastion/articleshow/88576878.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Hyderabad||PM should accept DeMon was a total failure: Owaisi||Hyderabad: AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation move was a total failure and that PM Narendra Modi should accept this. When his attention was drawn towards seizure of over Rs 200 crore cash from a businessman in Uttar Pradesh, Owaisi said Modi should answer as to how so much of cash was found despite the demonetisation of bigger notes in 2016. The AIMIM chief demanded the government come clean on who the money belonged to.  “Modi should tell how a businessman’s house in UP gets cash worth Rs 180 crore despite demonetisation. Demonetisation was a failure as only poor people and small scale industries suffered the most and the rich still had huge cash,” he said. On BJP’s Andhra Pradesh state president Somu Veerraju announcing that the saffron party would give liquor at Rs 70 if voted to power, Owaisi said the BJP has no morals and will go to any extent to grab power. “Another BJP leader in Kerala had earlier said that beef would be given if voted to power. Why don’t the BJP leaders say they would give milk and nutrition to children. Why is BJP in so much love with liquor,” he asked. Asked about Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s comments on Malegaon blast, Owaisi lashed out at the BJP government for not filing an appeal in Malegaon, Hyderabad and Samjhauta blast cases. “Muslim youth jailed on their alleged involvement in blasts are being acquitted after seven to eight years. There is no accountability. A new law should be brought to punish all such officers who book false cases or implicate the innocent. By the time youth were released from jail, their parents had died in many cases. Then they go and cry on their parents’ graves.

The food park is slated to be the largest in UP and will come up in Greater Noida’s Sector Ecotech-10 in an area of 20acre. The expected investment in the project is Rs 500 crore and the park is likely to be ready within a year from now. “The food park will provide several opportunities to the youth and farmers of this region. Direct employment generation through the park is slated at 700, while 1,000 indirect jobs will be created. Farmers will also get a good price for their produce. The food park will have the facility to process fruits and vegetable through the most modern means and will package them for export,” said a government spokesperson. The Lulu Food Park will have a storage capacity of 20,000 tonnes for products like milk, agricultural produce and ready to eat packaged food. Most of the food items stored here will be meant for export to central Asian countries among others. Bhushan said that the Lulu Food Park will provide a major boost to local farming.  “Farmers will be able to get better price for their produce as they will be able to store their crops and sell at higher prices,” he said.

The third eye of the police will be keeping a close watch on you from the skies. With Covid cases spiking across the state, the police have decided to implement coronavirus safety guidelines strictly in the city. Police teams will be using drones in different areas on Friday evening. “The drones will keep an eye in the residential as well as commercial areas apart from the by-lanes in the old city. People can celebrate inside their home but they cannot gather in large numbers and flout Covid guidelines. The drones will capture photos if there are such gatherings,” said a senior police official.  Some of the areas including Fatehgunj, Sayajigunj, Akota and Sama Road witness huge crowds, especially the youngsters, who hang out with their friends till late night on the New Year Eve. “The drones will monitor these areas and our teams will ensure that large crowds don’t gather at any particular spot,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime).  Several teams have been formed to patrol different areas and ensure that people get back home before the 11 pm curfew. The focus will also be on nabbing people moving around in drunken state and eve-teasers. Interestingly, while in city areas restaurants and party plots will be closed by 11pm, the rural areas won’t have any such restrictions.  “Some of the city areas fall in our jurisdiction where the 11pm curfew will be implemented. In the other areas, there will be no night curfew as the state government has included only city areas in the notification. But we will enforce Covid safety rules strictly in the rural areas,” said Sudhirkumar Desai, superintendent of police, Vadodara (rural).  “Those gathering on Friday evening in rural areas will have to maintain social distance and wear face masks. Also, there will be a limit on the number of persons in these gatherings. We have formed separate teams to monitor the areas having farm-houses and party plots,” Desai added.  In Rajkot city too, police too will deploy drones to keep watch on the New Year parties, especially after the night curfew hours begin. Rajkot police commissioner Manoj Agarwal said “We have two drones that will be used to monitor crowds. The night curfew deadline will be implemented strictly and we will ensure that people follow Covid guidelines while celebrating."

---||Lucknow||Combat Omicron in new year with vax, caution & Covid protocols||LUCKNOW: As the year 2021 draws to a close amid the threat of another wave of coronavirus pandemic with the emergence of Omicron variant, health experts have warned people not to forget the death and devastation caused by the virus in the last two years and stay alert to ward off another surge. After the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020, the virus has infected almost 2.4 lakh people, leaving over 2,650 dead in Lucknow. The second wave in April-May this year was more devastating than the first witnessed from July 2020 to January 2021. More than 60% of the infections and deaths took place in the second wave when the transmission rate suddenly shot up to unimaginable levels, overwhelming hospital and healthcare facilities, not to forget the economic hardships it heaped on the people, especially migrant workers who walked hundreds of kilometres from various parts of the country to their native places in Uttar Pradesh. Former head of the microbiology department at the Institute of Medical Sciences-Banaras Hindu University (IMS-BHU), Prof Anil Kumar Gulati, said: “So far, we have seen a pattern in which cases remain low for a few months before surging all of a sudden. For the last six months, daily cases have been minimal and a substantial number of the population has been vaccinated, hence the situation is under control. But the same cannot be predicted about the future, particularly if a new variant arrives.” “Now, we have experienced almost everything. This experience can be used to tackle the third wave,” he said. Prof Manodeep Sen, a microbiologist and a faculty member at the Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) said most of the new infections being reported currently were breakthrough, that is, the vaccinated people are getting infected. “This shows that the virus is finding its way to evade the antibodies of our immune system. If breakthrough infections start happening at a large level, there is a threat of another strong mutation in the virus,” he added. “The virus undergoes mutation with every new host. As it circulates more, the mutation gets stronger. Hence, apart from the threat of Omicron variant, if cases surge exponentially, possibilities of another highly contagious mutation cannot be ruled out,” said epidemiologist Dr Amit Singh, secretary of the provincial medical services. “This is the reason why we need to exercise extra caution,” he added. Experts believe that the situation this time may not be as grave as it was in the second wave, but say that while the administration needs to step up contact tracing and make adequate arrangements for oxygen supply, intensive care beds and staff, people need to religiously follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Prof D Himanshu, medical superintendent at KGMU and in charge of the infectious disease unit, said: “Studies have shown that Omicron might evade immune response and is highly transmissible, but its severity is still not clear.” “People will have to follow Covid protocol for a long period or till the virus loses its strength. This will not only keep the Omicron threat at bay but also prevent further mutation of the virus,” he added. Dr Rahul Gam, a consultant at the National Health Authority (NHA), said vaccination was the best way to tackle the pandemic. “Even if it doesn’t protect people from contracting Covid-19, it reduces the severity. Covid restrictions should continue and people should get themselves tested as soon as influenza-like symptoms develop,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/combat-omicron-in-new-year-with-vax-caution-covid-protocols/articleshow/88576893.cms||---

He wondered why BJP state president Bandi Sanjay and Telangana in-charge Tarun Chugh sat on deeksha in BJP office to protest unemployment when their government at Centre failed to live up to its promise of giving two crore jobs to youth every year. Bandi should explain what happened to BJP’s promise of depositing 15 lakh each into the bank accounts of poor after bringing black money stashed in foreign banks.

In a letter to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Wednesday, Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy said GO 317 in its present form was doing more harm than good to the employees and teachers and demanded that the government hold consultations with the representatives of teachers and employees unions based on which new guidelines should be formed for effecting transfers. Revanth said the Telangana statehood agitation was based on the slogan of ‘neellu, nidhulu, niyamakulu’ (water, funds and jobs). The employees and teachers played an active role in the agitation with the hope that the separate state would put an end to all injustices meted out to them, especially with regard to appointments on the basis of their native district. They participated in the agitation, braving action against them by the government. However, the present allotment and transfers being made by the state government have caused mental agony to the employees and teachers as they are being subjected to huge injustice, he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-letter-to-cm-kcr-revanthdemands-repeal-of-go-317/articleshow/88575809.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Lucknow saw surge in death certificates in May-June||LUCKNOW: The number of death certificates issued in Lucknow in May and June this year was 2-5 times higher in comparison to the average figures of May and June of the preceding three years. Data from the district Civil Registration System (CRS) portal, exclusively accessed by TOI, reveals the surge. Lucknow was ravaged by the second wave of Covid-19 from April to June this year. Even after taking into account 1,436 officially recorded Covid deaths in this period as a reason for the spike, calculations show that the May-June 2021 figures are still high in comparison to the same months in the previous three years. Data also shows that the number of death certificates issued in the first six months of 2021 were almost equal to the annual figures of 2018, 2019 and 2020. The CRS portal is a place where birth and death records are uploaded by various authorities under the government to issue these certificates. According to rules, hospitals issue death certificates if a casualty takes place during treatment. Local municipal bodies issue certificates for deaths at home. The certificate is issued by the authorities of the district where a person dies, even if the deceased is the resident of another place. Officials in the health department feel that a thorough probe can reveal whether the May-June 2021 spike is because of a backlog or deaths of Covid patients at home that remained uncounted. It could even be deaths of patients who came from other districts to Lucknow for treatment. Finding out exact reasons will also help in formulation/amendment of welfare and healthcare policies for better results in the future, they add. Former chief medical officer (CMO) of Lucknow Dr SNS Yadav said that an investigation should be done to find out whether these numbers include patients who died at home or in rural areas. “The cause of death is said to be Covid-19 if a person who tested positive through RT-PCR dies within 14 days of the test,” he said. “However, there is a possibility that a person may die due to complications such as pneumonitis caused during active Covid-19 or post-Covid complication. In that case, RT-PCR test would be negative at that stage. These details need to be verified by officials,” he added. The current CMO of Lucknow, Dr Manoj Agarwal, said he could not comment on the matter as he took charge in July. However, Lucknow Municipal Corporation health officer Dr Sunil Kumar Rawat said that high numbers in May-June could be because of a backlog. “People were scared to come out of their houses. Offices for application of death certificate were closed. These factors led to high pendency, resulting in a large number of certificates being issued in May-June,” he added. “The reason behind the spike can be traced only after looking at the date of death mentioned in these certificates. CRS portal shows the month of issue, but it is possible that the certificate was issued in May-June for an earlier death,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-of-death-certificates-issues-in-city-in-may-june-saw-sharp-increase/articleshow/88576915.cms||Yusra Husain

Congress leaders alleged that rally held on government expense was an attempt to prove before Prime Minister Narendra Modi that despite crushing defeat in the byelections, people of the state are still with the BJP. In retaliation, BJP leaders have said Congress leaders of state have lost their composure as they enter the election year.Congress leaders alleged that crowd brought to Mandi was an attempt to prove the popularity of BJP government in front of the Prime Minister whereas the reality is that huge pressure was created on officials to mobilise people for this rally. They said the government machinery was misused and thousands of buses of HRTC were used for this rally.Congress vice-president Gangu Ram Musafir, former MLA Ajay Bahadur Singh and former MLA Karnesh Jung said victory of Congress in the by-elections has shown that people of state have made up their mind to change the government in 2022 assembly election. They said that BJP’s Mandi rally was a flop show as Prime Minister failed to make any big announcement for the State.Congress leaders have demanded that the government make public the expenditure incurred on Mandi rally, claiming all schemes launched or inaugurated by the Prime Minister were of the previous Congress government.In retaliation, the BJP has said Congress leaders have lost their composure as they enter the election year. State BJP general secretary and Sundernagar MLA Rakesh Jamwal said the way Congress leaders have come down on insulting the culture and traditions of Himachal Pradesh while opposing the BJP, it is shameful.He said the slogans raised by former minister and Congress leader Prakash Choudhary in protest against the delicacies of sepu badi, kachori and badane shows the kind of insanity in the Congress. He said Congress leader Kaul Singh Thakur is calling himself brave is also part of this episode, while he himself takes up the challenge and turns his back on himself. He termed Kaul Singh Thakur as a narcissist. Addressing mediapersons in Mandi on Tuesday, Kaul Singh had said the chief minister did not dare demand anything from the Prime Minister. On this, Rakesh Jamwal said that Congress has a tradition of demanding and rejecting the demands. He said today projects worth lakhs of crores of rupees are going on in Himachal with the cooperation of the Modi government at the Centre. He said that the state does not have to ask for anything today, the Centre itself is approving the projects of various sectors and also giving financial support. Jamwal said the four-year tenure of state government has been excellent and the crowd at the Mandi rally is proof. He said Congress leaders have lost their sleep due to the success of the Prime Minister’s rally and Congress leaders do not understand how to oppose the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/cong-bjp-spar-over-mandi-rally/articleshow/88577834.cms||---

A major portion of the wetland is silent and free from human intervention which has helped in developing the unique bird diversity.The commonly sighted species during winter include the northern pintail, northern shoveler, Eurasian wigeon, painted stork, cotton pygmy goose, comb duck, grey-headed lapwing, common snipe, ruddy shelduck, red-crested pochard, common pochard, grey heron and purple heron.“The Arachandi wetland has the potential to become a good birding destination. However, it needs some basic facilities in terms of infrastructure development, proper sanitization, boating and a walking pathway around the lake, which will facilitate bird watching,” said Aloke Pattnaik, a physician and an avid bird watcher.Locals said there is also a threat of poachers and they demanded proper protection for the winged guests from the forest department. “We have been taking steps for protection of the migratory birds with the help of local community members and villagers. If the forest and tourism departments provide support for the protection and promotion of the place, it can be a major destination for bird lovers,” said Lalit Mohan Panda, secretary of the Centre for Rural Tourism and Development, a voluntary organisation that is engaged in protection of the birds at the wetland.As many as 57 trainee range officers from the Forest Rangers Training College, Angul, recently visited Arachandi to study the birds. “The wide variety of birds and many migratory species at one place is really amazing. We learnt how we can conduct bird census and identify them. It is a learning process as well as an amazing outing for us,” said Shailesh Yadav, a trainee forest ranger from Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/lack-of-facilities-hits-bird-watching-in-cuttack-wetland/articleshow/88577835.cms||Minati Singha

Much to her surprise, the school uniform, shoes and socks no longer fit her. Also, it was difficult to find the school bags, stationery, tiffin boxes and water bottles at home after 21 months. Many other parents faced similar problems.“We did not expect schools to reopen soon. When the dates were announced, I brought out the uniform and made my child wear it. But the child has grown in height and gained weight due to lack of physical activities for the last two years. Now I have to buy the uniform, sweater, a pair of shoes and socks,” said Samal.Following the outbreak of pandemic, the schools have been shut since March 2020 when the new session had not even started. Also, children were not allowed to go out for close to two years and forced to lead a sedentary life leading to weight gain. “I have two children in primary school and both now require new uniforms. I have bought two pairs of uniforms ready for each child as the clothes need to be washed every time they return from school,” said Meenakshi Mishra, another parent.Shops selling school uniforms have brought out their stocks after the government announced resuming physical classes for Class 1 to V from January 3. A few parents came to buy uniforms on the first day. “We are expecting an increase in footfalls in the next few days. We have kept our stocks ready after no business for the last two sessions,” said Sukant, manager at a uniform shop in Market Building shopping complex here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/parents-hurry-to-buy-new-school-uniform-for-children/articleshow/88577836.cms||Minati Singha

Residents said that despite directions to impose night curfew and Covid-appropriate behaviour in Uttarakhand, tourists who have thronged Mussoorie for year-end revelries are moving around without masks or social distancing. “There is a huge rush on the Mall road, but hardly a handful of people are seen wearing masks. This is a recipe for disaster and the administration is merely being a mute spectator,” lamented a resident under condition of anonymity. Residents said that while night curfew has been imposed by the state government, it will not serve any purpose unless wearing of masks and social distancing is strictly enforced. They also said that there will be a heavy footfall of tourists from Thursday till the New Year and unless precautions are taken, a Covid-19 outbreak would be highly likely. “Tourists from several states are expected to gather over the next few days. Unless social distancing and wearing of masks is strictly enforced, an outbreak will occur” said Rajat Aggarwal, president of Mussoorie Traders Association. Mussoorie station officer (SO) Girish Chandra Sharma told TOI that strict checking is being done. “We have started a drive on Wednesday and so far, issued around 12 challans each for those found without masks and those violating social distancing.

Aneesh George, son of George and Dolly of TC 93/2226 at Pettah is the deceased. The police have recorded the arrest of his friend’s father, Lalan, 51, on charges of murder. The arrest was recorded at Pettah police station. The alleged crime took place at Lalan’s residence, CRA 508, Chayakudi Lane near Pettah. Lalan, a father of two girls aged 16 and 14, found Aneesh in the girls’ bedroom on the first floor of the house during the early hours of the day and attacked him using a kitchen knife, inflicting fatal injuries. According to the police, the incidents related to the case happened sometime between 3.30 am and 4.30 am. The police received a phone call from Lalan’s wife informing them about the attack and requesting assistance to take the injured to the hospital. A team of police immediately reached the residence and took him to the hospital. But, he succumbed to his injuries while on the way. The doctors pronounced him dead on arrival. ‘’When the police reached the crime scene Lalan was not there as he had set out to the police station to turn himself in immediately after stabbing the youth,” Pettah station house officer inspector Riyas Raja said. He initially told the police that he attacked the youth thinking that he was a burglar. However, the police have not bought this statement entirely. He said that the police are probing into the aspects of how Aneesh got into the residence. He is assumed to have set out on foot from his residence, which is located hardly a kilometer away from Lalan’s residence around 3.30 am. His parents were unaware of his absence until the police informed them about his fate. An inquest done on the body of the deceased revealed two stab injuries, one on the chest and the other on the back. Meanwhile, sources in the police said that Aneesh and Lalan’s elder daughter were very close to each other. Lalan knew about it and had even warned Aneesh to stay away from her. However, more verification is needed in this regard. The statements of Lalan’s wife and daughters needed to be recorded to confirm this, sources said. Aneesh was a second year BCom student of Bethany College, Nalanchira. Besides parents, he is survived by a brother Anoop. His post mortem examination was conducted on Wednesday and the body was later released to the relatives for funeral. Lalan was an NRI working in a Gulf country. He had returned home around 18 months ago following the advent of Covid 19 pandemic. He never returned to the Gulf after that. He is likely to be produced before the court on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/19-yr-old-intruder-stabbed-to-death-by-neighbour-in-city/articleshow/88575856.cms||---

The rent for the building was being paid by teachers of the school and some well-wishers. The Jhalod Road primary school in Dahod had around 600 children. The school was operating from a building on the Jhalod Road in Dahod and was inaugurated in 1937. The building became dilapidated and layers of plaster also started coming off its walls. A staffer of the school was also injured. Given this situation, it was decided to vacate the school building two years back. It is around this time that the staffers decided to shift it to the building of the Asha Kiran School, a private school. Rent was to be paid for the new premises at a rate of 10,000 per month. Curiously, it was the government primary school’s teachers who were paying the rent. Officials are still wondering why did this happen. Ideally, the students should have been absorbed in other government schools in the area. “It is true that the teachers were paying the rent for the building,” said district primary education officer Mayur Parekh. He added that it was not possible for the education department to pay the rent for a private school. But things turned for the worst when the management of the private school wanted it’s premises to be vacated. A new building for the government primary school was planned, but is yet to come up. The dilapidated old building is unfit even for temporary use. Parekh said that the delay in work on the new school was because under the Smart City project it was planned that the school should be bigger and with more facilities. A larger plot of land was needed for this and officials zeroed down upon land in the possession of the state prohibition and excise department. The land, however, is yet to be handed over. The parents and students made representations to the top brass of the Dahod district administration on Tuesday. They have sought an end to the issue. Many are even demanding that the government should pay the rent for the private school premises. The administration has proposed that the students be absorbed in other existing schools in Dahod. As per norms, students have been offered transport allowance if they have to travel beyond a stipulated distance based on the standard they are in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/teachers-paid-rent-for-building-to-run-govt-school-in-dahod/articleshow/88576220.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Dehradun||PIL says Kumaun Univ VC appointed against rules, HC says guv to take call on issue||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday heard a petition claiming the vice chancellor of Kumaun University, NK Joshi, was appointed to the post by flouting norms. After hearing the matter, the division bench of acting chief justice Sanjay Kumar Mishra and justice NS Dhanik disposed of the petition, saying that the petitioner’s representation dated April 8, 2021, is already under the consideration of the governor and before a verdict is announced, the governor should hear both the petitioner and the VC. The petition was filed by statehood activist and Doon resident Ravindra Jugran, who contended that rules of the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the UP Universities Act had been bent for the selection of the VC. He said that to be eligible for the post of the VC, a candidate must have 10 years of experience as a professor in a university or an equivalent post in a research institute or an academic administrative institution. While Joshi has an MSc in Physics, a PhD in Forest Science and professorship in Computer Science, he has not held the post of a professor and hence does not qualify for the post he holds. For the selection of a VC, a chancellor first invites applications, then a search committee is formed and it picks three candidates from the pool and lastly, the governor nominates one of those three candidates as VC. Jugran also contended that Joshi’s educational records are misleading.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pil-says-kumaun-univ-vc-appointed-against-rules-hc-says-guv-to-take-call-on-issue/articleshow/88574986.cms||Sonali Mishra

As per the IMD data, Parbhani was one of the coldest cities in Marathwada, with a minimum temperature of 10.6 degrees Celsius, which is a negative deviation of three units from the normal range. The temperature in Aurangabad and Nanded was 11.3 degrees Celsius (no deviation) and 12 degrees Celsius (negative deviation of 1 unit), respectively. KK Dakhore, an agricultural meteorologist at Parbhani-based Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, said the existing harsh winter conditions would gradually wither over the remaining week. “The minimum temperature is expected to rise by three to four units in the next few days. The temperature is expected to be well in the normal range if there is no drastic change in the weather systems,” he said. As per the IMD, skies are likely to remain clear for the next one week, which will cause a rise in the mercury level. Many citizens said that the current harsh winter conditions are palpable. Asha Thorat, a homemaker, said, “It is for the first time in the winter that we are using the woollen clothing.

At least 19 oxygen generation plants have been set up in government hospitals and urban community health care centres (UCHCs). The capacity of all these plants together is 15,338 litres per minute which is sufficient to supply oxygen to every bed in these hospitals and CHCs, they added. Of these, a bedside piped oxygen supply facility is available at six hospitals. In the remaining 13 hospitals/UCHCs, oxygen cylinders can be refilled from the plant and taken to the bedside. Work is underway to lay pipelines in these healthcare facilities as well. Further, plans are also afoot to establish nine more units in other UCHCs, said officers. Spokesperson of chief medical officer's office, Yogesh Raghuwanshi, said “The steps taken by the state government helped in managing the crisis of oxygen during the second wave and now after setting up of new plants, all the 10 government hospitals and 18 urban CHCs have become self-sufficient in medical oxygen production.” “These plants have been set up through PM Cares Fund, MP and MLA local area development funds and grants from various companies through their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds,” he added. Apart from these government health care facilities, King George's Medical University (KGMU) and Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Science (RMLIMS) have plants with the capacity to generate 1.1 lakh litre of oxygen per minute and 43,000 litre per minute respectively.

After the matter gained traction, chairman of the SC/ST commission had directed senior authorities of Champawat district to sort out the issue amicably. Sources said a decision in this regard will be taken soon. Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Party’s Champawat district in-charge Madan Singh Mahar held a meeting with the cook, Sunita Devi, and reiterated the promise of a job in Delhi made by Rajendra Pal Gautam, AAP leader and social welfare minister in the Delhi government. Mahar asked Devi to consider moving to Delhi where she would be deployed as a cook for Rs 18,000 per month. Mahar added that she would be offered free-of-cost accommodation and the education expenses of her kids would also be looked after by Delhi's AAP government. Speaking about the offer, Devi said, “I have received only verbal assurances so far. I will take a call on moving to Delhi only after I get an appointment letter detailing all terms and conditions.” TOI had earlier reported that Devi had joined the Sukhidang school, which has a student strength of 230, as bhojanmata on December 13 but the very next day, several upper caste students refused to eat the meal cooked by her. Later, the chief education officer of the district, RC Purohit, after reviewing the matter, termed her appointment as illegal, and dismissed her. However, last week, 23 Dalit students of the school came out in support of Devi. To protest her removal, they boycotted the mid-day meal cooked by her replacement, a woman from upper caste, and instead got their own lunch from home. An inquiry was subsequently constituted in the matter. Meanwhile, a meeting called on Wednesday by Champawat district officials to discuss the issue was cancelled after several members of the parent-teachers’ association and the school’s management committee gave it a miss. The meeting, which was to be chaired by a team of officials, including SDM Tanakpur, chief education officer of Champawat and circle officer (police), has now been postponed to Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/row-over-dalit-cooks-removal-ukhand-officials-explore-possibility-of-reinstating-her-in-govt-school/articleshow/88575004.cms||Prem Punetha

They have also arrested a man in connection with the case. The police identified the accused as Mohanan, 55, of Bhajanamadam near Kadakkavoor. Jessi, 54, an insurance agent residing at Vakkom under Kadakkavoor police station limits, is the deceased. She was found dead on the railway track near Ayanthi bridge near Varkala. The police had initially under the assumption that it could be a case of suicide as the spot where the body was found was a secluded area where many suicides by jumping in front of moving trains were reported in the past. However, the police launched a detailed investigation after Jessi’s family pointed out that the gold ornaments she was wearing were missing from the body. The police soon launched a detailed investigation using scientific methods and zeroed in on Mohanan, with whom Jessi maintained a close relationship. The police said that Jessi, a widow with two daughters, maintained a close relationship with Mohanan. They even had some financial dealings between them. ‘’Mohanan had asked for financial assistance from her to go abroad for a job, which she could not give. On the day of the crime, Mohanan took her to the crime scene in an auto rickshaw pretending to introduce her to a new potential client for an insurance policy. He then strangled her using her saree and dumped the body on the railway track and left. The investigation was led by Kadakkavoor station house officer inspector V Ajesh under the supervision of Varkala DSP Niyas. The police also recovered one of the ornaments from Mohanan’s residence. He told the police that he had sold another ornament at a jewellery. He even secured a visa to a Gulf country using that money and was planning to escape soon when the police arrested him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/man-arrested-for-murdering-woman/articleshow/88575889.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Prabha Varma’s kritis to be part of Carnatic concert||Thiruvananthapuram: Kritis written by poet Prabha Varma will be featured in a Carnatic music concert at Vyloppilly Samskrithi Bhavan on December 30. It will be performed by K R Shyama who has also composed the `Kritis`. Vylopilly Samskrithi Bhavan is hosting the Carnatic music concert as part of efforts of a group of classical music lovers to regain the glory of Carnatic music. R Ramachandran Nair was the last Malayalam poet to write Carnatic music ‘kritis’ under the pen name Thulaseevanam. Writing and composing ‘kritis’ for Carnatic Music, often considered an arduous task, requires a combination of excellent vocabulary, musical awareness and classical music listening skills. In Carnatic music, the ‘kriti’ is arranged in tune with the melody. All the Carnatic musical kritis so far have been composed with requests to the deities, their praises and synonyms for the deities. Prabha Varma’s works are distinguished by beautiful imagery and symbolism. Prabha Varma adopts a different approach when writing ‘kritis’ in the tradition of Swathi Thirunal, Irayimman Thampi, Thulaseevanam and many other writers. Carnatic music concerts should always have a variety of melodies and rhythms. Even the rhythms themselves have to be prepared at different speeds to make the concerts extremely heart-warming. Carnatic music must blend melody and musicality. All these qualities are plentiful in Prabha Varma’s works and they are full of literary beauty, according to the organisers. Prabha Varma’s ‘kriti’, such as “Neelabha Prabha nee... neerazhiyil veenayo.... nin neelimayal kadalalaneelichaayo” shows that his Carnatic hymns are rich in poetic beauty. The work on Hanuman, which begins with “Pavanam Paripavanam” in the Nattakurinji Raga, is arranged in a ‘Misra chapa’ rhythm. There will be eight such ‘kritis’ in the concert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/prabha-varmas-kritis-to-be-part-of-carnatic-concert/articleshow/88575909.cms||---

This development comes after a BTech student was found hanging in the institution’s hostel room on Sunday. The on-campus counselling facility for students was available till the Covid-induced lockdown was announced, and classes were shifted to the online mode. NITK director K Umamaheshwar Rao said, “We will reach out to students and ask them to speak to our counsellors, or take help for any issues.” The institution has one full-time counsellor at the healthcare centre, and has additional counsellors from private hospitals visiting the institute. Narendranath S, dean, students’ welfare, said, “We have planned a session for 100 students by an expert counsellor from the region. We will have more counsellors to help students deal with depression, suicidal thoughts or any financial difficulties that are hindering their academic performance.” Further, he said the institute has been helping students with financial problems. “Last year, the faculty helped a student from Bihar financially, and our alumni spread across the globe are always there to help such students,” he added. Another faculty member said students hesitate to take the help of counsellors due to the social stigma and fear of isolation from other students. Currently only the third-year and fourth-year students are on campus, after a gap of nearly 18 months. A few second-year students have also returned on campus. Meanwhile, second and first-year BTech students are yet to arrive on campus. 30 NIT students committed suicide across India in 8 years Minister of education Dharmendra Pradhan informed the Lok Sabha on December 20, that about 30 students studying in NITs across India committed suicide between 2014 and 2021.

Yakshaganas are a dusk-to-dawn musical plays. Its episodes are based on the Ramayana, Mahabharata and the Bhagwad Gita. The plays are performed mostly in Uttara Kannada, Shivamogga, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts and in Kerala’s Kasaragod region. Just as the Yakshagana melas began touring, the rising cases of the Omicron variant and the imposition of the 10-day night curfew has resulted in uncertainty not just among artistes, but those who organise the performances. Many Yakshagana troupes quickly changed the performance timings, scheduling them between 3 pm and 9.30 pm. However, the timings have become a problem for the performers. An artiste from the Kateel Yakshagana Mela said that starting the performance early was a challenge especially for those who have a job and are performers. They will have to apply for a half-day leave. Also, since it’s an open performance and not in a closed hall, wearing heavy make-up and costume before sunset is definitely a challenge taking into consideration the weather. The options are few, in case it is here to stay this season, art lovers may get used to it. The sevas by the Sri Durgaparameshwari Dashavatara Yakshagana Mela of Mandarthi, in Udupi district, are booked till 2043-44. The president of the Mandarthi Shree Durgaparameshwari temple, Dhananjaya Shetty, said, “There is uncertainty. Those who have got a slot are not happy with the new timings. Hopefully, this is a temporary change. We are hardly left with any option because it is difficult to get a fresh slot. Also, there are devotees who are opting for sevas held during the rainy season at the temple premise,” he said. The temple has five melas and conducts an average of 950 shows per year. The harake seva expense is around Rs 50,000. Each troupe has around 47 members. A troupe member from Udupi told TOI, the second wave has left a deep scar on the income of most people, especially those in the hospitality sector. Those who organise the Yakshagana harake sevas every year are continuing to do so, but among those who got an opportunity to offer the harake seva this year, there are few who have requested, if it could be postponed to a later date due to financial crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/yakshagana-timings-change-due-to-night-restrictions-artistes-worried/articleshow/88575080.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

---||Goa||Fadnavis meets workers upset with Jayesh’s entry||Panaji: After BJP witnessed a split among its workers in Saligao over the induction of former GFP MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar into the party, Goa BJP election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday held a meeting with party workers to pacify them. He said that those who are not with us, will also join the campaign in some time and BJP will win the Saligao seat. Fadnavis said that the door-to-door campaign which will be launched on January 1 should connect heart-to-heart and win their votes. He said that any given time and date, the Election Commission of India (ECI) will announce the election date for the upcoming assembly election in Goa and told party workers to work hard. “We have not called the general public for this meeting and only main BJP Saligao karyakartas have been called. When a new person joins a party, some people are happy whereas some people become sad and that is part of politics. I have confidence (in Salgaonkar) with his approach, he will reach out to those around 20% people who have moved away from us to bring them back into the party fold,” Fadnavis said. On December 5, a group of BJP workers rebelled under the banner ‘Together for Saligao’ and took the decision to field a candidate against the party’s candidate from the constituency in the upcoming assembly elections. The rebel group had shortlisted two probable candidates, Kedar Naik and Rupesh Naik, sarpanch and zilla panchayat member of Reis Magos, respectively. Fadnavis said that BJP is a strong force in Saligao and the joining of Salgaonkar has given additional strength to the party and the party will collectively win the Saligao seat with majority. “When we think of elections, team is very important and if the team is charged and works with enthusiasm then it is easy to win the election,” he said. The former Maharashtra chief minister said when you go for a ballot war one must have a positive attitude and until and unless the team enters the field with a positive mindset, the election tempo cannot be built. Fadnavis said that during the door-to-door campaign, the candidate should speak to the people and understand what is in their mind. He said sometimes people want the candidates to talk to them and if they think that they have been taken for granted then they don’t like it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fadnavis-meets-workers-upset-with-jayeshs-entry/articleshow/88600805.cms||TNN
---||Goa||Goa: Moreno Rebello, ex-zilla panchayat member from Curtorim, quits BJP 20 days after joining||MARGAO: Ex-zilla panchayat member from Curtorim, Moreno Rebello, on Thursday resigned from BJP, hardly 20 days after he had joined it with much fanfare. He said he was under tremendous pressure from his supporters and even some members of his family to quit following social media reports of attacks on religious places of the minorities in BJP-ruled states around Christmas time. He said that the recent developments across the country, “especially the atrocities against minorities, created a lot of problems for me, as people began pressurizing me to leave BJP.” “The Christmas midnight sermon finished my peace of mind. I couldn’t enjoy Christmas. It was too much pressure, and I could handle it no more,” he said. With chief minister Pramod Sawant and a host of senior BJP leaders having descended on Curtorim to welcome Rebello into the party fold on December 10, it was obvious that the party would nominate him as its candidate in Curtorim, a Congress bastion. He said local BJP units members approached him and on the assurance of the BJP leadership that they would do his 14 development works he had listed, he joined the ruling party. Rebello said on one hand, BJP didn’t take him into confidence and that the developmental works proposed by him remained unattended. “perhaps, they didn’t take me seriously”. He said that on the other hand, there was huge pressure on him for having joined BJP in the light of the development in other parts of the country “Ever since I joined BJP, there was too much pressure on me, with my supporters questioning my motives. I was getting suffocated. I am now a relieved man,” Rebello told reporters after submitting his resignation. He, however, claimed that he has no immediate plans of joining any other party or of contesting the polls. “I have just pulled myself out of one problem which I had myself created. I want some peace now,” he replied to a question. He said if he had taken personal benefit, he would not have been able to leave BJP. Rebello said he had quit Congress as he was sure that then sitting MLA (Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco) would get the ticket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjps-curtorim-aspirant-quits-20-days-after-joining-party/articleshow/88600799.cms||---
---||Goa||For development works, Goa Forward Party blocks road||MARGAO: Supporters of Goa Forward Party (GFP), including the chairperson of GFP-affiliated councillors of Margao Municipal Council, led by its president Vijai Sardesai on Thursday squatted near the main traffic island at Fatorda along the busy Ponda-Margao road. The road block paralysed road traffic for a quite a while before police succeeded in persuading the protestors to disperse. Speaking to reporters at the protest site, Sardesai said that the agitation was organised to protest what he called stopping of various development works that had begun in Fatorda by the public works department (PWD). He alleged that PWD stopped the works at the behest of his political rival, ex-Fatorda MLA and BJP general secretary Damodar Naik. The police had a hard time in evicting the protestors from the road, prompting Fatorda PI Kapil Nayak to rush to the site.  As the police urged the protesters to clear the road, an altercation ensued between Sardesai and Nayak as the latter told him off for inconveniencing the public by protesting on the road without obtaining any permission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/for-devpt-worksgfp-blocks-road/articleshow/88600803.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Money given for tablet will be recovered if students don't buy the device: Edu dept||Dehradun: In a bid to ensure that the money being given to students for purchasing a tablet is used for the purpose, the Uttarakhand government has said that the amount will be recovered from the student if it is found that the device was not bought. The department has also set a guideline for the purchase of tablets. The state has mandated students to buy a tablet that at least has an 8-inch display, 2GB ram and 4G compatibility. According to the government's announcement, an amount of Rs 12,000 will be given to those studying in Class X and XII in UBSE board schools and state-run degree colleges. So far, the government has released over Rs 190 crore for the scheme. A majority of Class X and XII students, who will write their board exams in 2022, have already received the money. In the next phase, college students will be extended the benefit of the scheme. “We have instructed school principals to make sure that students buy the tablet devices soon after they get the money in their bank accounts,” said a senior education officer. In order to monitor utilisation of the money being given for the purchase of tablets, a committee headed by district magistrates has been formed in all 13 districts. Notably, money for tablet devices will be transferred only to Aadhaar-linked bank accounts. Each school has been asked to appoint a teacher as the nodal officer to assist in the implementation of the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/money-given-for-tablet-will-be-recovered-if-students-dont-buy-the-device-edu-dept/articleshow/88575090.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Delhi||City’s First Dense Fog Of Season Lasts An Hr||New Delhi: The national capital on Wednesday morning saw the season’s first dense fog in isolated areas, including IGI Airport, which obscured the visibility to around 100 metres. It, however, lasted only for an hour between 9am and 10am, and no delay or diversion was reported at the airport. India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicts dense fog on Thursday too. “The episode on Wednesday was not a major one. At the airport, too, it only affected one runway where visibility was around 100 metres. At Safdarjung, in the morning hours, the visibility was above 500 metres. There are chances of dense fog on Thursday, while we expect moderate fog for a few more days,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. Due to the rain on Monday and Tuesday, there was enough moisture in the air that was aided by very slow-to-calm winds to form the fog. “But there are other major components for the fog to sustain for a longer period like strong inversion layer, enough particles etc, which were absent on Wednesday morning. We are still monitoring the situation to forecast episodes of dense fog,” said Jenamani, adding that the current readings of the weather pattern suggested no chance of cold wave in Delhi till January 2 due to the low wind speed. The weather department expects another spell of rain in the first week of January. IMD forecasts the minimum temperature to drop from Thursday due to the inclusion of northerly component in the wind. Meanwhile, the air quality deteriorated back to the “very poor” from the “poor” category a day earlier. The air quality index (AQI) was 267 as against 305 on Tuesday and 285 on Monday. AQI continued to be “poor” in the morning hours, but the pollution levels soared slightly over the day. According to the pollution monitoring agency, AQI is likely to improve to “moderate” by the next two days. “Relatively high wind speeds are likely for the next three days, enhancing ventilation effecting AQI to be in ‘lower end of poor’ or ‘moderate’ category,” System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research stated. The city also saw a drop in the minimum temperature, though the daytime temperatures soared. The minimum temperature was 8.4 degrees Celsius as against 9.4 degrees a day earlier. The maximum temperature was recorded at 21.2 degrees Celsius as against 18 on Tuesday. The minimum and maximum temperatures on Thursday are likely to hover around 6 and 21 degrees Celsius, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/citys-first-dense-fog-of-season-lasts-an-hr/articleshow/88575967.cms||---

The matter came to light when the priest opened the temple for morning prayers. Police filed an FIR against unidentified persons and are monitoring CCTV footage to find the accused. According to the police, the priest reached the main sanctum of the temple early morning on Wednesday and saw some flesh lying near the main door. As the news of flesh found inside the temple spread, locals gathered at the spot in large numbers, and police were called. The crowd told the police that they would protest if the accused would not be arrested immediately. “The police reached the spot, lifted the flesh, and buried it under soil. We managed to pacify the crowd and an FIR in the matter was filed under relevant sections,” said circle officer of Kithore, Chandrakant Meena. The police have sent a sample of the flesh to the lab to identify the type of meat it was.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/miscreants-throw-meat-inside-temple-stoke-tension/articleshow/88576457.cms||Ishita Mishra

A scavenger that is rarely spotted in the region has been seen camping near Timbi Lake on the outskirts of the city. A group of bird lovers have photographed an Egyptian vulture next to the lake that is located about 10km from the city. It is nearly after 30 years that this species of vulture has been spotted at Timbi lake. “We were out to see migratory birds at the lake on December 19. After walking around for almost two hours we were taking a rest at the back side of the lake when we spotted a dark patchy bird flying above us. It descended at some distance and we thought that maybe it was a harrier,” said Tanisha Dagur, one of the bird watchers who spotted the vulture along with Dhaval Devaliya, Aniket Soni and Vivek Nariya. “But when we took a closer look from binoculars, we were in for a surprise. It was an Egyptian vulture. Our entire group was excited as this bird hasn’t been spotted in and around Vadodara for several decades,” Dagur, a zoology student at M S University, told TOI. “It is possible that the bird may be exploring new locations in this region. Or maybe it was resting for a while before migrating further,” she added. According to the Environmental Information Centre (ENVIS centre) of Gujarat Ecology Commission, in 2016, Gujarat was home to more than 133 Egyptian vultures and their main population was concentrated in Banaskantha and Ahmedabad district. “c Spotting an Egyptian vulture here is a good sign as this bird usually prefers to stay at places where it can find food to scavenge,” said Raju Vyas who had done a study of vultures in Vadodara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/rare-egyptian-vulture-seen-in-vadodara-after-30-yrs/articleshow/88576238.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Hyderabad||A year of major elections, turf wars with AP||Major elections, schemes and clashes with AP and the Centre kept the political scenario in the state charged all through the year TRS BANKS ON DALIT BANDHU While the TRS government has introduced several welfare schemes over the last seven years, a special scheme for Dalit families – Dalit Bandhu – introduced this year, stood out as the biggest so far. Under this scheme, Dalit families can avail of Rs 10 lakh and utilise it to start their own business. It aims to cover 17 lakh Dalit families in the state, in a phased manner. As the scheme was first rolled out in the Huzurabad assembly constituency, on a pilot basis, ahead of the by-poll, it attracted severe criticism from opposition parties who alleged that it was done by TRS for political gains in the elections. Of course, the party failed to eventually win the seat. Later it was extended to four mandals in various assembly constituencies being represented by Dalit MLAs.It was also implemented in CM KCR’s adopted village, Vasalamarri in Yadadri-Bhongiri district. The state government released Rs 2,000 crore for Huzurabad, another Rs 7.6 crore for Vasalamarri and Rs 250 crore for the four mandals. Now the government is gearing up to extend the scheme to 100 families each in the rest of the assembly constituencies by the end of this financial year. Big ticket by-polls It was a year of fiercely fought by-polls in Telangana with major political parties, especially TRS and BJP, turning them into a prestige issue. In fact, some termed the Huzurabad by-election as a mini assembly poll, going by the way parties rigorously campaigned – for close to four months -- and spent money to lure voters. The seat here ultimately went the saffron brigade’s way with former health minister Eatala Rajender – who quit TRS following allegations of land grabbing levelled against him and his family member’s firm – beating his pink party rival. The TRS, however, walked away with a thumping majority in the Nagarjuna Sagar constituency by-poll held in April. The election here was necessitated following the demise of sitting MLA, Nomula Narsimhaiah. In both the elections, TRS deployed senior leaders in each mandal in the assembly segment to ensure the party's victory. TRS president and CM KCR showered several thousands crores-worth of sops too. But while it worked at one place, it clearly did not in the other. Water wars The water row between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh peaked in 2021 with both the states complaining against each other about water sharing, drawls from Krishna River, hydel power generation and construction of new projects across the Krishna River. Authorities on both sides almost came to blows at Pulichintala over hydel power generation. Several dozens of letters were dashed off to the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and Ministry of Water Resources. Eventually, in July 2021 the Centre took over all irrigation projects in both states and announced that project operations will be transferred to two river boards -- Krishna and Godavari – by October. The boards are still to take over completely. Paddy pangs Until a few months ago, not many would have predicted that Telangana, touted to be the biggest paddy producer in the country, would get embroiled in one of the biggest controversies of the year. The issue led to a political war between the TRS and BJP with protests and counter protests. For the first time in seven years, TRS president KCR sat on dharna demanding that the Centre procure the parboiled rice in Rabi season along with complete procurement of paddy in Kharif season. This, after the Centre, in October, stated that it would not procure parboiled rice from Telangana and buy only 58 lakh MTs of paddy produced in Telangana. The issue snowballed into a major crisis soon, with the CM meeting the union ministers and sending a ministerial delegation to Delhi, apart from taking up protests both inside and outside of Parliament.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/a-year-of-major-elections-turf-wars-with-ap/articleshow/88575913.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Made-in-India hero had to battle many villains||Hyderabad: If 2021 was the year that saw the world hit back at the dreaded SARS-CoV-2 virus thanks to vaccines, there was no other vaccine that was subjected to trial by fire, at home and abroad, as the first `Made in India’ Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin was. Developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, the two-dose inactivated whole virus vaccine found itself willy-nilly dragged into controversy from word go.  A leaked letter, written by ICMR director general Balram Bhargava ordering participating hospitals to speed up Covaxin trials so the vaccine could be ready by August 15, 2020, sowed the first seeds of doubt against the desi vaccine. Thus began the intense public scrutiny that only intensified further after Covaxin was granted EUA by DCGI on January 3, 2021.  To make matters worse, Serum Institute of India (SII) chief Adar Poonawalla’s disparaging remarks about all vaccines, except those developed by Oxford, Pfizer and Moderna, being "safe as water" sparked off a public spat, that saw Bharat Biotech’s CMD Dr Krishna Ella hit back and question the trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, that SII makes under the Covishield brand. Finally, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) had to step in to flag a truce. Covaxin then found itself in the eye of a political storm after some opposition leaders branded it a saffron vaccine. Even experts termed the EUA nod as premature.  But Covaxin’s struggles were far from over. Right from allegations of unethical trials, to aggressively questioning the vaccine’s safety, efficacy, quality and output scale-up to shrill calls to "show the data" despite it being published in over a dozen prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals, detractors tried every trick in their books to pull it down. But the biggest vote of confidence came from Prime Minister Narendra Modi who took the desi vaccine in March.  Covaxin also found itself dragged into an international controversy after Brazil suspended its $320 million order for 20 million doses after a probe into allegations of irregularities against Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Bharat Biotech terminated its deal with its Brazilian partner Precisa Medicamentos over unethical practices.  No wonder then that Covaxin had even Chief Justice of India NV Ramana fighting its case, stating publicly -- what many had suspected all along – global attempts were made to scuttle Covaxin. Today, over 15.5 crore doses of Covaxin have been administered in India and it is now slowly but surely making inroads into global markets as well. ............................. Molnupiravir green-lighted This oral anti-viral drug that inhibits the replication of multiple RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2, got the go-ahead from the Indian drug regulator just days before 2021 drew to a close. The drug, which was studied by Merck & Co Inc in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics in a Phase III trial for the treatment of non-hospitalised patients with confirmed Covid-19 globally, will now be brought not just to the Indian market but also over 100 low-and middle-income countries by several Hyderabad-based pharma companies. Corbevax makes the cut India’s third indigenous Covid-19 vaccine got its foot into the door just days before 2021 bid adieu with the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation granting it an emergency use authorisation on December 28. The two-dose recombinant sub-unit vaccine is developed by Biological E and Texas-based Baylor College of Medicine and has completed two Phase III clinical trials involving more than 3,000 subjects aged between 18 and 80 years. It was found to be safe, well tolerated and immunogenic and will be the most affordable vaccine yet to be rolled out in the country , said Biological E's managing director Mahima Datla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/made-in-india-hero-had-to-battle-many-villains/articleshow/88575944.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Delhi||Delhi Police to focus on abductors, gangs extorting bizmen||NEW DELHI: With Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana restructuring the Crime Branch as a part of a major revamp of the force on Monday, the unit will now be prioritising a crackdown on gangs extorting businessmen and kidnapping people for ransom. The order accessed by TOI stated that a large population, both residents and floating, made crime control a challenge. Organised crime needed to be constantly identified and neutralised. Certain specialised offences, like street crime and property frauds, required a closer surveillance. “Cases that require special attention are referred from central and state governments and the courts to Crime Branch for investigation. Therefore, it was felt that allocation of work should be assigned based on specific subjects falling under certain verticals so that focused attention could be given to those crimes that had the propensity to create a sensation,” the order added. There would be three additional commissioners under the supervision of a joint commissioner, who would report to the special commissioner. In all, there would be seven DCPs and 21 ACPs. Special commissioner (Crime) Devesh Chandra Srivastava said the order had streamlined the working of the Crime Branch and set clear guidelines for officers by delineating their roles and responsibilities. “Extortion from businessmen and traders is high. Most cases are in the form of protection money demanded by gangsters active in the area. Kidnapping for ransom also needs special attention. Divisions, like the anti-extortion cell and anti-kidnapping cell, have been established to curb such incidents,” stated the order. The interstate cell will focus on curbing organised crime and interstate criminals. The anti-gang squad has been tasked to gather intelligence, build a record and neutralise these gangs. “Some of the most dreaded gangsters have emerged from the Outer-North, Outer, Rohini, Najafgarh and rural belts of South West and West districts. While most have been arrested, the gang members are still active,” the order said. To curb street crime, anti-robbery and snatching cells have been formed. The cybercrime cell is equipped with a state-of-the-art lab and will focus on cases related to trojan attacks, cyber terrorism, social media abuse, etc. The main focus will be on cases where the victims are women and children. The narcotics cell will control the supply and trace the origin of drugs. It has also been tasked to increase the conviction rate. The anti-human trafficking unit will focus on kidnapping and abduction cases, tracing missing children and reuniting them with their families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-to-focus-on-abductors-gangs-extorting-bizmen/articleshow/88575983.cms||Abhay Singh

Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Thursday said that around 90% of the anganwadi workers’ demands have been already fulfilled. He also said that most of the workers did not know why they were on strike. Sawant held a meeting with the workers along with opposition leader Digambar Kamat. He said both Kamat and the anganwadi workers were unaware of their demands. He said that the strike is due to a tussle between two anganwadi union workers. The chief minister said that they have inwarded their demands to the director of women and child development on December 8. “I have gone through their demands, and out of their around 13 demands, the demand to increase their salaries was fulfilled in November and a circular was issued on December 20. They were not aware about it,” he said. Sawant said that the government has decided to give revised salaries from April 1, 2021 and arrears would be paid. He also said that a second demand to increase retirement benefits was also fulfilled by the government last month. Counsel for the Anganwadi worker, Hrudaynath Shirodkar said that they do not agree with salary increase by the state government. “We want a 30% rise in salary. Once we get the salary, we will calculate the difference and come back to government,” Shirodkar said. Kamat said that a circular was issued on December 20, but it has not been implemented till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/90-of-anganwadi-workers-demands-fulfilled-sawant/articleshow/88600844.cms||---

Categorized as ‘vulnerable’ in the IUCN red list, the mugger crocodile is a declining species of freshwater crocodile. It is a Schedule I reptilian species protected under Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. In Uttarakhand, Khatima's Kakra forms a perfect habitat and breeding zone for these marsh muggers. Now, the area has been turned into a tourism spot. The crocodile safari was inaugurated by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Wednesday. In the entire Terai Arc Landscape (TAL), 126 crocodiles were found in Kakra Nala. The trail is spread across 4km in which at least 81 adult muggers, 33 sub-adult and around a dozen juveniles exist as per latest forest department study. “This is the first such crocodile trail where people can watch the species from a very safe yet close distance. There are wetlands containing crocodiles in different states in which boating is allowed. But, no such trail exists that exclusively aims at educating the people about the significance of marsh crocodiles,” said Sandeep Kumar, DFO, Terai East. This species of crocodile is found in India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. Senior scientist and expert at Wildlife Institute of India Dr K Sivakumar said, “Promoting ‘crocodile tourism’ is a right approach taken to change the perspective of people from seeing it as an animal of conflict to that of significant value in our ecosystem. All they require is good nesting sites and food.” The crocodile trail is aimed at ensuring that their habitat is secured from the effluents of industries and the area remains free of enrichment for letting its population thrive. Muggers are opportunistic predators and they prefer fish, snakes and turtles, birds and mammals (monkeys).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/croc-trail-a-first-comes-up-at-surai-ecotourism-zone/articleshow/88575169.cms||Shivani Azad

Items worth Rs 50 lakh were gutted in the fire, a senior fire official said. As per fire officer, Rajendra Nagar, the blaze started around 12.50pm and a team of 40 firefighters and 20 fire tenders were pressed into the service to contain the flames which were towering above. Nagar said that the electric scooters were assembled at the workshop before being sent to the distributors. The team of the fire department made their way through enveloping thick smoke and managed to save around 120 vehicles that were kept inside the burning workshop. A thick plume of black smoke had engulfed the entire area where over a dozen medium and small workshops and factories are located. The blaze posed a major risk of sweeping through adjacent factories, however, Nagar said that his team had quickly managed to contain the flames before it could trigger a major mishap. “We used all fire tenders at our disposable and controlled the fire before it could sweep through other places,” Nagar said. The exact reasons which triggered the fire are yet to be determined, however, the officers have not ruled out the possibility of some electric malfunction leading to the fire. The factory owners have estimated a total loss of about Rs 50 lakh, the fire department, however, said that many of the eclectic scooters were saved following a timely action. The incident sparked a wave of panic in the locality where several workers were evacuated from nearby units and many people gathered on the main street. Police had to disperse the crowd so that fire tenders could rush in on time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/goods-worth-rs-50l-gutted-in-fire-at-e-scooter-factory/articleshow/88576503.cms||---

It was ready in 2019, when he, for the first time, conducted a festival in December. The temple, which is named ‘Ammaiyappar’, features the bust of his parents.“I love my parents and I am here because of them. I was not able to bear their loss. I constructed the temple to express my love for them. I was particular about building the temple on farmland. So, I bought two acres of agricultural land at Deepalapatti village,” Kumar told TOI.As he couldn’t organize the temple festival in December last year because of the pandemic situation, it was held in a grand manner on December 19 this year, by inviting his relatives and the villagers.“More than 500 people participated in the function and there was a feast for all of them. I also gifted dhoti and sari to more than 100 people,” Kumar said.The video of temple festival went viral on social media and out of curiosity many people from nearby areas have started visiting the shrine.Kumar is married to 36-year-old S Uma Maheshwari. They have a son - 8-year-old Prasath - and a daughter - 5-year-old Dhivya Bhakyasree.

It is not just a profession. It is a service towards your motherland and the common man. At no point of time, under no circumstances you should let down the trust of the common man. Every decision and action taken by you must be towards strengthening their hope and trust reposed on you,” said Naveen, who took part virtually in the programme. He also urged the young officers to shoulder the roles and responsibilities that come attached with civil service.Speaking on some of initiatives of his government like 5T and Mo Sarkar — the feedback-based governance model, Naveen said these steps are directed at bringing transformative changes in the governance mechanism. “The government is working dedicatedly to provide services at the doorsteps of the people,” Naveen added. “No matter how amazing and innovative a strategy is, its true success is dependent on its effective implementation.”He suggested the officers to work judiciously, with honesty and integrity, for the benefit of the people.Secretary to the chief minister (5T) V K Pandian advised the young officers to maintain absolute transparency and to treat people professionally and with empathy.Naveen also launched the digital life certificate mechanism for pensioners, a part of the 5T initiative. Official sources said identification and life certificates can now be submitted by the pensioners using artificial intelligence-based video verification process. “It will be of immense help to the pensioners as they can submit their identification and life certificates digitally, without visiting any government office simply by using their mobile phones. Odisha is the first state to implement such a digital service for the pensioners,” said Naveen.This facility will also be available at the Mo Seva Kendras located across the state. The e-Diary, under which all information contained in the government diary can be readily and conveniently accessed by citizens using their mobile phones, was also launched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/cm-urges-young-officers-to-work-for-peoples-benefit/articleshow/88577898.cms||---

---||Meerut||Have fulfilled my promise to make west UP riots-free and safe: Yogi Adityanath||BIJNOR: Patting the back of his own government, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said that his government had made west UP riots-free and safe. “There were threats to the safety and security of our sisters and daughters from rioters during the previous regime, but now goons are threatened by the law. I had promised to the people that I would do it,” said Yogi at a BJP’s ‘Jan Vishvas Yatra’ in Amroha on Wednesday. The CM, on this occasion, also unveiled 31 development projects worth Rs 43 crore. In an effort to appease electorates in the sugar bowl of UP, the CM said, “The west UP region that was known for riots during the previous regimes is now growing sugarcane. The BJP government has paid Rs 1.51 lakh crore to sugarcane farmers. During the 14 years of the SP and the BSP regimes, they had not paid the sugarcane price as much as the BJP government had paid in just four and a half years. Besides, we are going to revive eight sugar mills in UP. Amroha is one of them.” Raking up the Krishna Jjanmabhoomi temple issue, Yogi said, “We are building a Ram temple in Ayodhya and Vishwanath’s abode in Kashi, then how can Mathura and Vrindavan be left out? We have started working on them by forming a Teerth Vikas Parishad.” “Could SP, BSP or Congress dare to do so,” Yogi sought to know from people while addressing a gathering in Amroha’s Hasanpur. Appealing to the public to get vaccinated to keep Covid-19 at bay, the CM said, “Our double engine government (state and centre) had worked to save both lives and livelihoods of the people. We provided them with free treatment and vaccines. All people should get themselves vaccinated.” Hitting out at the opposition parties, the CM said, “They plundered the state and hoarded money. Besides, the chacha-bhatija duo used to extort money during government recruitments, but we are providing employment to youths on their merit.” The BJP won in three of the four assembly segments in Amroha in the last assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/have-fulfilled-my-promise-to-make-west-up-riots-free-and-safe-yogi/articleshow/88576573.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Kochi||Riveting performance showcased at ‘Hope Fest’||Thrissur: The cultural festival ‘Hope Fest’, organised here by the Sangeetha Nataka Academy, on Thursday showcased interesting performances on the second day of the event. One of them was “Ariyennunnor” (those who count rice grains), a solo performance by K V Ganesh of the theatre collective Rangachethana. “Ariyennunnor” effectively deploys the conceptual and practical aspects of clandestine theatre by roping in the casual spectators on the streets and shops on the roadsides into the performance. Ganesh, who performs as a beggar in the play, achieves this by walking towards them and interacting with them. C R Rajan and James Eliya gave a contemporary interpretation to the famous play of Samuel Beckett, “Waiting for Godot”, by weaving in several popular elements into it. “Bhranthu” (Madness) is a mediated performance based on Dalit writer C Ayyappan’s short story of the same name. Directed by Abheesh Sasidharan, the play uses technologies and materials as well as an Ambassador car to generate experiences. “Once upon a Clown Time”, a clown show conceived and performed by Monica Santos Zamorano from Spain, was another interesting show on the day. There was also an interactive session with theatre activist Prabalan Velur. A compilation of films from the Belfast International Art Festival was broadcast on Thursday. Another interesting solo play, “Porul”, directed by Rajesh Karthy, was performed by Kannan Unni. Live theatre performances, digital theatre, and music programmes are parts of the Hope Fest, which began on Wednesday and is scheduled to conclude on Friday. The festival formally took off on Wednesday with the staging of the play “Evolution”, directed by Jose Koshy. It was staged largely as a solo performance by actor Adat Gopalan with Vivek Roshan performing a supporting role.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/riveting-performance-showcased-at-hope-fest/articleshow/88600293.cms||T Ramavarman

Currently, the state government has prepared draft of the mineral policy that needs to be approved by the cabinet. At an event in Mine Welfare Association Center, Jaipur, the trustee of Mines Labor Protection Campaign Rana Sengupta said, “Mining policy will not just work for the protection and safeguard of mine workers but also prevent the disastrous impact on forest and environment in totality.” In the event, which was addressed by secretary of INTUC Jagdish Shrimali, advocate P Selvi and Palak Mahechaamong others, Sengupta said, “The current government in its manifesto had promised to set up a Mine Worker Welfare board, but it has not been done.” Efficient utilisation of DMF came into discussion where the members said that the money could be spent with more productivity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-urged-to-make-mining-policy-not-mineral/articleshow/88576564.cms||---

We converted it to use solar power. It is based on GSM technology. Based on information on movement of elephants near the track, the station master of the Walayar railway station can send an SMS to the device to trigger it,” an official said.A female elephant and two calves were killed after being hit by the Mangaluru-Chennai express train while crossing track A on November 26. The railways and the forest department are taking preventive steps to avoid such incidents. Solar-powered lights were installed at some places and plans are afoot to install solar-powered fences to block the entrance of elephants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/sound-of-bees-tigers-to-ward-off-elephants-from-rail-tracks/articleshow/88576000.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Seers accused of hate speeches share a laugh with cop, video viral||HARIDWAR: A video showing seers who have been accused of delivering hate speeches at the recently-organised Dharam Sansad in the city sharing a laugh with a police inspector while submitting a complaint to him is raising eyebrows. The video was taken on Tuesday when the seers submitted a complaint against maulanas (Muslim clerics), who they alleged were "conspiring against Hindus". In the video, Jitendra Narayan Tyagi alias Waseem Rizvi, former head of the Shia Waqf Board, who is an accused in the hate speech case, can be seen handing over a copy of the complaint to inspector Rajendra Singh Kathait of Haridwar city police station, even as the other seers huddle around them. Sadhvi Annapurna Bharati, another accused in the hate speech matter, can be seen telling Kathait: "Please register the complaint and thereafter a message should go out from your side that you are not biased and you will conduct a probe that is fair and just." To this, Yati Narasinghanand, head priest of the Dasna temple, who had organised the Dharam Sansad, jokingly says, "Why unbiased? He is our boy, he will be on our side." During the entire clip, Kathait can be seen smiling while holding a copy of the seer's complaint. Asked to comment, Kathait told TOI that the place shown in the video is the Shambhavi Dham ashram where he had gone to serve notices to Waseem Rizvi and Annapurna in connection with the police cases registered against them. “During the visit, the seers in the ashram said they had an application to give me and I received it. That’s all,” he said. He added that “the only time I spoke was when a seer said that justice should be done, and my response as a police officer was that it will be done. How can I be held accountable for what others were saying during that time?” Watch Uttarakhand: Seers accused of hate speeches share a laugh with cop, video viral||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/seers-accused-of-hate-speeches-share-a-laugh-with-cop-video-viral/articleshow/88575227.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
