"The actual price of petrol should be Rs 40 to Rs 45 per litre. But people are being forced to pay Rs 108 per litre. The cost of LPG domestic cylinder refill is nearly Rs 1,000. While the Telangana government is not reducing the VAT on petrol and diesel, Narendra Modi government at the centre is not reducing the price in tune with the decrease in crude oil prices in the international market," said Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy. He was addressing a public meeting at Chevella crossroads after completing a 10-km padayatra taken up as part of a nationwide Jan Jagran Abhiyan call given by the AICC leadership against the rising prices of essential commodities. The TPCC chief announced that two MPTCs of the ruling TRS, Kavali Sujatha and Sattaiah have joined the Congress in protest against the failure of BJP and TRS Governments in keeping inflation under check. Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power on the promise of bringing back black money stashed in foreign banks and that he would deposit Rs 15 lakh each in the bank accounts of citizens. Modi has not only failed to fulfil this promise but has not given 2 crore jobs every year as promised by him, he said. “The BJP government should have given 14 crore jobs and Telangana government at least 50 lakh jobs. Both the governments have failed to give employment to youth and the unemployment rate is at an all-time high in the country,” Revanth said. He announced that the Congress would continue its agitation until the BJP-TRS governments respectively purchased every grain produced by the paddy farmers in Telangana. AICC general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh said the common man is suffering the most in the country due to rising prices of essential commodities. The mishandling of the economy by the Narendra Modi-led BJP government is the reason for the high rate of inflation. The Congress will continue to fight for the cause of common man who should throw their support to the Congress in the next elections, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/common-man-suffering-the-most-due-to-essential-commodities-price-rise-congress/articleshow/88364525.cms||Roushan Ali

Addressing ‘ Mahangai Hatao Yatra’ organised by Uttar Pradesh Congress as part of its poll campaign, Rahul spoke about the true meaning of a Hindu as someone who only follows the path of truth and never converts his fear into violence, hate and anger. “A ‘ Hindutvavadi’ bathes alone in the Ganga while a Hindu bathes with crores of people. (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi says he is a Hindu, but when did he protect the truth? The PM said he would create two crore jobs, where did he do so? He asked people to bang thalis to get rid of Covid… Hindu or Hindutvadi,” Rahul asked. Taking a jibe at the PM for his holy dip during the inauguration of Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi, he said: “For the first time, I saw just one person taking bath in the Ganga, (he) removed Yogi (Adityanath), sidelined Rajnath Singh... The entire world saw only one person bathing in the Ganga…,” he said. Speaking about the difference between Mahatma Gandhi and his assassin Nathuram Godse, he said, “Mahatma Gandhi spent his life understanding truth and then there is Godse, a ‘ Hindutvavadi’. Nobody calls him (Godse) a ‘Mahatma’ (a revered soul) because he killed a Hindu who always spoke the truth… Godse was a coward, a weak man. He could not face his fear.” Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also attacked the Centre and UP government by stating that the the PM and the UP CM were weaving a network of lies to establish that the fate of people in the country was changed for the better. “However, every single person in the country knows the reality,” she said. Priyanka called upon the people to do away with the BJP government in UP in 2022 if they want actual development and growth for themselves and for their children. She reiterated the importance of women in politics and said the Congress was the only party to have fulfilled the first promise even before the elections by giving 40% of its tickets to women candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rahul-targets-pm-says-hindutva-follower-bathes-alone-in-ganga/articleshow/88364484.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Addressing media persons here on Saturday, AAP Ludhiana Lok Sabha incharge Amandeep Singh Mohi and Punjab spokesperson Ahaab Singh Grewal alleged that a serious effort is being made by the Congress government to illegally appoint junior, incompetent officers who will be beholden to the government and will do their bidding during the elections. AAP appealed to the election commission to take note of this “serious illegality and attempt to interfere” with the process of the upcoming elections in the state. “The just demand of the officers to restore their earlier 1993 pay scales was used and deliberately dragged for 6 months so that they would be forced to go on strike thus giving a chance to the Congress government to appoint their own people instead,” they alleged. Mohi and Grewal further 'elaborated' how this scheme was being executed by the government under the garb of penalising the striking officers.  They alleged that Congress government has taken steps including 58 of the striking officers have been transferred, majority of them to the head office to get them out of the way and striking officers have been penalised in various ways. AAP leader alleged that an ADC development of a district has been penalised by being denied a promotion for daring to stand up, while two other officers of deputy director rank have been promoted for towing the government line. They further alleged that after openly threatening the striking officers a DDPO of a district who was spearheading the strike has been punished and sent to another district. Mohi and Grewal alleged that the president of BDPO association who is 7 months pregnant has been shunted to Fazilka. They added that in an “attempt to influence” polls large scale “improprieties have” been done. AAP leader said that eight panchayat officers have been “illegally appointed” as BDPOs in contravention of the Panchayati Raj act an example being a Panchayat officer who has been appointed as BDPO for the 5th time to “please the minister”.  “Also to put things into perspective the scale of the manipulation, out of the 150 odd BDPOs in Punjab 50 plus Junior Gram Sewaks, Panchayat officers, sepos, accountants, accounts clerks who could have never become BDPOs have illegally promoted in contravention of principle of seniority and rules and thus making them beholden to the congress government and therefore by posting them to such crucial posts at this critical juncture just before the elections the government is making a blatant attempt to post pliable officers in key positions across Punjab. And more such illegal appointments and transfers are on the way,” the leaders alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/serious-effort-by-congress-government-to-manipulate-poll-process-alleges-aap/articleshow/88364185.cms||Shariq Majeed

The civic authorities had recently asked the bank to vacate the premises so that the sewer could be cleaned. Videos of the blast site aired on TV stations showed portions of the bank premises and an adjacent fuel station blown to smithereens. Windows in other nearby buildings were shattered while several parked cars and motorcycles were damaged. Dr Sabir Memon, a doctor at Karachi’s Trauma Centre, said at least four among the injured were in a critical condition. He said the injuries did not appear to have been caused by shrapnel, as is the case in explosions triggered by terrorists. A few hours after the initial blast, another smaller explosion took place at the same location even as rescue operations were underway. No further casualties were reported, although there is a possibility of some people being still trapped under the rubble, officials said. Many sewage channels in Karachi have been covered, mostly illegally, by constructing concrete structures over them. Karachi, which is responsible for 60 per cent of Pakistan’s economic output, is a congested city with rampant unregulated construction and inadequate municipal services.

After the Omicron scare, the government designated Lok Nayak Hospital, the capital’s largest hospital, for Omicron patients. The separate isolation units for Omicron in private hospitals will create more healthcare facilities for the patients and will address panic among people. The four hospitals are Max Smart Super Speciality Hospital, Saket; Batra Hospital & Research Centre, Tughlakabad Institutional Area; Fortis Super Specialty Hospital, Vasant Kunj and Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital. “In order to augment the capacity of institutional isolation facility in the private sector for Covid positive international passengers who have traveled from or transited through the countries classified as "Countries At Risk" as per the central government guidelines, the authorities of Batra Hospital & Research Centre, Tughlakabad Institutional Area; Fortis Super Specialty Hospital, Vasant Kunj and Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital are hereby directed to establish separate (isolation) unit for such passengers on payment basis with immediate effect and to follow the SOPs issued by MotlFW, Gol from time to time,” an order issued by the health department stated. The WHO has classified Omicron as variant of concern. Earlier this month the Delhi government asked authorities of Max Smart Super Specialty Hospital, Saket to establish separate (isolation) unit for Covid positive international passengers who have travelled from or transited through "Countries At Risk". Altogether 12 Covid positive international passengers were admitted in Max Smart Super Specialty Hospital, Saket as on December 15. Now five hospitals are available for the treatment of Omicron patients. The Covid cases are slowly rising in the capital. Delhi reported 86 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday which is the highest in past some months. According to the latest health bulletin the positivity rate in the capital stood at 0.13% which is one of the highest in recent times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhis-four-private-hospitals-asked-to-establish-omicron-isolation-units/articleshow/88362323.cms||Alok KN Mishra

The J&K Congress leadership also demanded rollback of the order that allows agricultural land to be used to set up any activity, including industrial. The J&K government had, a few days ago, issued an order that said agricultural land can be utilised for any purpose. Referring to Union home minister Amit Shah’s parliament speech, Bukhari said in a statement that agricultural land in J&K is supposed to be safeguarded by the government against any kind of fiddling with the land-use status. He regretted that many arbitrary decisions, including the recent one on the land-use policy, have been rolled out, resulting in an unwanted increase in alienation among the people. "Such policy decisions are the prerogative of an elected government and the present dispensation should desist from taking such unilateral moves that put a question mark on its mandate," Bukhari remarked. He said that in view of the assurances given by the Union government from time to time in this regard, and in light of the directions of the Supreme Court and the J&K high court, no permission should be granted for conversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes, especially for non-domiciles of J&K. "The J&K high court has also barred conversion of agricultural land in J&K in view of the fast shrinking agricultural land mass and its repercussions on overall crop production, which has witnessed a drastic fall in the last many years," he observed. Bukhari said that the latest decision on the land-use policy will open the floodgates for non-agricultural activities and will further increase the dependency of the people of J&Kashmir on import of food grains to manage their food requirements. "There is no doubt the agriculture land utility in J&K has diminished during the last few decades owing to the growing population and housing requirements, but the government should at least ensure that in such circumstances permission for change of land use is not granted rampantly and, more so, not in favour of non-domiciles of J&K," he said. J&K Pradesh Congress Committee president Ghulam Ahmed Mir, too, said agricultural land needs to be protected in J&K rather than changing its status from agricultural to non-agricultural land. Mir also demanded a rollback of the decision, which is bound to cause restlessness in Jammu as well as in Kashmir. Mir urged the government not to disturb the land status in J&K as that would lead to further disappointment and restlessness among the people, which has to be avoided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/apni-partys-bukhari-takes-strong-exception-to-change-in-land-use-policy-congress-too-demands-rollback-of-decision/articleshow/88364679.cms||M Saleem Pandit

In a tweet, J&K Peoples Conference put out a statement made earlier by the NC that participation in proceedings of delimitation commission would be tantamount to accepting August 5 decisions and it is unwilling to do so. “Please at least have the courtesy to show even some pretence and explain how it was tantamount to endorsement then and not now. Digital world. Digital proof. 'Chit bhi meri patt bhi meri' won't work. Era of multiple speeches in Srinagar and Delhi and in multiple places is over,” Lone tweeted. In another tweet, the party asked NC what compelled it to participate in proceedings of delimitation commission. "These are the utterances of Dr Farooq Abdullah. What changed between then and now for the NC to now participate. Is it not tantamount to endorsing August 5 decisions now? There is a limit on monopoly on morality," the party tweeted. The NC had earlier boycotted proceedings of the panel, saying it is the product of Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act, 2019 which it had challenged in the Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sajjad-lone-slams-nc-over-u-turn-on-delimitation-commission/articleshow/88364765.cms||---
---||World||Hindus in Britain to get their first purpose-built crematorium||LONDON: Hindus in Britain are going to get their first purpose-built Hindu crematorium complete with a large ceremony hall, two private ritual rooms, shower facilities, a crematory hall and a separate canteen building after a landmark decision was made to grant planning permission. The Planning Inspectorate on December 16 granted Anoopam Mission UK planning permission for the crematorium on its 15-acre site near Denham, allowing its appeal against Buckinghamshire Council, which had refused planning permission on September 4, 2020, stating that it was "an inappropriate development in the green belt, which would encroach on the countryside". The proposed crematorium will be located in the grounds of the Hindu temple at the Shree Swaminarayan Spiritual Cultural and Community centre and will be able to cater for up to 500 attendees. In its letter to Buckinghamshire Council, when making the original application, Satish Chatwani, international president of the Anoopam Mission UK, wrote that the "experience of a Hindu" funeral was missing in other crematoria in the UK. The letter explained how death is one of the samskaras (rites of passage) of a Hindu and that even though electric cremators can replaced the tradition of burning the body on a wooden pyre, it is the ceremony and ritual that surrounds the cremation of a Hindu that make a Hindu funeral. "Cemeteries are provided across the country for the Muslim and Jewish communities to bury and honour their dead as befits their beliefs; that there is no such provision for Hindus to properly carry out this last act of faith is a betrayal of our rights and our contribution to British society," he wrote. Non-Hindu crematorium services in Britain are much shorter than Hindus require, the crematoriums often cannot accommodate the large numbers that attend Hindu funerals; slots cannot be found in the short time frame after death that Hindus require, there are no dedicated spaces for pre-ceremony rituals such as opening the coffin and carrying out aarti and pradakshina. Nor are there shower facilities or dining facilities. As such, Hindus have to use several venues: the home, the funeral parlour, the crematorium and the temple, disjointing the ceremony. In her decision, planning inspector Katie McDonald wrote the Hindu community in this area were "disadvantaged by being denied the opportunity to fully observe their cultural and religious beliefs and traditions" and this was so significant that it "outweighed the harm to the green belt. "Just as dedicated cemeteries exist for followers of other faiths in this country, deaths in the Hindu community should be afforded this dignity," she said. Letters and petitions, with over 2,000 signatures of support, were submitted and Bob Blackman MP and Lord Jitesh Gadhia spoke in favour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/hindus-in-britain-to-get-their-first-purpose-built-crematorium/articleshow/88364852.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||Goa||FC Goa settle for a point against high-flying Hyderabad||Bambolim: FC Goa maintained their unbeaten record against Hyderabad FC with an engaging 1-1 draw, but it was a struggle at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on Saturday. Joel Chianese deservingly put high-flying Hyderabad ahead in the 54th minute with a close-range header, while Airam Cabrera equalised just after the hour mark in a game that could have gone either way. With 11 points from their last five games, Hyderabad are now second, four points behind defending champions Mumbai, while Goa are seventh, a point less than ATK Mohun Bagan and two behind Odisha FC who they face next on Christmas eve. Juan Ferrando was forced to make changes to the Goa team that won two games in a row with Jorge Ortiz suspended. Cabrera took his place, while Princeton Rebello stepped into the boots of Glan Martins. For Hyderadad, coach Manolo Marquez’s hand was forced as Edu Garcia broke the bio-secure bubble and was sent into isolation. Chianese was a natural replacement. The Australian did try to justify the faith with some fine runs. Had it not been for an alert Goa goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh, who dived low to parry away a grounder, the Australian striker could have opened the account in the opening half. Bartholomew Ogbeche was Hyderabad’s other striking weapon, lively all through the night, though the Nigerian striker’s attempts lacked either power or direction. Goa had plenty of the ball but, without the pace and precision of Ortiz, rarely troubled rival goalkeeper Laxmikant Kattimani. Alberto Noguera, Edu Bedia and Princeton took control of the midfield, pressed high, but didn’t create any opening for either Cabrera or Devendra Murgaonkar. Goa didn’t have a shot on goal in the opening 45 minutes. The second half was different. Open, see-saw, and highly engaging. Hyderabad surged ahead in the 54th minute when Ashish Rai flicked the ball for Nikhil Poojary, who ran down the right flank and essayed a cross right into the heart of Goa’s danger zone where an unmarked Chianese gleefully headed inside the nets. Goa were clearly rattled. They have been behind in three previous games, all of which they lost. This time it proved to be different. Noguera split open the defence with a through ball which Devendra intercepted, cut past the onrushing goalkeeper, only to strike the post. Fortunately for him, and Goa, Cabrera was lurking inside the box and pounced on the rebound. The teams could have won all points in the closing stages of the match. While substitutes Aniket Jadhav and Aaren D’Silva both could not maintain their composure when they had the sight of goal, Kattimani proved to be the saviour for Hyderabad when he acrobatically tipped over Noguera’s attempt. Hyderabad should be happy they are now closer to Mumbai. Goa will be glad they got a point from a losing position for the first time, though if they were more enterprising towards the closing stages, it could have been more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-settle-for-a-point-against-high-flying-hyderabad/articleshow/88364951.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||Refereeing errors too much to take for Kerala Blasters this season: Karolis||Panaji: Kerala Blasters FC sporting director Karolis Skinkys says it’s not normal that the club has been at the receiving end of match-deciding refereeing decisions in three of their five matches this season. Kerala Blasters have had goals disallowed (against SC East Bengal), penalty denied (against ATK Mohun Bagan) and a goal scored from an offside position being counted. It’s just five games into their Indian Super League (ISL) campaign and the calls for better refereeing is growing louder. “In five games (so far), three times we have had match-deciding mistakes against us, sometimes more than just one mistake (in a game),” Karolis told TOI on Saturday. “That’s a little bit too much. You can always tolerate mistakes. You always understand that referees are also human, they can make mistakes. That’s normal. In a season of 20 matches, you can have one match-deciding mistake, not four or five in three matches. It's simply too much.” Kerala Blasters officially complained against the “gross incompetence” of referee R Venkatesh, who officiated two of their games. “It was important for our club to react. Everyone in this organisation is working hard. The players are working hard, they fight on the field, and we must protect them. I would call this disrespectful behaviour against club and the players (from the referees),” said Karolis. The sporting director has been in India for the last two seasons and has seen a clear pattern in how referees behave on the field. Most of them, he feels, are guided by how players react on the field and officials, on the bench. “The biggest issue is referees blowing the whistle going by players’ reactions and cheap and simple pressure from the bench. When you see (the games) from close, you see referees give positive whistle to the team that shouts louder. “By acting like this, the team, coaches, staff, who are longer in the league, you can see the difference. Those who have spent more time here, they shout more and know, doing this, they can get some kind of benefit in a few whistles per match. “This is killing football. Referees should have some standard of judgment and keep the standard same for all teams in all games. They need to be stricter about the reactions. It’s not normal that sometimes simple dives – I won't mention the games – get red cards for the opponents. And I am not speaking about our games here,” said Karolis. After losing their opening game against last year’s finalists ATK Mohun Bagan, Kerala Blasters are now unbeaten in four games. They are placed eighth with six points and will need to start winning games to move closer to a playoff spot for the first time since 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/refereeing-errors-too-much-to-take-for-kerala-blasters-this-season-karolis/articleshow/88365040.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Jammu||Held for sharing ‘hate’ post on Gen Rawat, Jammu school co-founder apologises, gets bail||JAMMU: Sabbah Haji, the former director and co-founder of Haji Public School in the remote mountain village of Breswana in Doda district of eastern Jammu, was released on bail on Friday following her arrest last week for sharing an offensive social media post that called CDS Gen. Bipin Rawat a “war criminal” after he died in a helicopter crash on December 8. She spent four days in custody and apologised in writing for the post. A first class executive magistrate gave Sabbah, 39, bail on a personal bond of Rs 50,000 after she submitted her written apology. The magistrate said security agencies would monitor her activities for a year. The post on Gen. Rawat that Sabbah shared attracted widespread criticism against the not-for-profit English-medium school she and her mother founded in 2009 in her native village, accessible only after a trek of three-four hours through mountainous terrain that remains snowed out in winter. Several people called out the school and demanded its closure. The school management fired her from her position and clarified that “a recent distasteful media post during the rounds has nothing to do with the school and that the said person has acted in their individual capacity after their tenure with the school ended”. Her father Saleem Haji said: “We are in the process of looking for a new director for the school.” He defended Sabbah, saying all “children make mistakes and she has repented for hers…She had shared the post, not made such remarks herself”. However, sharing objectionable social media posts is equally damaging and punishable under law. The Dubai-born, Bengaluru-educated Sabbah has been quite active on social media, often posting activities of her family-run school that was lauded for bringing quality education to one of the remotest corners of J&K. In 2017, she received an award from the J&K government for social reforms and empowerment. The co-ed school that started from the Haji family home with a couple of kindergarteners now has more than 450 students up to Class X from several nearby villages. “My village, my school, and my people in a little village I call home…are blissfully unaware of the political machinations in Delhi and Srinagar…” she wrote on her blog. That is “…why I have such hopes for the children of my village to grow up untainted by the disturbances and anger and resentment and lack of opportunity that unfortunately permeates normal life in ‘Kashmir proper’.” A postgraduate in English literature, she has earlier worked as a content writer and an accountant in Bengaluru until she decided to settle down in Breswana. Helped by her parents and a businessman uncle, the Haji Amina Charity Trust was formed in Doda in 2005 and this funds the school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jammu/held-for-sharing-hate-post-on-gen-rawat-jammu-school-co-founder-apologises-gets-bail/articleshow/88364855.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||Only 18% pass in orthopaedics: Results in diplomate of national board exam leave doctors stunned||NEW DELHI: Less than one in five doctors doing post-graduation in orthopaedics passed the final theory exam conducted by the National Board of Examination (NBE). In ENT, almost two-thirds failed the exam. Similarly, just over 36% passed the exam in paediatrics. The results announced by the NBE on November 24 were a shock to many doctors doing diplomate of national board (DNB). DNB is a post-graduate course considered equivalent to MD/MS, but is conducted in private hospitals and institutions and administered by NBE. Doctors had been assured that the hardship and disruption in studies due to Covid would be taken into consideration when conducting the exams and in marking them. However, students claimed that the pass percentages show that along with an unreasonably difficult paper, the evaluation must have been extremely harsh. Senior officials in NBE blamed the poor results on poor preparation by doctors during Covid. Those specialising in orthopaedics pointed out that if Covid was the reason, the results ought to have been uniformly poor across all specialties. However, among specialities in which over 50 students appeared, the pass percentage was almost 90% in obstetrics and gynaecology, and in dermatology and well over 60% in several others including general surgery, ophthalmology, radio diagnosis and psychiatry. “DNB orthopaedics is quite high up in preference and so only people with a decent rank in the NEET PG exam get the specialty. Hence, it can’t be that more than 80% of doctors specialising in orthopaedics are poor students. If the poor result is attributed to substandard training at the institute, NBE is to be held responsible for giving accreditation to poor quality institutions. However, this cannot be true because some of the institutes which have seen zero candidates passing are among the best,” said a resident doctor in orthopaedics. According to data that NBE shared with TOI, the pass percentage of DNB pediatrics has been consistently low over the last three exams, the highest being 43.4% in the June 2020 session. The president of the Association of National Board Accredited Institutions (ANBAI) and the head of the department of orthopaedics and spine surgery in Ganga Hospital, Dr S Rajasekaran, said that ANBAI has written to the NBE to consider reevaluation before publication of results if there is an abnormally low pass percentage in any specialty. “We have also made a strong plea that at least 50% of the examiners must be from NBE institutions,” he added. “Only those clearing the theory exam can appear for the practicals. So the final result of those who pass the practical exam could be even lower,” said an orthopaedic resident who had failed and is appearing for the next DNB exam being held from December 16 to 19. Many resident doctors pointed out that there was not even a month between the results of the last exam being announced and the next one being held. “It ensures that students have no time to challenge the results as they would immediately get busy preparing for the next chance to clear the exam,” said a resident doctor specialising in paediatrics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/only-18-pass-in-orthopaedics-results-in-dnb-exam-leave-doctors-stunned/articleshow/88365466.cms||Rema Nagarajan

It is spreading significantly faster than the Delta variant in countries with documented community transmission, with a doubling time between 1.5–3 days,” said WHO’s technical brief to member-countries. The saving grace so far has been Omicron’s lower virulence even though its spread underlines the need for measures like masks, sanitisation and avoidance of large gatherings along with vaccination. The UN health agency said it remains uncertain to what extent the observed rapid growth rate can be attributed to immune evasion, intrinsic increased transmissibility or a combination of both. Preliminary data also suggests there is a reduction in neutralising titres against Omicron in those who have received a primary vaccination series or who have had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may suggest a level of humoral immune evasion. Humoral immunity is the process of adaptive immunity manifested by the production of antibodies that develops in bone marrow. The number of people infected with the Delta variant in the UK were found to be doubling every 11 days, according to a study conducted by the Imperial College of London based on analysis of swab tests taken between May 20 and June 7. “Given current available data, it is likely that Omicron will outpace Delta where community transmission occurs,” the latest WHO update said. In India, while overall Covid-19 cases continue to be below 10,000 for around 20 days, health authorities have cautioned against complacency highlighting examples of countries like the UK and France that are witnessing a surge powered by Omicron despite high-vaccination rate and exposure to the Delta variant. A total of 7145 new Covid-19 cases were recorded from across the country on Friday. Active caseload currently stands at 84,565 cases. This includes Omicron-infected cases but Delta continues to be the dominant variant so far, according to officials. While some studies from the UK show that the risk of reinfection from Omicron is higher than Delta and there are no signs of the infection being milder than Delta, the UN health agency maintained there are still limited data on the clinical severity of Omicron. “More data are needed to understand the severity profile and how severity is impacted by vaccination and pre-existing immunity. Hospitalisations in the UK and South Africa continue to rise, and given rapidly increasing case counts, it is possible that many healthcare systems may become quickly overwhelmed,” WHO said. As of December 16, the Omicron variant has been identified in 89 countries across all six WHO regions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/omicron-cases-doubling-in-3-days-in-areas-with-community-transmission-who/articleshow/88365581.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Delhi||DRDO scientist set off IED in Rohini court to kill lawyer: Cops||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police's special cell arrested a scientist, identified as Bharat Bhushan Kataria, after an exhaustive investigation into the Rohini court blast on December 9, Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana revealed at a press conference on Saturday. The scientist, who is currently being interrogated in custody, allegedly wanted to eliminate a lawyer with whom he had a long-standing enmity. TOI was the first to report on Saturday that the blast was not terror related and had been orchestrated by a DRDO scientist. Kataria started planning the attack a month ago and procured the essentials through e-commerce sites and other means, which cops are verifying. He used an anti-theft system meant for bikes as a remote control to trigger the blast. He is suspected to have learned the technique online using DIY videos and web pages, apart from using his professional expertise. However, the bag used by Kataria to carry explosives and his suspicious movements caught on CCTV cameras blew his cover. The investigation has revealed that Kataria and the advocate, Amit Vashisht, were living in the same building till about three years ago. "They have a long-standing dispute of over 10 years and have filed over a dozen civil and criminal cases against each other. One such case against Kataria was listed on December 9 at room 102, Rohini court, for arguments on charge," Asthana said. Kataria, who worked with the Defence Research and Development Organisation reached the court around 9.30am and went inside room 102 around 10.15am and searched for Vashisht. He noticed the lawyer sitting in the back row and casually walked to the back. He then placed the bag with the IED behind Vashisht. Kataria then walked out and triggered the IED from a safe distance with the remote. At 10.35 am, he walked out of the court complex from the Ring Road side and went home in his Ertiga car, police said citing their probe. Kataria had managed to prepare a powerful nitrate-based IED. Since the circuit was improperly woven, only the detonator exploded, leaving behind unburnt powder and preventing large-scale damage. Only a cop standing nearby was injured and the targeted lawyer escaped unhurt. "Incriminating material apart from the attire of an advocate used in the incident have been recovered from the residence of the accused," said Asthana, who closely monitored the entire investigation. The low-intensity blast was reported around 10.25am. A case under sections of attempted murder (307 IPC) and Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act was registered at the special cell. "Almost 200 cops comprising DCP Rajiv Ranjan Singh, ACP Ved Prakash and others from the northern range began their probe while other units of the cell provided inputs," a senior cop said. Preliminary findings of the National Security Guard and forensic lab indicated the use of easily available materials in fabricating the IED. Components of the IED, including chemicals like nitrate and potassium chlorate and nuts and bolts as shrapnel, were identified from the debris and exhaustive efforts were made to track the source of all such components. The bag used to place the IED was tracked to a Mumbai-based medical equipment making multinational company and thereafter its distributors, including the Delhi-based stockist, were examined. Stationery shops selling the kind of file cover found in the bag with the IED were identified. Distributors of the automotive anti-theft mechanism used in the IED were identified and examined. During investigation, over 1,000 vehicles that entered the court complex on the day of the blast were verified. Footage of around 120 CCTV cameras inside and outside the court complex was studied minutely to identify a suspect. Voluminous telephonic data was analysed. Based on CCTV footage and eyewitness accounts, several persons present in the court complex were identified and verified. The day's litigation list of that courtroom was also scanned and people related to cases examined. A week-long exercise led the cops to zero in on a dozen suspicious characters. Of them, Bharat Bhushan Kataria became a person of interest. His case was listed for hearing on the day of the blast. His opposite party, Amit Vashisht, was seated in the row next to which the IED exploded. Vashisht said during questioning that he had seen Kataria in the court just before the blast. When cops dug deeper, they found Kataria was involved.

The minimum temperature in Rajasthan was recorded at -3.3°C in Fatehpur of Sikar district, and in neighbouring Churu, it was -1.1°C, according to the meteorological department. People in Jaipur woke up to the coldest morning of the season so far when a minimum temperature of 4.9°C, almost four degrees below normal, was recorded. Parts of Madhya Pradesh, including Bhopal, also experienced a cold wave on Saturday due to chilly winds coming from the North. The lowest minimum temperature of 4°C was recorded in Gwalior, Datia and in Nowgaon area of Chhatarpur district, said PK Saha, a meteorologist at IMD Bhopal office. The wave is the result of winds coming from Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand which have witnessed snowfall. "At -6 and 2.3°C, Srinagar and Jammu recorded the coldest night of the season so far on Saturday," a department official said. Pahalgam recorded -8.3°C and Gulmarg -8.5 as their minimum temperature. Meanwhile, Drass town of Ladakh recorded -20.3 and Leh -15.3 as the night's lowest temperature, the official added. Extreme cold conditions were witnessed across Uttarakhand on Saturday, with the Met department issuing a yellow alert in the state till December 24. On Friday, the lowest temperature was recorded in Ranichauri at -2.7°C. In Mussoorie, the temperature dipped to 2°C at night. As per IMD, the minimum average temperature in Uttarakhand on Saturday was 3.8°C , 3 notches less than normal, while average maximum temperature was 17.8°C, four notches below normal. A fresh spell of snowfall in the higher reaches of Himachal Pradesh has put Manali, Shimla, Solan, Kinnaur, Lahaul-Spiti, and Dalhousie under a cold wave. Water froze inside pipes in higher reaches of Chamba, Lahul-Spiti, Kinnaur, and Shimla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cold-wave-grips-north-india-rajasthans-sikar-churu-below-freezing-point/articleshow/88365639.cms||---

This was the second test of the two-stage solid propellant Agni-P missile, which has a dual redundant navigation and guidance system, after the first one on June 28. The Agni-P missile, the smallest and lightest among the entire Agni series of ballistic missiles, will further bolster India's strategic deterrence capabilities once it is fully operational after a series of "developmental and user trials". The missile, which was launched at 11.06am , "followed a text book trajectory to meet all mission objectives with high level of accuracy", a DRDO official. "This second flight-test has proven the reliable performance of all the advanced technologies integrated into the system," he added. Both defence minister Rajnath Singh and DRDO chairman Dr G Satheesh Reddy congratulated the team of scientists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-tests-n-capable-agni-prime-missile/articleshow/88365746.cms||---

He was 86. His relatives said he died of cardiac failure on Saturday afternoon. He is survived by two sons, both lawyers at Gujarat HC. Nanavati was born in 1935 and enrolled as an advocate at the Bombay high court in February 1958. He was elevated as a judge of the Gujarat HC in 1979. In 1993, he was transferred to the Orissa HC, where he served as its chief justice too. A year later, he was transferred to the Karnataka HC as its chief justice. In 1995, he was promoted to the Supreme Court. Nanavati retired in 2000. Immediately after his retirement, the NDA government at the Centre tasked him with investigating the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. He tendered his report in two volumes in 2005. In March 2002, the Modi government in Gujarat appointed him as the chairman of a commission which was probing the burning of the S-6 coach of the Sabarmati Express. Before he joined the commission, it had only a single member: Justice (retd) KG Shah. With his appointment as the chairman of the commission, the Gujarat government widened the scope of the inquiry to the post-Godhra riots. Justice Shah passed away some time later and Justice (retd) Akshay Mehta became a member of the commission. The commission submitted the final report on the riots in 2014 to then Gujarat CM Anandiben Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/justice-nanavati-who-probed-84-guj-riots-no-more/articleshow/88365769.cms||---
---||India||Response to migrants inhuman: Nobel laureate Abdulrazak Gurnah||NEW DELHI: There is this kind of inhuman response in Europe to migrants who are risking their lives, even dying, to escape violence and poverty,” says Abdulrazak Gurnah, whose novels exploring the refugee experience won him the Nobel prize for literature recently. He is only the second black African writer to win this honour. In an exclusive interview to TOI, he also took a dig at British home secretary Priti Patel, who recently floated a controversial plan to push back refugees crossing the Channel in small boats. Gurnah said he was surprised that even those who are children of refugees, such as the home secretary whose Indian family migrated to Uganda and then the UK, are displaying a lack of compassion towards migrants. “Should we be vilifying these migrants rather than treating them as people who, in most cases, are escaping violence, wars and poverty?” he says. It’s a subject he feels very strongly about since he himself arrived in the UK as a refugee fleeing unrest in Zanzibar. In fact, it was the sense of alienation he felt as a student in a foreign land that turned him into a writer. "Sometimes we write to clarify our thinking or just simply to try and disentangle ideas or feelings," says Gurnah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/response-to-migrants-inhuman-nobel-laureate-abdulrazak-gurnah/articleshow/88365771.cms||Neelam Raaj
---||India||CAG: Noida, an Industrial authority, but has just 5% land for industry||NEW DELHI: Set up under the UP Industrial Area Development Act 1976, the Noida Authority failed in its main objective of promoting industry, the performance audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has pointed out. The CAG report, tabled in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly on Friday, said only 5% of the total land acquired by the Noida Authority could be developed for its main purpose, which was industry. It did try to promote industrialisation with lower prices for industrial plots, subsiding these through profits earned from the sale of land in segments like residential and commercial. However, the CAG observed, the Noida Authority was required to ensure that the benefit of these subsidised rates was passed on to genuine industrialists who were interested in investing at the earliest and not to investors or traders of land. Glaring instances of undue favours in screening of applications and discretionary allotment of industrial plots were found by the CAG. The deviation from procedure is so stark that the state government on September 30, 2020 directed the Noida Authority that in no case should an industrial plot be allowed for any use other than those mentioned in allotment conditions. The CAG calculated the monetary difference between actual benefits to the allottees and the charges levied for using industrial plots for commercial purposes to be to the tune of Rs 333.17 crore. Conversion charges for land in the mixed-use category were decided as 50% of the differential value of commercial and industrial property. The value of commercial property was much higher than that of industrial property. Later, the charge was reduced to 25% of the differential value on popular demand. Interestingly, the charges were further reduced to 10% of the differential value at the 186th board meeting on September 18, 2015 citing public demand for reduction, the CAG report said. Besides, conditions on deposit of conversion charges were further eased by the board in December 2017. Instead of full charges, 20% of charges were to be deposited initially and the rest in 10 instalments paid six months apart. The CAG observed that the reduction to 10% of the differential value was irregular and lacked justification as the suggestions of the public had been invited at the time of the initial reduction and duly considered. Thus, the CAG noted, the restricted applicability of the scheme along with reduction of charges in an arbitrary manner clearly indicated that special dispensation was extended to allottees of auto showrooms, art galleries and museums only. Mixed land-use facilities are available to such allottees on the ground floor of industrial plots on 25% of permissible floor area ratio (FAR). The CAG said Noida had identified 36 cases where allottees were using the properties for activities outside the allotment condition. Amongst them were 10 car showrooms that were using industrial properties. As of August 2020, only 10 allottees had deposited the conversion fees and no maps were approved under the mixed land-use policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cag-noida-an-industrial-authority-but-has-just-5-land-for-industry/articleshow/88365776.cms||---
---||India||Karnataka may make accused pay ‘forced conversion victim’ Rs 5L||BENGALURU: Karnataka’s proposed anti-conversion bill leaves the door ajar for converts to return to their previous faith without calling into question the possibility of duress or allurement, sources said ahead of the draft being placed before the Assembly. This notable exclusion is seen as being in tune with the demand raised by various outfits to bring back people who converted to Islam and Christianity from Hinduism through a “ghar wapsi (homecoming)” drive. The proposal to omit reconversion to one’s original faith from the purview of the bill might be discussed at the cabinet meeting scheduled for Monday, sources said. The draft of the Karnataka Protection of Right to Freedom of Religion Bill states that courts can order those found guilty of forcible conversion to pay a maximum compensation of up to Rs 5 lakh to the “victims”. It also seeks to declare null and void marriages solemnised with the sole purpose of unlawful conversion. The bill also proposes a three-year jail term if anybody forcibly converts minors, people of unstable mind and those belonging to any Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe. In the event of mass conversion, the guilty will be sentenced to three years in jail. The bill defines mass conversion as converting two or more people at a time. Repeat offenders are liable to get a jail term not less than five years. These penal provisions will also be applicable to institutions indulging in forced conversion. The bill places the burden of providing proof on the accused that religious conversion was not carried out through misrepresentation, allurement or force. The bill seeks to record the new religion of any convert and also allows the government to reclassify the person in terms of entitlement to social welfare benefits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/karnataka-may-make-accused-pay-forced-conversion-victim-rs-5l/articleshow/88365778.cms||Anil Gejji

"UP plus Yogi bahut hai upyogi (Uttar Pradesh plus Yogi have great utility)," he said, indicating that Adityanath would be the CM face of the party for the upcoming assembly elections. Modi made the comments after launching the Rs 36,230 cr worth six-lane Ganga e-way project in Shahjahanpur, pegged to be the longest in the country at 594 km. The expressway will connect the eastern and western regions of UP from Meerut to Prayagraj. The project is set to be completed in 2024. "This expressway will bring new industries and create employment opportunities for thousands of youths...," the PM said in his 40-minute speech to a crowd, which BJP leaders said was over one lakh-strong. Modi also took a dig at the opposition, saying: "You have seen how the money of the government was used by other parties. Today, it is being used by the government for development work. Earlier, these projects only started on paper so politicians filled their coffers. Today, these projects are ensuring that your money is saved and is in your pocket...There are some political parties that have problems with the country's heritage and development..." The PM also lauded the Yogi government for the law-and-order situation in west UP. He also said: "Before the BJP took charge, there was a saying that one should return home before sunset because people who flashed kattas (countrymade pistols) ruled the roads..."

With high levels of protection (seroprevalence) in participants at this point, the study concluded that a third booster, while a chunk of population is yet to get their second shots, may not be advisable, Dr Muralidhar Tambe, professor and Head of Community Medicine at BJMC, told TOI. The study also found that in all categories of the 558 healthcare workers (HCWs), who were part of the study, the antibody prevalence was above 90% months after completion of two vaccine doses. Dr Tambe said, “Though we found that the antibody prevalence decreased as the duration of interval increased after two doses of Covid vaccine, immunity levels remained high. Antibody positivity among the study participants was at 96.77% at three months post full vaccination, rising to 100% at four months, and then falling to 91.89% at seven months after the initial two doses.” Dr Tambe said overall, of the 558 HCWs who participated in the study, 94.4% were positive for Covid neutralising antibodies at the time of the study period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covishield-cover-high-7-months-after-2-doses-90-antibody-prevalence-seen-study/articleshow/88365780.cms||Neha Madaan
---||India||CAG: No fixed policy on Noida land pricing||NOIDA: How long does it take to decide a pricing mechanism for assets one owns? For the Noida Authority, 45 years has not been enough. A planning and development agency of its scale and responsibilities is yet to formulate standard guidelines to determine allotment prices for its land, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has said in its performance assessment report that was tabled in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly on Friday. Year-on-year, the central auditor found, land prices while launching schemes were fixed in an arbitrary manner without considering input costs, which is a basic operating principle. Because of this elementary flaw, land under different categories like residential, group housing, commercial and institutional was allotted at sub-par prices, resulting in revenue losses for both the Noida Authority and the state government because allottees paid lower stamp duty while executing lease deeds, the report said. Losses amount to Rs 16k cr: CAG The CAG has estimated potential losses to the tune of Rs 16,245 crore to the Noida Authority's books and 5% of the value (Rs 812 crore) towards stamp duty. Highlighting several anomalies, the auditor felt the reserve rates of land were intentionally underpriced, translating into profits for allottees, particularly real estate developers who bagged group housing plots. The central auditor also noted that the Noida Authority allowed exploitation of higher sellable area on both group housing and commercial plots by increasing floor area ratio (FAR) and ground coverage but did not seek any additional land premium from the allottees despite doling out substantial gains in the form of increased components. The audit report summarises the functioning of the Noida Authority over a period of 13 years between 2005 and 2018. It was its first such comprehensive performance assessment. At present, the Noida Authority has different rates for various categories of real estate. The city has sprawled out across 168 sectors, which come under five zones with A being the most premium and E being the least developed. Every year, the Noida Authority fixes the basic rate or reserve rate of a sector based on allowed usage of plots, which are offered through auctions to the highest bidder. However, over the years, there has been no consistency in the way these prices have been set, increased and decreased. The CAG evaluated various cost components beyond the land acquisition cost to examine how the authority determined the final price before arriving at the conclusion that the exercise was arbitrary. Findings revealed systemic deficiencies, injudicious reduction in rates and allowing increased exploitation of land (through increased FAR and ground coverage) at lower prices, among other inconsistencies. Decisions on prices were taken on the fuzzy concept of past practices. "There was no laid-down manual or procedure for inclusion or exclusion of the heads of expenditure and the manner in which such expenditure was to be calculated," said the CAG report. The Noida Authority also failed to produce any formal document that was used for calculating category-wise or sector-wise rates. Ritu Maheshwari, the current Noida CEO, told TOI a cost consultant agency had been engaged around a month ago. "They are going to frame guidelines. It will take two to three months to implement it and the procedure will be followed in the forthcoming allotment schemes," said Maheshwari. The audit team came across several anomalies in the responses of the Noida Authority on the subject and the procedure that was followed. Though the Authority said it went by the demand and supply scenario while revising the prices annually, besides a multitude of other factors, it was noticed that the prices were not revised during 2009-10 under any category. The reason assigned was global recession. It was during this same period that most group housing plots were allocated to builders. Without taking the approval of the state government, Noida Authority increased FAR and ground coverage (GC) in March 2011 for group housing and commercial plots. FAR was increased by 100% to 150% and GC by 10% to 15%. But allotment rates were not increased proportionately. The fixation of rates on the lower side caused a dent of Rs 14,000 crore to the authority, out of the total losses of Rs 16,245 crore, CAG estimated. The authority passed on benefits of a lower price regime to 55 group housing projects and to 20 big ticket commercial projects, CAG noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cag-no-fixed-policy-on-noida-land-pricing/articleshow/88365782.cms||Shalabh

Meanwhile, 32 major farmer organisations of Punjab, flush with success at getting the three farm laws repealed, met at Mullanpur Dakha on Saturday to discuss forming a political front to contest upcoming Punjab elections but failed to arrive at a conclusion. Options like forming a pressure group instead of a political party were also tossed about and the issue will be taken up again at the next meeting, some attendees said. The main point on which the majority of farm leaders did agree was that a final decision should be taken up with unanimity to ensure there was no room for bickering later. "The matter of a farmers' political front will be discussed again threadbare in the next meeting and a collective decision will be taken," farm union chiefs Buta Singh Burjgill and Ruldu Singh Mansa. Addressing reporters, Charuni said there was a need for change in the country. "The (traditional) parties have made politics a business and money to power and power to money (sic), and are repeating it. On the hunger index, our country is ranked 102 among 107 countries. According to a 2014 report, over 45% of children are suffering from malnutrition," said Charuni. "Politics has become polluted and corrupt. The country is being captured by the capitalists. To bring a change in that politics, due to which the country is suffering from hunger and (medical) treatment has become out of reach for the common person, we have launched Sanyukt Sangharsh Party. Today, our policies are not made by the Angrez (British) but by policymakers of our country who have promoted capitalists and didn't make policies for the common people. The motive of our party will be to cleanse politics by bringing forward good people and sidelining corrupt leaders who are looting the country," said Charuni. Charuni said, "Our party (SSP) will be secular and caste-neutral. Our party will work for the needs of society. We are moving ahead to save the country," Charuni said. He announced that his party will contest the 2022 Punjab assembly elections, adding that it has been registered with the Election Commission of India.  In other decisions, the farm groups confirmed they would attend the meeting to be called by Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi to raise pending demands. They intend to push for a debt waiver, ensuring sugarcane growers get the promised rate of Rs 360 per quintal, compensation for farmers whose cotton crop has been damaged by the pink bollworm, withdrawal of cases registered against farmers during the protests, supply of urea and proper compensation for land acquisitions for upcoming expressways in the state. The farm bodies decided by voice vote that only those toll plazas that promise not to increase charges would be allowed to resume operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farm-unions-discuss-plunge-into-politics/articleshow/88365783.cms||JK Singh

CIR was introduced in the city in December 2020 and in its nearly 10-month operation (till October this year), around Rs 70 crore belonging to nearly 6,500 cybercrime victims has been frozen in bank accounts of the fraudsters and their aides. These amounts will be returned to the victims through court proceedings. Till now, the facility was available only for Bengaluru citizens. In the backdrop of increasing cybercrimes, financial frauds in particular, cops have decided to extend it statewide by January-end. Director general and inspector general of police (DG-IGP) Praveen Sood said: “As of now, cybercrime victims from districts outside Bengaluru should dial 15526, the national helpline introduced by the ministry of home affairs. This helpline is handled by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Soon, there will be a dedicated staffer for the state-wide CIR facility who will work round-the-clock. The purpose is to put in our best efforts to stop money going to the hands of miscreants. CIR-Bengaluru has frozen around Rs 70 crore at bank accounts.” He requested the victims to approach the CIR helpline within two hours of occurrence of any fraud. Only then will it be possible to freeze the money. The main advantage of CIR is that victims can lodge the complaint over the phone, he added. Meanwhile, the state witnessed 6,368 cases in the first 10 months of the year. As per state police records, Bengaluru accounted for almost 80% cases — 5,004 between January and October. September saw the maximum cases (957) reported in Karnataka and it was 818 in Bengaluru. The lowest number of cases were reported across the state in May — 368. A senior officer, however, pointed out the drawbacks of CIR. “There are three important stages in handling the facility. First, the ‘call-taking officer’ will collect details from the victim and forward them to the investigating officer (IO). The IO will register the complaint and communicate with nodal officers about the banks to get the money frozen. The last two stages are crucial. Sometimes, there will be communication gaps between the IO and nodal officers for different reasons. At such times, miscreants would have withdrawn the cash,” he said, adding that all staff working for CIR should be periodically trained and updated with the latest modus operandi of cybercriminals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dial-112-to-file-cybercrime-plaints-across-state-soon/articleshow/88365812.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Experts propose measures to preserve architecture of Kodagu & Tulunadu||Bengaluru: Picturesque old Guthu houses with beautiful chaavadis, spacious courtyards drenched in rain, thick pillars and woodwork-heavy doors, small kitchens that open into dining areas and the attached sacred spaces — the ancestral houses of Tulunadu enchanted all on Saturday even as architects and academicians discussed their poor state now. During a discussion on the independent houses and forest shrines of Kodagu, Brinda Somaya, an architect and urban conservationist, lamented the irreversible loss of several architectural marvels in Kodagu. Attributing it to migration, harsh weather conditions and building maintenance difficulties, she stressed the need for documentation and living in harmony with nature. “Every part of these buildings, including choice of materials, construction methodology, patterns of building activity, spatial organisation and ritual meaning assigned to various aspects, reflects the governing principles of a highly organised and hierarchical traditional society,” said Somaya. From patrilinear joint families, the session moved on to Tulunadu, where a matrilinear setup was in place. But the reasons for the loss of heritage structures were identified to be similar. “There are hundreds of homes that are more than hundreds of years old. But many of them are in a sad state. With lifestyle changes and people moving to cities, many are not interested in them and the cost of maintenance is high. A few structures are retained because of their cultural significance,” said Gayathri Shetty, an architect involved in an upcoming publication on the building techniques of Dakshina Kannada. The ideas include turning them into hospitality projects. “Some of them can be as big as those that have 80 rooms. The courtyard can be further divided into various portions for functions such as weddings. This will bring in income that can be used for maintenance,” she said. “There is a need to develop a system of joint ownerships and trusts as the generations in the homes now come up to 80-120 members. We need to ensure that the structure is not sacrificed in the bargaining between members. These homes can also become areas to revive local arts,” she said. Sayeegeetha Hegde, a Tulu linguistic scholar, said: “There was a time when 80 people used to stay here. It is not just about the family, but an entire village and its heritage.” From memories of staying at the Kodagu homes to catching fish from paddy fields to watching elders lie down on a wooden bench attached to the window to supervise workers on the field, the architects shared nostalgic snippets during the session, held as part of Bangalore Literature Festival.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/experts-propose-measures-to-preserve-architecture-of-kodagu-tulunadu/articleshow/88365814.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||Bengaluru||I still have nightmares about Rio Olympics loss, says Sania Mirza||BENGALURU: Tennis superstar Sania Mirza’s Rio Olympics loss continues to haunt her five years on. “I am still unable to get over it and have nightmares. I suddenly wake up from sleep and have tears in my eyes. Coming that close and still being unable to get it was heartbreaking,” she said. Sania and Rohan Bopanna lost the mixed-doubles bronze medal match to a Czech pair. “After the match, we were on a one-hour bus journey to the airport and did not say a word. There was nothing to say. It was a dream that came so close [to fruition]. It was the first time I saw Rohan in tears,” she said. She, however, maintained the beauty of an athlete’s life is the chance to come back stronger. Sania also spoke about the incident of her being misrepresented as stamping on the Indian tricolour, her heartache then, sacrifices of her family, her sister who is in fashion business, and her wedding with cricketer Shoaib Malik. “I loved what I did. I enjoy the struggle, the pain I get when I get into the gym. And that is why I still hit the gym. My parents never made me feel like they were burdened,” she said. To a question on how she balances motherhood and tennis by travelling to tournaments with her son, she said: “I am asked this question a lot. I wish it was posed to men as well as even they travel with their children… It is indeed challenging. You have to adjust to different time zones, you have to get your son adjusted to that. But when he grows up, he will be proud he has a mother who did not kill her dream because she became a mother.” So does she expect to see more world-class tennis players from India soon? “All the players so far have come up not because of the system, but because of individual effort. We cannot expect miracles to happen overnight. But we can hope the system will get better,” she said. She was speaking after connecting virtually at the Bangalore Literature Festival on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/i-still-have-nightmares-about-rio-olympics-loss-says-sania/articleshow/88365815.cms||---

The miscreants smeared black paint on the statue, located near Sankey Tank, in an attempt to create communal disharmony, a police officer said. The incident came to light on Saturday morning after passers-by alerted cops, who cleaned the statue and deployed additional personnel to thwart any backlash. Police registered an FIR based on a complaint by Karnataka Maratha Welfare Association (KMWA) members. A senior police officer said all DCPs have been told to safeguard statues in their areas. More police personnel have been deployed at KSRTC terminal, where buses from Maharashtra arrive and depart.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/shivaji-statue-blackened-in-bluru-3-men-in-custody/articleshow/88365817.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Procure ICMR-approved testing kits to detect Omicron strain, TAC advises govt||Bengaluru: The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Covid management has suggested the state government procure S-gene target failure testing kits that can indicate the Omicron infection.At a recent meeting of the TAC, experts discussed solutions to quickly isolate those suspected to have been infected with Omicron, while genomic sequencing reports are awaited. “We need to consider the stress experienced by Covid-positive international travellers and hospitals waiting for genomic sequencing reports. Whether Omicron or not, the treatment does not differ. But this can help in early isolation and clear confusion to some extent,” said TAC members. The committee has recommended the government buy the Indian Council of Medical Research-approved ‘Ag Instalume’ by Agappe, a rapid molecular diagnostic testing kit for Covid-19 that can detect the Omicron strain. The kit has been developed in such a way that it detects the presence or absence of S gene (spike glyoprotein genes). In those affected with Omicron, the S gene component is negative, which is an indicator to isolate them early. Genomic sequencing can be done parallelly, TAC members added. The TAC has recommended two more similar testing kits — QRX approved by ICMR and COVIQWIK developed by the council. They are not yet available in the market. The TAC recommendations to the government as per its 140th meeting held on December 15 mention: “This is a molecular test called Reverse Transcriptase-Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP). It is less complicated and economical for the end user than RT- PCR.” The committee has mentioned three kits in its reports, including Agappe’s and RT-PCR testing kits looking for specific genes to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV2 in a swab sample. While N gene points to the presence or absence of nucleocapsid protein of the virus in a sample, ORF1 gene searches for the polyprotein. Mutations in the latest Omicron variant — B.1.1529 — have occurred in S gene that encodes the spike glycoprotein. If a sample is negative for S gene, it’s indicative of the presence of Omicron, which needs to be further confirmed via genomic sequencing. The conventional Covid RT-PCR test kits in use at present have reagents that detect the presence of N and ORF1 genes, but not S. S-gene target failure testing can be used to triage Covid-positive individuals among international passengers coming from at-risk countries. “To begin with, these kits need to be used in the triaging centre at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital only for those who test positive on arrival at international airports. If S gene is not detected in RT-PCR, then it’s likely to be Omicron and such patients can be isolated immediately. These kits take just about 45 minutes to give results. It’s high time they are procured,” said Dr CN Manjunath, member of TAC and clinical expert committee. He added usage of these kits can reduce waiting time and make triaging easy. “It needs to be further confirmed by genomic sequencing. S gene failure testing can filter out non-Omicron infected persons,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/procure-icmr-approved-testing-kits-to-detect-omicron-strain-tac-advises-govt/articleshow/88365819.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Bengalureans are taking their Christmas celebrations up a notch this year by bringing decor and delicious treats together. Mabel Kurian, a homemaker, said her 12-year-old child insisted on adding a gingerbread house to their Christmas decorations. “It looks beautiful and has an amazing fragrance,” the RT Nagar resident said, adding she was surprised with the variety available in the market. Shelza Chand, a pastry chef, said gingerbread houses have grown in popularity in the past couple of years. “It is built with edible cookies, icing, jellies and candies, and is smashed around the New Year to symbolise a new beginning,” she said, adding the Hansel and Gretel fairytale, in which two lost kids eat into a witch’s house made of gingerbread and cake, made it popular worldwide. Shelza is offering DIY (do-it-yourself) kits with Christmas cookies cut into templates, icing to hold the house together and a cake base. She also makes marzipan eggs for Easter every year. Freeda Lazar, founder of Freddie’s Baking Studio, which specialises in edible art, said people love gifting decorative Christmas cookies and keeping them as pieces of art on tables. Freddie’s cookies are handmade, hand-illustrated and design-heavy — like a snowman, gingerbread man, Christmas tree, Santa Claus and more in flavours such as chocolate, vanilla and cinnamon. The all-women studio, which employs skilled workers from local communities, also offers DYI kits for gingerbread houses. “The kit includes roofs, walls, with red and green icing. It’s a fun activity for kids and adults,” she said, adding that the cookies, without preservatives, will stay in good condition for 12 days. Foodhall at 1MG in Trinity Circle is offering stacked gingerbread trees that can be kept close to the Christmas tree and DIY cookies that can be hung on trees as edible ornaments. SMOOR has cinnamon star and gingerbread cookies as edible decorations. Vimal Sharma, founder-director and CEO of SMOOR, said children love eating them in various shapes and it becomes a fun game to put some out for Santa on Christmas eve. Christmas in cityBoth the Oberoi and Hopshaus Microbrewery, Whitefield Main Road are hosting Christmas Brunches on October 25 and 26 respectively. The Oberoi is also offering Yule logs, stollen, plum cakes etc. SteppinOut organised the Christmas-special night flea market at the Taj West End on Saturday. Magnolia Bakery is offering Christmas goodies and hampers with 6-inch Plum Cake, pies, Cookie Jars etc. Lagom Patisserie and All About That Bake also have a Christmas-special menu.

---||Bengaluru||From samples to kits, experts explain why genomic sequencing takes time||BENGALURU: Genomic sequencing reports are key to identifying the Omicron variant. But due to several factors, sequencing is taking a minimum of 5-8 days and the delay in results is leaving everyone, including patients and hospitals, on the edge. This situation was discussed at a recent meeting with chief minister Basavaraj Bommai as most Covid-infected persons are recovering by the time genomic sequencing results are out. STOI takes a look at why the process is slow. The sequencer requires over 300 samples to initiate the process, but only under 100 are sent in a day. Hence, sequencing is done once in three days. According to virologist Dr V Ravi, state nodal officer and chairman, committee for Covid-19 whole genome sequencing, one needs to understand that the sequencing is not like RT-PCR test and not all Covid-positive samples are suitable for it. He said only Covid-positive swab samples with Cycle Threshold (CT) value below 25 qualify for genomic sequencing, as the viral load will be more in those with low CT value. The value indicates the number of cycles in RT-PCR test needed to amplify viral RNA to reach a detectable level. Currently, with less than 400 cases a day, just about 10-12 samples would have CT value less than 25, he said. Dr Ravi said the chips used in the process require either 100 samples or over 300 at a time for the sequencing to be done. “The cost of the chip is Rs 2.5 lakh. The cost remains the same whether there are 10 samples or over 300. The situation here is not like that of the UK, where 80,000 persons are turning positive every day,” he said. Agreeing with Dr Ravi, another technical advisory committee member said genomic sequencing is like running an aircraft. “For an aircraft with a capacity of carrying 300 passengers, the cost remains the same irrespective of whether it has 10 or 300 on board. If there aren’t enough samples, we will have to wait for them to accumulate. The government will only reimburse the cost of samples sequenced and not for running the entire process with fewer samples,” a TAC member explained. The purpose of sequencing is to detect a new variant, which two labs in Karnataka have been doing successfully, said Dr Ravi. “On November 26, Omicron was declared as a variant of concern. On November 30, Karnataka was the first to detect Omicron (though it was later announced on December 3 after verification),” he added. Stating that the state’s labs were at the forefront in detecting Alpha and Delta variants earlier, Dr Ravi said a resource-intensive method like sequencing should not be used for every sample. Dr Ravi said irrespective of the variants, the treatment remains the same for Covid patients, but that Omicron cases need to be hospitalised and can be discharged only after they test negative to prevent community spread. Prof Satyajit Mayor, director, National Centre for Biological Sciences, said sequencing is not a trivial affair. “We have to wait till we have 300 samples. It takes a week’s time to put out the results and we are doing our best,” he said. Genomic sequencing was temporarily halted for at least a week at Nimhans owing to global shortage of kits. Dr Ravi said the institute lab has procured them now. According to the health and family welfare department, there is no delay in genomic sequencing. “The reports are available within 5-8 days,” said Randeep D, commissioner of the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/from-samples-to-kits-experts-explain-why-genomic-sequencing-takes-time/articleshow/88365822.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Kang: Not clear if booster shots needed for all||Bengaluru: With the spread of Omicron variant fuelling fears, some health experts have suggested a calibrated approach towards booster doses of Covid vaccine. Virologist Gagandeep Kang said: “We know high-income countries are providing booster doses for every adult member of their population. But it is not clear if we need boosters for everybody. It is clear that if you are older and you have comorbidities, there is an incremental benefit. But is that one per cent or 20 per cent, that is the question which needs to be answered. It can be seen as though you are giving yourself an insurance policy at an uncertain time. It may turn out that boosters were not required at all. It is a matter of time.” On whether Covid was artificially engineered or naturally occurring, Kang said: “Coronaviruses infect a lot of species. It is possible that this is an engineered virus. It is possible that this is a naturally occurring virus that was being experimented with in Wuhan and the experiments made it more easily transmissible between humans. But did it happen and will we ever know if it did? You know better,” Kang said at a literary event. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/kang-not-clear-if-booster-shots-needed-for-all/articleshow/88365823.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Owners must clear poop, leash pet dogs in Cubbon Park from today||BENGALURU: If you are planning to take your dog for a walk inside Cubbon Park, be prepared to scoop its poop and drop it into the nearest bin. This directive is part of the many regulations that the horticulture department will enforce from Sunday after the high court recently expressed concern over allowing pet dogs inside the city’s premier lung space. The department note read: “Owners are to ensure their pets are not a source of nuisance to others. All owners must bring scoops and pick up excreta of their dog and deposit it in the garbage bin provided.” Dog poop poses a major problem in the park as most pet owners do not pick it up while taking their dogs for a walk. There have been instances of verbal arguments breaking out between dog owners and morning walkers over it. Ironically, the department order is silent on the action to be initiated against dog owners who refuse to clear the poop. However, a horticulture department official said: “We will first create awareness among the owners before taking penal action. All guards at the entrances will advise them to carry a scoop, and if they continue to defy orders, they will not be allowed to enter the park with their pets.” Apart from this, pet owners have been directed to restrain their dogs with a leash that is not longer than six feet. Leashing pets in public places ensures passers-by are safe, the department said. Officials said around 300 pets are brought into the park on weekdays and the number crosses 1,000 on weekends. Cubbon Park deputy director (horticulture) HT Balakrishna said: “With the help of police and our staff, we will monitor entry of pet dogs into Cubbon Park. We don’t want the public to face any nuisance by pets and their owners.” The staff have been mandated to check if dogs are leashed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/owners-must-clear-poop-leash-pet-dogs-in-cubbon-park-from-today/articleshow/88365825.cms||---

The judge said the sanction was refused on the ground that several files and documents placed for scrutiny were false. “It is not an acrimonious exercise but a solemn or sacrosanct act, which gives protection to a government servant or releases him to face prosecution. It is the discretion of the competent authority either to accord or refuse sanction,” the judge noted in his order, while citing various Supreme Court judgments. The judge negated the petitioner’s argument that it is an aggrieved party and hence its writ petition is maintainable.Lokayukta police had challenged the January 28, 2017 and May 31, 2017 orders passed by the department of personnel and administrative reforms secretary, who had turned down the requisition to accord sanction against Krishnamurthy under Section 19 of PC Act in a disproportionate assets case. Lokayukta police maintained that the competent authority, while declining to give sanction, had looked into the entire material of investigation, which is impermissible in law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-upholds-govts-denial-to-prosecute-inspector/articleshow/88365826.cms||---

The proposed bill seeks to “restrict the overall term of notaries for up to 15 years (initial term of five years and two renewal terms of five each) by curtailing the renewals of unlimited terms”.According to the current rules in Notaries Act, 1952, notaries are tasked with verifying the authenticity of documents and attesting them by affixing their seal. Notaries act as agents of the state and Union governments and appointed in an area marked by the authorities.However, KSNA maintained that the proposed bill would make life and careers difficult for the current notaries. Nearly 30-40% of them would lose their jobs if the government goes ahead with their appointment for a term of 15 years (with breaks for every five years), association secretary Ranga Ramu said. There are around 300 notaries in Bengaluru.KSNA treasurer Manohar Jeerige said: “Why does the government want to curb our employment? We will be jobless after 15 years and renewal is uncertain. Let the government give equal opportunities to all instead of curtailing our jobs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/notaries-fear-job-loss-with-proposed-bill/articleshow/88365827.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Passengers want MEMU trains to Tumakuru & Dharmapuri||BENGALURU: While South Western Railway (SWR) commissioned electrification of two major routes from Bengaluru last month, passengers say their wait for MEMU (mainline electric multiple unit) trains is getting longer. MEMU trains are environment-friendly and reduce travel time by 5-10%. Last month, the commissioner of railway safety approved the operation of electric trains to Tumakuru and Dharmapuri. At present, only one pair of MEMU trains (06261/06262 KSR Bengaluru-Hosur-KSR Bengaluru) is operational, up to Hosur and back. Many passengers say this should be extended till Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu. “The train leaves Bengaluru at 9:25am and reaches Hosur at 11am. In the return direction, it leaves Hosur at 3.15pm and arrives in Bengaluru at 5.30pm. From Hosur, Dharmapuri is only two hours away and a large number of daily-wage workers and farmers travelling between Bengaluru and Dharmapuri will benefit if this train is extended,” said TP Lokesh, a member of Karnataka Railway Vedike. Similarly, there is a growing demand for MEMU services from Bengaluru to Tumakuru, especially with fuel prices going up. Many people from Tumakuru depend on passenger trains to reach the state capital. KN Krishnaprasad, a rail activist, said: “Tumakuru is considered a satellite city of Bengaluru. Thousands of people, including workers, students, tourists and pilgrims, travel between both destinations every day. The operational cost of DEMU trains is higher as they consume diesel. There is no justification for not running MEMU trains to Tumakuru and Dharmapuri even after electrification.” SWR chief PRO (in-charge) E Vijaya said: “We are processing necessary approvals to operate MEMU trains towards Tumakuru, which are expected to be completed shortly.” She said MEMU trains will be introduced in electrified sections in a phased manner. “MEMU is ideally suited for shuttle/frequent services, especially for short distances,” she said. “We will consider extending Hosur MEMU up to Dharmapuri. At present, there is no shortage of MEMU rakes in SWR.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/passengers-want-memu-trains-to-tumakuru-dharmapuri/articleshow/88365829.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: 87-year-old gets FIR registered over attack on son by doctor, hospital workers||BENGALURU: After waging an epistolary battle for more than three years, an 87-year-old Tamil Nadu woman has succeeded in getting an FIR registered against a doctor and two employees of a private medical college hospital in Devanahalli for allegedly attacking her 60-year-old businessman-son and rendering him immobile for life. Chandra V from Vellore flooded Bengaluru police with missives, mostly handwritten and only some typed, alleging that her son V Suresh was attacked in 2018 after he demanded that the hospital clear the money it owed him over material he had supplied to the establishment four years earlier. Acting on one such letter from the woman, Devanahalli police approached the accused persons, who justified non-payment of money citing substandard materials supplied. The same statement was forwarded to Chandra. However, saying a mere statement doesn’t get the justice her son deserves, she resumed writing letters to various officers of city police. Finally, one letter addressed to the police commissioner’s office yielded the desired result last month. Acting on their superiors’ directions, Devanahalli police registered an FIR against Muniraju and Pushpa S from Akash Institute of Medical Science and Research Centre (Akash hospital), Devanahalli, and Dr Satish Babu HV, who was working with the hospital at the time of the incident, under IPC sections 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 420 (cheating). Trouble began in 2014 when Suresh’s quotation to supply furniture and other wooden accessories to the college was accepted. Dr Babu, then director of the college, asked him to supply the order. The materials were supplied in 2015 and Suresh was paid around Rs 1 crore with a pending balance of Rs 12 lakh. Suresh’s efforts to collect the dues were in vain. In the first week of May 2018, he visited the college seeking to meet Dr Babu but unidentified construction workers pushed him to the ground. He sustained injuries to his chest. Because of business schedules, Suresh travelled back to Vellore. Another assault“Seeing my injuries and hearing my story, my mother wrote to Dr Babu, seeking an explanation from him for the incident as well as the pending money. There was no reply. On May 28, 2018, I visited the hospital again to get back the amount. To my shock, I was beaten up again. I returned home and narrated the incident to my mother,” Suresh told STOI. “The injuries caused to me when I was attacked the first time worsened and I can’t move now. Saying that god will help us one day, my mother kept writing the letters,” he said. Suresh has blamed Dr Babu, Muniraju, and Pushpa for the attack. “My mother wrote several letters to Devanahalli police, seeking their intervention and justice. Acting on one such letter, Devanahalli cops summoned the authorities concerned from the hospital and took a statement from them. However, the authorities said some furniture was of inferior quality and hence the balance was not paid. Also, according to them, the balance was Rs 4 lakh and not Rs 12 lakh, which is a lie. Had it been a fact, why did they keep quiet for almost three years after the delivery? The agreement was made for a one-time sale and there was no mention of repair or service,” Suresh said. The accused did not respond to phone calls, messages and emails from STOI. Deputy commissioner of police (northeast) CK Baba said the case is under investigation. “We have issued notice to the suspects, asking them to appear before the investigating officer,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/87-year-old-gets-fir-registered-overattack-on-son-by-doc-hosp-workers/articleshow/88365830.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

The photographs produced by the board demonstrate the petitioner’s utter disregard towards the environment,” justice M Nagaprasanna said.The company had challenged the notices issued by Padumarnad village following complaints of pollution. The village panchayat had warned that if no corrective steps are taken, a plaint would be lodged before the authority. Thereafter, it issued another notice for unit closure.However, the petitioner claimed it was not causing any noise or air pollution. In the petition filed before the HC, only notices issued by the village panchayat were mentioned; the October 21, 2021 showcause notice by KSPCB and the reply submitted on November 4 were suppressed from the court.Solely on the ground that KSPCB wasn’t involved and only the village panchayat was ordering closure, the high court granted an interim order on November 11. However, when KSPCB was made a party to the petition, many documents pertaining to the notices issued and the reply given by the company were placed before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/1l-fine-on-firm-for-suppressing-facts-causing-pollution/articleshow/88365832.cms||---

We also have plans to set up electric vehicle-charging and battery-swapping stations,” he told STOI. The focus will be on advertisements inside trains, on pillars, platforms and station buildings. “But we don’t have any plans to wrap trains with advertisements like some other Metro operators as it will affect aesthetics. We will focus more on advertising revenue once the BBMP ban is lifted. Firms will also be allowed to put up LED screens at stations for advertisement and branding,” Parwez said. “For the existing stations, there are no immediate plans to provide semi-naming rights to companies (to allow their name to appear as prefix to the station name). But those interested can tie up for upcoming stations like Infosys Foundation-Konappana Agrahara Metro Station (Electronics City),” he said. A recent report by International Association of Public Transport, an NGO, had said Bengaluru Metro’s non-farebox revenue such as rent and advertisement forms only 9% of the total — the lowest among Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Chennai. In Delhi, 37% of the revenue comes from sources such as feeder bus, rent, revenue from real estate and consultancy. Non-farebox revenue in Mumbai and Chennai is 14% and 16%, respectively. The contribution is 58% and 28% for MTR Hong Kong and SMRT Singapore, respectively Asked about poor last-mile connectivity from Metro stations, Parwez said a cab service by ex-servicemen will soon be given parking space at major stations. “This will ensure safe and reliable service for passengers for last-mile connectivity.” He added that BMTC will also soon operate 90 electric Metro feeder buses. “The private firm Metro Ride has already launched electric autos in many stations and have plans to extend the service to a few more stations. Yulu has provided Miracle (electric scooter) in many stations. We will encourage all firms/startups which provide last-mile connectivity solutions to Metro passengers,” he said. ‘Ridership picking up’ Parwez said the past two years have been a difficult period for the transport sector because of Covid-19, but ridership has picked up in the last 4-5 months. “Now, Namma Metro’s daily ridership has increased to 3.3 lakh. We will be able to recover daily operational costs if it touches at least 4 lakh. We are expecting this to happen by next month as many IT companies are now reopening,” he said. The daily ridership was 5 lakh before the pandemic. He said the national common mobility card is ready to be launched. It is a universal card and can be used to shop and pay for parking, and can be integrated with other modes of transport such as BMTC, taxis or autos. On monthly passes for passengers, Parwez said the idea is being considered but nothing is finalised yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/more-retail-outlets-ads-in-metro-stns-to-up-revenue/articleshow/88365831.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

AIADMK organising secretary D Jayakumar preferred the complaint close on the heels of Sasikala announcing her plan to pay tributes to former chief minister M G Ramachandran at his memorial on his death anniversary on December 24.A release from her office at noon said that Sasikala, along with cadres, would pay a visit to the memorial at 10 am and pay floral tributes to the late chief minister and take part in the customary pledge-taking event near the memorial. The release called upon the cadres, functionaries of various wings, fans and general public to attend the event. In his complaint given to Jiwal later in the day, Jayakumar sought action on an earlier complaint filed before Mambalam police in October against Sasikala, alleging that she was dishonestly claiming to be the general secretary of the party. “Having lost all her claims to the party leadership before various fora, including the Supreme Court, now Sasikala has intentionally and wilfully taken law into her own hands with the intent to create chaos, confusion and disharmony, which is likely to result in breach of public peace,” Jayakumar said. The AIADMK had filed a complaint with the director general of police after Sasikala, upon her release from prison, started using the party flag.In October, Sasikala went to MGR memorial in T Nagar and unveiled a commemorative plaque, where she was referred to as “general secretary of the AIADMK.” The complaint said Sasikala knew well that her conduct amounted to impersonation of an office to which she had no legal claim. “The said acts have been committed deliberately, intentionally and wilfully knowing fully well the consequences,” Jayakumar said..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/aiadmk-seeks-police-action-as-sasi-plans-to-pay-tribute-to-mgr/articleshow/88365833.cms||---

When a division bench of Justice M Duraiswamy and Justice Sathya Narayana Prasad commenced their proceedings on Thursday, advocate G Mohana Krishnan made a mention seeking urgent hearing of the review petition. He submitted that the conditions imposed by the order dated August 19 are practically impossible to be followed and are in contrary to the law set by the orders of the Supreme Court. Allowing the mention, the bench orally instructed the election committee of the association to not to release the voters list scheduled to be released on December 17. The court then directed the registry to list the matter for hearing on January 7. As per the August 19 order imposing minimum qualification, a person willing to contest must be senior counsel with 25 years of standing and must have argued at least 50 cases before HC each year or 250 cases in the past five years. The court felt that such minimum qualifications are necessary as ‘many lawyers who have not even entered the campus of the high court are trying to become the members and office bearers of the association. The order was passed on a plea moved by advocate K Sathyabal raising a series of allegations against the association and its functioning. He added that the certificate of practice of members must be verified as there is confusion as to whether members are residents or non-residents of Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/mhaa-moves-hc-to-review-order-on-election-criterion/articleshow/88365836.cms||---

With no toilets for them, boys are forced to attend nature’s call in open, while the ones available for girls are poorly maintained. Sadasivam, a class VIII student says, "We have to walk at least a kilometre to find a deserted stretch to urinate. By the time we return to the campus, our break is over, and we are at the receiving end of our teacher’s ire. People think only girls need proper toilet facilities, and they fail to consider our plight.” waste strewn in one of the corners of the school corridorThere are at least 518 students studying in this school which is housed in two different buildings- one each for classes VI to X and XI to XII. Female students on the campus are even more worried as they are forced to clean the campus with no sweeper or sanitary workers employed for the purpose. Ilakiya, a class nine student said that the authorities should consider employing sanitary workers. "Sometimes we keep our premises clean thinking that it is our duty to keep it tidy. No parents will wish their wards to do such jobs," said Ilakiya. Students said that, at times, there is insufficient water and long queues to use the toilets. Even a few teachers at the school echoed the same problem. One of them , on the condition of anonymity, said that the male students who urinate in the open end up fighting with each other passing unnecessary comments. There are times when some of them purposely go far and return at their own time and miss the main classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/issues-galore-at-kanchi-govt-school/articleshow/88365837.cms||Sindhu Kannan

The flash protest impacted vehicular movements on many other arterial roads connecting Purasawalkam with north Chennai. Otteri police inspector Krishna Murthy detained two of the students and launched a search for those absconding. A team of police went to to the spot and talked to the crew after which the protest was lifted. The incident happened around 3.30pm and the students reportedly boarded the bus (29-A plying between Anna Square and Perambur) at Doveton bus stop. Since they were travelling on the footboard and also tried to climb atop the bus, conductor Karthik warned them. However, the students allegedly did not get in and instead made fun of the conductor. On Strahan's Road, Karthik shouted at the students again and in return, the students got down from the bus and hurled stones at the windshield. The crew immediately stopped the bus and staged a protest, who were soon joined by the other members of MTC. Of late, videos of students travelling footboard of MTC buses and EMU trains have gone viral on social media. In a recent incident in Gummidipoondi, a girl and a boy were summoned by police and and let off with an warning for footboard travel on an EMU train.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/footboard-travel-mtc-bus-crew-resort-to-flash-strike-traffic-hit/articleshow/88365838.cms||---

However, the guidelines said, it will be applicable prospectively which means the rule will be implemented for new teachers appointed after this notification. “The teachers who have completed eight years of service in a particular school will be transferred compulsorily. These teachers will be given priority and allowed to participate in the counselling before general counselling takes place,” guidelines issued by school education secretary Kakarla Usha on Saturday said. “If it is applied to existing teachers, then more than 80% of teachers may have to be transferred. So, it is being introduced only for new recruits," an official said. To address the vacancy issues in northern districts, the policy has mandated five years of service in priority blocks for new recruits. These priority blocks will be identified based on vacancies. Existing teachers working in non-priority blocks and willing to work in priority blocks through general counselling need to serve at least three years. Teachers who serve in priority blocks will get preference over others during the general counselling. The counselling will be done during May or at the end of first or second term and no transfer counselling will be done during the academic sessions. P Patric Raymond, general secretary of TN Graduate Teachers Federation, said the objective for introducing the maximum eight-year service rule in schools was unclear. "The department should give priority to teachers who were transferred for taking part in the strikes held during the AIADMK regime," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-govt-teachers-can-work-in-schools-for-8-years-say-new-rules/articleshow/88365839.cms||---

Based on evening estimates, officials said about 2.32 lakh people were covered for both doses in Saturday’s mega camp. Close to 25 lakh people have been covered in 15 mega vaccine camps and 88.59% of the eligible population have taken the first dose, while 66% have taken the second dose. The civic body has ramped up its vaccination drive with 1,600 camps being held frequently in busy areas to cover the vulnerable population and those due for their second dose. Experts say since the duration of Covishield is longer some people may even genuinely forget to take the second dose. “Sending an SMS to people who missed the dose or reminding them with a phone call will help them take the second dose,” said Dr Ram Gopalakrishnan, Infectious Diseases Specialist at Apollo Hospitals. Dr Gopalakrishnan said if people do not take the second dose and they get infected, the infection will still be severe. “There’s also a great chance of them going into oxygen support,” he said, adding that people must take the second dose at the earliest, even if there’s a delay. The second dose gains significance as a national Covid-19 supermodel committee has also predicted a third wave caused by Omicron. Former director of public health Dr K Kolandasamy said there must be strict enforcement in cinema theatres and other public spots. “Theatres in many places are not checking for vaccine details. Attenders of patients in hospital too are not vaccinated in some instances. This is risky,” he said. Chennai currently lags behind in second dose coverage compared to capital cities of neighboring southern states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/about-7l-in-city-still-due-for-2nd-dose-of-covid-vax/articleshow/88365840.cms||Omjasvin M D

Speaking at a discussion on the title “The Plastic Emergency” organized by #BreakFreeFromPlastic movement and Citizen consumer and civic action group (CAG), experts said that the governments may have banned single use plastics, but they are still manufactured for exports and they are also pushing to increase the capacity by incentivising petrochemical industry. Tamil Nadu generates around 79,114tonnes of plastic waste every year. Vishvaja Sambath, Chennai Climate Action Group, said from cancers and neurological disorders to reproductive and developmental disorders plastic has its impact on health. “Tamil Nadu has announced three new large industries in Tuticorin, Nagapattinam and Cuddalore. If we think that we are not affected in Chennai, we are wrong. We have one huge impact-causing a petrochemical hub in our backyard at Manali,” he said.S Saroja, CAG, said a study they had conducted earlier this year showed that there is a disparity in the ban. Experts also stressed on waste management on the lines of Bengaluru. Nalini Shekar of Hasiru Dala said they set up a dry waste collection center and an effective implementation of ban on single use plastics by holding a stakeholder meeting discussing the impacts of plastic use. This reduced dry waste from 1.5tonnes to 60 to 80kg in a ward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/stall-expansion-of-petrochemical-industries-experts/articleshow/88365842.cms||---

The commission further suggested that the salaries for the retired army personnel be paid by levying fines on officials who gave completion certificates to the poorly laid roads and storm water drains. “Such measures will lead to government contractors, engineers and workers to carry out their works diligently in the future,” said an order from S Muthuraj, Tamil Nadu Information Commissioner. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/let-retd-army-engineers-check-roads-swds-tn-info-panel/articleshow/88365843.cms||---

---||Chennai||Contractors in Chennai fined Rs 7.67 lakh for poor upkeep of parks||CHENNAI: The city corporation has levied a fine of Rs 7,67,491 against private contractors for poor maintenance of parks across the 15 zones. The contractors were asked tough questions on why watchmen were absent during duty hours, the shortfall in labour, deficiency in pruning and watering, among other things related to park maintenance, official sources said. It is learned that Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi personally reviewed the inspection reports given by the zonal officials on the poor upkeep of parks and pulled up the contractors. While there are around 800 parks in the city, 542 parks have been outsourced to private contractors for maintenance. Of the Rs 7.67 lakh collected since August this year, Rs 2.5 lakh (32.59%), was collected from contractors tasked with maintaining the parks in zone 4 (Tondiarpet), while contractors in zone 10 (Kodambakkam) were fined Rs 1.25 lakh (16.2%). Of the Rs 67,800 fine for the shortfall in labour in December, Rs 40,680 (60%) was levied on contractors in Tondiarpet alone, while Rs 20,340 (30%) was levied on contractors in the Valsaravakkam zone. The officials also found that in Tondiarpet, the contractors in charge of maintenance of five parks did not allow the required number of staff as per the tender conditions. “We are now imposing fines and are asking for a response from them. If they continue with poor upkeep and their watchmen are not present during work hours, we will terminate their contracts,” an official said. A senior corporation official said such inspections and data-maintaining come in handy for the civic body to hold the contractors accountable. “Parks are an important recreational space for the public and the contractors must ensure quality maintenance,” said the official. The official said that in some parks, even the staff in the gardens were absent on many days without any communication and that they had initiated pay cuts for them. The official added that one corporation zonal official is appointed per park for daily inspection and the drive will continue on a daily basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/contractors-fined-7-67-lakh-for-poor-upkeep-of-parks/articleshow/88365847.cms||Omjasvin M D

An inquiry about Freemasons’ hall, a huge mansion-like structure off Ethiraj Salai, mostly attracts blank stares.It’s not an issue for the members though as that is how they like it to be, despite world leaders and famous personalities being part of the fraternity. Freemasons from across the country are in the city for the weekend to observe the diamond jubilee celebrations (60th anniversary) of the regional lodge of southern India, which had its origins at the Freemasons’ hall in the city. “Unlike a club or an organisation, members cannot join by filling out a form or paying a fee, but have to be initiated into the group,” said Anish Kumar Sharma, Grand Master, India. It reflects in the number of freemasons in the country — a meagre 20,000. The basic qualification is belief in god or a supreme being. Freemasonry, believed to have its origins in the United Kingdom, was imported to India by the British. Novelist Dan Brown’s depiction of Freemasons in ‘The Da Vinci Code’ and ‘The Lost Symbol’ added to the intrigue. “There is an incorrect understanding of what Freemasonry is. We believe in the fatherhood of god and brotherhood of men. We make good men better,” said Madhusudan, referring to famous Indian Freemasons such as Swami Vivekandanda and Dr Rajendra Prasad. Freemasons are involved in charity and as part of the present celebrations, the members will be distributing 25,000 smart spectacles t on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/freemasonry-in-south-india-turns-60/articleshow/88365849.cms||---

We had no other go than to bring down the encroachments forcefully,” an assistant engineer with the corporation told TOI. A section of the residents protested for a while against the demolition of houses, but later went by the procedure. Officials said the anti-encroachment drive would continue in other parts of the city as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/civic-body-razes-encroachments-near-nungambakkam/articleshow/88365890.cms||---

---||Patna||Cleanliness challenge: ULBs asked to ensure participation of people||PATNA: The state urban development and housing department (UDHD) has asked all the urban local bodies to ensure maximum participation of people in Swachh Technology Challenge as part of the Centre’s ‘Swachh Survekshan Survey 2022’. The competition has been organised to find solutions to social issues like waste management, plastic waste and wastewater planning. The winners of this competition will get an opportunity to participate in state and national level competitions. It will particularly seek solutions in four thematic categories – social inclusion, zero dump (solid waste management), plastic waste management and transparency through digital enablement. “The objective of this challenge is to promote innovative technology, sustainability and easy-to-use methods under sanitation and solid waste management. For this, all the municipal bodies have to publicise the Swachh Technology Challenge by putting up posters and banners and inviting applications from companies and NGOs by December 30,” Vishal Anand, joint director of Municipal Sanitation and Development, said in a letter to the heads of the ULBs. For the approval of the application, a committee is to be formed at the ULB-level in which municipal commissioner will be the chairman. Nodal officer of Centre’s Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) and two executive officers will be the members of the committee. The application has to be uploaded to the Swachhata portal by January 8 next year after the committee’s approval. Individuals or group of citizens, companies, educational institutions and community-based organisations or NGOs can participate in this challenge and send their technology-based ideas for cleanliness to their respective municipal bodies to help city administration efficiently manage cleanliness operations. Solutions or ideas with commercial approach and revenue-generating capacity will be selected. The piloting time of the project must be 3 to 10 months and preference will be given to indigenous technology. The state-level winners will get cash prize of Rs 5 lakh for the first position, Rs 2.5 lakh for the second position, Rs 1.5 lakh for the third position, Rs 1 lakh for the fourth position and Rs 75,000 for the fifth position. In Bihar, there are 258 ULBs. Winning entries (top 3 in each category) under the challenge will be rewarded with seed funding of Rs 25 lakh per project along with one year of dedicated incubation support at the national level. The active participation of cities in the challenge will have a direct bearing on their performance in the ‘Citizen Engagement’ component of Swachh Survekshan 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cleanliness-challenge-ulbs-asked-to-ensure-participation-of-people/articleshow/88362897.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Gaya airport: Proposed cargo terminal to facilitate quick transportation of agri produce||GAYA: The proposed cargo terminal at Gaya airport would facilitate quick transportation of organic agriculture produces from Gaya and other adjoining districts into the market across India and abroad too. The civil aviation ministry has proposed to connect Gaya airport along with Darbhanga airport with the second phase of agriculture flight operations. The ministry has shortlisted total 53 airports including Gaya and Darbhanga in Bihar in the agriculture flights 2.0 scheme. Officials claimed that Gaya has been selected for organic agriculture produces. Under this scheme, the organic agriculture produce growers would be getting exemption from landing, parking and route navigation charges. Officials claimed that by providing air route connectivity, the government aims to facilitate quick transportation of the produces to the market. The aim is to protect the agriculture produces from getting destroyed. All agriculture produces will be transported to a common place from where they will be ferried to different market places. District agriculture officer Sudama Mahto said, “There is a huge potential for organic farming in the district. The agriculture department is promoting organic farming through government and non-government agencies besides, voluntary organizations. The initiative to transport organic products by air route will provide market for the organic farm produces.” Already on religious and spiritual map of the country, Gaya will emerge on national trade map after the cargo terminal becomes functional. Work is in progress for construction of terminal at Gaya airport in an area covering 36 acres. In a bid to develop Gaya airport at par with international facilities, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has requested the state government to make available around 110 acres of land for expansion of the runway and other development plans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gaya-airport-proposed-cargo-terminal-to-facilitate-quick-transportation-of-agri-produce/articleshow/88362919.cms||---
---||Patna||Forest department secretary, DFO spar over quarrying on Nawada hillocks||PATNA: A PIL to save the Yagyavalkya and Lomas hills in Nawada from being quarried without proper clearance has brought to light conflicting facts from department of environment, forest and climate change. The department’s principal secretary has submitted a counter affidavit in Patna high court stating that the leased areas for mining are neither under Rajauli wildlife sanctuary nor the proposed eco-sensitive zone of the place. The Nawada divisional forest officer has, on the other hand, ordered two private firms to stop quarrying the hills with immediate effect on grounds that the place falls under ESZ of the sanctuary as notified by the state government on May 10, 2019. The quarrying activities have been stopped as Patna high court stayed them after hearing the PIL. The order to stop quarrying was issued by the Nawada DFO on November 1 which was not accepted by the mining firm authorities after it was served by a forest guard, Sanjeet Kumar. A copy of the letter is with TOI. The affidavit was submitted by principal secretary Dipak Kumar Singh before the high court a week before DFO’s letter. A copy of the affidavit is also with this newspaper. In his letter, the DFO said since earmarking of Rajauli wildlife sanctuary ESZ boundary is still under process, the Supreme court order will prevail which mentions that in such condition, ESZ will be 10km radius area around a sanctuary. The DFO has written that under these circumstances, the quarrying areas fall in ESZ which is barred. He has also warned of legal action against firms if they continue quarrying. However, the secretary in his affidavit mentions that quarrying is not taking place either inside Koderma wildlife sanctuary as its boundary is till Jharkhand border nor Rajauli sanctuary as Nadawa DFO has proposed average 500-metre as ESZ around it. The PIL was filed by one Vinay Kumar Singh, who urged the court to order stopping of quarrying permanently as it is being done without due clearance and the area falls under the eco-sensitive zone. The petitioner said both hills have historic and cultural value. “Goddess Sita had given birth to her two sons Luv and Kush there,” he said. On November 24, a division bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah had orally observed that the two hills should not be touched as they have religious and cultural importance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/forest-department-secretary-dfo-spar-over-quarrying-on-nawada-hillocks/articleshow/88363643.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Visakhapatnam||Illegal motor training schools under lens||Visakhapatnam: The transport department has launched a special drive to inspect motor training schools in Vizag city following credible information of some institutes flouting rules. The crackdown is the first in the city in recent years. There have been a number of allegations that unauthorised driving schools are coming up on the outskirts of the city as it expands north. Speaking to STOI, deputy transport commissioner, Vizag, G C Raja Ratnam said they have carried out surprise raids at some driving schools flouting norms and seized 11 cars. The raids revealed that the driving schools obtained permission for two cars for running the school but also used another two cars without permission. Others appointed inexperienced instructors. “The raids will continue for a few more days,” Raja Ratnam added. There are over 30 drivings chools, which include a number of reputed institutions, in Vizag city. However, some have been operating illegally and luring youngsters under the guise of low fees. “I observed that some driving schools do not teach how to drive safely at night or when it’s raining. Except a few, the majority of driving schools are running with unqualified instructors. There is an urgent need to act against such schools,” said G Prabhakar, a resident of East Point Colony. “Students are not keen on attending classes in the lecture room, they are only thrilled to sit behind the wheels to learn driving. Very few students are interested in learning the rules for road safety. Driving is not only about riding the vehicle, it is also about how to control fatal road accidents,” said a member of a driving school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/illegal-motor-training-schools-under-lens/articleshow/88363636.cms||Nalla.Babu

The popular ‘Pamriya dance’ and ‘Miryasin geet’ will also be performed by a section of Dalit Muslims on the occasion. The organiser of the fair, Dr Ayub Rayeen, told TOI on Saturday, “The condition of Dalit Muslims is deplorable when it comes to education or economic and social status. We want them to be included in the SC/ST category.” The first ‘Dalit Muslim Mela’ was held in 2018 and the second in 2019. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the fair was not organised in 2020. The convenor of the fair, Osama Hasan, said, “We are motivating the Dalit Muslims to send their children to college for higher studies, instead of making them perform menial jobs. However, we cannot achieve much without the government’s help.” While advocate Mumtaz Alam will preside over the ‘Dalit Muslim Mela’, former MP Ali Anwar will release a book on the community.

---||Patna||Set goals and work hard to achieve them, senior IPS officer tells pupils||PATNA: Around 240 students from 40 Patna schools on Saturday got a pep talk from senior IPS officer Vikas Vaibhav who motivated them to set goals for life and work hard to achieve them by utilising all available resources and energy. Vaibhav also motivated the students not to waste their energy in fighting on trivial issues, such as caste, religion and region. “Come together, help each other and contribute to the society, your state and the country,” he told the students. Vaibhav, special secretary (home department,) was addressing a function held at Rabindra Bhawan here to felicitate the students who emerged winners in Bharat Heritage Olympiad Quiz contest, organised under the umbrella of “Let’s Inspire Bihar”, on glorious history of the state. Let’s Inspire Bihar is an initiative taken by Vaibhav. More than 30,000 students from across state had participated in the quiz competition that had started on November 19 as part of the ‘World Heritage Week’. Altogether 240 students in two categories – classes VI to VIII and classes IX to XII – were declared winners and felicitated by Vaibhav. Vaibhav’s address to the students was more like an interactive session as he shared his knowledge of glorious past of Bihar with the students and asked them questions. “There can be no better example than Bihar to inspire. This was a land of knowledge and visionaries,” he said while sharing the history of glorious Nalanda and Vikramshila universities. “The world today knows Oxford and Cambridge universities as the best. But when there was nothing, Bihar had Nalanda and Vikramshila universities where people came to study from abroad by risking their lives,” Vaibhav said. He informed the students how residents of Tibet had donated gold so that they can call a teacher from Vikramshila to their land more than 1,000 years back and how 7,707 people used to gather in ‘santhagar’ of Vaishali, their Parliament, for governing in 5th century BC. Tanisha, a Class VIII student of St Karen’s High School and one of the winners of the quiz contest, said the questions in the competition inspired her to know more about Bihar. “Our history is fascinating. I searched about Vikramshila University and constructions made by emperor Ashoka in Bihar,” she said. Another Class VIII student, Akash Chaturvedi of Kendriya Vidyalaya-Kankarbagh, said he searched about Kesaria stupa on which a question was asked in the quiz competition. “I could not answer the question and it drove me to know more about Bihar,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/set-goals-and-work-hard-to-achieve-them-senior-ips-officer-tells-pupils/articleshow/88363750.cms||Debashish Karmakar

In all, roads stretching across a length of 6.8km are being upgraded under the ‘Smart City’ project in the twin cities. Meanwhile, residents and shopkeepers alike want the HDSCL to ensure that work on the roads is completed on time. The project envisages upgrading the streetlights on the roads, improving the marking, ensuring that pedestrians enjoy a hassle-free stroll along pavements. Work on upgrading these thoroughfares was kicked off in 2017, with a sum of Rs 47.9 crore earmarked for the project. A HDSCL official expressed hope of work on all the roads being completed at the earliest. Motorists who travel regularly along these roads complained about the protracted delay in completing work on these thoroughfares. Pointing out that the HDSCL kicked off work on various projects nearly five years ago, they said that there was little that attested to Hubballi-Dharwad’s transformation into ‘Smart Cities’. Among others, dust and rubble left on the roads have left the commuters peeved. Many are starting to wonder how much longer it may take for the authorities concerned to introduce smart cards. While shopkeepers have to deal with the downturn in business, motorists find commute on thoroughfares a nightmarish experience, particularly when stones and other materials used for construction are dumped on the road. HDSCL managing director Shakeel Ahmed said, “Work on all roads earmarked for upgrading under the ‘Smart City’ project will be completed in two months. We have already completed work on the drains, and all cables have been installed. Work was delayed owing to the outbreak of Covid-19, owing to which we had to extend the deadline.” Work on Smart City projects was launched in the twin cities in May 2017, with Rs 500 crore allocated by the central government for various initiatives.

Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agrawal told this reporter that low visibility caused by dense fog led to a large number of road accidents during the winter season. “All the district magistrates have been asked to ensure the safety of motorists by making them stick retrospective tapes on the back and front of vehicles,” he added. Agrawal has also asked the officials of the road construction department, rural works department and National Highways Authority of India to take necessary action in view of foggy weather conditions. “It is important to take precautions and be careful in order to avoid road accidents and save lives,” the transport secretary said. According to sources, road accidents claimed 1,884 lives in 2019 and 1,722 in 2020 due to fog and haze in the state. Meanwhile, the transport department has issued a dos and don’ts list for motorists. “People should avoid using cellphones and listening to music while driving. Overloading, speeding, overtaking and stopping vehicles in the middle of the road should also be avoided,” says the list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/districts-told-to-use-reflective-tapes-to-prevent-accidents/articleshow/88363763.cms||Faryal Rumi

Held at the Bidhannagar police line, 100-odd traffic cops, including officers, constables and civic police personnel, had a one-hour session on how to behave with women, how to help women in distress, how to be calm in a messy situation and how to remain physically and mentally fit. “The gender sensitization and soft-skill development training was organised with the help of an NGO. More than 100 personnel attended the session and we have more such programmes scheduled,” said Surya Pratap Yadav, DC (headquarters) Bidhannagar Commissionerate. Cops were informed of the multiple complaints against them about behaving rudely with motorists and people on the road, and special instructions were given to check their behaviour with women and the elderly. “The cops were told to be patient and behave better with people, especially women. The department is hurt because of the incident involving two cops. Efforts are on to ensure such an incident never recurs,” said an officer. Bidhannagar Cipy Police had decided to organise the training after an additional judicial magistrate of a Salt Lake court criticised cops about their role in dealing with the woman in distress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/honing-soft-skills-bidhannagar-cops-undergo-sensitisation-training/articleshow/88364413.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Top Brahmins leaders of eastern Uttar Pradesh are expected to participate in the conclave. Talking to TOI, Ashish Pandey Dipu, organiser of Brahmin conclave, said, “Samajwadi Party has always given respect to Brahmins and the community is stoutly backing us to ensure formation of a pro-people government in state. Top Brahmins leaders, including former Speaker Mata Prasad Pandey, socialist icon late Janeshwar Mishra’s brother Tarkeshwar Mishra, SP state vice-president Jai Shankar Pandey will take part in the conclave.” The hallmark of the conclave will be distribution of the battle axe of Vishnu incarnate and Brahmin icon Parshuram among delegates. “The Parshuram axe will become the symbol of Samajwadi Party’s victory in coming elections. We will also felicitate Brahmins serving society with the 'Mulayam Singh Yadav Samman'. A 'havan' and ‘sundar kaand’ recitation will also be performed.

---||Kolkata||Man back from Nigeria third Omicron suspect in Kolkata||KOLKATA: One more Omicron suspect surfaced in the city on Saturday — a 69-year-old Kolkata resident who returned from Nigeria. The Covid-positive patient is admitted in a private hospital off EM Bypass and his swab samples will be sent for genome sequencing. Hospital sources said the patient is fine and has only mild symptoms. “He had some mild symptoms and tested Covid positive on December 14. Later, he was admitted to a private hospital in south Kolkata. His wife, who travelled with him, tested negative. The patient is doing well. Only his driver and another person came in close contact, and their samples will be tested on Sunday,” said director health services Ajay Chakraborty. The patient and his wife arrived in Kolkata by Qatar Airways on December 13. His samples have been forwarded to School of Tropical Medicine from where it will be sent for genome sequencing at NIBMG at Kalyani. While Bengal has recorded only one Omicron case so far, the count across the country has crossed the century mark. These cases continue to be a cause of worry and there is concern about the impending festivities. Health experts have cautioned revellers not to drop their guard. “The worry is this variant is more infectious. Although it is known not to cause severe disease in healthy and vaccinated adults, it is not very clear how this variant behaves in children, the aged and those with co-morbidities. Hence, we cannot afford to drop the guard and must avoid large gatherings,” said Asis Manna, medical superintendent and vice-principal at ID Hospital. Bengal’s Covid graph has remained stable for two to three months. But with Omicron lurking, and a few countries seeing a steep surge, health experts fear this variant with more that 30 mutations in the spike protein could create havoc in the state too. “Going back to Covid-appropriate behaviour has become all the more important in face of Omicron. Also, getting vaccinated at the earliest is important. If someone has come back from abroad and has developed symptoms at home, please do not conceal it. Get tested while staying in isolation,” said Yogiraj Ray, associate professor of infectious diseases at IPGMER. Doctors suggest small gatherings with known people or attending parties outdoors could also minimise risk. “Omicron will be the dominating strain throughout the world very soon. As it has high transmissibility, any kind of gathering can be a super-spreading event and thus it will become a public health emergency. So, festivities can be continued following the Covid-appropriate behaviour with proper use of masks and avoiding mass gatherings as much as feasible,” said public health specialist Anirban Dalui.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/man-back-from-nigeria-3rd-omicron-suspect/articleshow/88364312.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The vigilance raid yielded Rs 95 lakh in cash, gold and silver jewellery worth Rs 66.51 lakh, deposits in post office and other places worth Rs 81 lakh and deeds and documents related to purchase of 12 immovable property. The Vigilance Investigation Bureau had registered an FIR against Singh on Friday for amassing DA worth Rs 81.63 lakh. It procured a search warrant and conducted the raid around 8am. The raid lasted for 12 hours. The approximate DA increased to Rs 4 crore after the raid and it is expected to increase further. The vigilance sleuths were surprised when cash started tumbling out of small carton boxes and suitcases kept inside the wardrobe and almirah. Vigilance sources said a currency counting machine was requisitioned to count the cash. The government-authorised evaluator was later called to establish the value of gold and silver jewellery. “Altogether 1.295kg gold and 12kg silver ornaments, including three bricks weighing 2.7kg, were recovered,” a source said, adding 20 passbooks of different banks were found during the raid. “Documents related to seven vehicles, including two SUVs and four bikes, were also recovered,” a senior officer said, adding of 12 immovable property, the vigilance had knowledge about at least nine worth Rs 1.13 crore. “These nine properties include the Indrapuri house worth Rs 50 lakh as per deed value. The house is registered in the name of Singh’s wife Alka Kumari,” he said. “Vigilance has come to know about a plot in Bairiya in Patna worth Rs 40 lakh. Singh and his wife own at least four flats and plots in Patna and Punpun,” he said. Sources said Singh had joined service on June 30, 1995.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vig-raids-engineers-house-unearths-da-worth-rs-4cr/articleshow/88364134.cms||Debashish Karmakar

In Patna, Congress Mahanagar members organised a “padyatra” from Makhdumpur Digha ghat gate number 89 to Digha haat. Bihar Congress working president Sameer Singh, who was leading the march in the city, said rise in prices of essential commodities has made life difficult for people. Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre, who also participated in the march, said, “The NDA governments at the Centre and in state are least concerned about the plight of common people. Even basic food is out of the reach of a common man. There was a saying ‘dal-roti kha lenge’. But buying dal (pulse) is an expensive affair now and cooking it on stove using LPG cylinder has become impossible for majority of people.” Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said the Centre has completely failed to control inflation in the country. State Congress president Madan Mohan Jha, who participated in a foot march in Darbhanga’s Manigachhi, said the party workers would continue to raise important issues. “Our leaders Rahulji and Priyankaji also participated in padyatra today. It is the Congress which has been working for the betterment of common people and only this party can bring back the good old days in the country,” Jha added. Asked about rumours of his resignation as BPCC chief, Jha said, “I have not offered my resignation yet. It depends on the party high command to take a decision in this regard. I will accept whatever is decided by the high command.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/congress-netas-protest-price-rise-hold-padyatra/articleshow/88363660.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Police sources said the killings were fallout of a gang war. The victims were identified as Mastu Verma alias Abhishek Verma (48) and Sunil Kumar (35).

Sources said Sunil was driving the car and taking Mastu to Rajendra Nagar terminal where the latter was supposed a Delhi-bound train. Both were residents of Chowk Shikarpur. SHO Sanjeev Sinha said police recovered at least six empty cartridges from the spot. “Sunil’s wife told police that one criminal on bike had stopped their car, but locals said there were two criminals,” the SHO added, adding raids were on to arrest the killers. Mastu was also an accused in BJP neta-cum-industrialist Gunjan Khemka murder case.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata private schools welcome HC order, plan fee hike in new session||KOLKATA: Most city private schools will announce a fee hike from April 2022. The HC order on Friday allowed schools to discontinue the ongoing concessions from March 15 and start afresh. This has enthused private schools, which said they are looking at a fee hike after two years. They had been directed by the court to allow parents to pay 80% of essential fees because of the financial constraints during the pandemic. Schools said they had kept the fees at the 2019 level because, by the time the 2020 revision was planned, the pandemic had started. Schools had also been directed in an order on October 13, 2020, to allow 80% concession. Schools said they had not been able to give increments to teachers who had collectively taken the hit due of this concession. Many schools said they hadn’t been able to implement the sixth pay commission recommendations for their teachers because of funds crunch. “The pandemic has not been kind with inflationary rates. We had to contend with fee default despite concessions. We also had to cope with rising prices. So after two years we are welcoming the HC order and while we re-admit the children, we will make our revised structure clear. We are looking at a hike,” said Major General V N Chaturvedi, spokesperson for Birla High School and Sushila Birla Girls’ School. Schools said they were happy the HC clarified that during re-admission after March 2022, only those who can pay the revised fees will be admitted. “The one-and-a-half-year-old fee struggle is closing and it is a big relief. Parents need to realise that if they wish their child to study in a private school, they will have to agree with its fee structure. We will work out everything with our lawyers,” said Krishna Damani, spokesperson for South Point School. Some schools said though the HC has directed them to inform parents about fee charged on essential and non-essential heads, there is nothing “non-essential” in what schools do. “All our extra curricular and co-curricular activities have been conducted online. How can I brand them non-essential?” Chaturvedi said. Spokesperson for Shri Shikshayatan School Bratati Bhattacharya said, “We are finally looking at a fee hike this year so that we can complete pending formalities that will help boost teaching-learning. We will work out the percentage hike with our lawyers keeping in mind the prevailing situation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-private-schools-welcome-hc-order-plan-fee-hike-in-new-session/articleshow/88364376.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Health experts said since many such patients avoided coming to the hospital due to Covid-19 last year, their problems increased manifold. IGIMS superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said of 100 patients who come to his department every month, at least 40 have cancer issues. “The number was less earlier. However, there has been at least 10% increase in number of such patients after easing of Covid restrictions,” Dr Mandal added. A training programme was organised at the hospital on Saturday in which Dr Mandal said while the number of end-stage cancer patients was increasing, its operation had become easier with laparoscopic method, unlike earlier when surgery was being done by opening the stomach. “In laparoscopic method, the end is cut and joined using stapler technique. As a result, patient is operated in less time and less blood income is obtained during the operation,” Dr Mandal added. At the inauguration of the workshop, IGIMS director Dr N R Biswas said pancreatic cancer as well as intestinal cancer can be treated with telescope at a cheap rate through laparoscopic method in the surgical gastroenterology department of the hospital. Dr Siddhartha Hazarika, who had come from Guwahati and had himself received training in onco surgery department of AIIMS-Delhi and Pune earlier, also shared his knowledge and experience with the trainees. “Earlier it used to take two to three hours to cut and join the patient’s intestine with stapler technique. But it is being done in minutes now,” said Dr Hazarika. Organising secretary of the workshop, Dr Sanjay Kumar, said around 50 surgeons from outside the institute also participated in the workshop and were asked to further pass on the knowledge to their colleagues. Associate professor of gastro surgical department, Dr Saket Kumar, gave a vote of thanks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/igims-sees-a-rise-in-number-of-pancreatic-cancer-patients/articleshow/88363736.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||AIPWA opposes move to raise marriage age for women to 21||PATNA: The All India Progressive Women’s Association (AIPWA) on Saturday opposed the Centre’s move to raise women’s marriage age to 21. It also asked the government to withdraw its proposal in this regard, saying, “When 18-year-olds can choose a government and decide the country’s future, why deny them the right to choose their life partner?” In a joint statement issued on Saturday, AIPWA’s national president Rati Rao, national general secretary Meena Tiwari and national secretary Kavita Krishnan said, “The Union cabinet’s proposal to raise the legal age of marriage for women to 21 is ill-advised and should be withdrawn…. The age of marriage for all adults should be 18. If we consider 18-year-olds adults who can choose a government and decide the country’s future, we must accept that they are old enough to decide their own future.” “Early pregnancies adversely affect the health of young women as well as children; they also interfere with the education of women. They are forced by parents into early marriage against their will. But the answer to chronic anaemia, malnutrition, and women’s disrupted education does not lie in criminalizing marriages of those under 21,” they argued. The AIPWA members asked the government to provide a helpline and support for young women being forced by parents into marriage against their will. “It should invest in social campaigns supporting the right of women to control their own lives and take their decisions. All adults above the age of 18, irrespective of gender, must have the right to decide whether, when, and whom to marry,” they said. Rao, Tiwari and Krishnan further stated, “In India, ‘khap panchayats’, community councils, as well as sangh mobs are known to attack young inter-caste and inter-faith couples. In such cases, adult women are often wrongly termed minors and incarcerated in shelter homes from where they can secure freedom only when they agree to forsake their inter-caste or inter-faith relationships and agree to return to their parents’ home. Now such coercive parents and outfits will have a law that selectively denies women adulthood in the matter of marriage. The Union cabinet’s proposal will not empower women, it will only empower the forces that inflict such violence against women’s autonomy.” The AIPWA asked the Centre to withdraw its proposal and “amend the existing laws to respect the rights of all individuals above the age of 18 to enjoy full autonomy in all spheres of their lives, including decisions about whom to love or marry”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aipwa-opposes-move-to-raise-marriage-age-for-women-to-21/articleshow/88363651.cms||Madan Kumar

Inaugurating a two-day national symposium on the contributions of noted novelist and story writer Phanishwar Nath Renu on the occasion of his birth centenary celebrations organized by PU Hindi department here on Saturday the minister said the new administrative block would be constructed by the state government at a cost of more than Rs50 crore. “The historic Wheeler Senate House, which has witnessed the development of the entire academic, cultural and political history of the state along with the national freedom movement, will also be renovated at a cost of Rs2.5 crore,” the minister said, adding that the necessary proposals for these have already been approved by the education department. Chaudhary further pointed out that a university is known by the quality of its teaching and teachers. “Lack of infrastructural facilities can’t stop the flow of education, hence, teachers must strive hard to give their best to students,” he said. Paying his tribute to the great writer Chaudhary said, Renu’s literature was rooted deeply into the soils of the state and was quite relevant even for the contemporary world. His message to the society was loud and clear, pleading for preservation of cultural values. “Renu was not an utopian thinker and his writings were based on his own social experiences in life. He fought the Assembly elections in 1972 just to experience ‘where the shoe pinches’ (where the malaise lies in the socio-political system),” he added. The minister said the ever-increasing use of electronic gadgets by the youth is telling upon the desired growth of literature. “The academicians and littérateurs of the state must work hard to ensure preservation of our cultural values in modern literature,” Chaudhary said. PU vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Chaudhary, eminent littérateurs Purushottam Agrawal, Usha Kiran Khan, Alok Dhanwa, Ram Bachan Roy, spoke on different aspects of Renu’s life and works and called upon the younger generation to get inspiration from him.

The accused, Chhotku Yadav alias Shyam Baba, had kept the minor boy in his captivity for about a fortnight at a village in Uttar Pradesh’s Shravasti district. A special police team from Begusarai raided the accused’s hideout on Friday and rescued the minor boy. Begusarai DSP (headquarters) Nisith Priya on Saturday said the boy had gone missing from his village on December 5. “As family members failed to trace him, a kidnapping case was lodged with the Naokothi police station in Begusarai,” Priya said, adding Begusarai SP Awakash Kumar later constituted a special raid team under Bakhri SDPO Chandan Kumar to solve the case. “Electronic surveillance helped police get the location of the priest and the boy was finally rescued. The boy’s father used to run a tea stall near the temple in the village. Chhotku had picked up a fight with the boy’s father recently. He kidnapped the boy to teach his father a lesson. Chhotku is a native of Shravasti. He had married a Begusarai girl. However, his wife and in-laws had deserted him two years back. Since then, he had been living in the village alone and working as priest in a local temple,” the DSP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/begusarai-priest-held-for-kidnapping-minor-boy/articleshow/88362933.cms||---

The state industries department has decided to promote environment-friendly products made, such as corn husks, banana leaves and jute in lieu of plastic bags and thermocol products to reduce toxic plastic pollution and tackle ever-increasing garbage problem. Ashok Kumar, chief executive officer of Bihar State Khadi Village Industries Board, said Khadi Mall in Patna and other units of khadi, Bihar Museum and Bihar Emporium will start selling cutleries made of corn husk and banana leaves and jute bags from January next year. “These biodegradable products are best substitutes for plastic and thermocol-made items. The demand of environment-friendly products will rise after the ban,” he added. Kumar said minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain has asked the officials concerned to promote and sell the products made of corn husk, banana leaves and jute among other eco-friendly products which can be the alternatives of plastic and thermocol. For this, the department will provide technical as well as financial support to the entrepreneurs making biodegradable products. “During a state-level competition organized by Upendra Maharathi Shilp Anusandhan Sansthan (UMSAS), an entrepreneur, Naz Ozair from Muzaffarpur, made beautiful cutleries like plates, cups, glasses, spoons, trays and tricolour using sweet corn husk. Naz and his team has been selling these products in other states, including Gujarat, Delhi, Maharashtra and West Bengal,” said Ashok, who is also the director of UMSAS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/corn-husk-banana-leaves-to-replace-plastic-items-in-bihar/articleshow/88364567.cms||Faryal Rumi

This result came in after the AMC disconnected 360 drainage connections to private industrial estates in the city. A photo of a clean beaker with near transparent discharge from the Pirana STP — claiming that the sewage was treated with 60% efficiency— was circulated among Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) officials and the high court. Performance of other AMC-run STP plants are yet to be evaluated. “For almost two decades, this STP plant alone discharged thick sewage laced with industrial oil and toxic chemicals. Thanks to the illegal discharge of effluents into the municipal sewerage system, a large part of the sewage could not be treated,” said a senior AMC official. More municipal drainage connections to private industrial estates are to be disconnected, said AMC official. The official number is a little above 500 connections. The civic body on Saturday snapped 15 new industrial drainage connections that were diverting their effluents to the municipal sewage treatment plant, which is not designed to deal with chemical effluents. The drainage connections were in India Colony, Shahpur, Vastral, Kubernagar, Behrampura, Nikol, Ramol-Hathijan and Odhav. The AMC has disconnected 360 connections of private industrial estates in the city. These estates, each housing an average of 40 units, had permission to direct sewage into the AMC sewage treatment system while they had to drain trade effluents into CETPs. Over time, the AMC officials say, these estates began directing effluent into the domestic sewage system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-hc-intervention-discharge-from-pirana-stp-clears-up/articleshow/88364948.cms||---

While garden waste is mostly found in posh areas, tree waste is found in other areas where branches are often cut off by electricity department workers and residents. B Selvanayagi, a resident of Abdul Rahim Road at Race Course, said the garden waste was not being cleared in once in 15 days in their area. “We had taken up the issue with health officials several times, but to no avail.” R Palani, a resident of Police Quarters at Ganapathy, said the tree waste has become an eyesore in their area. “The tree waste has been piling up for more than a month now, inviting poisonous insects and snakes. A few days ago, we had spotted a snake coming out of the heap. We are afraid to let our children play outdoors. The waste is cleared only when we keep on raising the issue with officials.” The residents said there should be a mechanism in place to clear the garden and tree waste at least once in a week. A corporation official, who is posted at Race Course, said they were flooded with complaints regarding garden waste. “We get the shredder machine, which is used to shred the waste, only once or twice a month. We cannot shift the waste without shredding it into pieces.”. When contacted, a health official said only one shredder machine was available for each zone. “Ideally, there should be three shredder machines in each zone. There is a proposal to increase the number of machines. The issue can be addressed, once we get the new machines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/garden-tree-waste-piles-up-on-streets/articleshow/88364941.cms||V Devanathan

The building had been a converging point for a number of reform movements undertaken during the mid-19th century, across religious communities in the city. On its facade, the building displays the symbols of all religions — Om, lotus, sun, trident, cross, and moon crescent and a star. A flag with satyamev jayate ( truth prevails) written on it flutters atop this building which was built as per temple architecture. The building was inaugurated on August 22, 1874 though the organization had been formed on December 17, 1871 by progressive Amdavadis — Mahipatram Rupram and Lal Shankar Umiyashankar with help from mill owner Ranchodlal Chotalal — as the Ishwar Prarthana Samaj. Even before the Ishwar Prarthana Samaj was formed, another body was quite active as the ‘Dharmasabha’ in 1858-59. This was led by Bholanath Sarabhai Divetiya. The members of samaj was offered a new perspective to worship in the then-conservative Amdavadi society . Members of this group exhorted worship of the metaphysical, formless Almighty, and did not believe in idols. They tried hard to prevent child marriages and advocated widows remarriages. The society also tried to abolish dowry, blind faith, misconceptions, and other evils that communities were grappling with at that time. “The samaj initially held all-religion meetings on spiritual life. Hymns and bhajans were sung, and members of all faiths congregated at this building,” says historian Rizwan Kadri, adding that the samaj was inspired by reformer Raja Ram Mohan Roy 's religious reform movement in Bengal, called the Brahmo Samaj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/prarthana-samaj-turns-150-years-old/articleshow/88364990.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Members of NSUI said TSBIE is responsible for suicides of students.“While NSUI has been fighting for the rights of students, the inter board is least bothered to respond.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Antibodies at over 90% seven months after 2nd Covid vaccine dose, says study||PUNE: High levels of protection (seroprevalence) against Covid-19 have been detected in over 500 healthcare workers even 3-7 months after taking two doses of the Covishield vaccine, a recent analysis by the Pune-based BJ Government Medical College (BJMC) and Sassoon hospital has revealed. “With high levels of protection (seroprevalence) in participants at this point, the study concluded that a third booster, while a chunk of population is yet to get their second shots, may not be advisable,” said Dr Muralidhar Tambe, professor and head of community medicine at BJMC. The study also found that in all categories of the 558 healthcare workers (HCWs), who were part of the study, the antibody prevalence was above 90% months after completion of two Covid vaccine doses. Dr Tambe said, “Though we found that the antibody prevalence decreased as the duration of interval increased after two doses of Covid vaccine, immunity levels remained high. Antibody positivity among the study participants was at 96.77% at three months post full vaccination, rising to 100% at four months, and then falling to 91.89% at seven months after the initial two doses.” He said that except for five individuals, who had received Covaxin, all other study participants had received Covishield. Dr Tambe said that overall, of the 558 HCWs who participated in the study, 94.4% were positive for Covid-neutralizing antibodies at the time of the study. “Some of these HCWs had already completed three months, while some had completed 4-7 months after two doses of Covid vaccination. In the next aspect of the study, we analysed antibody positivity in their serum according to the duration of time period competed after full vaccination. The blood samples were collected two months ago,” he said. Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, head, microbiology department, BJMC, said, “Competitive ELISA kits were used to detect the antibodies present in the serum. As per the method, if patient’s serum anti-Covid-19 antibodies caused more than 50% signal inhibition, then his/her serum is considered to have effective neutralization activity against Sars-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid). We were able to detect a much higher percentage of antibody positivity in the sera of the HCWs several months after full vaccination, which was over 90%.” Dr Karyakarte, who is also the state coordinator for genome sequencing, said, “In addition to the immunity provided by the vaccine, many individuals may have gained hybrid immunity due to sub-clinical infection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-antibodies-at-over-90-7-months-after-2nd-dose/articleshow/88364946.cms||Neha Madaan

The court noted that the prosecution “could not secure the presence of the victim who was rescued from the spot nor of the decoy, who was used to lay the trap”. “Sections 4 and 5 of the ITP Act and Section 370 of the IPC speak of human trafficking. In the case, the human/person who was trafficked was neither examined nor the raid proved by examining the decoy. Therefore, no case is made under Section 4 and 5 of the Immoral Trafficking Act and Section 370 of the IPC,” the court held. “In fact, the panch has also not given the correct description of the spot where the raid was conducted. Hence, the accused is entitled for acquittal,” additional sessions judge, Panaji, Pooja C Kavlekar stated. The case of the prosecution was that in June 2018, the accused, Shital, also know as Anny Subba of Delhi, procured girls for the purpose of prostitution from another state. The police laid a trap and arranged a decoy customer. There were two NGOs, two panch witnesses, three PIs and the decoy customer, who contacted the accused and cracked a deal, where the accused would supply one girl for sexual favours. She was allegedly caught red-handed while delivering a girl to the prospective customer (decoy) for sexual favours, thereby living on the earnings of prostitution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/non-examination-of-victim-leads-to-acquittal-of-accused-in-trafficking-case/articleshow/88379603.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Previous govts limited their announcements to polls: CM||Lucknow: Highlighting the development works carried out in Uttar Pradesh under his government and that by the Centre after Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said earlier governments had limited their announcements and slogans to elections. “Actual work was done in Uttar Pradesh only after Prime Minister Modi took over the reins at the Centre in 2014. He not only gave respect to the labourers by honouring those who had worked on Kashi Vishwanath Dham project in Varanasi, he also showed respect to the country’s ‘aastha’ (faith). “Before 2014, slogans and announcements were limited to elections. As a result, issues related to farmers, villages, youth, ‘matra shakti’ and labourers were being continuously ignored since Independence. Our government’s policy has been to connect with people. Due to this, all sections of society are being given respect. This work has been done by the Prime Minister,” Yogi said. Elaborating on infrastructural development undertaken by his government in Uttar Pradesh, the chief minister said that between 1947 and 2017, there was construction of only “one and a half expressways” in the state. “Currently, six expressways are either ready or are being constructed. There is Ganga Expressway to connect east with west UP, Purvanchal Expressway to link central UP with eastern parts, and Bundelkhand Expressway to connect central UP with Bundelkhand,” the CM said. “A 12-lane expressway will connect Delhi and Meerut while work is underway on Gorakhpur Link Expressway and Ballia Link Expressway,” added Yogi. “The state is being taken to new heights and we are working to strengthen its economy. The Ganga Expressway will not just link two places but will also lead to industrialisation and employment generation. Other than the districts which will be linked to it, the project will reduce the distance and will also link hearts. This is the vision of PM Narendra Modi,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/previous-govts-limited-their-announcements-to-polls-cm/articleshow/88365389.cms||---

Not only this, the government formed with the claim of giving complete loan waiver to farmers and unemployment allowance to youth, but these have not been fulfilled, he said. Beniwal said instead of working for the public, Gehlot was busy trying to save his post. Before the Covid period, Gehlot was busy visiting Delhi, during pandemic he remained locked in the house leaving people to fend for themselves. “The state government is celebrating the three-year term as a festival, but from which angle is it right to celebrate the festival,” he asked. Beniwal also alleged that the bureaucracy dominates the power structure so much that they have paralysed even the CM in his ability to take decisions in public interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-has-become-a-haven-for-criminals-says-rlps-beniwal/articleshow/88364949.cms||---

Launched in August, the project is a collaboration with Banswara-based NGO Vaagdhara, which works on tribal livelihood issues. Under this campaign, children and adolescents in 750 villages of five blocks — Kushalgarh, Anandpuri, Sajjangarh, Ghatol and Gangartalai were screened to identify malnourished and acutely malnourished children. For 15 days, under the guidance of experts, selected women cooked nutritious meals as per the prescribed diet plan for identified children. “The feat was achieved by using locally available food items such as small millets like Ragi, Kangni, Sama, local vegetables, sprouted grains, groundnut brisk, til laddus, etc. Imparting training to mothers on how to cook nutritious meals with locally available food has delivered the desired results,” said Vaagdhara secretary Jayesh Joshi. “To evaluate the impact, a screening was carried out in November, exactly after 11 weeks to the programme. Astonishingly, it revealed 43 per cent children out of the malnourished group had attained the normal nutritional level,” said Joshi. The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) screened 16,000 children in Kushalgarh to figure out 4,045 children were malnourished and severely malnourished. “Of these 4045, 58.57 per cent of children were identified as malnourished and 41.43 percent severely malnourished children. The screening was done thoroughly to make sure that none of the surveyed children missed the mark of nourishment,” said Joshi. Overall, 67,000 children residing in five blocks were screened. The agencies involved in the campaign say that they are expecting the same result in all blocks. “The success of the campaign proves that mere change in the cooking pattern along with the collective effort of the agencies can resolve the problem of malnourishment in tribal children,” added Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/43-dip-in-malnourished-children-under-poshan-swaraj-abhiyan/articleshow/88364958.cms||---

At 4.4%, it is twice the overall case fatality rate recorded for Thane district (2%). Thane city has the least fatality rate. District data shows that the overall Covid fatality was 2.03% for Thane, meaning 11,596 people of the total 5.70lakh who tested positive died due to the disease since the pandemic started. Thane is the third most affected district in Maharashtra after Pune and Mumbai that have reported 19,761 and 16362 deaths.  Experts said that lack of awareness and initiatives taken by the local administrations have contributed to higher deaths in Bhiwandi than adjoining areas.  Officials from the municipal corporation blamed it on late diagnosis and hesitancy among residents to get screened. “Most people live in slums here and have little understanding of urgency for diagnosis and treatment. There are misconceptions that discourage many from approaching hospitals,” said health officer Jaywant Dhule at the Bhiwandi civic body. Even in vaccination, the town has seen slow progress.  In contrast, Thane city saw one of the lowest death rate at 1.4%.

People across age groups, including children, participated in the one-day hunger strike. All protesters wore black in a sign of solidarity. “We are not objecting to the construction of the proposed hotel, but to the destruction that will take place after its construction. We have an ancient nullah system that connects the ‘handi’ (water storage system) to the sea. Rainwater is taken care of by these ‘handis’. The nullah was built by our ancestors. The entire system was made to preserve the village and avoid flooding. These hotel projects do not benefit the village in any way, but will destroy it,” local Joaquin D’Silva said. Outgoing MLA Alina Saldana, who came to support the protesters, said, “Our interference with nature will cause trouble. It will lead to flooding in the village. Once the ecology has been damaged it’s impossible to overcome it. The project team should talk to the village committee.” Villagers alleged that the TCP and panchayat have given permission to the hotel. Protesters said that the two hotels in the village have not given locals jobs and added that this new hotel will follow suit. “We will hold an indefinite fast if the situation demands,” protesters said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-hotel-will-destroy-arossim-ecology-locals/articleshow/88379608.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||ED crackdown on firm aiding app loan scam||Hyderabad: The Enforcement Directorate, on Friday, arrested Pavitra Pradip Walvekar, promoter director and CEO of Pune-based Kudos Finance and Investment Private Limited, an NBFC company, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). He was produced before the PMLA Special Court, Hyderabad and remanded to judicial custody for 15 days. Further investigation is on. Lately, the ED has been investigating several Indian NBFC companies, in the business of disbursing instant personal loans via mobile apps, for money laundering. It found that various fintech companies backed by Chinese funds joined hands with these NBFCs to provide instant loans for a term ranging from seven to 14 days. In the case of Kudos, the ED found that although it is projected that the NBFC engaged fintech companies to offer loans, in reality, they allowed the latter to misuse the Kudos’ NBFC license. “Kudos has no mobile app of its own…the entire lending operation is being done by the fintech app from its own funds. In return Kudos is taking a commission without doing any due diligence or hard work,” a release issued by ED stated. It added: “In the entire business, fintech companies gained a profit of around Rs 544 crore and Kudos gained a profit of around Rs 24 Crore,” ED stated adding. “This is in complete violation of the RBI guidelines on NBFCs and thus, the entire profit of Rs 568 crore is nothing but proceeds of crime. The source of funds with the fintech companies is also suspect and is being investigated.” Kudos tied up with 39 apps in the last one year. As per the arragement the fintech companies captured customers’ data by getting access to their mobile contacts, media etc. To obtain more profits and maintain high recovery rate their call centers resorted to harsh recovery measures by using abusive language to entire phone list and contacts and misuse of social media privileges. “Unable to bear the harassment, certain people have committed suicides. Moreover, at the time of loan disbursal itself, the app would deduct 15% to 25% of the amount as processing fee and charged a very high interest on the remaining amount. They claimed a loan recovery rate of around 95%,” the ED added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ed-crackdown-on-firm-aiding-app-loan-scam/articleshow/88364409.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Jaipur||To mark govt’s 3rd anniversary, Rajasthan CM lays foundation of 2,400 schemes||JAIPUR: To mark three years of the state government, chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday laid the foundation stones of 2,408 projects costing about Rs 9,405 crore in nine departments and inaugurated 104 projects costing about Rs 3,790 crore. Addressing a function organised at the chief minister's residence, Gehlot said the state government had successfully realised the basic mantra of good governance in the last three years. He said 70 per cent of the promises made in party manifesto had been fulfilled so far. The implementation of 87 per cent of announcements of the last three budgets shows the stupendous achievement of our government in spite of all the adversities including the pandemic, major fall in revenue and political challenges, he added. Gehlot also used the occasion to take on the central government. He said the central government has a big role in the development of the states. It government should take initiative to financially empower all the states but its behaviour has been negative, he added. He reiterated the demand for grant of national project status to Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project (ERCP), an important project from the point of view of drinking water and irrigation in 13 districts. He said the Centre should increase its share in other centrally sponsored schemes including Jal Jeevan Mission. Gehlot said at the time of Covid, the state government fulfilled the duty of saving lives by delivering the best management. For treatment of people, medicines were ordered using chartered planes. The ‘Mukhyamantri Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojna’ would free the common man from the huge cost of treatment. The government implemented ‘Mukhyamantri Kisan Mitra Urja Yojna’, due to which lakhs of farmers of the state are getting subsidy of up to Rs 12,000 per annum on electricity bills. Due to this scheme, the electricity bill of around 3 lakh farmers had now become zero. To provide quality education to children, the government took initiative to open English medium schools. About 123 new colleges were opened, including 33 girls colleges. A decision has been taken to open a girls’ college anywhere if there are 500 or more girls in class 12th in a higher secondary schools. Speaking on the occasion, PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra alleged that the Centre was discriminating against the state citing the DAP and urea shortage facing farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/to-mark-govts-3rd-anniv-gehlot-lays-foundation-of-2-4k-schemes/articleshow/88364966.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Search team closes in on tiger in Wayanad, fresh pug marks found||KOZHIKODE: The forest department on Saturday claimed that they have determined the approximate location of the elusive tiger which had been spreading panic at Kurukkanmoola in Wayanad for over two weeks. The department claimed that they missed out on the injured tiger at Begur reserve forest on Saturday by seconds and were confident about capturing it at least by Sunday. Officials said that Saturday was a positive day as very fresh pug marks were found based on which they were able to determine the approximate location as Kaveripoyil in the forest fringes. “We were able to reach really close to the approximate location of the tiger but there was no direct sighting. We were able to locate the presence based on the pug marks. We are trying our best to find it at least by Sunday. Three darting teams are ready to tranquilize the tiger if it is spotted. Possibility of darting the tiger in night is low but it may enter the trap cages during the night,” said a senior forest official. South Wayanad DFO A Shajna said that they were able to feel the presence of the tiger very closely unlike the previous days. “Almost all tracking teams are closing in on that target. In Saturday’s search, its physical presence was observed in some places. So, we believe that we’ve moved a bit closer to the task of capturing the tiger. From the response that we got from the teams, we almost missed the tiger by seconds on Saturday. However, they are yet to sight in a distance from where darts can be fired to tranquilize it,” said Shajna. She added that with the search concentrated in this area, they were hopeful of finding the tiger by Sunday. “Teams are ready for darting whenever an opportunity arises,” she said. Meanwhile, pug marks were found at Kurukkanmoola village on Saturday morning as well. Over 230 personnel on the ground apart from 30 police personnel had been searching for the tiger for over a fortnight. A family, which was travelling in a car, had reportedly sighted the tiger crossing a road at Puthiyedam late on Thursday night. On Friday, the village had witnessed tension as the irate residents engaged in a scuffle with the forest officials. Police have registered two separate cases in connection with the scuffle. Cases were filed based on the complaint by both the residents and the forest officials against each other. The situation had further escalated on Friday when a forest staff member in the search team allegedly tried to take out a knife during the scuffle. The DYFI on Saturday staged a protest against forest officials in connection with the incident on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/search-team-closes-in-on-tiger-fresh-pug-marks-found/articleshow/88364419.cms||---

Near them a child had one eye on the timer as she tried to finish a Tangalia pattern. “All are winners here, but the biggest winner is Gujarati art,” said Jay Thakkar, associate professor at CEPT University and coordinator for the Threads of Innovation project. As part of the project, university students undertook rigorous interaction with artisans during the pandemic year. The challenge posed to them was converting their learning into a children’s game that could give a peek into the history of the craft and its practices. The ongoing winter exhibition at the university has the project proudly displayed with its book and documentation. Sanjana Mahadevan, one of the students who created the Ajrakhpur game, said that the challenge was to understand nuances of the entire craft, deconstruct it and add the element of competition. “At first, the young players found it a bit difficult, but once they got the hang of it, it was fun,” she said. Likewise, Srushti Mehta, who created Sangam game based on woollen artisans in Kutch, said that she focused on the largely undiscussed part of the craft – logistics. “The students earn charkha, create workshops based on the resources, and also get a peek into the lives of communities associated with it,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/learning-gujarats-coveted-crafts-through-games/articleshow/88364960.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Lucknow||PM Modi’s ‘upyogi’ remark is stamp of approval for Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Symbols and gestures in politics perhaps have more meaning than words. Of late, no one has used it more than Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Even as people continue to talk about a photograph of the PM making a friendly stroll with chief minister Yogi Adityanath at the Governor’s House, putting his hand on the CM’s shoulder, the PM’s statement that “UP plus Yogi means ‘UPYOGI’ (useful)” has left political observers analysing the political meaning behind these gestures. Modi’s remark on Yogi came on Saturday at Shahjahanpur where the PM was addressing a gathering after laying the foundation stone for the 594-km Ganga Expressway. The six-lane Ganga Expressway between Meerut and Prayagraj would be completed by 2025. Modi said now UP bulldozers run on mafia’s illegal properties and on illegal buildings. But it gives immense pain to those who patronise the mafia. That is why people of UP are now saying – ‘UP + Yogi’ is very useful (UPYOGI). Showering praise on Yogi, Modi didn’t stop here. There is a market in Meerut called Sotiganj. Vehicles stolen from any part of the country were brought there and cut into pieces, Modi said and added that Yogi got that illegal market bulldozed. “Those who like the company of mafia speak their language. We love the country’s language,” Modi said. Interestingly, Modi’s remark that Yogi is useful for UP comes at a time when deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya has begun hogging the limelight. Focus on Keshav, too, has increased after Modi’s gesture during the foundation laying ceremony of Jewar International Airport around three weeks back. While leaders present on the dais during the function were waving at the crowd, the PM was seen holding Maurya’s hands and asking him to come forward and wave with him and other leaders, including the CM. Before the Jewar programme, Keshav had apparently been absent at a few programmes attended by the PM. After Modi’s gesture, political observers began analysing the significance of Maurya and that it was a balancing act between two top BJP leaders of the state. Even as political observers were analysing Modi’s gesture towards Maurya, a photograph again surfaced corroborating the observers’ claim that Maurya’s importance in UP BJP politics is at par with the CM. This time the PM was seen putting his hand on Maurya’s shoulder. Maurya was seen meeting Modi at Parliament building despite the fact that the PM had a busy schedule with the House in progress as well as Russian President Valadmir Putin’s presence in the country. Since then the deputy CM has been seen hogging the limelight and also sharing the dais at various events along with the PM and the CM. Even as supporters of Keshav Maurya were upbeat over the developments of the past few weeks and that there is no denying the fact that the central leadership holds Maurya’s political clout at a high esteem, the PM’s remark around Yogi is also a stamp on the fact that UP BJP will go to polls with Yogi Adityanath as its face. “It’s almost a decisive statement by the PM to say ‘UP+Yogi bahut hai UPYOGI’,” a political observer said. “It should rest all speculations, if any, around who would be the face of the UP BJP in the coming elections,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/modis-upyogi-remark-is-stamp-of-approval-for-cm/articleshow/88365403.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

The Congress is the main opposition party in the Chandigarh municipal corporation while Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is contesting Chandigarh MC polls for the first time. BJP is the ruling party in the Chandigarh MC. Congress party workers, who are closely working with Rajinder Rana, said that he regularly holds four to five public meetings in favour of Congress candidates in different wards, besides holding nukkad meetings with city residents. On Saturday, Rana addressed rallies in sectors 41, 7, 42 and 22 B and Maloya in favour of Congress candidates. He has brought a team of over 60 Congress leaders from Himachal Pradesh, who have been given responsibilities of ward coordinators and of assisting main ward coordinators. Rana, who defeated former chief minister of Himachal Pradesh, Prem Kumar Dhumal, in the 2017 assembly polls, is targeting the ruling BJP on issues like the slip in the city’s sanitation raking to 66, privatisation of the profitable power department, hike in water tariff and sewerage cess etc. Recently, Rana played a crucial role in getting Varinder Guleria, former president of the Himachal Cell of Chandigarh BJP, to join the Congress and that too on a day when Himachal CM Jai Ram Thakur cwas in town campaigning for BJP candidates. He has also been handling the unenviable task of pacifying workers unhappy with the party’s ticket distribution. He went for a tea at the party leader’s house. The next day, he went for dinner at another leader’s house and convinced both to work for campaigning. Rana, who has a house in Sector 33, also activated his local teams to campaign for the Congress. He is regularly coordinating with former Union minister Pawan Kumar Bansal, on campaign-related issues. Box: BJP scared of defeat “BJP is bringing union ministers, chief ministers, former chief ministers and other star campaigners for MC elections. Had they worked for public welfare and for betterment of Chandigarh in the last five to six years, there was no need to bring these leaders to the city for campaigning. The public of Chandigarh is ready to oust BJP from Chanadigarh MC and Congress party is heading towards a thumping victory in the MC polls,” said Rajinder Rana during a public meeting on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/congs-rana-plays-people-card-ahead-of-mc-polls/articleshow/88364414.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Vehicles were temporarily blocked from entering D B Marg and were diverted through the narrow road behind the Adil Shah Palace. This led to an over two-hour long traffic jam. “There was a rehearsal and traffic was not blocked completely, it was diverted,” said North Goa SP (traffic) Shekhar Prabhudesai. Many citizens said that after seeing the massive traffic jam, they turned around and returned home from Panaji church square without entering the city. “We had to return without completing the work we had come for. We were worried we would be stuck the entire afternoon. The vehicles were barely moving for over an hour,” said a resident of Ribandar. Officials, however, said that the rehearsal of the traffic diversion plan was implemented for a very short period. “There was a slight after effect, we will try to minimize this from happening on Sunday,” Prabhudesai said. For Sunday, parking lots have been arranged at Campal Parade Ground, Dhempe College and V M Salgaonkar College of Law for the event at Miramar Beach. For the event at Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Stadium, parking will be opposite ETDC, open space and lanes of Goa University residential quarters and near the Jubilee Hall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/diversion-drill-for-pms-visit-sees-huge-traffic-jam-in-panaji/articleshow/88364470.cms||---

In the attack, two persons, Nemi Chand Pancharia and Tolaram suffered burn injuries to their eyes, nose, hands and legs at Sribalaji town in Nagaur district. In an unfortunate turn of events, both the customers had visited the jewellers’ shop to complain over the poor jewellery quality they had purchased from the same. Both the victims have lodged a case of assault against the jewellers at the Sribalaji police station. According to the police, the customer Raghuver Pancharia in his complaint stated that his father Nemi Chand Pancharia had purchased some gold ornaments from the jewellery shop situated at Sribalaji town a few days ago. “Suspecting that the gold quantity was not up to the mark they approached the jewellers to seek a refund of their money which was nearly Rs 40000,” said a senior police officer of Sribalaji police station on Saturday. Police added that after Nemichand and one of his family members, Tolaram reached the jewellery shop on Friday evening, a verbal confrontation started between the two parties, followed by abusive exchange of words. This turned violent when the two jewellers, identified as Labhchand and Sundarlal threw acid on them leading to burn injuries. “The victims underwent medical examinations. We have registered a case of assault and have initiated investigation into the matter,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jewellers-throw-acid-on-complaining-customers/articleshow/88364974.cms||---

The health department was expecting more people to turn up for vaccination in view of apprehensions about the Omicron variant. While seven lakh people in the district are eligible for the second dose, many of them are still to get the jab. “There is a need for another extensive campaign to create awareness on vaccination, especially when we aim at fully vaccinating the eligible population by the end of this year,” said deputy director of health services Dr P Aruna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/72-of-eligible-population-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/88364977.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Repeated closures a jolt to IB curriculum launch||NEW DELHI: Frequent school closures due to Covid-19 and pollution have hit the Delhi government’s plan to introduce International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum at 10 Sarvodaya Vidyalayas this year. The curriculum is now likely to be introduced at these schools from the next academic session. A senior government official said, “The programme was for classes up to VIII. With continuous school closures, there is hardly any time now to implement it this session. However, the modules have already been prepared and the teachers trained”. On August 11, the Delhi government had signed an MoU with the IB to start the curriculum in 30 schools. These 30 schools are part of the newly constituted Delhi Board of School Education and include 20 Specialised Schools of Excellence (SSoE) for classes IX to XII and 10 Sarvodaya Vidyalayas. The private schools, which have been running the IB curriculum, are helping the teachers of these 10 Sarvodaya Vidyalayas with module preparation and training. At SSoE, the session started late—from September 2—this year, but it will be completed by the end of March 2022 itself. Like for other schools, the new session will begin at SSOEs from April 1, 2022. In these schools, the admissions have taken place for Class IX. Only for Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) discipline, admissions have been done for Class XI as well. “For this year, it will be a shorter session. Due to the pandemic and other preparations, the admission process was little delayed,” said the official. Only recently, students of these SSoEs have had their first exams. Rajpal Singh, principal of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, Yamuna Vihar, said, “For the two units that were taught, the assessment was completed a day ago. Continuous assessment is being held for the students. 21st-century life skill courses are what we teach at this school”. “Apart from teachers, resource persons also visit the school. For 10 days, there were visiting faculty from IIT Delhi. There is another organisation that is teaching multi-skill planning, finance planning and economics,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/repeated-closures-a-jolt-to-ib-curriculum-launch/articleshow/88365662.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Nagpur||Road expansion threatens Satpura-Melghat tiger corridor||Madhya Pradesh, with 526 tigers, narrowly pipped Karnataka (524 tigers) to win back the ‘Tiger Stripe’ tag after the All India Tiger Estimation (AITE)-2018. But it may lose this distinction due to callousness in enforcing wildlife mitigation measures for linear projects like roads by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The state has already lost 37 tigers this year due to various reasons, including road hits.MP seems to have learnt no lessons from the dispute over wildlife mitigation on Pench-Kanha corridor (NH7) where the NHAI fell in line only after high court orders. Now a similar dispute has developed on NH46 (Betul-Hoshangabad), cutting the functional corridor between Melghat-Satpura tiger reserves.Both, NHAI and MP forest department have bypassed the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, by not seeking National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), and National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) permissions while deciding on wildlife mitigation structures to expand three corridor stretches — Baretha Ghat, Bhoura (in Betul) and Kesla Ghat (Hoshangabad).During a visit to Baretha, TOI found tree felling, cutting of ghat and levelling of roads in the forest stretch. Though the contractor JSIPL, Pune, claimed work is as per permissions from the forest department, the mitigation structures are not as per MoEFCC guidelines, approved by NTCA and MoRTH.The NTCA has explicit powers to ensure tiger reserves and corridors link one protected area to another are not diverted for ecologically unsustainable uses, except in public interest and that too with the approval of NBWL and NTCA. In such sensitive corridors, a minimum 300-metre underpass is needed for every kilometre of road passing through the forests. Sources told TOI, “After much politics, NHAI is making only 5 underpasses in 6km ghat section. These will be 15 to 200 metre long and 5 metres high. The combined length of all structures is 600 metres in the entire 6km Baretha stretch.”All three forested patches fall in the tiger conservation plan (TCP) of both Satpura and Melghat tiger reserves, and hence as per the Wildlife (Protection) Act, permission of the NBWL and NTCA is mandatory. This has not been taken. The staff at work say six days ago there was tiger movement in Baretha ghat section.MP’s Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (wildlife) Alok Kumar said, “It is true that NBWL and NTCA permissions are needed. However, NHAI agreed to mitigation measures and work is being done as per set conditions only. I will check the conditions and get back to you.” However, Kumar failed to share the conditions and details of mitigation measures.Vivek Jaiswal, NHAI regional manager, Bhopal, said the project was to be completed by 2019 but got delayed as tree felling permission was awaited and mitigation measures were yet to be decided. He too did not share mitigation details. “The issue has been resolved now,” he said.The casual approach of MP forest department and NHAI, and NTCA’s silence is set to destroy the vital corridor connecting Satpura-Melghat, the two largest tiger reserves of Central Indian Landscape (CIL). Mitigation structures have not yet been decided in the other two stretches of Kesla Ghat and Bhoura. The NH46 from Betul to Obedullaganj connects Betul to Bhopal and bisects three sensitive patches in Baretha, Kesla Ghat and Bhoura.A report ‘Connecting tiger populations for long-term conservation’ by well-known experts Q Qureshi, S Saini, P Basu, Rajesh Gopal, R Raza, and YV Jhala says this corridor is mostly through forested landscape with low-intensity agriculture and human density. It insists on safeguarding this corridor to maintain functionality of habitat as a viable corridor permitting gene flow of wild species between Satpura and Melghat.The project work has recently resumed with fresh tree-felling and earthwork being undertaken. The forest staff on the spot said NHAI has felled over 10,000 trees till now. Inquiries showed the construction of several minor bridges is being passed off as mitigation measures for wildlife. “The mitigation measures are nowhere close to those required by rules,” said wildlife conservationists.“The Satpura and Melghat tiger reserves lack sufficient tiger numbers, and need intervening corridors for tigers to move about. What is the point of voluntary relocation of villages to recover tiger populations if we destroy connectivity between these two tiger reserves,” asked Udayan Patil, wildlife conservationist.Conservationists called the mitigation measures a farce and said nothing has changed even after the NH7 legal battle. “No lessons have been learned by the forest officials,” says environment and wildlife Manish Jeswani.The activists have demanded action against forest officials for negligence and dereliction of duty. “What was the NTCA doing? Why did its officials not act on this,” they asked.Conservationists working in the Satpura landscape said, “Tweets by MoRTH minister Nitin Gadkari claiming to build world-class mitigation measures on NH7 are an eyewash, as the roads ministry destroys several other corridors. The MoRTH itself has said that the linear guidelines of MoEFCC should be followed, then why did MoRTH fail to follow them?”WILDLIFE LAWS SHOWN THE DOOR?* Rs800 crore project sanctioned in 2014 but stuck over contractual disputes* Tree felling started 3 years ago and recently resumed* No mitigation measures in Kesla Ghat & Bhoura forest patches* Mitigation in Baretha patch insufficient, not in line with guidelines* Minor bridges being passed off as mitigation steps* Clearance of State Board for Wildlife (SBWL), NTCA & NBWL not taken* Mitigation as per MoRTH protocols also not doneIMPACT OF NO MITIGATION MEASURES* The Satpura-Melghat in Central India & Eastern Ghats is among the 32 major tiger corridors across the country mapped by the NTCA.

Accordingly, the NMC approached over 70 different banks requesting seizure of these accounts.The department has attached these accounts over the past one month. The official said the NMC had given the defaulters every opportunity available under rules to clear the dues.He further said that if the amount is not recovered soon, the process of seizing and auctioning the properties to recover dues will be initiated. Only 442 traders cleared their dues which comes to around Rs1.41 crore. As a last resort, the NMC has attached the bank accounts of 2,497 traders. “There is a provision of recovering dues by seizing accounts,” said Meshram. Meshram claimed that none of the traders neither replied to NMC’s notices nor raised objection on department’s assessment. During scrutiny of documents, the LBT department found that around 1,010 traders had not submitted bank account details and their outstanding dues had reached Rs239.82 crore.Now, the LBT department has submitted revenue recovery certificates to all the assistant commissioners to go ahead with the seizure and auction of properties to recover the dues from the 1,010 businessmen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-seizes-bank-a/c-of-2497-traders-to-recover-rs286cr-lbt-arrears/articleshow/88363005.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Documentary on Balaramapuram handlooms||Thiruvananthapuram: New York based fashion designer and movie maker Sanjana John arrived in Balaramapuram for the shooting of her documentary on traditional handloom here on Saturday. The documentary will be an anecdote of the history of the arrival of handlooms, its connection with the erstwhile royal family of Travancore, the lost glory behind it and her plans for the future to regain the lost glory and fame. “Handloom industry is undergoing one of its toughest times. These experienced craftsmen should not be let for exploitations of any sort. They must be duly recognised and equally rewarded, for the smooth continued growth of the industry, for the very survival of this great art,” Sanjana John said “My role is to enlighten the weavers to design and produce materials attractive and acceptable through traditional handloom weaving and how to ensure new, global markets. That only will do well to the very survival of traditional handlooms,” she said . Specially designed handloom woven materials will be showcased during the Oscar event. As representatives from many countries arrive at Oscar, this will give natural visibility, acceptance and markets in these countries as well. Traditional weavers working for 50-70 years deserve better recognition for their craftsmanship. Though very renowned, conventional handloom dhoti, saree etc are not in use in other nations. “Hence the weavers need to be trained on customised designer wear acceptable in these countries and ensure global markets,” Sanjana John said. “Several measures are being initiated for the revival of the handloom industry, in association with the CISSA. New generations have reluctance in coming into looming. Our mission is to allay their apprehensions. The state capital is on its development path. Our aim is to explore those avenues to the welfare of the handloom industry as well. More plans are in the pipeline, in association with the NABARD,” said V Muraleedharan, union minister of state for external affairs. Sanjana John is voluntarily extending her initiatives for the development of Balaramapuram handlooms being spearheaded by CISSA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/documentary-on-balaramapuram-handlooms/articleshow/88364429.cms||---

Unveiling the mural art on the walls of the housing unit of Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board at Ukkadam with Coimbatore collector G Sameeran and corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara, Balaji said public facilities such as government buildings and bridges will soon have paintings reflecting the cultural and tradition of Tamils. “We will soon launch a scheme to prevent pillars of flyovers and government buildings from getting defaced by posters,” he said. Based on 25 petitions received at Makkal Sabai meetings, road works to the tune of Rs 6.38 crore will be carried out, the minister said. “New street lights will be installed and construction works will be carried out at a cost of Rs 6.91 crore. Road works and other development works focusing on basic infrastructure facilities will be developed at a cost of Rs 15 crore in Pullukkadu area.” “Special teams consisting of 20 conservancy workers and 20 dengue breeding checkers will be formed in the five zones of the city corporation to identify three problematic places a day and take up works such as clearing drainage, clearing mosquito breeding sources and removing pruned tree branches. Every week, 90 places will be cleaned by the teams,” he said. The minister, who met members of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Friday, said a 1,500-seat auditorium, multi-level car parking and a common facility for jewellery makers will be set up soon in the district. The members urged the minister to expedite road widening work, metro rail project, restoration of lakes and ensure availability of drinking water. The minister said that the government is formulating projects for the next 10 years based on the requirement of Coimbatore. Responding to the claims of former electricity minister P Thangamani that DMK has falsely framed him in the disproportionate asset case, Balaji asked him to disclose his family asset from 2006 till 2021, which will reveal exponential increase over false means.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/minister-warns-of-action-against-aiadmk-cadre/articleshow/88364992.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

DCP (Jaipur North) Paris Deshmukh said the police are planning to file the chargesheet in the case on Monday. "We will take up the case under the Case Officer’s Scheme and efforts are underway to file the chargesheet on Monday," he said. Deshmukh said the investigation moved swiftly because it involved a crime against a minor. The incident had taken place on Thursday evening when the girl’s parents learned about the matter. They approached the nearest police station and filed an FIR against the boy. The investigation in the case was handed over to a senior official posted in the special unit constituted to probe crimes against minors. Police said both the girl and the boy used to play together as they were neighbours. Police said the FIR was registered immediately and her medical examination was also done. Deshmukh said the police had immediately begun to search for the boy and detained him.

---||Ahmedabad||Most Omicron cases show no symptoms||AHMEDABAD/RAJKOT/SURAT: The patients of Omicron variant of Covid-19 are not drastically different from the Alpha and Delta variants the experts have seen in the first and second waves — for the start, majority of the patients that got detected with the variant are asymptomatic, and don’t need oxygen support. The first three patients of Gujarat — all from Jamnagar — were discharged from the government-run GG Hospital recently. The experts said that except the first case where a septuagenarian had developed fever and dry cough, the other two were asymptomatic. “Their temperatures were checked regularly, and they were given paracetamol and multivitamin tablets as part of Covid protocol. Apart from that, they did not need any medical intervention,” said a treating doctor. “According to the protocol, they are supposed to remain quarantined for the next seven days and report to us if any problem arises. They were discharged after they tested negative twice after 14 days.” Dr Rakesh Joshi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad, said that the sole patient the hospital has — a native of Kheda with travel history to the UK — is stable. “In Delta variant, we had seen high involvement of lungs. Here, it’s not the case. The caution, however, is still required as Omicron is considered to be highly contagious and the patients are kept in a separate ward,” he said. The only Omicron patient in Surat did not complain of any health issues since he tested positive. No symptoms were found during examination by doctors. “He was as normal as a healthy person,” said a health official. A 42-year-old businessman who had returned from Africa had tested positive after eight days of return and later the variant was confirmed in genome testing. City-based experts said that sore throat, body ache, and mild fever are among the symptoms recorded in India and elsewhere. They, however, added that more details are required to ascertain the progression of the variant.

---||Jodhpur||Cops by his side, undertrial shot dead in Jodhpur while returning to prison||JODHPUR: Firing incidents continue to rock Jodhpur, the hometown of chief minister Ashok Gehlot. In yet another such incident on Saturday evening, two unidentified persons opened fire at an undertrial in presence of policemen while he was being taken back to jail after a hearing in Pali. The victim, Surendra Singh, was rushed to the hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. The assailants, however, managed to flee from the spot. Considering it to be an act of revenge, police have launched a hunt for the shooters. The incident left the people around in utter bewilderment as the shooters made the move in broad daylight amid the huge bustling of people, barely a few meters away from the Ratanada police station. According to the DCP (East) Bhuwan Bhushan Yadav, Singh had been under judicial custody in a case related to retaliatory firing on one Jabar Singh in Pali and was facing trial in a court there. "He had been lodged in Pali jail, but was shifted to the Jodhpur jail some time back due to over-crowding," he said. "He was being taken back to Jodhpur after hearing in Pali by bus. He along with the guards had got off the bust at Bhatia Circle here in the evening. As they were crossing the road, two unidentified motorcycle-borne persons suddenly shot at Singh with a pistol," said the official, adding that two bullets hit Singh and he fell on the ground. The guards rushed him to the hospital with the help of the people around. As the information spread, police officials rushed to the spot, and an FSL team was roped in to collect evidence. As it took place amid the third-anniversary celebrations of the Congress government in state and at the CM’s hometown, the incident found an instant reaction from the BJP and the RLP. Slamming Gehlot, Jodhpur Organisation in-charge Vasudev Devnanai said despite holding the home portfolio, Gehltot had no control over crime. RLP supremo Hanuman Beniwal, in his tweet, said the reputation of police in the state was at stake and Gehlot had miserably failed in handling the law and order not only in the state, but in his hometown as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/cops-by-his-side-undertrial-shot-dead-in-jodhpur-while-returning-to-prison/articleshow/88364998.cms||---

CEC will also launch new initiatives. On Wednesday, he will meet the chief secretary, director general of police (DGP) and home secretary. Political parties are likely to raise the issues of job scam before the CEC. Meanwhile, CEO Kunal has already started meetings with political parties, law enforcement agencies and banking officials among others to conduct free and fair elections. Last week Kunal, called upon the nodal officer appointed for election expenditure monitoring and law and order management to curb the use of money and muscle power in the ensuing assembly elections. Kunal also asked Goa police to identify persons with criminal backgrounds and take preventive measures so as to ensure a conducive atmosphere before the elections. During the meeting, it was decided that the commercial tax department, income tax department, central GST department, enforcement directorate, directorate of revenue intelligence and police will enhance surveillance on movement, storage and distribution of unauthorised cash and goodies.

The samples of eight close contacts have been sent for genome sequencing, said VMC officials. They said that the couple did not have any symptoms when they were tested. The duo had undergone tests only on the suggestion of some relatives four days after they arrived from Zambia. The couple was not from an ‘at risk’ country and was under self-observation. It had undergone a test before leaving Zambia and had tested negative for Covid-19. Sources said that out of 51 contacts of the couple, samples of eight close ones were sent for genome sequencing without waiting for positive Covid-19 results to save time. The couple has been admitted to a private hospital in Vadodara city. The duo did not have any major symptoms till Saturday when one of them complained of headache and another had mild fever and sore throat. On Saturday, 15 fresh Covid-19 cases were reported in the Vadodara city and district. All these cases barring one were from the city. Twelve patients were discharged leaving 109 active cases. None of the patients were critical, but four were on oxygen support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-omicron-cases-51-contacts-identified/articleshow/88363624.cms||---

While another 10 lakh masks are imported from Delhi on a daily basis, the cost has remained high at Rs 10 to Rs 15 for a three-layer mask purchased over the counter. On the outskirts of the city, there are about 10 production units, each with a capacity to manufacture one lakh to four lakh surgical masks every day. Despite all this, prices have not come down despite a growing demand thanks to the involvement of middlemen in the trade. Owing to this, users are forced to pay 5-10 times more than the cost of manufacturing on each mask. There was some volatility for masks during and after the first and second waves of Covid-19, but prices have largely remained unchanged even after expanded local production, market analysts say. Manufacturers sell it to retailers for as little as 90 paise to Rs 1. During the first wave of Covid-19, shops could purchase the masks for around Rs 8 or Rs 9, but now the manufacturers sell them for less than Rs 2, although the costs stay the same. “Prices will not rise from our side because there are enough units in the city,” Srivas Bhatti, a manufacturer, said. “Demand spiked last week as a result of Omicron concerns, but then decreased swiftly again,” he said. According to experts, masking is more than mandatory in light of the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) finding that the R-value of Omicron is 1.6 times and four times more than Delta variant. “It is preferable to wear threeply surgical masks or N95 masks every time we leave the house, not just when entering huge gatherings,” Kiran Madala, an Indian Council for Medical Research-certified researcher, said. He emphasised that the transmission rate was high in the Omicron variant and that good mask usage was the first effective weapon against the variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/price-of-masks-remains-high-despite-high-production-rate/articleshow/88364426.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The announcement was made by AAP national leader and member of parliament (MP) Sanjay Singh during a public rally in Dhanas. Singh was in the city to campaign for AAP. Since there is a large number of voters from Purvanchal in the city and they are considered a key deciding factor in elections, AAP is trying to woo them through its UP leader. Holding a broom in his hand, Sanjay Singh said that AAP knew how to clean corruption. “Everyone in Delhi knows that the Aam Aadmi Party does what it says. The party does not make false promises,” he said. He also promised 20,000 liters of water to each family every month and said classrooms in schools will be built like Delhi schools. Other promises he made included setting up of mohalla clinics, cleaning of the park, provision of dedicate place for Chhath Pooja and free electricity, water, healthcare and education. Expressing confidence about an AAP victory, he said that the party would work for women’s empowerment. Somnath Bharti, MLA, Delhi AAP, said Arvind Kejriwal had tried to redefine politics. “We are together to support the people of Purvanchal. Three MLAs of Delhi have come so that the victory of Aam Aadmi Party is assured here too,” he said. AAP candidate from ward 15 (Dhanas-Sarangpur) is Ramchandra Yadav, a local resident. Yadav has been active in the area and was chosen by the party on the basis of survey and internal assessment. Many prominent leaders of Chandigarh AAP unit and AAP MLAs from Delhi were present on this occasion. Thanking them, Ramchandra Yadav appealed for votes and support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-assures-rs-1000-to-women-above-18-yrs-of-age/articleshow/88364422.cms||---
---||Delhi||No cutoff means pressure to score high in final exams less: Students||NEW DELHI: Delhi University’s (DU) decision to conduct entrance examinations from the next academic session has been welcomed by many Class XII students who are eyeing a seat in the varsity. For them, this is a welcome change as the pressure to score very high marks in their board examinations is now off their chest. When the university’s new plans came to light, for DU aspirant Vanshika Kanaujia, the first thought was that there would be “another exam.” However, she said the afterthoughts looked brighter to her. “There are boards that are more lenient with their marking system and students end up having a higher score than the rest. With respect to that, the entrance examinations are definitely a good idea. This will at least bring some uniformity,” Kanaujia, who wants to pursue BA (H) Economics, said. The university, in a decision taken on Friday, paved the way for a common entrance test to be conducted following recommendations of a committee, which was constituted under the varsity’s dean of examination DS Rawat. Aarushi Menon, another aspirant, said, “We should approach this change with a balanced view. While there is a lot of anxiety involved as we appear for the board examinations, with entrances, it will be slightly reduced. However, we cannot completely reduce the importance of board examinations as in the future, employers may want to look at the results.” “Getting a chance to appear for entrances will help us give a better shot at our dream colleges because we do not have to depend completely on our board results,” Menon, who wishes to study BA (H) English, said. Kanaujia further added, “If admissions are based only on entrances then boards might not be that significant but we will still have to study hard to build a base. However, the pressure of securing a 98% or 99% will not be there.” Stating that shifting to a common entrance test was a good idea, Piyush Rangra, another aspirant, said, “It will lay down a standardised procedure and provide an equal base to students. I am waiting for the exact guidelines to be issued so that I can begin with the preparations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-cutoff-means-pressure-to-score-high-in-final-exams-less-students/articleshow/88365667.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Beyond boundaries: Remembering the ‘mother hen’ of women’s cricket||The Albees. That was the name of the first "ladies' cricket team" in Bombay. It was short for Aloo Bamjee, the purposeful Parsi woman who used to stride into the Cricket Club of India lawns every Saturday with a hand-fan, a hat and a heckle. In a mini Morris driven by her brother-in-law Kawas, Bamjee--a maternal, childless widow--would arrive bearing washed socks, stockings and sandwiches for the braided batters practicing in the nets and suffix their ill-timed shots with her go-to interjection: “Uppish!” Had she been alive, Bamjee--who had never wielded a willow--would have hit an off-the-field century this month. On her birth centenary on December 28, though, you 're not likely to wake up to a Google Doodle of this short-haired pioneer of women's cricket. Despite having acquainted the city’s softball-playing young girls with the season ball in 1969 Bombay--four years before the Indian Women’s Cricket Association was born--Bamjee remains digitally untraceable, her legacy bereft of even a Wikipedia page. “I doubt the current XI know who Mrs Bamjee was,” says former Albee-ite Shobha Pandit. “She is the reason they are.” Aloo Bamjee with the Albees team.A CCI member, Bamjee began “nursing” women’s cricket with a single-minded fervour after the death of her husband, Homi. The circulars she sent to schools and colleges drew in a motley bunch of teens and future bankers who would find Bamjee standing her ground against gender-based concessions during their first meeting with legendary batsman Vijay Merchant when he’d advise using a soft ball and smaller boundary lines. Besides CCI grants for bi-weekly practice sessions, Bamjee arranged for Raj Singh Dungarpur and Arvind Apte to coach the girls aged 16 to 23 years, away from the eyes of skeptics who were hungry to know: Will they be bowling underarm? Will they wear sarees? Sarees and pinafores would be hastily shed and white slacks left behind by male players, donned in the ladies’ cloak room twice a week. The April sun would truncate their matches to 20 overs long before T20. “Mrs Bamjee bought gloves and bats for the girls who could not afford them,” says Albees’ former captain Rashna Vaid, remembering the broken-Hindi-spouting founder who would take the girls’ dust-ridden mittens and stockings home to get them washed for the next session.  “She was like a mother hen,” says Behroze Edulji about Bamjee who would demand “hard work and practice” in exchange for imported chocolates and Parsi delicacies. Along with her sister Diana--who used to play tennis-ball cricket with the boys at Badhwar Park--Behroze would head during the monsoons to Bamjee’s vast home overlooking Wankhede stadium. “She would hang a ball in the doorway,” recalls Behroze. “We used to practise hitting there.” The batters were called “batswomen” or, broadly, “the Eves” then. Bats had to be raised to silence crude remarks on the street, kits had to be shared and compliments earned. “People used to scoff at us,” says former “batswoman” Silloo Medhora, recalling the pre-Velcro times when she would wait for the wicket-keeper to take off her clip-on pads so they could slip in to them. Once at the nets, when Silloo went down on one knee to hit a drive, she heard the familiar moan: “Uppish.” “Tell her that’s not the way to play,” Bamjee instructed legendary batsman Farukh Engineer. “I don't know what to say to you,” Engineer told Silloo. “I’d love to play this shot.”  Until 1972, the only rivals that the 60-member Albees had were its own. Forty girls, former Albee-ites chiefly, practised at Indian Gymkhana in Matunga. Their answer to Albees’ talented Edulji sisters were the Pandit siblings, Shobha and Jyoti. On seeing that Albees players “had better discipline”, Shobha had joined Bamjee’s club in 1974, long after its girls appeared at their first match at Brabourne sporting canvas--not spike--shoes and a prowess that Bamjee had likened to that of “an average set of junior boys.” News about Indi’'s first national women’s cricket tournament to be held in Pune in 1973, would baffle Bamjee, who had been trying to find fitting rivals for the Albees. In the inter-state contest, UP had to borrow four cricketers from the Bombay team made up largely of Albeeites. “In the land of the blind, we were the kings,” recalls Silloo, a banker who would shell out for the girls’ train tickets as pleas for funds went unheeded. “People took us with a huge pinch of salt,” says Silloo, who tasted barely any salt in the dinner she had at Bamjee’s house when the latter was unwell. As Bamjee’s health deteriorated in the ‘80s, the Albees too began to fade. “Politics crept in. She was sidelined,” says Albeeite Sanober Malhotra about Bamjee who died at age 85 on Parsi New Year in 2007, having willed Rs 30 lakh to her househelps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/beyond-boundaries-remembering-the-mother-hen-of-womens-cricket/articleshow/88365000.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||Nagpur||Sena, NCP & Cong must clarify stand on Vidarbha statehood: Mungantiwar||Nagpur: Former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar called on the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituents to explain their stand on granting statehood to Vidarbha. During his visit to the TOI office, the Ballarpur MLA said Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress had never come clear on the issue, even though the BJP time and again reiterated its full support for making the region a separate state. While listing out injustices meted out to the backward region by three-party coalition, the senior BJP leader pointed out that they failed to reconstitute the statutory development boards of Vidarbha and Marathwada. “In absence of these boards, the development amount received by Vidarbha from the government has been reduced drastically and thus progress is hampered. In distribution of agriculture pumps, western Maharashtra farmers were given more preference. The government goes out of the way to help the sugarcane farmers of the western region but provides nothing for the paddy farmers of Vidarbha. “We tried our best to implement recommendations by Vijay Kelkar committee constituted for studying the region’s backlog,” he said, adding that even the recruitment in government jobs were stopped without an explanation. Mungantiwar, also the head of Public Accounts Committee, hoped the BJP would emerge winner in Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections slated next year. The party will battle it out with its former saffron alliance partner. In 2017 polls, both friends-turned-foes fought a close battle where BJP won 82 and Sena 97 seats. “We will not differentiate between Marathi, Hindi and Gujarati citizens, but fight with full might in the BMC. There is a likelihood of seats getting increased to 236 from 227. The issue of having a pact with Raj Thackeray led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) is not on the agenda. The Sena has nothing to do with the Mumbai citizens, it only wants power. They focus only on politics and neglect development,” he said. Slamming the MVA partners for not making sincere efforts to continue the OBC reservation, he said had the government taken all parties into the confidence to find a solution, the issue would have been resolved. “During peak of the Covid-19 pandemic Prime Minister Narendra Modi had conducted 21 meetings with all chief ministers. MVA leaders should have taken a clue out of it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sena-ncp-cong-must-clarify-stand-on-vidarbha-statehood-mungantiwar/articleshow/88363689.cms||---

According to a senior forest department official, elephant herds used to raid ration shops in the villages on the forest fringes for rice. “A herd damaged a ration shop at High Forest Area last month. When rice bags were shifted to a temple, the herd broke open the main door of the temple and ate the rice,” deputy field director of Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) M G Ganesan said. This prompted the officials to install two predator-deterrent Foxlights in Monombolly. “We installed the lights 30 feet away from ration shops a week ago. They emit red, blue and white light, giving the impression of someone patrolling. Elephants have now stopped visiting the villages. Encouraged by the result, we installed the lights at Thaimudi estate and Thonimudi estate," said Ganesan. "Based on the trial results, we will implement the method to check man-animal conflict in Monombolly and Valparai forest ranges.” But the lights are not enough to scare away leopards, the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/automated-flashlights-keep-wild-elephants-away-from-villages/articleshow/88365009.cms||A Subburaj

As part of their treatment, they have been put on Zincovit and multivitamins. Since none of these patients have shown major symptoms, and there is no known treatment for Omicron, this is the basic protocol being followed. Officials are treading carefully with the current batch of patients as there is no known treatment so far for the new variant. “They are just being monitored and kept on basic multivitamins. If at all anyone has any issue, symptomatic treatment is being given. They are all healthy and just two to three of them had mild cough and body aches,” said a source, speaking about the condition of Omicron positive patients. The standard treatment protocol for treatment of mild cases of Covid-19 includes paracetamol, steam, warm liquids and multivitamins only. “Although there is very little requirement to treat them, they are being constantly monitored because there is no clarity on how the virus might react.

He said that the campaign ‘Sthreepaksha Navakeralam’ fulfills a major responsibility in the government’s endeavour to reduce atrocities against women. “Each woman should muster the courage and strength to raise the voice against wrongdoings. There should be a public consciousness which would facilitate such reactions. Kudumbasree can ensure the most effective intervention in this regard. This campaign shall be carried on in future also,” said the chief minister. He said that today’s Kerala was built on people’s receptivity towards change irrespective of caste and religion. ``We progressed through great strides in education. It was made available to all members cutting across gender. Voices were raised against practices that oppressed women. Daughters had no right to father’s assets. Education was denied. At every stage revolutions emerged against such practices. The change was a result of constant uprisings against the regressive system,” he said. The first phase of the campaign will continue till the International Women’s Day on March 8. As part of this, the follow-up events will also be organized. The campaigns are organized in such a way that it will be utilized both online and offline.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Proper medical treatment a distant dream in Mankulam||IDUKKI: Mankulam is a village in the high range of Idukki near Munnar. It has a population of 9,300 and 40% of them are tribals. As Attapady gains headlines in the media for malnutrition of tribal kids, Mankulam is no different when healthcare is considered. The single medical officer-Primary Health Centre (PHC) is the only treatment facility in the area. The nearest towns are Adimali and Munnar that are 34km and 32km away from Mankulam. People have to travel to Adimali for further health services and deliveries of pregnant women. Because of the difficult terrain and scarcity of public transport, people residing in the interiors of Mankulam, including Tribal communities, have to walk a lot to get access to the PHC. Dr Tijo P Jose, former medical officer Mankulam PHC, said the geography and terrain of Mankulam is a major challenge for getting proper treatment facilities. “Tribespeople and children are facing malnutrition. We often visited the tribal settlements and provided emergency treatment to the people. Without a proper road and travel facility, we walked five to six hours to reach the settlements,” said Dr Jose. “The PHC has to be upgraded. I was the only doctor in that village for the last two years when I served the PHC. I had to treat people while taking rest for an injury on the hand. Most tribespeople did not get proper treatment for their illness,” said the doctor. “Wild animal attacks is also a major challenge. Proper attention and treatment must be given to the tribespeople of the 13 settlements in the panchayat,” said Jose. According to natives, after the doctor quit, a lady doctor is now in charge of the PHC. “The doctor has a five-month-old baby, and she is struggling to provide treatment to the people due to the difficult terrain without proper facilities,” said Joseph, a native. “If the PHC is upgraded, the government can appoint four doctors and other paramedical staff,” said Jose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/proper-medical-treatment-a-distant-dream-in-mankulam/articleshow/88364455.cms||Sandeep Thomas

As per highly-placed sources, around 100 samples have been sent for genome sequencing by the state government to the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), Uppal. “Majority of these samples are of international passengers who were in home quarantine and had tested Covid positive in the RT-PCR test after eight days of return and monitoring. Of these, only 37 were samples of passengers who tested positive at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA), Shamshabad. Health authorities have been closely monitoring those in home quarantine, checking on them each day,” said a source. It is learnt that less than half of the Omicron suspects have returned from high-risk nations. “Some have taken connecting flights from Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi, while others have come from high-risk nations. A chunk of the passengers had tested negative at the airport, but tested positive on the repeat test after eight days. There are also some who have tested positive at the airport from among the ones who had landed from non risk countries,” added the source. Samples of passengers returning from high-risk nations, if tested positive in the RT-PCR test at the airport, are immediately sent for genome sequencing. For those testing negative, home quarantine and a repeat test is done. Meanwhile, suspected cases have spread across five districts, confirmed sources. As per the latest details from the state health department (as on Friday), a total of nine Omicron cases have been detected in the state, of which five are foreign nationals and three are Indian residents. So far 17 samples of the 100 have tested negative. The confirmed cases are spread across Hyderabad and Warangal districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/100-omicron-suspect-samples-sent-for-testing/articleshow/88364450.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man at centre of matrimonial con booked for rape||Mumbai: The probe into the matrimonial cheating and blackmailing case involving Yuvraj Bhosale (41), who was nabbed in Pune recently, has taken a sinister turn with Kalwa police booking him for rape. Also, while till just a week ago, the number of his victims were 15, now it has grown to 30, as registered by Mumbai police alone. Also, the amount defrauded from his victims has grown from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore. Since Bhosale is believed to have victimised many more women across the state, the police have urged those who could possibly have been his victims to overcome stigma and come forward to register complaints. The Kalwa police’s rape case against Bhosale is on a 35-year-old divorcee’s complaint. “He asked the victim for money telling her there was an IT raid at his place. The woman took a loan of Rs 20 lakh from a private bank and gave it to him. He also took her jewellery. He had introduced himself to her saying he owned a steel company and had a textiles business too,” said a police source. At present, Bhosale, who went by several aliases, including Rajevir, Satish Borud, and Virendra, is in the custody of Virar police for cheating another woman. Senior inspector Manohar Awhad of the Kalwa police station confirmed the rape and cheating case registered with them against Bhosale. “Bhosale is a resident of Talegaon near Pune. He cheated several women on the pretext of marrying them, or helping them get jobs, or giving them roles as models in his company, YB Motion Pictures for saree shoots. These were false pretences. He did not have any company. He would just go to Goa’s casinos and splurge money there or in matka. This money came from his victims,” said an officer. With Mumbai’s central region cyber police station investigating into an FIR registered with them, fresh information against Bhosale is coming to light. “We have found information about 30 women who were cheated by him on various pretext. Mostly, he befriended divorcees and promised to marry them. There are also instances when he offered to help with jobs; in one such case, he took Rs 4 lakh from a woman to help her get a job in a Worli hospital,” said a police source. He was first arrested for promising marriage to a 35-year-old woman, and extorting from her Rs 30 lakh and a car. It was this woman’s FIR that resulted in his arrest. “Bhosale used to mentally torture women he befriended and would ask for numbers of other women. He would then contact them and befriend them,” said a police source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-at-centre-of-matrimonial-con-booked-for-rape/articleshow/88365045.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Jagtap, also a criminal on police records, died under medical attention at a hospital in Pimpri. After opening fire from a close range at Jagtap, the two assailants then snatched the motorcycle of a passerby and fled from the scene. They went towards Bhosari, the Pimpri Chinchwad police said. The entire firing incident has been captured on a CCTV camera. Deputy commissioner of police (Zone II) Anand Bhoite told TOI, “We have established identities of the two assailants after recording the statements of the eye-witnesses. We also have the CCTV footage of the spot, which shows the two men giving chase to Jagtap. There were seven body offences registered against Jagtap. He was also working as a real-estate agent in Pimpri Chinchwad.” A case of murder, robbery and cases under Indian Firearms Act was registered against the two with the Sangvi police station later in the day. Bhoite said, “The two assailants have over nine body offences and robberies registered against their names. The two had even assaulted Jagtap about a year ago.” A team comprising senior inspector Sunil Tonpe and sub-inspector Mininath Warude rushed to the spot after receiving an emergency call. According to the police, the local residents had organised a small ceremony on the occasion of Datta Jayanti on Saturday morning. The local group put up a small pandal in front of the Lord Datta temple. Jagtap was looking after the ceremony and was busy with prasad and prayers. At this moment, the two men reached the pandal and charged at Jagtap. Warude told TOI, “Jagtap realised that the two men were after him and he started running. The two chased him down and opened fire. They fired four rounds and two bullets hit Jagtap. One bullet hit his chest and the other his stomach”. “As the two men were armed, the local residents did not chase them fearing they would fire back. The two men then went to the main road and saw a motorcyclist passing by. The duo forced the motorcyclist to stop. The two then fled with the two-wheeler. They rode towards Bhosari,” Warude said. “We are conducting a search for the two,” Bhoite said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/assailants-fire-4-bullets-kill-rival-at-busy-katepuram-chowk/articleshow/88365043.cms||---
---||Agra||At 4.2 degrees, Meerut coldest city in UP||AGRA/MEERUT: Meerut was the coldest city in Uttar Pradesh on Saturday, registering a minimum temperature of 4.2 degrees, 4 degrees below normal. In Agra, the minimum temperature was a notch higher at 6.5 degree Celsius. According to the meteorological department, following the western disturbance in Himalayan along with its induced circulation over north Rajasthan and adjoining Haryana, the western parts of Uttar Pradesh will witness cold winds with shallow fog in the morning. However, there is no indication of rainfall, especially in the Agra region. Principal scientist N Subhash at Meerut-based Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Agriculture University said, "Saturday's maximum temperature was 15.6 degrees Celsius, which is 7 degrees lower than the normal, while minimum was 4.2 degrees. On Sunday, the intense cold will persist as minimum temperature is expected to fall to 2-3 degrees Celsius accompanied by cold winds while maximum will hover around 15-16 degrees." Chilly winds blowing at the speed of 12 km per hour made people shiver on Saturday in the Agra region. While the minimum temperature was 6.5 degree Celsius, the maximum temperature was 19.6 degree Celsius, four notches less than the normal. People lit bonfires to get some relief from the extreme weather. Neighboring districts of Firozabad, Mathura, Etah, Aligarh and Mainpuri were also cooled by chilly winds. At many places, people lit bonfires to get some relief from the extreme weather. The change in weather has resulted in an increase in the number of patients suffering from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases visiting hospitals. Firozabad medical college principal Dr Sangeeta Aneja said, “Following extreme weather conditions, the number of patients having cardiovascular and respiratory issues has increased. However, our major concern is the increase in the cases of children suffering from pneumonia and hypothermia. At present, 20 infants are under treatment at the newborn care unit. In case of rapid breathing or fever, parents should immediately take the child to the doctor.” Additional director of the health department, Agra, Dr AK Singh, said, “People need to follow some basic precautions in the current weather conditions. Direct exposure to cold winds should be avoided. All body parts, especially feet and head, should be properly covered.” He advised that people should consume a calorie-rich diet, but oily and spicy food should be avoided. Lukewarm water should be taken at frequent intervals. Early morning walks and exercise in open spaces should be avoided for a few days. Wearing a face mask when going out is recommended. Children, senior citizens need special care, and patients of diabetes, blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases are advised to see a doctor immediately in case of health issues,” Singh added. Meanwhile, cold winds helped in lowering air pollution levels in Agra. As compared to 208 or “poor” category on Friday, the air quality index (AQI) in Agra on Saturday was recorded at 117 or "moderate" category by the Central Pollution Control Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/at-4-2-degrees-meerut-coldest-city-in-up/articleshow/88363701.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Hyderabad||Failing is not the end of the world; you’ll get another chance||With 51% of students failing in the Intermediate first-year exams, the vice-chancellor of Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences (KNRUHS) B Karunakar Reddy shared his story and asked students and parents not to get dejected It is disheartening to see students ending their lives over marks. Failing in an exam is not the end of the world; an individual can succeed in any field at any point in their lives. When I was a teenager, I wanted to do medicine. I prepared and appeared for my Engineering Agricultural and Medical Common Entrance Test (EAMCET), but I could not make the cut. I was very sad. But I eventually made peace with the fact that wasn’t meant to get a medical seat, and joined a normal degree college. But my parents never discouraged me, they never criticised me for my failure. They encouraged me to work harder. My father put me in a tutorial to prepare for the EAMCET exam again. Along with my degree, I attended coaching class and eventually cracked the test in my second attempt. Of course, even then I secured only a few marks above the cut-off (while the cut-off was 148, I got 152). But I managed to get a medical seat and never looked back. Like me, you too will get a second chance. You might have failed in your intermediate today or secured fewer marks, but it doesn’t make you a failure. The exams are only testing your memory, not your knowledge. As for parents, it is your responsibility to extend moral and psychological support to your children. Because when one is a teenager, one isn’t mature enough to make his/her own decisions. Parents easily tend to forget what they were like when they were teenagers. It is also wrong to put the burden of your (parent’s) ambitions on the children or compare them to others. It doesn’t matter if their friend or cousin secured 90 marks or 9 marks. Even if they failed an exam or scored fewer marks, support them and encourage them to study and clear the paper. Society needs hard-working people in all fields. People shine at different stages. With your support and their hard work, these children will certainly succeed in life.

---||Pune||Plea against ‘poor’ civic services finds support||PUNE: After a group of residents from Vimannagar decided to take the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to consumer court for alleged deficiency in services, citizens from nearby areas have decided to follow suit, too. “We are planning to support the residents of Vimannagar in this legal battle and will file supplementary petition. The issues raised by them are serious,” said Ashish Mane, an activist from Vadgaon Sheri. According to Vimannagar residents, who filed the petition in the consumer court in November, the PMC had been collecting property tax from them but not been providing the requisite services. They said their intention was to “make the administration aware that civic officials and staff were not shouldering their responsibility.” Mane said that many residents in Vadgaon Sheri had faced similar issues and experienced lack of positive response from the civic staff. Purnima Gadiya, a resident of Nagar road, also echoed a similar view. “The PMC is spending funds on civic projects. But they seem to lack long-term planning. Civic work is repeated unnecessarily in many places. This is nothing but wastage of public money,” she said. The petitioners from Vimannagar (PMC ward number 3) said that officials and staff members were not following the duties given to them under the Maharashtra Municipal Act section 203 (1) 14, 130, 131 and other sections. “The PMC collects the property tax from citizens but does not provide the facilities purposely. It is against the law and principle of natural justice,” Qaneez Sukhrani, a citizen activist and one of the three petitioners said. “The roads are potholed, dug up and in poor condition. Some patches, where footpaths have been constructed, are occupied by hawkers,” said Umesh Magar, another petitioner said. “The debris, garbage, broken tiles and other waste material are dumped on public places. The PMC does not lift this trash. The lifting and disposal of garbage is not done in a scientific manner,” said Ashutosh Mashruwala, one of the petitioners. According to their complaint, service cables, electricity supply cables and garden waste were kept unattended after road repair and maintenance. The elected members from the areas claimed that many big-ticket projects were going on in the areas, which were causing some temporary inconvenience to citizens. “The PMC is carrying out major projects like 24X7 water supply. Once the project is completed, dependence on tankers will reduce drastically. Even the work to lay gas pipelines is underway. Problems pertaining to roads and repairs will reduce once these works are completed,” said Rahul Bhandare, a corporator from the area. According to Bhandare, the civic body has identified sites in Viman Nagar where relocation of roadsid vendors has been planned. He said the process of increasing the number of garbage carrying vans was also underway. Suhas Jagtap, ward officer, Nagar road-Vadgaon Sheri areas, said that the civic administration was making efforts to keep the civic facilities in order. “The garbage collection and disposal are taking place as per the scheduled timetable. The civic body has the photographic database of these works,” he said. Jagtap said that actions were being carried out against illegal hawkers at regular intervals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/plea-against-poor-civic-services-finds-support/articleshow/88365052.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh listed the application, seeking direction to the Centre and Reserve Bank of India (RBI), for a hearing on February 25, 2022. The application said that while the currency notes of the denomination of Rs 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 100, 200, 500 and 2,000 are visually impaired friendly, it is not applicable for the Rs 50 note, which is indistinguishable from the Rs 100 and 500 notes and there is no coin available for the same. It further stated that the petitioners undertook a study on the distress and inequalities faced by the visually impaired citizens due to the design of the currency notes. The application was filed in a pending petition seeking directions to the authorities to withdraw the new Rs 50 notes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-in-hc-for-rs-50-coins-for-disabled/articleshow/88365685.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||All-India medical admissions now in 4 rounds for transparency||MUMBAI: Admissions to all-India quota seats in undergraduate and postgraduate medical courses will now be done by the centre in four rounds instead of two. The move will bring in more transparency in the counselling process and ensure there is no violation of merit. However, students from Maharashtra will be left with 200-225 fewer MBBS seats during the state round of admissions. For UG admissions, around 1,700 of the total 7,000 seats in the country were returned to states at the end of the second rounds previously. Based on an affidavit filed by the ministry of health and family welfare, the Supreme Court directed the medical counselling committee (MCC) of the directorate general of health services to conduct admissions to 15% undergraduate and 50% postgraduate seats under the all-India quota in four rounds. This will mean that in addition to the first two all-India rounds, mop-up and stray vacancy rounds will also be conducted for 2021-22 admissions. Earlier only the all-India rounds were conducted by MCC and the vacant seats were returned to the state. An official from the ministry said that this was an anomaly in the admission process, which has now been corrected. “Every year several merit rank-holders from states blocked seats in the all-India quota till the end of the second round and eventually took the state quota seats. While some genuinely waited for the second round to secure seats, some were running a syndicate in connivance with other stakeholders to ensure more seats are returned to the states. Around 1,700 seats were going back to the states (UG) and many higher merit rank-holders were left without seats in the all-India quota, even as students with lower ranks secured seats,” said the official. The ministry wanted to put an end to this and, in a case filed by students, an affidavit was filed to modify the process. No all-India seats will be reverted to the states in the new scheme of things, he added. Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, said that the move will definitely bring in more transparency. However, around 220-225 seats usually come back to Maharashtra after the second round, which will not be the case any more, and genuine students will be at loss.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-all-india-med-admissions-now-in-4-rounds-for-transparency/articleshow/88365059.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Agra||Death sentence to man who raped, murdered 10-year-old||AGRA: A special Pocso court in Hathras on Saturday awarded death sentence in 18 working days to a 48-year-old man who had raped a 10-year-old girl and smothered her to death four months ago. The judge also slapped a fine of Rs 1.20 lakh on the convict. Additional district and sessions judge (Pocso), Pratibha Saxena, found the accused, Chandrapal, guilty and pronounced him to be hanged till death. The judge stated in the order that the minor girl "could not even start her life" when she had to face mental and physical trauma because of the rape and murder. She added that the situation the victim had gone through "could not be imagined" and that it “shakes a person’s soul”. Additional district government counsel (ADGC) Rajpal Singh Diswar said the post-mortem report of the victim had confirmed rape and the cause of her death was “asphyxia due to smothering." The convict was known to the girl as he had been visiting his two sisters who are married in the locality where the victim resided. He had also lived as a tenant for six months in the same locality. The crime took place when the man visited his sisters for Raksha Bandhan. According to the victim’s father, his daughter and son were sleeping with him in a vacant plot on August 22 night and when he got up in the morning to relieve himself, he found his daughter missing. He searched for her but could not find her. Later, some local residents informed him that a body was found near a canal in Behdoi village and the victim was identified as his daughter. The FIR was registered under sections 302, 201, 376 and 363 of IPC. During investigation, it was found that Chandrapal had kidnapped the girl and later killed her after sexually assaulting her. Chandrapal was reported to have a criminal history with at least 11 FIRs lodged against him in Hathras and other parts of western UP for dacoity, theft and liquor and drug peddling, the ADGC said. On February 6, the same court had sentenced a 36-year-old man, who had raped his one-and-a-half-year-old niece and left her seriously injured, to life term within 23 days of filing the chargesheet. In 2019, a Pocso court in Baghpat had sentenced a 25-year-old, who had raped a three-year-old, to life imprisonment, five days after charges were framed. The same year, a court in Raebareli had concluded trial in 10 days and sentenced a 30-year-old man to life for raping a six-year-old.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh lines up 707 hospitals in anticipation of third wave||VISAKHAPATNAM: Amid Omicron fears and reports that the Covid-19 infections may increase in the coming months, the state health department has focused on hospital preparedness for the anticipated third wave. As many as 707 hospitals have been lined up for the possible third wave. At the peak of the second wave in May-June, about 650 hospitals served the patients. These 707 hospitals have a combined capacity of 50,400 beds for adults, including about 28,200 oxygen beds and 6,970 ICU beds. Considering the reports that children may be more vulnerable to the pandemic in the third wave, partly due to their unvaccinated status, about 4,500 ICU/oxygen beds would be earmarked for paediatric services apart from the 3,000 general beds. Hypoxia-related complaints had surfaced in the Covid-19 patients during the first wave last year, forcing the health department to immediately create oxygen lines for about 19,000 beds. But the patient management during the second wave completely revolved around oxygen supply, movement and management. The number of oxygen beds were increased to about 25,000 in the second wave. The daily oxygen consumption peaked to 640 metric tonnes in the second wave from the first wave’s peak of 260 tonnes. Logistics proved to be a major challenge in the movement and supply as all this oxygen is received from external sources like industries in various states. Considering all these factors, the state government is now setting up about 144 PSA (pressure swing adsorption) oxygen plants. Meanwhile, the state has also set up liquid medical oxygen tanks at the hospitals for storage. It purchased additional cryogenic tankers. The state also procured 23,000 oxygen cylinders and 20,000 oxygen concentrators on its own, apart from the prerequisite capacity of the cylinders and concentrators at the private hospitals. According to the officials, about 15,000 passengers arrived in the state from various foreign countries in the last few weeks. The state has so far detected one Omicron case among the foreign returnees. Director, Andhra Pradesh public health and family welfare department, Dr G Hymavathi, said the state is prepared to face any eventuality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-lines-up-707-hospitals-in-anticipation-of-third-wave/articleshow/88363744.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Delhi||Cheating case: ‘Sorry state of affairs’ annoys Delhi court||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has pulled up the police for not invoking graver penal sections in a cheating case, saying the manner in which the investigation is being conducted reflected a very sorry state of affairs. Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana said it was really unfortunate that eight people have been bailed out on the basis of half-baked facts and shoddy investigation in the case. As per the prosecution, the accused and their associates were involved allegedly in cheating the complainant on the pretext of providing him assistance regarding cheque-related query. The accused allegedly shared a fake website with the complainant having the logo of a bank resembling the official website and after the complainant downloaded the application, a sum of Rs 27 lakh was fraudulently transferred from his bank account to eight different bank accounts. They also allegedly used to run online advertisements for “customer care services”. During the hearing, Additional Public Prosecutor Irfan Ahmed, appearing for the police, informed the court that there are specific allegations that the accused created fake and forged website and hence, besides offence under Section 420 (cheating) IPC, sections 467, 468, 471 IPC along with relevant section of the IT Act were also attracted in the case. He further submitted that Section 467 was punishable with life imprisonment and the alleged offences were non-compoundable in nature. He also claimed that not only the accused were avoiding joining the investigation but also tampering with the evidence by influencing the victim. The public prosecutor further submitted that the victim was compelled to accept a paltry sum of Rs 15 lakh, and not only the settlement was unconscionable but even the alleged offence was non-compoundable in nature. “The submissions of Addl PP seem to bear weight… The court is at a loss to understand as to why the investigating agency is shying away in invoking the appropriate provisions of law in the instant matter. It is really unfortunate that eight people have been bailed out on the basis of half- baked facts and shoddy investigation,” the court said in an order on December 17. It directed the DCP concerned to look into the matter personally and ensure a fair and impartial investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cheating-case-sorry-state-of-affairs-annoys-city-court/articleshow/88365689.cms||Usha Das

The event is scheduled to commence at 2.30pm, secretary for information and publicity Ravi Dhawan said. A rehearsal for the flypast conducted on Saturday exposed the lack of communication between the state government and the security personnel who rudely turned away local spectators from the event. “Those who wish to attend need to be at the venue latest by 12.45pm. After that, the routes will be closed. It seems like there was some miscommunication and we will give appropriate directions to the police. We will ensure that there is unhindered movement before 12.45pm,” Dhawan said.

Senior party leaders will also flag off similar yatras from five other regions in the state. This will be the CM’s sixth visit to Mathura this year. After beginning the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, BJP has been trying to raise the pitch for the construction of a similar temple in Mathura. Several leaders of the party have given statements indicating this in the recent past. On his last visit to Mathura on December 8, while addressing a public rally, the CM had said, "Before deciding about your present and future, think of who constructed the temple for Lord Ram in Ayodhya. You all should keep in mind that no other political outfit, except the BJP, could have done this." Earlier, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had stirred up controversy by tweeting that "construction of grand temples in Ayodhya and Kashi is underway and preparations are on for Mathura”. Mathura has also become a hot spot for political movements ahead of assembly elections. Last month, Congress’s 'Pratigya Yatra' came to an end in the town, after covering Muzaffarnagar, Bijnor, Moradabad, Rampur, Bareilly, Budaun, Aligarh, Hathras and Agra. In October, Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party Lohia (PSPL) president Shivpal Singh Yadav embarked on his ‘Samajik Parivartan Yatra’ from Mathura, after offering prayers at Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan. Meanwhile, state general secretary and campaign incharge for BJP, Govind Narayan Shukla, said the party’s national president JP Nadda will start the Jan Vishwas Yatra from Ambedkar Nagar, union minister Rajnath Singh from Jhansi,Nitin Gadkari from Bijnor, Smriti Irani from Gajipur and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will lead it from Balia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/yogi-to-flag-off-jan-vishwas-yatra-from-mathura-today/articleshow/88363765.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The lawyers staged a protest on the court premises on Saturday and abstained from work in the civil courts. Meanwhile, a decision to go on strike every Saturday was taken at the meeting of an action committee for the establishment of the high court bench in Agra (a group that is spearheading the movement). They sought the implementation of the Jaswant Singh Commission Report of the 1980s, which identified Agra as a suitable location for an HC bench in western Uttar Pradesh. Talking to the media, lawyer Yogesh Lavania said, “This is our right, and we will continue our protest till we get a high court bench here.” Another lawyer said they would form a human chain and stop traffic and rail movement for a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/no-vote-if-no-hc-bench-constituted-in-agra-say-protesting-lawyers/articleshow/88363757.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC to decide fate of two sisters on death row for kids’ kidnap-murder||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Saturday concluded the hearing and will soon decide the fate of two death row convicts, both women, who in 2014 had filed a petition to commute their capital punishment to life imprisonment. They cited “unjustified delay” by authorities in dealing with their mercy petition, causing them much agony and violation of their fundamental right to life.  The women, sisters Renuka Shinde and Seema Gavit, were tried for the 1996 case of kidnapping 14 children and murdering five of them in Kolhapur and convicted in 2001. In 2004, the high court had confirmed their death sentence and in 2006 the Supreme Court too had upheld the noose for them. They have been in custody since October 22, 1996. The sisters had in 2014 petitioned the high court to commute the death sentence to life term citing unreasonable delay by the state in dealing with their mercy petitions, which thus violated their right to life. The counsel for the sisters, Aniket Vagal, on Saturday at the final hearing before a bench of Justice Nitin Jamdar and Justice Sarang Kotwal said the sisters had in September 2006 submitted their mercy petition to the President but it was sent to the state since procedure prescribed it be first considered by the governor. Public prosecutor Aruna Pai, opposing the petition, said death cannot be set aside looking at the gravity and heinousness of the offence. She said if the court is inclined to commute the sentence, it should be life imprisonment till remainder of their natural life. The high court bench asked the public prosecutor to take instructions from the state government and clarify on Wednesday whether the government has powers to not commute the life imprisonment, which as per Supreme Court rulings means till the end of convict’s life. In January 2008, Shinde said she filed another mercy petition before the President while her petition was pending before the governor and it was sent back to be placed before the governor. Gavit also sent a mercy plea in September 2008 and a follow-up request that October to the governor. Vagal said that in August 2012 the governor rejected Shinde’s plea for mercy to commute death sentence to life imprisonment and a year later rejected Gavit’s plea. On July 7, 2014, the President rejected their mercy petition and nine days later the Centre communicated it to the state, said their lawyer. They were informed of the rejection on August 4, 2014, and they filed the petition before the high court saying they were “constantly living under fear of death for over 13 years”. Centre’s counsel Sandesh Patil said there was no delay on part of the Centre. He said the 11-month gap from 2012 to 2013 was since the policy is to avoid conflicts and to send mercy petition of both the accused in same case together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-to-decide-fate-of-two-sisters-on-death-row-for-kids-kidnap-murder/articleshow/88365081.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Road closure by SCR angers Vijayapuri colony residents||SECUNDERABAD: A right of way, which has been used by Vijayapuri Colony (South Lalaguda) in Secunderabad for more than four decades, has now been restricted for traffic movement by the railway authorities. The local military authority (LMA) has already shut 21 civilian roads in Secunderabad Cantonment and now the South Central Railway (SCR) too seems to be following in the footsteps of LMA. The entry into the right of way has been shut and locked by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) cops between 10.30 pm and 5.30 am, which has already been done by LMA, in Secunderabad Cantonment. The right of way is one of the three key routes of Vijayapuri Colony to go to the railway hospital, Mettuguda X Roads, Secunderabad railway station and Rail Nilayam, and other parts of Secunderabad and Hyderabad. Over 6,000 people of the residential colony and abutting areas use the right of way on a daily basis. The road closure issue came to light after angered residents approached the Telangana assembly deputy speaker T Padma Rao and made a plea to resolve it. South Lalaguda comes under Secunderabad assembly constituency. “Through this 1.9 km length of right of way, we used to reach Mettuguda X Roads and railway hospital and other areas within five minutes. But now, we have to take 15 to 20 minutes detour. There are 112 residential apartments in this colony and majority of the residents are retired railway employees,” president, Vijayapuri Colony RWA, Nagaraja Rao told TOI. Another resident of the same locality, Suresh Anand said, “Due to restricted traffic through this passage, it has become difficult for ambulances during emergency situations to reach either railway hospital or any other corporate hospitals. Residents of this colony are strongly appealing to lift the ban on traffic restriction and keep the entry open as earlier.” SCR authorities, however, responded to the Deputy Speaker’s plea, and allowed two-wheelers by installing traffic bollards and CCTVs at the entry point. When TOI contact Chief PRO, SCR, Ch Rakesh, he said: “We have railway assets like open lands, buildings and workshops in South Lalaguda. Nearby households of the Vijayapuri Colony are dumping garbage on our open land . To restrict garbage dumping and to avoid disturbance to our new buildings construction activity due to heavy traffic movement, we have closed this road, only allowing two-wheelers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/road-closure-by-scr-angers-vijayapuri-colony-residents/articleshow/88364512.cms||Sunil Mungara

One of his accomplices was also nabbed. The accused were identified as Ishtiyaq, a resident of Meerut, and his associate Akil (35), a resident of Muzaffarnagar. Earlier, police got an input that Ishtiyaq, along with his associates, was committing car thefts in Delhi. On October 19, the gang members were chased by police in which one Sazid was arrested but Ishtiyaq and Akil managed to flee, a senior police officer said. On Saturday, police received information regarding Ishtiyaq’s movement in the central district. The car which he was driving was later located at Rani Jhansi Road. On seeing the cops, the accused tried to flee but the vehicle crashed into the divider. “They then tried to flee by opening fire and Ishtiyaq sustained bullet injury in his leg in retaliatory fire,” deputy commissioner of police (central) Shweta Chauhan said, adding that later, both the accused were overpowered. One car, two pistols, two key coding tabs, tools used in car theft and three live cartridges were recovered, police said. The recovered car was found to be stolen from Maurya Enclave area Akil was previously involved in three cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-wanted-for-32-car-thefts-held/articleshow/88365706.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Convict & witness faiths no reason to deny furlough, says Bombay high court||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has held that refusing to grant furlough to a convict only on the grounds that the witnesses and he belonged to different religions, without any material to back up the claims of a possible law and order situation, needs to be deprecated. The high court has set aside a 2020 order rejecting furlough to a convict, Salman Bagwan (24), and said that he is entitled to be released on the leave for the maximum period as provided under the rules. “Mere fact that the petitioner (Bagwan) and the witnesses belong to different religions cannot be a ground to presume that this will lead to law and order situation. Such a stand unless backed by some material, needs to be deprecated. Therefore this reason being only foundation of the impugned order and it being arrived at without basis whatsoever, the impugned order will have to be set aside,” the high court said. Bagwan was convicted and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment by a sessions court in Shrirampur, Ahmednagar, in April 2018. Along with several others, he was found guilty of grievously injuring a man from a rival group in 2016. Bagwan is lodged in Yerwada Central prison, Pune. Bagwan’s lawyer Tanveer Khan submitted the petition challenging the March 17 order of the Deputy Inspector General of Prisons rejecting his application for release on furlough leave. “The objective of furlough is to enable a convict to maintain ties with society and give him a chance to reform himself. If furlough is denied mechanically to a convict who is eligible for it, the purpose of furlough and reforming criminals would become otiose,” Khan said. When Bagwan became eligible for furlough, he made the application to the Deputy Inspector General of Prisons for furlough as per the Maharashtra Prisons (Bombay Furlough and Parole) Rules. A report was filed by the Divisional Police Officer, Shrirampur, and his plea was subsequently rejected. In August 2020, the Additional Director General of Police and Inspector General, Prisons, too denied his plea. The HC noted the only reason given in the order for rejection is that the witness is of a particular religion and Bagwan belongs to the other religion, therefore, there is likelihood of a law and order situation as per the police report. The police report submitted by the head constable, Shrirampur, to the sub-divisional police officer, reiterated the statement. HC said, “Apart from this statement alone there is nothing either on record or in the file shown to us.” It directed the relevant authority to issue a formal order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/convict-witness-faiths-no-reason-to-deny-furlough-bombay-hc/articleshow/88365089.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Kochi||Kerala: Need answers or SilverLine project won’t take off, says opposition||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The UDF on Saturday held statewide protests against the LDF government’s flagship SilverLine rail corridor project alleging it was unscientific and impractical. Opposition leader V D Satheesan launched the state-level protest at Ernakulam while KPCC chief K Sudhakaran inaugurated the protest in front of the Secretariat. Various UDF leaders led protests in the headquarters of 10 districts through which the project would pass. Inaugurating the UDF march to Ernakulam collectorate, Satheesan said that the state government was planning to spend Rs 2 lakh crore for the SilverLine project even without a detailed project report (DPR). He said that the government would not be allowed to go ahead with the K-Rail project without giving answers to the queries raised by the opposition. “If the opposition also supports these absurdities, we will have to face the trial by the masses in the future. The government is not giving answers to any of the questions raised by us. They want to acquire land, appoint consultants and take loans. Many power brokers are roaming around in the state secretariat,” Satheesan said. “The government has already fixed the deal. But it won’t work out in Kerala,” he said. He also asked who had decided to take a loan from Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica). He said the UDF was united in the agitation against SilverLine. The Congress party will examine why MP Shashi Tharoor didn’t put his signature on the letter sent by the UDF MPs to the Union government against the project. “Tharoor can take time for studying the matter. But it can’t be termed as division in the UDF. What he said was that there is the need for a development culture for Kerala and he would support if the chief minister tries to remove the hurdles in the way of creating such a culture. The opposition will play a creative role,” Satheesan added. The opposition will support the government if it decides to make Kerala an investor-friendly state and also to implement projects in a transparent manner, he said. Inaugurating the UDF agitation before the Secretariat, KPCC president K Sudhakaran said the project was purely unscientific and the government has the moral responsibility of convincing the people about the need for this project. “The government should not be adamant in the name of development. The development promised by the chief minister should not become a curse to the state. The SilverLine project will be a huge blow to the people. Hence, I request the government to reconsider the decision on this project,” Sudhakaran said.

---||Meerut||Crushing begins, UP sugar mills owe farmers over Rs 4,300 cr||Bijnor: Cane crushing has begun but several sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh are yet to clear their dues. They owe farmers a total of Rs 4,300 crore. Of this, last year’s dues account for Rs 3,400 crore. Farmers have warned that the delay in payments despite a hike in sugar prices would have an impact on the assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, due next year. According to rules, mills should pay farmers in 14 days of purchasing cane. But widespread violation seems to be the order of the day. There are around 119 sugar mills in UP. According to records at the cane department, out of these, at least 21 mills have failed to clear dues of last year’s (2020-2021) crushing season. The dues are mounting as the crushing season has begun and more than 40 lakh sugarcane growers have so far supplied their produce worth Rs 3,508 crore to sugar mills across the state. The mills have paid only Rs 2,657 crore to cane growers for the current season while running up dues to the tune of Rs 851 crore. Now, the milIs owe a cumulative sum of Rs 4,300 crore to farmers. “Sugarcane is a key crop in west UP but the government seems to have turned a blind eye to pending dues. There are nine mills here in Bijnor district. Out of these, two mills are yet to pay last year's dues,” said Jaipal Singh, a farmer registered with Bilai Sugar mill of Bijnor .He pointed out that government has declared minimum price for sugar at Rs 3,100 a quintal while sugar prices in the market are between Rs 3,400 and Rs 3,500 a quintal. Another farmer, associated with a Najibabad-based mill, Arvind Kumar said, “Not paid, farmers have been forced to borrow. Many are being forced to sell their produce to kolhu owners at Rs 250 a quintal as against the state advised price of Rs 350 a quintal.” When contacted, district cane officer Yashpal Singh confirmed that “a few mills have not cleared old dues”. “We are tightening the noose on them. I hope pending dues will be cleared soon,” he added. A cane department official said the government has made efforts to control the situation. Subsidy has been to mills on raw sugar export. Besides, ethanol-petrol blending is being increased. This has led to a hike in the price of ethanol. Over 40 mills in the state are producing ethanol directly from sugar syrup. In addition, a soft loan has been given to the mills. However, when asked, an administrative officer of a Bijnor mill, AK Singh, said, “Government has increased sugarcane prices from Rs 325 to 350 per quintal. It will impact sugarcane payment as there is little growth in the sugar market."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/crushing-begins-up-sugar-mills-owe-farmers-over-rs-4300-cr/articleshow/88363793.cms||Harveer Dabas

Bareilly health department has ordered a probe against the second lab. SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan told TOI, “We will take action once a complaint is lodged by the health department. We will also investigate the matter at our level.” The first sample of the man, who was born in Bareilly and works in the UK, was collected on December 3 and the Covid positive report arrived the same night. According to the second lab’s records, the RT-PCR was collected at 9am on December 4 and the report was out by 11am. He then left for Delhi and boarded the flight at 4pm. On December 6, his swab collected by the first lab was sent to Lucknow for further investigation and the report said he was Covid positive with cycle threshold (CT) value of 28. According to the ICMR, a patient is considered Covid positive if CT value is below 35. Dr Anurag Gautam, nodal officer for Covid in Bareilly, told TOI, “His father told us that he arrived in India on November 24 and then went to Gurgaon for some official work and returned to Bareilly on November 26.” “This man’s first swab sample was sent to Lucknow for genome sequencing, which confirmed he was infected with the Delta variant of Covid. We are verifying the credibility of the second report. A notice seeking explanation has been served on the second lab. The details have been shared with senior officials for further action,” said Dr Gautam. TOI contacted both the labs but they refused to comment. Bareilly’s chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Balveer Singh told TOI, “We are investigating whether protocols were violated by the man.

The public health department staff at Trichy international airport grew suspicious over the RT-PCR negative certificates they had carried as there were some anomalies.On verifying their Covid-19 certificates that they obtained from Malaysia, the officials developed suspicion over the name and address mentioned in them. Hence, they kept the passengers on hold without clearing their departure.The health team took swabs of the three passengers and sent them for RT-PCR tests and they were isolated at a ward at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) in Trichy until the results were out. District entomologist Dr A Aravinth Kumar said that all the four passengers tested negative for Covid-19 following which they were sent home.Dr Aravinth Kumar said that such issues cropped at regular intervals. On arrival, the officials will verify the name of the passengers in the report. Sometimes, it may not match with their documents and will lead to suspicion.

---||Trichy||Over 1,000 unsafe school bldgs to be demolished||Madurai/Trichy: Following the wall collapse that left three school children dead in Tirunelveli district, various district administrations have initiated the process of identifying unsafe school buildings. In Madurai, 372 dilapidated school buildings which are unused in 238 government schools have been identified on the orders of district collector S Aneesh Sekhar. The buildings are set to be demolished in a phased manner from next week. Out of the 372 buildings, 315 are in government primary schools and middle schools, while 57 are in government high schools and higher secondary schools. Trichy district administration has identified 290 unsafe government school buildings across the district to be demolished in the next 48 hours. The local bodies in urban areas will scrutinise government-aided and private schools, while block development offices in the rural areas will survey the schools that are posing a threat to the schoolchildren.Madurai district chief educational officer R Swaminathan said that all the buildings that are to be demolished are only those buildings that are in a highly dilapidated condition.“All these buildings need to be dismantled. No building that has been identified for demolishing is a building that is currently in use. A meeting was also held with heads of government aided and private schools as well and we have informed them to demolish if there is any dilapidated building on their campuses and to update details to us online,” he said. The CEO further noted that the team of engineers will also be making field visits to aided and private schools from next week to check the condition of buildings.“Many of the buildings that are built under the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) require periodical checking and maintenance. Though officials are supposed to carry out checks once in three or five years, often it is not done properly. By around 10 years, the buildings tend to waste away and become unsuitable for use. It finally ends up being in a condition that we cannot even renovate or repair it,” said the headmaster of a government higher secondary school.Former minister R B Udhayakumar, in a letter to the Madurai district collector also urged to check the stability of buildings in 2150 government, aided and private schools in the district. “Due to the rain, many of the old buildings often retain moisture and hence the walls are prone to becoming weak. Hence, checks must be carried out at all schools in the district as soon as possible to prevent unfortunate incidents,” he said.Trichy district administration said that 205 government elementary and primary school buildings and 85 high and higher secondary school buildings have been identified as unsafe. The public works department was instructed to demolish the weak structures before Monday without even waiting for the orders. Officials said that they have ordered the school authorities not to conduct classes in such buildings. The district administration has instructed the school education department to do the follow-up. While some buildings were identified for demolition based on their age, some have developed cracks due to poor maintenance.“For private schools, the local bodies including Trichy Corporation and other municipalities were told to send notices to verify the safety of the buildings,” district collector S Sivarasu said. Even if old unsafe buildings on the government school campuses were abandoned, the collector said that orders were issued to raze down such buildings. There are 2,107 schools in the district. Even the private school administrations were told to conduct a study for ensuring the safety of the building, education department officials said.Aided and private schools have obtained stability certificates from the PWD, while launching admissions for the first time, however, over the years, no follow-ups were made. “Stagnation of rainwater in the terrace for a long time is one of the major reasons for the buildings to deteriorate. We will coordinate with education department officials to demolish the weak structures in schools on priority,” a senior engineer with PWD, Trichy, said. PWD added that requirements for maintenance, if any, conveyed by the school headmasters will be addressed.Meanwhile, Tirunelveli district collector V Vishnu on Saturday formed 18 teams comprising officials from the revenue, rural development, Tirunelveli Corporation and the other local bodies and education department to inspect the nearly 1,500 school buildings in the district over the next two days. While four teams will inspect government and private schools in Tirunelveli city, the 14 other teams will inspect schools in rural Tirunelveli.In Karur, 20 government school buildings have been identified for demolition. District collector Dr T Prabhushankar inspected the demolition process at a government school. In Pudukkottai, 259 schools were identified each having one or two dilapidated buildings. Some of them were constructed 50 years ago. The list of weak buildings was shared with the PWD for demolition. In Ariyalur, 98 elementary and primary school buildings and 28 high and higher secondary school buildings have been identified for demolition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/over-1000-unsafe-school-bldgs-to-be-demolished/articleshow/88365471.cms||---

In the rural areas, camps were organised across 300 locations. In tribal hamlets where people return to home after work in the evening, the health officers conducted vaccination at doorsteps during the night hours. A maximum number of people were vaccinated in the K Abishekapuram zone of the city. The zone vaccinated 5,028 people, followed by the Ponmalai zone (4,963). Srirangam and Ariyamangalam zones vaccinated 4,447 and 4,193 people respectively. Trichy Corporation said that the phone calls made by the civic body to remind a section of people who were skipping their second doses have helped them improve the coverage. While prominent vaccination centres such as Makkal Mandram in Thillai Nagar and corporation schools in Senthaneerpuram yielded good responses, centres such as Anganwadis and water tanks recorded a low turnout. Sources said that nursing college students who were supporting the vaccination drives so far were not available on Saturday. Meanwhile, the civic body officials said that strict enforcement in commercial areas may encourage the response for vaccination camps in the coming days. In Pachamalai hilly areas, the rural health teams camping at hamlets in Top Sengattupatti village vaccinated farmworkers late on Friday. As many as 16 interior hamlets in Pachamalai have 90% vaccination coverage with at least one dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/over-18k-inoculated-in-mass-vaccination-drive-in-trichy-city/articleshow/88365472.cms||---

Addressing the event virtually, industries minister Thangam Thennarasu said that the state government is contemplating on a State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (SIPCOT) industrial estate facility in Trichy. The organisers of the event said that an industry growth conclave is being planned in tier II and tier III cities to bring new energy to the industries. As Trichy is home to fabrication, engineering and energy sector industries, the stakeholders citing the availability of premium educational institutes such as NIT and IIM had pitched for the need to bring more industries to benefit the MSME units. “Investment in Trichy will act as a radiant for the development of adjoining districts as well. Being one of the agro-based areas, initiatives towards the agriculture industry will help in the long run. We are ready to offer the best possible support,” the industries minister said. A video presentation on the amenities available in Trichy and future infrastructure projects were screened at the event. Around 20 stalls displayed defence components, value-added products from banana, milk and organic traditional paddy breeds produced and marketed by entrepreneurs in the central region. “Any part of Tamil Nadu can be reached in five hours from Trichy, we have such good air, road and rail connectivity. All basic amenities, land, water and electricity are available for those investing here,” K N Nehru, municipal administration minister said. The minister also pointed out that around 20,000 acres of land are available in the suburbs where Trichy, Pudukottai and Thanjavur districts share borders. Invited as the keynote speaker, noted missile scientist Dr A Sivathanu Pillai said that the Trichy-Thanjavur corridor can be developed as a hub for producing missile components considering the development of the Air Force station in Thanjavur. “Ordnance factory in Trichy can also be upgraded to produce missile components. Space technology-enabled precision farming should also be considered to monitor agriculture in the region,” the founder of Brahmos aerospace added. Meanwhile, MSMEs in Trichy had sought for a facilitation-cum-resource centre of defence corridor for which Trichy was selected as one of the nodes. “Trichy’s fabrication industry is capable of making a foray into shipbuilding. All we need is guidance. A common facility centre will encourage more MSMEs to diversify and produce components for the defence sector,” said P Rajappa, president of Tiruchirapalli District Tiny & Small Scale Industries .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/new-sipcot-on-cards-for-trichy-minister/articleshow/88365469.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Corporators upset with delay in road repair work||MUMBAI: Corporators in the BMC are upset over delay in road repair works that are being caused for the year. The BMC has re-tendered works for which, they said, that contractors had quoted steeply below estimates. This comes in the wake of the BMC putting forth the Rs 1,800 crores worth of road repair work proposal before the civic standing committee for approval next week. BJP’s Bhalchandra Shirsat pointed out that in the past two years no proper road repair work has been done in the city due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “Before that the works that were taken up were by those contractors who eventually got blacklisted and police complaints were filed against them. The city has not had good roads for the past many years. Now even if the bhoomipujan for starting of these road works is done, the same is unlikely to get completed anytime before next year December or the first half of the year 2023,” said Shirsat. Every year generally the BMC starts road repair works in the month of October post monsoons and the same goes on till May end before the onset of monsoons again. This time however in the month of September in an internal file note before the roads department, its chief had pointed out that the rate analysis is unlikely to justify the possibility of doing proper quality of road works in case of the bids for new road repair works that were received. Samajwadi party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh said that its the same story yet again where the same contractors have got the work at a lower rate as compared to before. “Earlier the contractors who had bid over 20% below have now got it at 18% below. Nothing has changed but only time which could have been utilized in starting works has been wasted,” he said.  “Earlier tenders floated received bids that were in the range of -26% to -30% below estimates but now they are lower comparatively,” said a civic official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-corporators-upset-with-delay-in-road-repair-work/articleshow/88365097.cms||Richa Pinto

The mills owe Rs 150 crore to sugarcane farmers. The Group of Ministers (GoM) comprising agriculture minister Kurasala Kannababu, Botcha Satyanarayana and Mekapati Gautham Reddy has held several rounds of discussions in the last few months but a resolution is yet to be chalked out. The farmers have been staging protests in different districts demanding clearance of dues from sugar mills. Initially, the government wanted to sell stocks in the mills to clear the dues. However the financial institutions which have given loans to the mills staked claimed over the revenues accrued through sale of sugar stocks. Farmers’ organisations have been demanding that the government should clear the dues from the exchequer without waiting for the sale of sugar stocks or measures to be initiated under Revenue Recovery Act. Across the country, sugar mills are struggling to manage the situation due to high production cost and low MSP. While the mills were made to buy sugarcane from farmers at fair and remunerative price, the government’s minimum support price (MSP) is not matching their production cost. “MSP on sugar was not increased proportionately to cane prices while governments increased the cane purchasing price to appease growers,” said a senior official working in a cooperative sugar factory. Although the sugar mills were told to pay the farmers within two weeks, many mills failed to clear dues even after three years. “The cultivation of sugarcane is unviable due to increase in labour costs and financial status of the sugar mills,” said a sugarcane farmer. He said they were unable to recover at least input cost as the mills were not clearing their dues for months together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/co-op-sector-sugar-mills-battle-for-survival-as-dues-to-farmers-mount/articleshow/88363796.cms||Samdani MN

This time we are going to the people with our performance and achievements to seek their blessings,” said Srivastava, adding that these yatras will pass through all assembly constituencies in their respective ‘kshetras’ (areas). Big public meetings will also be organised at various places in the course of the yatras.” Srivastava said that before flagging off the yatra of Kashi Kshetra, Irani will address a public meeting at the Lanka ground in Ghazipur. “After a two-day journey in all assembly constituencies in Ghazipur district, the yatra will enter Chandauli district through Sakaldiha on December 21. From Chandauli, the yatra will go to Sonbhadra district through Ghorawal on December 22 and Mirzapur district through Madihan on December 23.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Shivaji’s name is used only for politics, says CM to Modi||Mumbai: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray condemned the desecration of the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Bangalore. In a strongly worded press release, Thackeray said Shivaji is not only “our” deity, but that of the whole country, and his humiliation will not be tolerated. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena workers held demonstrations in different parts of the state against the desecration. Violence was reported from parts of Sangli district. Thackeray urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to personally intervene in the matter and direct the Karnataka government to take action against those involved. “The incident has to be thoroughly investigated. The Marathi-speaking people in Karnataka have for long been victimised and now, unfortunately, there is an incident of desecration of our beloved deity and the government there is turning a blind eye to it,” he said. Thackeray reminded Modi that in his recent speech at the inauguration of the Kashi Vishwanath temple corridor, he had lauded the emergence of mighty kings like Shivaji whenever there was an attempt to crush the country’s culture. “The name of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is used only for politics and when our deity is disrespected, they are not taking any action. This will never be tolerated. It is not possible to erase Marathi identity,” he added. The CM said Marathi people are used to being silenced in Belgaum, as Kannada activists would attack Marathi-speaking people who are fighting border issues in a legal manner. Sena MP Sanjay Raut tweeted: “While on one hand, PM Modi honoured Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Kashi, on the other hand, our Maharaj is insulted in Karnataka... These angering scenes are from BJP-ruled Karnataka...” Party workers on Saturday protested outside the BJP’s office at Nariman Point in south Mumbai. Sena functionary Pandurang Sakpal led the protests in south Mumbai. “We condemn the comments by the Karnataka CM who said that this was not such a big incident. There will be protests all over India. We condemn the BJP government and they should be hit with slippers. They must not forget that buses from Mumbai also go to Karnataka ,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shivajis-name-is-used-only-for-politics-says-cm-to-modi/articleshow/88365108.cms||---

State police chief Anil Kant issued guidelines for successfully undertaking the new programme. The district police chiefs would form special teams to nab those hiding after committing serious crimes. The state special branch will prepare a list of those indulging in anti-social activities, and they will be put under constant watch. It will be examined if the persons released on bail are violating the bail conditions. If they are doing so, steps will be taken to cancel their bail and remand them back to custody. The special branch has been asked to conduct secret surveillance on such persons. Those involved in criminal cases and those who are suspects will be under surveillance, and if required, searches will be conducted at their regular hideouts. A database will also be prepared on district-basis of those having previous history of involvement in violence and criminal activities. If required, they will be arrested by charging Kerala Anti-social Activities Prevention Act (KAPA). Those against whom cases have been already registered for various criminal activities will be arrested soon, and police will seize vehicles that have been used for such activities. All the steps that have been taken based on the guidelines will be reported on a daily basis to the state police chief by the DSPs of the special branch, through the district police chiefs. A high-level meeting of police officials of the rank of SPs and above was convened by the state police chief last week to chart new plans and review the functioning of the force in the wake of repeated criticism against police. The meeting had decided to come up with fresh ideas and strengthen the enforcement activities undertaken by the police to tackle various types of crimes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-to-launch-op-kaaval-to-curb-organized-crime/articleshow/88363811.cms||---

Modi paid tributes to his former cabinet colleague during his Goa visit on Sunday, and said that Parrikar was the person who set the development agenda for the state. “When I see Goa’s progress, I remember my dear friend and colleague Manohar Parrikarji,” he said. “He not only took Goa to new heights of progress, but he also showed the potential of Goa. The country used to see in Manohar Parrikarji the character of Goa, how sincere, hardworking and talented Goans are. We saw in him, in the way he lived his life, how one can work for his state till the last breath,” the Prime Minister said. It was Parrikar who initiated the work of expanding Goa’s tourism sector, said the Prime Minister. “On today’s occasion, I pay tribute to the memory of Goa’s luminous son Manohar Parrikarji.

As a result, they could not answer many questions. According to senior English lecturers, some of the questions were out of the syllabus, and grammatical errors were also noticed in the question paper. “As per our calculations, students may not be able to answer questions worth a total of 35 marks, out of 100 marks,” said a senior PU English lecturer, adding that the department of pre-university education (DPUE) must check the question paper, once it is prepared, for any errors. Some of the lecturers doubted if the English faculty had set the question paper. “Looking at the paper, we doubt whether the person who set it, was aware about the II PU English syllabus. At the exam hall, we noticed that the students were perplexed looking at the question paper,” said a lecturer who was an invigilator for the exam. Many lessons were omitted for the mid-term examination due to the pandemic. “However, several questions were from the lessons that were left out,” said a student, who demanded that the exam be held again. Students claimed that they could not answer one mark, four mark and grammar related questions. Due to a change in the examination pattern, the question papers are provided by the DPUE. Each district prepares a set of question papers for the state. Later, the question papers are randomly distributed to each district. “The departmental guidelines on framing question papers have been completely ignored. Grammar and punctuation errors are found from the beginning to the end of the question paper. The department must re-check the question paper before it is finalised,” said a senior lecturer. Lecturers suggested that inter-district question paper distribution should be stopped for mid-term exams, and strict action should be taken against the person who set the question paper. Snehal Rayamane, director, DPUE, said that she has asked Dakshina Kannada DDPU C D Jayanna to submit a report on the issue. “If there are more than 35 marks questions out of syllabus or errors in the questions, we may hold the exam again,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/students-complain-of-errors-in-ii-pu-mid-term-english-paper/articleshow/88363808.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Balakrishnan told reporters on Saturday that it was natural to have doubts. Not just for the LDF constituents, anybody for that matter, can have their own doubts. Those concerned are always ready to clear such doubts. “Regarding the CPI opinion, it has already been clarified by CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran. He has unequivocally made it clear that the CPI was in favour of the project that was included in the LDF election manifesto,” the CPM state secretary said. He was speaking about the reported difference of opinion expressed by some senior CPI leaders in the CPI council meeting recently and the refusal of CPI leader Binoy Viswom to join the Left MPs’ delegation to the Union railway minister. Lauds Tharoor’s stand Balakrishnan continued to laud Congress MP Shashi Tharoor for supporting the ‘development agenda’ of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “Tharoor has echoed the general opinion of the state. Congress should change their stand and cooperate with the SilverLine project,” he said. Balakrishnan also ratcheted up his attack against Indian Union Muslim League. “Nothing of what I said about IUML needs to be changed. It is true that the League takes communal stands, especially when it is in the opposition. Let the IUML leaders first correct what they said at the Kozhikode meeting,” he said. He also alleged dubious motives behind the Union government move to alter the minimum age for women to enter wedlock. Balakrishnan, who reached New Delhi to attend the party politburo meeting, alleged dubious motives behind the central government move to raise the legal age for marriage of women from 18 to 21. “There is no such urgent need to increase the minimum age for marriage for women. There is no doubt in the CPM in this regard. Also, the LDF constituents are all against the BJP government’s move,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpi-not-against-k-rail-project-says-kodiyeri/articleshow/88364532.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Misconduct if lawyer quotes fee on success’||Mumbai: A magistrate’s court has held that a lawyer quoting a fee conditional to the success of the trial amounts to professional misconduct. The magistrate quoted a Bombay high court judgment which said, “Fees conditional on the success of a case and which gives the lawyer an interest of the subject matter tends to undermine the status of the profession. The same has always been condemned as unworthy of (the) legal profession. If an advocate has interest in success of litigation, he may tend to depart from ethics.” The Rs 3 lakh cheque issued by the client, Sandip Gomane, brother of a murder accused, bounced, and the lawyer sought relief under the Negotiable Instruments Act. The magistrate’s court, however, acquitted Sandip. The magistrate’s court said that there was no legally enforceable debt. “The issuance of the cheque by the accused to the complainant in the present matter, towards a fees of a matter, depending on its success, cannot be said to be issued for a recovery of legal debt,” the metropolitan magistrate said. The court further said that it cannot be inferred that the accused legally owed an amount. The lawyer, Milind Rawal (39), had told the family of the accused he would charge Rs 3 lakh if the case ended in an acquittal. While the lawyer initially demanded Rs 5 lakh, after negotiations, he was ready to accept Rs 3 lakh. In 2016, the client Ramachandra Gomane was acquitted. In August 2017, when Rawal deposited the cheque given by Ramchandra’s brother Sandip, it was dishonoured due to insufficient funds. When Sandip did not respond to Rawal’s legal notice, the lawyer submitted the complaint against him in October 2017. Rawal also produced a promissory note that was executed by the Gomane brothers before the judgment in the murder case was pronounced. Sandip claimed the cheque was taken under influence. He also said that he only owed the lawyer Rs 1.09 lakh as he had already paid him Rs 1.91 lakh from time to time and had even done painting work at his house for Rs 67,000. The court, however, said that Section 138 of the Act, which relates to punishment for dishonoured cheques, is not attracted. The court said the legal profession is a major component of the justice delivery system and an advocate plays an important role in upholding the rule of law. “An advocate is expected to play a vital role in providing access to justice. The honourable Apex Court time to time (sic) vide its authorities in past also frequently expressed the concern on the falling professional norms in the legal profession,” the court noted. The court further said that the cheque was taken by way of abuse of position and the transaction was void under the Contract Act. The court said that since Sandip as a client was in a fiduciary relation with Rawal, the burden to prove that the fee was reasonable and had been voluntarily agreed to be paid was upon the lawyer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-misconduct-if-lawyer-quotes-fee-on-success/articleshow/88365116.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Mangaluru||University College extends midday meals to PG students||Mangaluru: University College, Hampankatta, has extended its free midday meal programme to postgraduate students this academic year. The programme was started three years ago, to help undergraduate students who come from far-off and poor families. The college, after realising that there are students in PG courses who face similar hardship, decided to extend the programme. The initiative is the brainchild of Uday Kumar M A, associate professor and former principal of the college. It was stopped during the pandemic, and resumed a few days ago. Dr Ganapathi Gowda S, associate professor, history and in-charge of the programme, told STOI that currently 230 students including 30 PG students, are benefiting from the midday meals. It is sponsored by the faculty, well-wishers, alumni and others. “Many students from economically poor backgrounds come to colleges from as far as 60km away. They leave home around 6am and pack tiffin from the previous night’s leftovers. The food turns stale when they sit down for lunch at noon. As they cannot consume it, they throw it away. They survive on water or eating biscuits or some quick bites, and attend classes hungry. This was the condition of undergraduate students, and it is the same with PG students. Therefore, we decided to hand-pick eligible candidates for the programme,” said Ganapathi. Ganapathi said that after a student submits an application to avail the programme, a personal interview is done, and is accepted only if the committee is convinced. “The UG college alone has close to more than 1,500 students, and a majority come from poor backgrounds. We cannot include everyone due to lack of resources,” Ganapathi said, adding that beneficiaries are given responsibilities to arrange, serve food and clean the place. When the programme started in 2017-18, it had about 50 UG students, and it was increased to 178 the next year. Every day the students are served unlimited rice, sambar, palya, chutney and pickle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/university-college-extends-midday-meals-to-pg-students/articleshow/88363822.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

---||Nagpur||Clerk misuses user id of srs, generates bills of other depts||Nagpur: A clerk working in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) projects department is alleged to have generated bills for the bogus files of contractor Padmakar ‘Kolba’ Sakode using the user ID and the password of a junior engineer. The clerk also gave approval using the user ID and password of the executive engineer. He had allegedly generated bills of bogus contracts of library and, birth and death registration department.NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi issued a show-cause notice to clerk Sanis Gokhe on Saturday. He was a clerk in the projects department when he allegedly did the irregularities and is now working as personal assistant of additional municipal commissioner Deepak Kumar Meena.As per the process, the department prepares file of contract and submits it to the accounts and finance department for release of payment to contractors. Then, the official concerned of the department generates bill online on NMC’s payment module system developed under e-governance project of the central government. The bill goes to the head of the department for online approval and then to the accounts and finance department for the approval. The accounts and finance department then disburses the payment after checking the file and the online bill.An NMC official told TOI that bogus contracts of Rs74 lakh in the library department and Rs60 lakh in the birth and death registration department have been confirmed. “We investigated into who generated the bill and approved it online. It came to fore that Gokhe had done it using user IDs and passwords of executive engineer Naresh Borkar and Sanjay Ingale. A show-cause notice has been issued to Gokhe.”Joshi has reportedly also approved show-cause notices to Borkar and Ingale and they are likely to be issued on Monday. They will be show-caused as they shared user ID and password with Gokhe.This is the second such case in bogus contracts scam. For bogus contracts of health department, clerk of general administration department had generated bill using his powers and had approved it using user ID and password of assistant commissioner Mahesh Dhamecha. The clerk was suspended and a departmental inquiry was launched against Dhamecha for sharing user ID and password with the clerk.The latest revelation again proves the involvement of staff of accounts and finance department in the scam. Though the bill was generated and approved from projects department and bogus contract was related to library and birth and death registration department, the payment was disbursed to the contractor by the accounts department. Three staff from accounts and finance department are already under suspension and departmental inquiry is still going on against chief accounts and finance officer Vijay Kolhe.It is learnt that many heads of departments have shared their user ID and passwords to clerks for approving bills on the payment module. Earlier too, this had come to fore in revenue scam. A computer operator on contract had reduced property tax bills of some persons using user ID and password of top officials.SKELETONS TUMBLE OUTPersonal assistant of additional municipal commissioner Deepak Kumar Meena used to work with projects departmentWas clerk in projects department Junior engineer is authorized to generate bill on NMC’s payment module.

BJP state president Bandi Sanjay on Saturday said he will participate in the protest programme on unemployment and the government’s attitude on the issue. Addressing a press conference at state BJP office BJP president said though Presidential Orders were issued on allotment of employees three years ago, government has not completed re-allotment. “State government should take up re-allotment scientifically by considering service rules and local status. The GO No. 317, which was issued by government was unscientific. As a result of the GO, employees and teachers will become non-local in their districts,” he said. On CM’s remarks at Friday’s meeting with TRS elected representatives that he would take up Bengal-like movement, Sanjay said BJP, which had just four seats in West Bengal, got 77 seats in the recently-held elections. He said the party would not keep quiet if TRS tried to create riots on the lines of West Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-deeksha-over-job-notification-on-dec-27/articleshow/88363840.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kanpur||Lawyer held in colleague’s murder during KBA poll on court campus||Kanpur: The police on Saturday arrested advocate Taru Agarwal, named in the murder of lawyer Gautam Dutt, who was shot dead during a firing incident during the election of Kanpur Bar Association (KBA) on the district court campus on Friday. Commissioner of police Asim Kumar Arun has appealed for full cooperation from the advocates in maintaining law and order. To recall, firing took place outside the Shatabdi Gate on the district court campus after the cancellation of Bar association elections late on Friday evening. During this, advocate Gautam Dutt, a resident of Anwarganj Phoolwali Gali, was shot in the stomach. He died during treatment at around 10:30pm in the Lala Lajpat Rai (LLR) hospital. After the information, the lawyers created a ruckus, subsequently the police rushed to the spot and pacified them by assuring prompt action. A case of murder has been registered on the complaint of deceased Gautam’s aunt Sangeeta Dwivedi, who has named one Taru Agarwal in the FIR. It is alleged that Taru Agarwal had killed Gautam owing to an old enmity. The commissioner of police said that the main accused Taru Agarwal has been arrested in this case on Saturday morning, and is being questioned. Police sources, meanwhile, said that Taru Agarwal surrendered at the Cantt police station at around 5:30 am on Saturday. In the complaint, there has been an allegation of electoral competition, but in the posters and pamphlets found by the police, Gautam Dutt and accused Taru Agarwal are seen supporting the same candidate. Police are trying to find out the exact reason behind the incident. Meanwhile, advocates of Kanpur Nagar on Saturday abstained themselves from judicial work to mourn the death. Gautam Dutt, an aspirant for the post of joint secretary, was shot after the declaration that KBA elections have been cancelled. The two associations, Kanpur Bar Association and The Lawyers Association, put up the banner of strike and asked the members to keep themselves away from judicial proceedings. KBA extended financial assistance of Rs 50,000 to the bereaved family of Gautam Dutt. The administration has deployed a heavy police force in the morning at the postmortem house so that any untoward incident could be checked. The family, after the postmortem, performed the last rituals of the deceased advocate on the banks of river Ganga. Meanwhile, the Bar council of UP has repeatedly asked the Elders Committee to furnish their report to the Bar Council as well as to the observer. But, there was no report so far according to Devendra Mishra observer sent by the Bar council of UP for supervision of election. Mishra, talking to TOI, stated, “I thanked God when I reached home last night. I had never imagined that such types of practices were being adopted in the election of advocates, who were claimed as most educated.” Mishra said that he was asking for a report since Friday evening but the election conducting committee did not send the same so far. He had received a PDF file, a few minutes before in which they had tried to smudge the incident. “Bar Council chairman and others were waiting for the names of advocates involved in the shoot out and in illegal activities during the voting so that they could be suspended or deprived of their license. But, no name has been given so far,” Mishra, who is also a member of Bar Council, said. Blaming the Elders Committee, he stated that they had still not sent the CCTV footage. “Once footage would be obtained then involved advocates could be identified easily and the Bar council would take action against them,” he added. He pointed out that as per verbal report the Committee had blamed one candidate each for president’s and secretary’s post. But they did not name any one. Though apparently Kanpur court premises were peaceful on Saturday, there were suppositions among the various groups of advocates. Point of discussion was firing in court premises and death of an advocate. Some blamed the student union like politics among fresher advocates, while some claimed hooliganism had started in the court premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/lawyer-held-in-colleagues-murder-during-kba-poll-on-court-campus/articleshow/88365124.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Jangling sound of landline phone rings its way into history, 7.6 lakh disconnect in 9 yrs||MUMBAI: That jarring clank of the good ol’ landline phone seems to be fading slowly. In the era of the cellphone, lakhs of people in Mumbai have hung up on their fixed phone connections over the past few years as the landline has failed to march in step with time and technology. In the last nine years alone, 7.6 lakh landline connections have been surrendered to the public telephone authority, MTNL. A manifestation of how times are changing if you consider that in the ’80s, it was a long waiting list for new connections. In April 2021, only 14.8 lakh connections were active in the city. This year, data shows that fresh subscriptions for the landline hit their nadir with merely 2,535 applications for new connections Mumbai (till November 30). The downward slide began in 2014-15 when the number of connections surrendered to MTNL outnumbered the new connections. This trend continued and intensified in 2020-2021. That is when over 1.16 lakh users surrendered their landlines, and merely 3,998 applied for a new connection. RTI activist Anil Galgali, who had sought this information, pored over the data to find that although new customers had been added in the past two years, the numbers were miniscule. While 1.9 lakh customers surrendered their landlines between 2020 and 2022, only 6,533 new connections were added in MTNL, Mumbai. “Customers were already dissatisfied with the service and MTNL, Mumbai, has failed to maintain the quality of service due to contractual work in the past few years. MTNL, Mumbai, can compete with private players only if positions are filled and quality of service improves,” said Galgali who has written to the Prime Minister and telecom minister to take measures to save MTNL, Mumbai. An MTNL insider, who did not wish to be named, said that old-time employees who had left were not replaced. “Instead, posts were filled with contractual, untrained people,” said the insider. In 2020, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) said, landline subscriber base was falling, with connections down from 3.68 crore on January 31, 2010 to 2.06 crore on January 31, 2020.  Of the total telecom 118 crore connections, only 2.03 crore — that’s less than 2% — were landline as of February. MTNL’s Mumbai general manager Sanjay Khare said several factors had led to the decline of the landline’s tele-density, but added that now telephony via optical cable or fibre-to-home was picking up pace.  “The mobile phone came packed with so many conveniences. It’s in your pocket, all numbers are saved, you can make a call to the one you want to speak to rather than going via another person who may pick the landline. As soon as a call from a cell phone got cheaper than the landline, it really pulled the landline traffic towards the cellular phone,” explained Khare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-jangling-sound-of-landline-phone-rings-its-way-into-history-7-6-lakh-disconnect-in-9-yrs/articleshow/88365127.cms||Hemali Chhapia

The incident which occurred on Dec 7 at a city school happened when the boy, who had taken an exam the previous day also, walked in wearing a neat pair of T-shirt and shorts — his normal dress. “As he was getting in, the principal insulted the boy and me in front of other parents and children for wearing what he called ‘indecent attire’,” said mother Seema Lal. Angry at the treatment of her son, she asked the principal if there was a dress code for the NIOS exam as he was being home-schooled. “He kept asking why the boy didn’t wear a uniform. I told him that there was no uniform as he was being taught at home by us.” Lal, a mental health consultant, immediately called the regional officer of NIOS who admitted that there was no uniform. “What appalled me was the regional officer’s next statement — I should know about Kerala tradition,” Seema said, adding, “What is Kerala traditional wear for a 15-year-old?” After that, they agreed that the child was not breaking any rules and let him write the exam. She said that all this was being recorded by a school observer who took the video. “I warned him that if it ever got out, I would report it to the cybercell. I have sent a complaint to the Kerala child rights commission,” she added. Lal, who has crusaded for the implementation of regulations for therapy centres in the state and for issues relating to disabled persons, says that the concept of NIOS is to allow all children to study without stress and tension of exams and academic pressures. “My son is a normal child, but there are several students who have various disabilities and who cannot be expected to conform to a dress code because of their disabilities. Is this going to be the attitude of authorities? This lack of sensitivity towards children who are not studying in an educational institution and bound by its rules, needs to be addressed seriously,” she said. “We will look into it seriously because it is a larger question of the concept of an open education system. We have sent notices to the concerned authorities,” said K Nazeer, member-Kerala child rights commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mom-moves-rights-panel-over-public-insult-of-child/articleshow/88363846.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

He also said that Pope Francis is appreciative of India’s democracy and has been invited to visit India soon. “Goa peacefully gave space for every idea to grow,” Modi said. “Goa has shown throughout history how every religion, every community and every people can come together for a united India. Goa is a place which has preserved the holy relics of Georgia’s Queen Ketevan for centuries. Only recently, India handed over part of the relics of Saint Queen Ketevan to Georgia. The relics were discovered in the St Augustine’s tower site in Goa,” the PM said. Goa’s freedom is a living symbol of India’s unity, said Modi.  “For Goa’s freedom struggle, everyone fought as one. The Pinto Revolt was led by Goa’s native Christians. This is the identity of India, where the goal is one — of serving humanity. This unity of India is praised by the world. I recently visited Italy and Vatican City, where I got the opportunity to interact with Pope Francis. His thoughts about India are the same,” said Modi. “I invited him to visit India and I want to tell you that after I invited him, Pope Francis said, ‘this is the greatest gift you have given me’. This is his love and appreciation for India and its vibrant democracy,” the Prime Minister said. Recalling some of the luminaries of Goa’s freedom struggle, Modi paid tributes to Luis de Menezes Bragança, T B Cunha, Juliao Menezes, Purushottam Kakodkar, Laxmikant Bhembre, Bala Raya Mhapari and Ram Manohar Lohia, among others. He also said that ‘several leaders of the Jan Sangh post India’s independence kept Goa’s freedom struggle going’. “Several members of the Azad Gomantak Dal gave their everything for Goa’s freedom. Prabhakar Sinari, Trivikram Vaidya, Vishwanath Lawande, Jagannath Rao Joshi, Nana Kazrekar, Sudhir Phadke were only few of many who gave direction and energy to the fight for the freedom of Goa, Daman and Diu,” said Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goans-have-always-been-accommodating-modi/articleshow/88379337.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Vijayawada||Docs seek toxicology lab to save poison victims||Visakhapatnam: Doctors have observed that the death rate of poison victims can be reduced if a forensic and toxicology laboratory is set up at King George Hospital in the port city. They say toxicology lab is essential to provide suitable antidote and save the lives of poison victims. Lack of lab facilities in KGH has been delaying post-mortem reports in poison death cases and administration of suitable medicine to the patients. Doctors in the forensic science department of Andhra Medical College say it would be difficult for them to prepare the final post-mortem report unless the examination reports reach them on time. Forensic medicine department head Dr.V Chandra Sekhar told TOI that a 24/7 toxicology laboratory in KGH would be useful for the doctors and the patients alike. “Poison cases lead to police investigation and filing chargesheets needs report. A proposal for a toxicology lab was mooted five to six years ago. But, there is no progress yet,” he said. Presently, the doctors are sending the poison victims’ samples to Regional Forensic Science Laboratory near NAD or the Central Forensic Science Laboratory in Hyderabad. However, the final report of post mortem reaches couple of weeks after the death. Not only in preparing post-mortem reports, but the lab will also be useful in saving the life of victims.“There are four to five suicide attempt cases or suicide deaths due to consumption of poison a month. We are facing difficult situations whenever a patient is brought here and no one knows what kind of poison he/she has taken,” another doctor said. KGH superintendent Dr. Mythili told TOI that they are trying to set up a laboratory. A quick analysis of the poison consumed by the patients will help the doctors give proper antidote as they can know the nature of poison and the substance consumed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/docs-seek-toxicology-lab-to-save-poison-victims/articleshow/88363841.cms||Siva G

On September 13, 2021, an FIR was registered against Quavi Ahmad under various sections of IPC alleging assault, loot and rape and under UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 alleging attempt to convert forcefully by misrepresentation. The FIR was lodged at Civil Lines police station of Prayagraj. As alleged in the FIR, the woman was preparing for Miss India competition and used to run a gym in Civil Lines. In 2018, she came in contact with Quavi Ahmad, who befriended her by changing his name. The accused took her to Lucknow on the pretext of running a beauty parlour where he exploited her sexually while giving her sedatives. He made obscene videos of her and started blackmailing her. On September 12, 2021, the accused attacked the woman in the Civil Lines area of the city and chased her. To save her life, the victim ran into a police post after which she lodged the present FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-former-sp-mlas-son-in-rape-conversion-bid-case/articleshow/88365140.cms||---

He said the state government would not set up paddy procurement centres in the coming rabi season as the Centre had repeatedly said it would not buy a single grain of boiled rice in the rabi season. He asked the collectors to inform the farmers that the government would not procure rice due to the policies of the NDA government and advise the farmers to go for alternate crops. However, he said the TRS government would continue to work for the interests of the people. In the previous season, the state government had set up 6,300 procurement centres in every village for the convenience of the farmers. He asked the civil supplies department to write to the FCI to lift the rice that had already been procured in the previous rabi season from the godowns. On the allotment of state government employees, he asked the collectors to allot the employees as per the new zonal rules which ensure employment to locals and also pave way for better administration. He also asked them to consider spouse cases while completing the process. The CM also discussed about implementation of Dalit Bandhu scheme in detail with the collectors and ministers. He explained the reasons for unveiling the scheme and need for the successful implementation of the scheme.

The leaders might be having their own opinion on diverse issues, which can be aired inside the party forum. While commenting on the statement by Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor supporting the development initiatives of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, especially K-Rail, the KPCC president said the party leaders while commenting on issues in public should adhere to the party policy on that issue. He said the party has sought an explanation from Tharoor on what grounds he made that statement in public. “I will be having a direct discussion with Tharoor on this and I hope that he will come out with a detailed explanation during the discussion,” said Sudhakaran. “Tharoor is considered as an orator and a diplomat. Hence he will be having different and independent views on each issue. But the party has asked him that being a Congressman he should adhere to the party line and party’s policies while talking on such issues,” the KPCC president added. UDF and Congress have taken a strong stand against the K-Rail project, he said. “But we don’t know what is the argument and logic behind the claims made by Tharoor on this. Let me talk to him first and then we will come to a conclusion,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/will-seek-explanation-from-tharoor-says-sudhakaran/articleshow/88364559.cms||---

Mayor M K Varghese has said that it was for the first time a local body in Kerala was taking an initiative on its own to protect the stray cattle. As per the Cattle Trespass Act, the stray cattle should be seized and auctioned periodically. “Mostly such cattle are slaughtered. We didn’t want this to happen, and we wanted to protect them. The offer of the Dhyan Foundation to protect the stray cattle in their rehabilitation centre has come in as a big support,” the mayor said. Though stray cattle flocking together has been a usual sight in the city, the corporation authorities were finding it difficult to give proper care to them as they keep wandering. On the other side, they were also causing accidents at different points. Recently, an ASI of Kerala police had died when the bike on which he was traveling hit a cow on the roadside. There are about 50 stray cattle in the city currently, and about 40 of them were being kept in an enclosure near the North Bus stand area in the city, said corporation veterinarian Dr Veena K Anirudhan. The mayor said that the Dhyan Foundation has excellent facilities to rehabilitate stray cattle at 24 centres in different parts of the country. They are known to be protecting about 70,000 cattle in these centres. “We have visited the foundation’s Coimbatore centre and we are satisfied with the facilities there. We are planning to start shifting the cattle by next week after signing an agreement with the foundation,’’ the mayor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/stray-cattle-in-tsr-to-be-shifted-to-coimbatore/articleshow/88363884.cms||T Ramavarman

Both leaders had been staying away from the party revamp process and were not cooperating with the new leadership. They had registered their protest with the party high command against the revamp being carried out by the new state leadership. It was in this backdrop that the KPCC president met both senior leaders. In the meeting, both leaders are learnt to have agreed to support the leadership to go ahead with the party revamp. The leaders agreed to support after the leadership made it clear that their demands would be taken care of while considering the new party office-bearers. After the meeting, Chennithala said that everything will be a smooth affair in the party. This shows that a temporary truce has been reached between the senior leaders and the leadership. Earlier, opposition leader V D Satheesan had also met both these senior leaders to garner their support for the party revamp. It is learnt that both Satheesan and Sudhakaran have made it clear that the nominees of Ramesh and Chandy will be given due recognition when the KPCC secretaries are being finalized. Ramesh and Chandy were of the view that since the AICC has decided to go for an organizational poll, there was no need for a party revamp in the state presently since the organization poll will have to be conducted here too. However, the KPCC leadership was of the view that the organizational poll is a long process and it will take a minimum of one year to complete. Hence, till then, the party machinery cannot remain defunct. Meanwhile, the AICC also gave the nod to the KPCC leadership to go ahead with the revamp and this was the reason why the KPCC president took the initiative to seek the support of the senior leaders. During the appointment of vice-presidents, general secretaries and DCC presidents, these two senior leaders were of the view that their nominees were sidelined. Hence these two leaders were not cooperating with the new leadership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/temporary-truce-in-cong-as-kpcc-chief-meets-chandy-chennithala/articleshow/88364562.cms||---

The PM made the statement while laying the foundation of the Ganga Expressway in Shahjahanpur. TOI had published a series of reports about the police's clamp down on the infamous albeit flourishing car-breaking and stolen auto-parts market. The crackdown started in July, and cops recovered hundreds of two- and four-wheeler engines along with other parts. They had also arrested two kingpins, Haji Iqbal and Haji Galla, along with their associates and seized properties worth crores. The market was shut down last Sunday. "It is important for people residing in Delhi NCR and other states to know that there is a bazaar in Meerut called Sotiganj. Cars stolen from across the country used to be dismantled here. This illegal practice had been going on for decades. No previous government had the courage to do anything about it. However, the ‘damdaar (daring) Yogi government decided to take action. Now, the black market of Sotiganj has been shut down," the PM said. TOI had reported that police had a few days ago served a notice under section 91 of the CrPC to over 100 shops to undertake stocktaking and submit records. Traders were also asked to submit GST documents. The market has over 300 shops and employs over 1,000 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/pm-praises-yogi-govt-for-cracking-down-on-sotiganj-scrap-market/articleshow/88363887.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Need transparency & efficiency in co-op movement, says Amit Shah||Ahmednagar/Mumbai: The Modi government is with the cooperative movement and its workers and wants it to move forward, but “we will also have to bring transparency and efficiency and provide space in it to youth with professional backgrounds,” Union home minister and co-operation minister Amit Shah said at a conference of the cooperation sector at Pravaranagar in Ahmednagar district on Saturday. Attacking the MVA government, Shah said problems of cooperative societies from the state were being brought to the Centre to be resolved. Stating he would not remain a silent spectator, Shah said it was corruption and not rules and regulations of the RBI that had paralysed cooperative banks in the state. “I am not here to disrupt but to join the missing links. I have seen some state governments not providing bank guarantees to sugar mills whose management is politically linked to opposition parties. Why should the state government not settle their issues instead of prompting us to hold meetings in Delhi?” he asked. “I have come not to break anything in the cooperative movement, but to add to the movement, but the state government should also rise above politics and look after cooperatives,” he said. Stating that he could not be “a silent observer, it is my responsibility and that is why today I have come here,” Shah added, “I assure you that when issues come before me, no one will look into who is running the cooperative unit. However, it will definitely be seen how it is performing and the state government should also proceed in the same way.” The Union home minister is on a two-day visit to Maharashtra and began his tour with a visit to Shirdi’s Sai Baba temple . “Today is a very happy day for me that I am present here in this holy land from which Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had raised the bugle of Swaraj... It is also the land of Saint Dnyaneshwar Maharaj..., This is the land of Sai Baba who taught the world the virtues of Shraddha and Saburi. This land is as holy as Kashi for cooperatives of the country, because it is here Padmashree Vikhe Patil worked to lay the foundation of cooperatives. PM Narendra Modi has established the Ministry of Cooperation because he knows cooperatives are relevant today and the mantra of ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’ can only become a success through cooperatives,” he said. But he noted, “There was a time district cooperatives in Maharashtra were considered ideal. But what has become of them today, only 3 are left.” Later in the evening, Shah attended an Institute of Company Secretaries of India awards ceremony in Mumbai. He will be in Pune on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-need-transparency-efficiency-in-co-op-movement-says-amit-shah/articleshow/88365151.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: 26 new power stations proposed in Bijnor||BIJNOR: Unable to bear the load of rising demand for electricity, The power corporation has proposed to set up 26 more stations in Bijnor to deal with the problem of overloading. At present there are 30 power stations in the district and a network of over 70 sub power stations suppying electricity to more than seven lakh consumers every day. The number of power connections have doubled in the last one decade and so have consumers. The increase in demand has led to overloading at power houses and consequent frequent breakdowns and low voltage, said power department officials. Nand Lal, superintendent engineer, said, “The new plan has been devised keeping the next five years in mind. Once, we have additional 26 stations, the district will be able to cater to its population without much problem. Out of these, four sub power stations are to be set up in Bijnor district headquarters." The main problem is to connect sub power houses to transmission power houses, which supply electricity to consumers. “Presently, our transmission power houses are also overloaded. In Bijnor city, we are facing such hurdles. Once transmission power houses are revamped, our plan can be implemented,” said Lal. Talking to TOI, Parveen Singh, a farmer from Gadana village, said, “Our village is linked with the Pili Chowki sub power house, which is overloaded. In summer, we have to face low voltage or power outages. If our power house is revamped, it will reduce our hardships.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/to-cut-overloading-26-new-power-stations-proposed-in-bijnor/articleshow/88363903.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Goa||Goa would have been liberated earlier if Sardar Patel lived a bit longer: PM Narendra Modi||PANAJI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said here on Sunday that it would not have taken so long for Goa to be liberated from Portuguese rule had Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel lived a bit longer. Modi said the delay in Goa’s liberation meant that several freedom fighters continued to lose their lives in the struggle to free Goa. “Thirty one satyagrahis lost their lives in 1955, including youngsters like Karnail Singh Banipal of Punjab. These brave freedom fighters were restless because at the time a part of India was still under foreign rule. Today, I want to say that if Sardar Vallabbhai Patel had to live a bit longer, Goa would not have to wait for so long for its liberation,” Modi said. Taking a dig at the then government under Jawaharlal Nehru, Modi also said that a freedom fighter like Mohan Ranade continued to languish in Portuguese prison, even after Goa was liberated. The issue had to be finally raised by Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Parliament back then, said the PM in his address to Goa on the state’s 60th Liberation Day celebrations held at Shyama Prasad Mukherjee indoor stadium on the outskirts of Panaji. Recalling the sacrifice of the Pune-based freedom fighter for Goa’s freedom, Modi said, “We must remember Mohan Ranade who was sent to jail for fighting for Goa’s freedom. He was kept in prison (in Portugal) and had to live through unspeakable difficulties. Even after Goa’s liberation, he remained in prison. At the time, it was Atal Bihari Vajpayee who raised the issue in Parliament,” he said. The Prime Minister said Goa has struggled the longest as compared to any other region in India for its freedom. “The rest of the country was free before Goa. Most of the people in the country finally had the freedom to live out their dreams. But they gave up all of it and chose to sacrifice for Goa’s freedom. Goa’s freedom fighters, too, never stopped fighting. In Indian history, Goans have kept the flame burning for freedom for the longest period,” Modi said. He said Goa never lost its connection with India despite several turbulent centuries of Portuguese rule, as the rest of the country struggled with Mughals and other invaders. “Goa was under Portuguese rule at a time when in other parts of India Mughals were ruling. The country saw many empires falling and rising. But even after centuries of power games, neither Goa forgot its Indianness nor did India forget its Goa. This is a bond which has only grown stronger with time,” Modi said. This is not the first time the issue of Goa’s wait to be liberated from Portuguese rule has been raised. Nearly a year ago, chief minister Pramod Sawant had blamed then PM Jawaharlal Nehru for the delay in liberating Goa. Referring to the same issue last month, the chief minister at a function in Margao said he was yet to fathom the reasons for the 14-year delay by the Indian government in securing Goa’s liberation from Portuguese rule and called for a debate over the issue. Goa governor P S Sreedharan Pillai, who was present at the function, suggested a “search and discussion” at the academic level on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-would-have-been-liberated-earlier-if-sardar-patel-lived-a-bit-longer-pm/articleshow/88379365.cms||---

Balu S, a constable attached to Special Armed Police battalion (SAP), is the deceased. He is the son of D Suresh and Anila D S of ‘Karthika’, Alissery near Punnapra in Alappuzha district. Balu was part of a four-member team led by Varkala station house officer inspector V S Prasanth to nab a murder suspect — Ottakam Rajesh — wanted in connection with the murder of Sudheesh at Pothencode. They set out on a traditional canoe to search the backwater island of Ponnumthuruth near Panayil Kadavu under Anchuthengu police station limits when the mishap occurred around 12 noon on Saturday. Besides Prasanth and Balu, other officers on board the boat were civil police officer Prasanth Kumar of Varkala station and constable Ananthapadmanabhan of SAP. The boat, which was hired from a local resident, was steered by its regular boatsman. Their boat overturned near Panayil Kadavu Bridge and all officers fell into the lake. While all others were rescued by local fishermen and those collecting mussels in the lake, Balu sank to the depths. Fire and rescue service personnel from Varkala and Attingal stations were immediately dispatched for rescue operation. He was found and pulled out of the lake around 2pm. He was first rushed to a private hospital at Varkala and then to Thiruvananthapuram medical college hospital. But the doctors could not save his life. The health condition of other officers involved in the mishap was stable, police said. Two other teams, led by Anchuthengu and Kadakkavoor inspectors, were also on the lake on other boats searching the backwater islands. They had set out to the island after receiving reliable information that Rajesh was hiding there. State police chief Anil Kant expressed condolences on the constable’s demise while on duty. As per his official statement, Balu became part of the police force after completing his training in September this year. He was a graduate in civil engineering as well as economics. Balu and Ananthapadmanabhan were part of a unit of SAP constables deputed to Varkala police station a few days ago as part of providing additional police security for Varkala Sivagiri pilgrimage. District police authorities said that a probe is on to find the circumstances that led to the mishap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cop-drowns-during-hunt-for-pothencode-murder-suspect/articleshow/88364592.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He dismissed two petitions, by Jayesh Jhaveri and his son Abhimanyu, that challenged the July 30, 2021 order of the Senior Citizens Tribunal, Mumbai, that had ruled in Nirmala Jhaveri’s favour. Her application before the tribunal said that after her husband Dharmadas Jhaveri died on March 25, 2017, Jayesh, along with his wife Sonal, grandson Abhimanyu and his wife Apeksha, left their Garodia Nagar house and moved in with her. Jayesh pressurised her to transfer all assets to him and not give any share to her daughters. When she refused, Jayesh turned violent. She then left her own flat “without any belongings except two pairs of clothes” and went to stay with a daughter. But as Jayesh threatened his sisters with civil and criminal cases, she returned home so he would not disturb them. “In my opinion, this is a classic case where son Jayesh and grandson Abhimanyu have left no stone unturned to make (the) life of the grandmother a living hell,” said Justice Kulkarni, noting that Nirmala Jhaveri was constrained to take recourse to the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007. While Jayesh’s advocate said he was willing to vacate the flat, Justice Kulkarni noted, “It is difficult to believe the vehemence with which Abhimanyu, without a semblance of legal right, can take a position to oust the grandmother from the flat.” Abhimanyu relied on an October 29, 2013 purported will of his grandfather to assert that the flat was bequeathed to him. Justice Kulkarni noted that his grandmother is admittedly the owner of the flat, its share certificate stands in her name, the flat is continuously reflected in her income-tax returns as her asset, and she pays maintenance towards it. The grandmother said according to her husband’s will, only if she pre-deceased him would the assets go to Abhimanyu. She said Abhimanyu, along with other family members, is taking all possible steps to usurp all her properties worth about Rs 20 crore, including a bungalow at Deolali and land at Cotton Green. She said Jayesh was disowned by her husband by a June 11, 1985 public notice. Justice Kulkarni said Abhimanyu is asserting his right on a will which is not probated and “which are future rights to be asserted in a proper jurisdiction.” He said “the grandmother who is in desperate need of a shelter, i.e., her own house, and to be left free from torture caused to her by Jayesh and Abhimanyu, was justified in invoking the Act.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/harasser-son-and-grandson-must-leave-womans-flat-bombay-hc/articleshow/88365157.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Vijayawada||Chintapalle shivers at 6.1 degrees Celsius as winter sets in across Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: Dense fog disrupted vehicular traffic and affected normal life in many parts of Vizag Agency, including Chintapalle, Minumuluru, Araku Valley, Paderu, Pedabayalu, and Munchingiput, on Saturday morning as mercury levels dipped.  Authorities of Regional Agriculture Research Station (RARS) at Chintapalle in Vizag Agency said Chintapalle recorded a minimum temperature of 6.1 degrees Celsius on Saturday, the lowest so far in this winter season.  Vehicular movement from Chintapalle to GK Veedhi, Narsipatnam, Paderu and other areas in the region was hit due to poor visibility, locals said.  Not only the tribal pockets in Agency but also the urban pockets in the district witnessed cool weather conditions on Saturday. Temperature in Vizag city plummeted to 15.4 degree Celsius at the airport area, and dipped to 19.2 degree Celsius at Waltair, forcing the Vizagites to wear woollen garments to keep themselves warm. “Dip in mercury has brought cheers to the visitors in the tribal pockets. Tourists were seen huddling around bonfires in the morning,” said VR Padal, a resident of Chintapalle. “Majority of the locals preferred to stay indoors in the morning and came out only after 10 am due to fog,” he added.  Tiny tribal hamlets Lammasingi and Tajangi, and Yerravaram waterfall in Chintapalle mandal have been drawing tourists from parts of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana with their unique features like cool weather and dense fog during the winter season.  Officials of IMD-Amaravati said the minimum temperatures recorded in state on Saturday ranged between 13.4 and 20.6 degrees Celsius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/chintapalle-shivers-at-6-1-degrees-celsius-as-winter-sets-in-across-ap/articleshow/88363911.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: 2 ‘puppy killer’ monkeys caught||AURANGABAD: The forest department officials caught two monkeys on Saturday morning from the Laul village of Majalgaon in Beed district amidst reports of monkeys lifting the puppies and killing them. Animal activist Siddharth Sonawne had an explanation. He told TOI that monkeys usually groom each other, and eat bugs picked out of each other’s hair. “I feel the monkeys might just have been looking for bugs on the puppies. However, as they couldn’t have done this on the ground, they took the puppies to roofs and terraces that they feel are safe.” Local residents, however, feel the monkeys have been seeking revenge. They said that some stray dogs had earlier killed a baby monkey, and since then, the monkeys have been lifting the puppies. “These monkeys take the puppies to rooftops and terraces that are unused or inaccessible,” said Dattatray More, a village resident. In all of the cases the puppies died — they either starved or were allegedly thrown off the rooftops by the monkeys. As a result, the villagers started shooing away the monkeys. However, the monkeys too started behaving aggressively with humans. Over the past four months, at least 40 puppies have reportedly died. Initially, the monkeys used to take these puppies to the roof of a house belonging to a resident named Balasaheb Bhagat. “When we realised that the puppies were starving, we tried feeding them. However, the monkeys then shifted the puppies to another inaccessible roof in the village,” said Bhagat. Taking cognizance of the villagers’ demand to control the monkeys, the administration roped in the forest department. Accordingly, a trap was laid in the early hours of Saturday and two adult monkeys were nabbed. Forest department’s round officer D S More told TOI, “Our team, along with Majalgaon forest range personnel and local residents nabbed the monkeys. They were taken to the Gautala wildlife sanctuary in Aurangabad and released.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-puppy-killer-monkeys-caught/articleshow/88363136.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Nagpur||‘Conservation of language is biggest challenge for GenNext’||Manohar Mhaisalkar is a name synonymous with the Vidarbha Sahitya Sangh (VSS) for over four decades now. VSS, a 99-yr-old literary organization, represents Marathi literary activity in the entire central India region, and Mhaisalkar has been associated with it for the last 48 years, nearly 20 as its president. Mhaisalkar is neither an author nor a poet. Neither is he a literary critic nor an orator. He is a proud ‘vangmayin karyakarta’ – a literary activist in the words of Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Mahamandal which is the apex body of all Marathi literary organizations in the country. On Saturday, the Sahitya Mahamandal felicitated Mhaisalkar for being a dedicated literary activist throughout his life. Mhaisalkar, who has witnessed almost all and triggered many changes in Vidarbha’s Marathi literary scenario, spoke to TOI. Unlike his reticent nature, Mhaisalkar expressed his thoughts on the past, present and future of literature, culture and life of Marathi people. Excerpts from the interview... Q. How does it feel to be felicitated as a ‘literary activist’, a rare award category? A. It is rare but the only category I fit in. Never a writer, poet, critic or speaker, I always find myself associated with theatre, music, literature as an activist, and as a worker who stays behind curtains. I am lucky that the patron organization of all Marathi literary groups is felicitating me for being a literary worker. This is a big honour for me. I like reading books as well as reading people. I am not a public man, but I have good friends in all fields. While receiving this honour, I can recall the entire journey with Vidarbha Sahitya Sangh, all ups and downs and all good and bad experiences. Q. Are you referring to the days when you were criticized a lot for the reconstruction of the VSS building in Nagpur? A. That was the period when I received the worst criticism of my life. I believe that an organization like VSS with about 100 years of legacy deserves to have a building suitable to its status. With this in mind, we started working on the concept of the VSS Complex. The old building was to be demolished for it. The opposition began right then. The shopkeepers and vendors around made a union and filed suits in the court of law. I was confident that our plan was perfectly all right and hence I continued with our plan. Today, you can see a landmark complex at Jhansi Rani Square. We have a grand auditorium, library, art galleries, state of art offices and, also, many shops. I can proudly say that no other Marathi literary organization has such a grand complex to its name. The VSS complex has become a monument for Nagpur. Q. But you never answered your critics during all these years. Why? A. I knew that the situation would have worsened if I would have retaliated in the same language. Instead of answering them, I kept working. Unlike others in the field of literature, I had no desire to stay in limelight or to gain publicity, or awards or recognitions. My goal was clear. I am a worker and a worker always wants to complete the task. I completed most of the tasks for which I was destined. I am 89 years old now and I am happy. No regrets. Q. Literary activities and controversies go hand in hand. Your take? A. It’s unfortunate that controversies get media attention. But, there is a lot of constructive work going on in the literature field. Positive or normal developments hardly make news for people. Controversies have news value. But, while criticizing an organization like VSS, one should once think that why and how such organizations survived for a period like 100 years. Running an organization for 100 years is not a joke. Constructive criticism is always welcome, but positive sides should also get equal attention which is not happening at all these days. Q. But, don’t you think organizers of literary summits invite the controversy themselves by making mistakes? A. Here the literary workers have a role to play. Organizers of summits must be responsible people. Proper planning is a must. This year itself, at a literary summit held in Nashik, the selected president of the summit was not present due to health reasons. Organizers would have selected an author healthy enough to attend the entire summit. As the president himself was absent, critics got ready material to condemn it. Q. Do you believe the new generation lacks literary acumen? A. The new generation is sharp. We were not this clever when we were young. They have great abilities. But, we have failed to keep them attached to the mother tongue. It pains when children speak wrong Marathi, can’t read passages properly and can’t identify the numbers in Marathi. This really is a big challenge in front of literary workers like me. Conservation of language is the need of the hour. For the next 20 years, we must work only on this subject. Q. What according to you is going to be the future of Marathi literature in Vidarbha? A. Believe me, we have good writers, good poets and good critics too. We need good organizers, workers and literary activists. VSS can do it. We have one of Vidarbha’s richest libraries. We have a state-of-art auditorium, art galleries. This organization has all potential to provide food for thought to the young generation. During my tenure, VSS grew from 350 members to 8,000 members. We need more mass involvement in this organization in the future. We have good people. In the next few years, you will see VSS shouldering these big responsibilities very ably.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/conservation-of-language-is-biggest-challenge-for-gennext/articleshow/88363976.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Vijayawada||YSRC, TDP spar over OTS at VMC meet||Vijayawada: Tension prevailed at Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) council meet on Saturday after ruling YSRC and Opposition TDP argued with each other during a short discussion on ‘Jagan Anna Saswatha Boo Hakku’ (One-time settlement - OTS) scheme. TDP floor leader Nellibandla Balaswamy alleged the ruling party is harassing the residents of Vambay colony by demanding them to pay Rs 20,000 as OTS fees.  YSRC corporators objected to the charge and staged a protest demanding the TDP to withdraw the allegation.  Vijayawada central MLA Malladi Vishnu said the TDP, which ‘failed’ to provide houses to the poor, is staging ‘fake protests’ to gain sympathy. “TDP enjoyed the power right from that of Union minister to corporator during 2014-19, but it failed to develop the city. They collected Rs 65,000 from each resident of H Block of Vambay colony and failed to transfer rights to them. Altogether, 105 beneficiaries paid full amount and faced problems. TDP has a bad motive to create disturbance in the council hall,” Vishnu said. Amid ruckus, the council passed resolutions required for its day-to-day functioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ysrc-tdp-spar-over-ots-at-vmc-meet/articleshow/88363919.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Bareilly||PM coins ‘Upyogi’ to laud UP CM Yogi Adityanath, takes dig at opposition||BAREILLY: In a strong endorsement of UP CM Yogi Adityanath, PM Modi on Saturday gave a new term ‘UP+ Yogi=Upyogi (useful)’ to the election lexicon, to highlight the significance of Yogi for UP. "UP plus Yogi bahut hai upyogi (Uttar Pradesh plus Yogi have great utility)," he said, indicating that Adityanath would be the CM face of the party for the upcoming assembly elections. Modi made the comments during his address after launching the Rs 36,230cr, 594-km long six-lane Ganga e-way project in Shahjahanpur, pegged to be the longest in the country at 594 kilometres. The expressway will connect the eastern and western regions of Uttar Pradesh, from Meerut to Prayagraj and will be spread across 12 districts. It is set to be completed in 2024. “This expressway will bring new industries and create employment opportunities for thousands of youths. The day is not far when UP will be known as the most modern state in the country," the PM said in his 40-minute speech to a crowd which BJP leaders said was over one lakh-strong. Modi also took a dig at the opposition by saying, "You have seen how the money of the government was used by other parties. Today, it is being used by the government for development work. Earlier, these projects only started on paper so politicians filled their coffers. Today, these projects are ensuring that your money is saved and is in your pocket." His comments came a day after former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav's aides were subjected to raids by the income tax department and attacks by opposition leaders for undertaking various project launches before the polls. Continuing his swipe at the opposition, the PM said, “There are some political parties that have problems with the country's heritage and development. They have problems with heritage as they are worried about their vote banks. They have problems with development because the poor are becoming less dependent on them...truth is, they are not happy with the country's progress." The PM also lauded the Yogi government for the law-and-order situation in west UP. He said, "Before the BJP government took charge, there was a saying that one should return home before sunset because people who flashed kattas (country-made pistols) ruled the roads. This is not the case anymore.” He added that the fear of riots happening "anytime, anywhere" ceased to exist. He said the Yogi government had "bulldozed" the mafia in the state. Modi tried to connect with the crowd by starting his speech in the local dialect and said that he feels blessed after touching the soil of revolutionaries such as Ram Prasad Bismil, Thakur Roshan Singh, and Ashfaq Ullah Khan, the heroes of the Kakori incident. He also claimed that the government provided more than 30 lakh pakka (permanent) houses to the poor. He said the campaign will continue until all remaining entitled beneficiaries are covered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/upyogi-bahut-upyogi-pm-endorses-adityanath-for-another-term-inaugurates-ganga-e-way-project-countrys-longest/articleshow/88363968.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Pune||Buzz at bakeries for Christmas goodies||PUNE: With Christmas around the corner, popular bakeries dotting Camp are cynosure of all eyes. In a quiet lane, parallel to MG Road, customers crowd around Husseny Bakery for Christmas sweetmeats. “People have become more health conscious now. Demand for eggless cakes has gone up and we have introduced new varieties catering to the same. Last year, we partnered with online delivery services. But this year we are glad customers are coming to the bakery. Most of our regular customers are senior citizens, who were at greater risk last year before vaccination drives and all, but now we are glad we are getting to see them visit the bakery,” said Yusuf Mirdehghan, who took over the management of the shop from his father who opened the bakery in 1932. Less than a km away, all roads lead to Kayani Bakery. “The crowd is more or less like this throughout the year, though people purchase more during Christmas. We offer regular varieties, there are no variations. Dark chocolate muffins, mawa cake, madiera cake, choco-walnut cakes are popular favourites,” said the security guard stationed at the entrance. Mohit Kale, standing in line for over 30 minutes to get his fix of baked goods for the week, said, “We have guests at home visiting us from other cities for Christmas. They love the cakes and cookies from Pune so much that they have asked me to pick up some cakes so they can take it back with them,” he said. The oldest of all, Royal Bakery, founded in the early 1900s, has customers ordering plums cake in bulk. “Plum cake is tricky, some places make to too dry, some too fudgy. Royal bakery gets it just right. We pick up plum cakes in bulk to gift to family and friends during Christmas,” said Dina Bakhtayar. Further from the cluster of bakeries in Camp, another popular destination to get a fix of Christmas goodies is Diamond Bakery in Fatima Nagar. “We have introduced mini varieties of plum and fruit cakes, and a range of Christmas special chocolates in different shapes and sizes,” said an employee at the bakery. For diabetics & petsWhile your regular bakery might not offer sugar-free, gluten-free or dairy-free varieties of festive treats, home bakers and other confectioners specialise in such preparations. Megha Agarwal, founder, Bake Pure, a cloud confectionery, said, “We are offering individual cakes as well as gift boxes consisting of cookies, chocolates, brownies and cakes made without any refined ingredients such as maida or sugar. The goodies are made with wheat, jaggery and do not contain any alcohol. However, this is not suitable for diabetics, for who we offer sugar-free cakes. We also offer vegan and gluten-free varieties of plum cakes.” AIKA Delicacies in Koregaon Park offers a range of diabetic-friendly treats, such as red velvet cake, chocolate-walnut cake, among others, with no premixes, sugar, or preservatives, and chocolates low on carbs. “Moderation is key for diabetics. While sugar-free cakes are best suited for people with this condition, we still have to maintain moderation while cutting a slice for ourselves,” said a customer. You can also include your pet in the festive binging with a rage of pet-friendly goodies. Sonal Zalkikar, founder, Petfeast, said, “We offer a Christmas cake substituting it with pet-friendly ingredients such as dried strawberries, apples, bananas, carrots and coconut cookies in various Christmas-themed shapes, meat loafs and special festive meals, which are lamb-based, and liver pudding for dessert.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/buzz-at-bakeries-for-christmas-goodies/articleshow/88364587.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The man stabbed the woman and set her on fire before commiting suicide. The attacker, Nandakumar (28) son of Mohanan, Valiyamadathil (H), Thikkodi, sustained 70% burns and was undergoing treatment at Kozhikode medical college hospital. He succumbed to his injuries at around 1:30am on Saturday. Nandakumar had stabbed the woman before pouring petrol on her and setting her afire at around 10am near Thikkodi grama panchayat office on Friday. The woman, Krishnapriya (22), daughter of Manoj, Kaattuvayalil (H), Thikkodi, had sustained over 90% burns and succumbed to her injuries by Friday evening. Payyoli police completed the postmortem proceedings and handed over the bodies to the relatives of the deceased persons by Saturday afternoon. Police had altered the FIR registered for attempted murder to murder late on Friday. “The accused admitted the crime while he was being taken to the hospital. However, we were unable to get the woman’s version. It seems like some friction in their relationship led to the attack. However, we have not received any evidence to confirm this. Since, the accused is also dead, we will file a report on the incident in court after an investigation,” said a senior officer with Payyoli police. The woman was a temporary staff at the panchayat office and the man was waiting for her with a bottle of petrol and a knife near the office. He spoke with her next to a tree near the office and suddenly stabbed her. He then poured petrol on her and set her afire. The man also poured the remaining petrol on himself soon after the crime. The woman had joined the panchayat as a project assistant on temporary basis only on December 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/youth-who-set-woman-afire-succumbs-to-injuries/articleshow/88364607.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Ranaut’s lawyer Rizwan Siddiquee said he was not surprised with the order. “The same court had earlier held that the Andheri Metropolitan Magistrate was not biased in his approach, therefore we were least expecting anything different in today's order concerning my clients serious cognizable criminal complaint against Mr Javed Akhtar, for the offence of extortion and insult to her modesty,” Siddiquee said. He added that he will challenge the order before the sessions court. On Friday, Ranaut moved the sessions court challenging the Esplanade court’s order rejecting her plea for transfer of Akhtar’s defamation complaint against her to another court. Citing bias, Ranaut had earlier said that she had lost faith in the Andheri metropolitan magistrate court that is hearing the defamation case. However, in October the additional chief metropolitan magistrate at Esplanade court dismissed her plea for the transfer. Ranaut’s revision application submitted before the Dindoshi sessions court said that the Esplanade court had failed to appreciate that the magistrate hearing the defamation case had grossly misused his power to cause intentional injury to her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-rejects-ranauts-plea-for-different-magistrate/articleshow/88365183.cms||---

---||Goa||Navy’s stealth warship begins sea trials on Goa Liberation Day||PANAJI: The Indian Navy conducted the maiden sea trials for ‘Mormugao’, the second indigenous stealth destroyer of the P15B class on Sunday, coinciding with the 60th anniversary of Goa’s Liberation Day. Built by Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd (MDSL), the ship has been named after the port town in Goa. The Mormugao was launched in September 2016 when the late Manohar Parrikar was the defence minister. The Indian Navy plans to commission the stealth destroyer in mid-2022 when it will be known as INS Mormugao. “Mormugao, Indian Navy’s second indigenous stealth destroyer of the P15B class planned to be commissioned in mid 2022, proceeded on her maiden sea sortie today. December 19 is perhaps the most befitting date for the ship to put to sea as today the nation celebrates 60 years of Goa’s liberation from Portuguese rule,” said the Indian Navy in a statement. Mormugao will add significantly to the Indian Navy’s combat capabilities. The sea trials come less than a month after the recent commissioning of INS Visakhapatnam, the first of the P15B contract. The fourth P75 submarine INS Vela was also commissioned in November and starting sea trials of Mormugao is testimony to the cutting-edge capabilities of MDSL, the statement read. “The Indian Navy played a pivotal role in the Liberation and dedicating the ship’s name to the maritime state of Goa will not just enhance the bond between the Indian Navy and the people of Goa, but also link the ship’s identity permanently to the crucial role the Navy played in nation-building,” the Navy said. The contract for four 15B ships at a cost of Rs29,700 crore was signed on January 2011. Mormugao has a displacement of 7,300 tonne with a maximum speed of 32 knots. The warship is equipped with surface- to-surface missiles, surface-to-air missiles and anti-submarine rocket launchers. It is also capable of carrying two anti-submarine warfare helicopters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/navys-stealth-warship-begins-sea-trials-on-l-day/articleshow/88379403.cms||---

Security protocols for VVIPs may also be revised based on the findings, he said. The Mi-17V-5 helicopter of the IAF which was ferrying the chief of defence staff Gen Rawat and the others from the Sullur air base crashed on its way to the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington, in Tamil Nadu on December 8. The investigation team will also question a group of people who took a video of the helicopter before it crashed, he said in answer to a question at the Air Force Academy (AFA), Dundigal. At the combined graduate parade at the AFA, the IAF chief expressed grief over the incident and said he would not like to pre-empt the findings of the court of enquiry. "It is a thorough process. It is a mandate given to investigate every single angle and look into every single aspect of what could have gone wrong and come out with recommendations and findings," he said.

The sighting has raised concern among residents, said authorities who have now intensified patrolling and set up cameras to trap its movement. Activists said there was no reason for panic. The first sighting was by security staff of a company in Vartak Nagar who saw it dash past the main gate early on Wednesday. “The CCTV footage shows the guard going towards the gate only to return terrified after spotting the leopard outside... Another camera up in the vicinity also showed the cat movement,” said Rakesh Bhoir, additional range forest officer, Thane. The following morning, the leopard was spotted in the premises of a neighbouring residential complex. “The animal ventured into our complex and entered the lobby and was barely few metres away from where our security guard was seated. Our watchman froze on suddenly seeing the wild animal. Luckily, the leopard heard some noise and scampered away in the dark not to be seen again,” said a building resident while talking to TOI. The third spotting was by a Bhim Nagar slum resident late on Thursday after which police and forest teams with Rohit Mohite, forest warden, and activist Nitesh Pancholi scoured the area till Friday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/wild-cat-on-the-prowl-in-thane-for-past-3-nights/articleshow/88346708.cms||Manoj Badgeri

---||Nagpur||Cannot dismiss Omicron as causing mild infection: Experts||Nagpur: Experts from the medical fraternity feel novel coronavirus variant Omicron may have been projected as mild as of now but there should be no complacency, especially in case of patients with multiple comorbidities having immunocompromised conditions and those unvaccinated. With the management protocol being the same as that for other variants, experts advised that among observing other parameters, checking SPO2 or oxygen level for any drop below 94% holds the key to ensure patients don’t slip into the danger zone. Dr Prashant Joshi, head of the department of medicine, AIIMS-Nagpur, said that Omicron cannot be taken lightly at all owing to its high transmissibility and doubling rate of two to three days. “It is spreading rapidly at an unprecedented rate,” he said. Dr Joshi pointed out that Omicron has already been reported in 77 countries and is responsible for nearly 60% of Covid infections in UK with an anticipated surge in January. “We also cannot dismiss Omicron as mild since the sheer number of predicted cases may overwhelm the health system,” said Dr Joshi. As per Dr Joshi, the first Omicron patient of city was closely observed for any symptom, his vital signs and SPO2 were regularly checked, especially after the six minute walk test. Experts say Omicron may escape immunity due to vaccine or previous infection because of large number of mutations especially in the spike protein. “Though supporting data is still awaited, there are possibilities that it may be evade immunity. If and when cases increases, more data will be available on the variant in the next three to four weeks to predict its virulence,” he said adding that inhaled steroids (Budesonide) may be given to protect the lungs in case there is persistent cough or fever for more than five days. “Oxygen supply should start for patients whose SPO2 drops below 94%. They be given systematic steroids, low molecular weight Heparin and Remdesivir. Tocilizumab can be given in subset of severe cases of Covid in ICU requiring high flow oxygen,” said Dr Joshi. Prof Dr Meena Mishra, HoD (microbiology), AIIMS, said it’s too early to predict but the variant may not behave the same for different patients. “The virus may be mild for one person but may behave differently, especially in case of comorbidities,” she said. Dr Mishra also said that sufficient data is not available regarding vaccine efficacy or inefficacy for Omicron. “The immune escape mechanism could result in vaccine being ineffective. Also, data on how immunocompromised patients may respond is not clear,” said Dr Mishra adding WHO too has advised not to take this variant lightly. “Covid appropriate behaviour and vaccination are the keys,” she said. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said there is no way Omicron can be taken lightly as there is no guarantee that the virus will behave in the same manner in India like elsewhere. “It’s already fourth wave abroad but we have seen only two waves so far which should not be forgotten,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cannot-dismiss-omicron-as-causing-mild-infection-experts/articleshow/88363994.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||Ramdas Kadam calls Anil Parab a ‘traitor’ out to finish Shiv Sena||Mumbai: Infighting between Shiv Sena leaders came out in the open on Saturday, as senior leader Ramdas Kadam called transport minister Anil Parab a ‘traitor’. Kadam alleged that Parab and Uday Samant, minister for higher and technical education, were finishing the party in the Konkan by colluding with the NCP. While Parab is the guardian minister of Ratnagiri, Samant is the guardian minister of Sindhudurg district. “There was a so-called clip with my voice but even in that I didn’t say anything against the Shiv Sena. I did not meet BJP’s Kirit Somaiya nor did I give him any documents. I had explained all this to Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and clarified in a letter. Talking about Anil Parab’s hotel doesn’t mean that I’m talking against the party. Just because their hotel is being demolished, they are trying to finish off a leader’s career permanently,” Kadam said. “Anil Parab has supported those from the MNS. They sidelined the local MLA, my son Yogesh. Who is the traitor? After becoming a minister he is betraying the party. And then he is blaming us. I’m not the traitor, Anil Parab is the traitor. He is giving away Sena’s seats and constituencies in local bodies (in Ratnagiri) to the NCP,” Kadam said. In response, Parab said, “I will not respond to the allegations. I am a loyal Shiv Sainik and the party will take appropriate cognisance of the issue.” Kadam said that he would always remain a Shiv Sainik and would never quit the party. “I urge Uddhavji to look into this and get them to fall in line,” he said. Kadam was a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Council (MLC) from Mumbai but was not re-elected after his term ended this year following the rift with Parab. He was a cabinet minister in the earlier BJP-Sena government, but has been sidelined in the present MVA government. Kadam’s son Yogesh is an MLA from Dapoli in Ratnagiri district. In October, a series of audio clips of conversations between Kadam and one of his associates had gone viral. In them, Kadam is heard expressing happiness, reportedly after the action taken by various authorities against alleged illegal construction on land owned by Parab in Ratnagiri and Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kadam-calls-parab-a-traitor-out-to-finish-shiv-sena/articleshow/88365189.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

She said the regressive mindset of those who object to the move should be identified. In the current circumstances, most of the girls wish to get married only after getting a job and completing a degree course at least. For this reason, the Narendra Modi government’s decision to enhance the minimum age for marriage for women would be a solace to girls, she said. “Considering the increasing infant mortality rate, vitamin deficiency in mothers and babies, health issues faced by girls who become mothers at a very young age and the high number of girls who fall into traps at a young age, the decision to raise the marriageable age of girls would help them more to lead a life with more self-respect,” the Mahila Morcha leader said. The response of the Morcha leader came at a time when IUML, CPM, and Congress have alleged dubious motives behind the move and hence opposed the same. Meanwhile, opposition leader V D Satheesan said in Kochi on Saturday that since the decision to raise the age of marriage for women was taken by the Union government and it being a national issue, the national leadership of the Congress would take a stand on it. “The party leadership has sought the state leaders’ opinion on the issue,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/centres-move-will-empower-women/articleshow/88364622.cms||---

Manisha’s brother is a practising doctor. He said: “My sister was a fighter, she was preparing for the police sub-inspector examination scheduled for Sunday.” He added: “Manisha had already taken training twice in Junagadh for armed and unarmed police units.” Vaghela said: “When Manisha married she had just completed her Class X and thereafter she not only finished graduation but also earned the LLB degree.” He said that Manisha’s son Mayur, 15, was with him when they reached her residence at Karmabhoomi Row House in Khokhra and discovered the body. He said that her husband Vijaysinh Jadeja was at Civil Hospital at the time attending to his relative. “Our communication was always strong. If she was too busy to take my call, she would get back to me later in the day,” Vaghela said. “But on that fateful day, when I called her, she never responded. She did not call back either.” He added: “Hence on Friday I decided to meet her. When Mayur and I reached her house, we found her hanging from a ceiling fan.” Vaghela said that he is waiting for the postmortem examination report. He said that when he found her body, everything in the house was in perfect order. Her mobiles were lying on the bed and hence a robbery attempt was probably ruled out, he said. Vaghela said that he was the first person to find the dead body of Manisha. He said her legs were bent from the knees. “From the position we found her in, it seems that the fan was within her reach,” Vaghela said. “It appears to me she could not have hanged herself from that position.” He went on to say: “Police need to investigate the death thoroughly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/murder-not-suicide-she-team-members-brother/articleshow/88364620.cms||---

In the meantime, the UK-returned 40-year-old woman and her daughter (9) were discharged from the hospital after testing negative. The mother-daughter duo left for Mumbai and flew back to London on Saturday. The duo’s genome sequencing report was negative, officials said. The UK-returned woman’s husband too had tested positive in Mumbai from where they returned. The Spain-returned woman, a resident of Telecom Nagar in Khamla, said she didn’t have any symptoms till date and was surprised to have tested positive only at Nagpur. “I tested negative on December 5 and took a Madrid-Frankfurt-Delhi flight. I landed in Delhi on December 7 and tested negative in rapid RT-PCR. They allowed me to travel to Nagpur,” she said. Civic officials visited her home and asked to take another RT-PCR test on December 11 while she was following seven-day home quarantine as per norms. “On December 13, I was a bit shocked to know that the report was positive. They asked me to move to MLA hostel or AIIMS Nagpur,” she said. The woman, who is fully vaccinated, had been part of a sporting event in Spain. She was among over 150 other sportsperson from the country who returned to India on December 7. “All of them have tested negative in their respective cities. None in our WhatsApp group has so far informed about testing positive,” she said. AIIMS officials said she is asymptomatic but still needs to be hospitalized till her genome sequencing report is received. In case this report is negative for Omicron variant, she will be tested on the 10th day of infection. Her RT-PCR report of December 22 needs to be negative to qualify for discharge as per the norms for international flyers. Arvind Patre (45), a resident of Dighori, is the only official Omicron confirmed patient of the city .

School students and adults arrived several hours in advance to stand in line and await the arrival of the Prime Minister. In their excitement to see the Prime Minister, social distancing went for a toss as everyone tried to crane their neck for a view of the PM. Many people were also excited to watch the fly past and the sail parade organised to showcase Goa’s maritime sector. People, including school children, arrived well before 12.30pm and waited for a good two hours for the Prime Minister to arrive and the function to start. Security personnel had thrown a tight cordon around the venue, preventing vehicles and people from moving about an hour before the Prime Minister’s arrival. Government schools and colleges were asked to send students for the event, while BJP also organised buses to ferry locals from various villages. The audience was served refreshments at the end of the event. Modi spent around 25 minutes at the venue and waved to the crowd before departing. Much to the delight of the gathering, the Indian Navy conducted two flypasts and as expected, the MiG 29K fighter jets from the Black Panther squadron was the cynosure of all eyes. During the sail parade there were 24 different types of sail boats along with 19 motorised boats. Goa Shipyard also displayed its high altitude high speed patrol boat. The Indian Army has ordered 12 of the vessels for patrolling the lakes along the Indo-China border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/throngs-gather-at-miramar-beach-to-see-pm-flypast/articleshow/88379412.cms||Newton Sequeira

Police have confirmed his connection to three other similar fires reported in the district recently and have recorded his arrest in these cases. However, his arrest was yet to be recorded in the Vadakara taluk office fire case. The suspect has been identified as Satheesh Narayanan of Andhra Pradesh. Kozhikode rural SP Sreenivas A said that they have found links between the person and the Friday’s fire at taluk office as well, but his arrest would be recorded in this case only after conducting sufficient inquiries. His arrest was recorded in the cases registered for fires at City Center building, office of special tahsildar (land acquisition) and at the bathroom of the district education office (DEO). Vadakara taluk office was gutted after a major fire broke out in the old building at 5.30am on Friday, destroying thousands of government files and land documents. “A comprehensive inquiry is going on into the fourth case registered for the fire at the taluk office. Reports must be collected from the fire force and KSEB. Reports of fingerprint and scientific analysis are also awaited,” said the SP adding that a simulation exercise to recreate the burning and scribbling on the wall would be held as well. He added that the man had scribbled on the wall a message asking to follow him on Facebook and Instagram and hence his social media presence was also under investigation. Police have identified a relative of the Andhra native and inquiry in this regard was also being held. The SP said a psychiatric counseling and evaluation of the Andhra native will also be held. “The man is speaking incoherently at times…Another challenge is that he is speaking a mixture of Telugu, Tamil, Hindi, and English,” said the rural SP. Police sources added that the man had admitted to starting all four fires to kill insects and to keep warm but this claim was being verified. Police added that the man had also written the names of south Indian film actresses in Telugu on the walls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/police-take-ap-native-in-custody/articleshow/88364635.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The couple resorted to the extreme step over a land dispute case. The couple — Mashamoni Ilaiah (34) and wife Anuradha — were later counselled by cops and let off. They came to Pragati Bhavan and poured fuel on themselves at 10.30 am before trying to torch themselves. Alert cops foiled their bid. The couple along with their three children were later shifted to Panjagutta police station. The couple complained to cops they were fed up with revenue authorities’ inaction on their five-acre land at Nadargul village in Rangareddy district. Meanwhile, Ibrahimpatnam tahsildar clarified that Ilaiah’s name was not reflecting in the land records, including pattadar column and possession column. He said Ilaiah’s father Venkaiah was first allotted a five-acre plot in survey No. 58 in Ibrahimpatnam in 1979 and subsequently, it was cancelled. The land was later allotted to Muthyala Sri Ramulu. “The land was acquired for National Security Guards, which belonged to Sri Ramulu in Ibrahimpatnam Bhagayat village. Later, three others — Middela Vijay Kumar, M Anil Kumar and M Sunil Kumar — got Bhoodan patta certificate in 1998 on five acres in the village,” he said. Compensation was awarded in the names of Anil, Vijay and Sunil in 2010 after it was taken away for setting up the regional centre of NSG, the tahsildar said.

---||Nagpur||Pande, a surprise winner, is new HCBA prez, Jaltare secy||Nagpur: Upsetting two powerful groups, Atul Pande emerged triumphant in the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) polls on Saturday. Amol Jaltare expectedly clinched the fight for the post of secretary in the keenly-contested election. The election was marred by over-enthusiastic lawyers playing sandal (traditional band) in front of Nagpur bench of high court’s premises despite it being a silence zone and in brazen violation of norms. It continued for about 10-15 minutes right in front of the HC’s main gate till some seniors intervened. Pamphlets were strewn all over the premises. Despite the HC premises having a full-fledged police kiosk, constables posted there were mute spectators. Even Covid-19 norms were not followed by many lawyers who were seen without masks and physical distancing. HC secretary Sanjay Bharuka told TOI that he had instructed police to keep a strict watch and give information if any band is played in the silence zone. Some lawyers who witnessed the band raised questions on how the law keepers brazenly violated the norms and demanded strict action against them. They pointed out that in 2010 polls, liquor was openly distributed and consumed by lawyers right inside the court’s premises. Crackers were burst, slogans shouted and dancing happened inside the court area. Though the judiciary had taken cognizance and reprimanded HCBA office-bearers that time, no action was taken against the errant lawyers. Along with Pande and Jaltare, Pankaj Tidke and Sharad Bhattad were elected as vice-presidents, while PS Chawhan was elected joint secretary. Gaurav Lakhe won the fight for treasurer while VS Oberoi was elected as library in-charge. Of the 1,512 votes polled, 11 were found to be invalid. This time a completely new team of office-bearers would take up the HCBA’s mantle for the next three years. Pande’s victory was a surprise for those hailing from the powerful groups, including those backed by Manohar family and Shreerang Bhandarkar. Earlier, it was expected that there would be a tough fight between Sameer Sohoni and Shridhar Purohit, but Pande scraped through by 78 votes surprising the biggies. Pande’s victory was “not a surprise” for his friends. “The legacy set by former District Bar Association (DBA) president late Sudeep Jaiswal helped Pande win. He has consistently raised problems faced by the young members of the bar for the last one and half years. The insipid attitude of current HCBA office-bearers, after the elevation of Justice Anil Kilor, had led to severe resentment among the lawyers. Selection of nine members for the judges’ post from Aurangabad and none from Nagpur speaks about HCBA’s working,” Ravi Sanyal told TOI. Pande told TOI that he would continue the works started by the earlier executive body. “We will try to accommodate all the members in bar rooms. We will also try to provide a hygienic atmosphere. We will make efforts to solve problems of young lawyers and restart study circle programmes that were stopped due to the Covid-19 pandemic.” Jaltare told TOI that they would carry forward the Nyaydoot project and improvise it. “We will ensure that the junior lawyers get full guidance in all respects. Expediting the annex building project would be the priority.

While arranging an adequate number of cabs on their platform is the primary responsibility of cab service providers, we remain committed to passenger convenience and have taken up issues with both the service operators,” it said in a statement. “In parallel, to ensure availability of adequate cabs for passengers, three more cab service operators — CHOIS, 4 Wheels and Quick Ride have been facilitated to operate from the airport. In the past few days, the number of frequencies of Pushpak bus services to the airport have also increased...” GHIAL said..” TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/use-other-cab-services-rgia/articleshow/88364851.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After 45 years in transit camp, senior citizen grateful to return home at last||MUMBAI: While the former residents of a Currey Road chawl are relieved to return to their home in a redeveloped high-rise after living in a transit camp for 45 years, they remain bitter about the delay. “Mhada purposely delayed giving us possession,’’ Suryakant Raut (74) told TOI. He was 28 years old when he handed over possession of his room in September 1976 at the erstwhile Haji Kasam Chawl, and shifted to the Kannamwar Nagar transit camp in Vikhroli. Raut lives there with his wife Sugandha (69), two sons and their families. Raut said he engaged in detailed correspondence with the authorities, in vain. Sugandha added that even after submitting original documents, they were not given their permanent house. “Transit camp was supposed to be a temporary residence, but the wait for a permanent home took so long,’’ said Raut, adding that it took a toll on their health and well-being. “Aamchi manastithi bari nahin (We are not in the right state of mind),” he said in Marathi. Raut said he and his wife do not keep good health. He underwent an angioplasty 23 years ago. “I am unable to walk. I get breathless,’’ he added.  The senior citizen said the years passed by waiting hopefully in the transit camp. “I don’t want to talk about it,” he said bitterly. But he was thankful to Justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar, who passed the order on Friday directing Mhada to hand over possession by 3pm on Saturday . “Pushkal abhar maanto. Tyanni changla kaam kela (We are very grateful. They did a good job),” he added. He also said he was to receive the keys of the flat from the estate officer.  The couple are anxious about staying on the twenty-third floor. “What if something happens? What if the lift stops?” Raut asked. Sugandha said she had expected to get a flat allotted on the tenth or twelfth floor, and not on the twenty-third floor.  “45 years later they gave us a place on the twenty-third floor. Because of the harassment, we accepted it. We want to live our remaining years peacefully. We don’t want to get into any trouble,’’ she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-45-yrs-in-transit-camp-sr-grateful-to-return-home-at-last/articleshow/88365205.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Officials seized 220 fake education certificates, which include 63 Telangana University B Com degree and connected certificates, 130 Andhra University B Tech and connected certificates and 27 Intermediate certificates of Maharashtra Intermediate Board. Four different cases were registered against the accused. The accused Syed Naveed, who runs an overseas education consultancy, and his employee Syed Owai Ali, a DTP operator, were nabbed after police conducted a raid at their office in Basheerbagh. Naveed set up a business of visa processing and other related works. “Since his earnings were insufficient, he hatched a plan to prepare fake certificates and documents like fake salary slips, medical fitness certificates, job offer and relieving letters. He was collecting ₹50,000 to ₹75,000 for his services,” Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar said during a press meet. “The accused scans original certificates of candidates to prepare fake certificates. He then edits the name and roll numbers using a software in his computers. He edits these columns depending to the customers’ requirement and delivers the fake education certificate,” police said. Using these certificates, police suspect that some candidates might have gone abroad and others might have used it for obtaining promotions in their jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fake-certificate-racket-busted-two-arrested/articleshow/88364864.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Hotels, shops in Kolhapur shut over video from Bengaluru||KOLHAPUR/BENGALURU: Shops and hotels owned by Kannada-speaking people in Kolhapur were shut on Saturday, while vehicles with Karnataka registration plates faced hurdles over the desecration of a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Bengaluru. On Friday night, a video of the desecration circulated widely on social media, leading to the protests in parts of Maharashtra, including Pune. On Saturday, black ink was thrown on Karnataka-registered vehicles on the Pune-Bengaluru National Highway. In Miraj city of Sangli district, vehicles with Karnataka registration plates were vandalised and stones were pelted at two Karnataka state buses. In Pune, members of various political parties and other organisations protested against the incident. Members of an organisation halted buses heading towards Karnataka from Pune and painted images of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on the vehicles at Shirur. Similarly, members of a political party held an agitation against Karnataka government at Swargate. Rajya Sabha MP Sambhaji Raje Chhatrapati said, “The desecration of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s statue is highly condemnable. The Centre and the Karnataka government should take serious action against the culprits.” Kolhapur district head of Shiv Sena Sanjay Pawar said, “This won’t be accepted. The culprits should be punished immediately. Otherwise, the intensity of our agitation will increase.” In the meantime, the Bengaluru police have launched a manhunt for people involved in desecration of the statue at Bashyam Circle in Sadashivanagar on Friday night. The incident came to light on Saturday morning after passersby alerted the police, who cleaned the statue and deployed additional personnel to thwart any backlash. The police registered an FIR based on a complaint by the members of the Karnataka Maratha Welfare Association (KMWA). The police have invoked different sections of the Indian Penal Code including 153-A (promoting disharmony, enmity or hatred between different groups on the grounds of religion, language or race) and 427 (causing damage to public property) against unidentified people. Deputy commissioner of police Bengaluru (Central) M N Anuchet said, “This particular statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is located inside the park near the lake. Miscreants had sneaked into the park at night and smeared the paint.” Another senior officer said all the jurisdictional DCPs in Bengaluru have been alerted to keep vigil on the statues in their areas. “Also, more police personnel have been deployed at the KSRTC bus terminal, where buses from Maharashtra arrive and depart,” he said. The incident comes amid rising tension in Belagavi district, which is on the Maharashtra-Karnataka border, and burning of a Kannada flag in Kolhapur on December 15. On Friday morning, the Kannada activist also burned a flag at Chitradurga.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/hotels-shops-in-kolhapur-shut-over-video-from-bengaluru/articleshow/88363229.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Row brews over auction of SUV at Guruvayur||THRISSUR: The auction of the SUV Mahindra Thar donated to Guruvayur Sree Krishna Temple as an offering has triggered a controversy. The vehicle was auctioned to Amal Muhammed Ali from Kochi at a price of Rs 15,10,000, on Saturday. Subhash Panikker from Guruvayur participated in the auction on behalf of Muhammed Ali, who is a NRI businessman, based in Bahrain. Interestingly, Panikker was the only participant in the auction bid. The devaswom had fixed Rs 15 lakh as the base price of the vehicle, which was offered to the temple by the Mahindra Group. Since the devaswom had decided that the starting auction amount should be at least Rs 10,000, higher than the base price, he offered Rs 15,10,000 and since no one else joined as competitor, the auction was fixed at Rs 15,10,000. However, later Subhash reportedly told the media that he was prepared to go up to Rs 25 lakh to buy the vehicle in the auction. On hearing this the devaswom chairman, K B Mohandas, said the devaswom may now face allegations that it has auctioned off the vehicle at Rs 15,10,000 when the participant himself had come prepared to the auction for a higher price. Panikker, however, said it was wrong to review an auction fixed after the process, and will legally challenge, if such a review takes place. Devaswom administrator Vinayan said the devaswom managing committee will take a final decision on proceeding with the auction results. The committee is meeting on December 21. The devaswom sources, however, said the vehicle was likely to be handed over to the winner of Saturday’s auction. The chairman said the auction price was reasonable, and the auctioneer will have to pay GST also in addition to the auction amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/row-brews-over-auction-of-suv-at-guruvayur/articleshow/88364647.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Bareilly||UK passport holder who tested +ve for Delta flies out of India after securing -ve report from pvt lab||Bareilly: A British passport holder who arrived in Bareilly on November 24 tested Covid positive but managed to fly out of the country on December 4 after securing a negative report from a private lab. Bareilly health department has ordered a probe against the second lab. SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan told TOI, “We will take action once a complaint is lodged by the health department. We will also investigate the matter at our level.” The first sample of the man, who was born in Bareilly and works in the UK, was collected on December 3 and the Covid positive report arrived the same night. According to the second lab’s records, the RT-PCR was collected at 9am on December 4 and the report was out by 11am. He then left for Delhi and boarded the flight at 4pm. On December 6, his swab collected by the first lab was sent to Lucknow for further investigation and the report said he was Covid positive with cycle threshold (CT) value of 28. According to the ICMR, a patient is considered Covid positive if CT value is below 35. Dr Anurag Gautam, nodal officer for Covid in Bareilly, told TOI, “His father told us that he arrived in India on November 24 and then went to Gurgaon for some official work and returned to Bareilly on November 26.” “This man’s first swab sample was sent to Lucknow for genome sequencing, which confirmed he was infected with the Delta variant of Covid. We are verifying the credibility of the second report. A notice seeking explanation has been served on the second lab. The details have been shared with senior officials for further action,” said Dr Gautam. TOI contacted both the labs but they refused to comment. Bareilly’s chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Balveer Singh told TOI, “We are investigating whether protocols were violated by the man. We have forwarded this information to the district magistrate and an enquiry has been initiated against the second lab. Appropriate action will be taken if anyone is found guilty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/uk-passport-holder-who-tested-ve-for-delta-flies-out-of-india-after-securing-ve-report-from-pvt-lab/articleshow/88364031.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Omicron ruled out in one international flyer, 67 city samples||Nagpur: In an assuring development for the city, genome sequencing has revealed the presence of only Delta and Delta sub-lineages as the dominant variant in Nagpur so far. The study by CSIR-Neeri’s environmental virology cell has ruled out Omicron variant (B1.1.529) in any of the 68 samples. The Delta variant (B1.617.2), declared variant of concern, was found to be behind acceleration in cases during the second wave which began from Nagpur and Amravati in March this year. Though the variant caused severe Covid disease then, now patients remain mild. The city’s only officially documented Omicron positive patient is now discharged. As per Pune-based NIV’s report, the patient was found Omicron-like yet officials have counted him as Omicron positive. The 68 samples belong to Covid patients, including one international flyer, who tested positive between November-end and December 18. All the 68 samples belong to vaccinated patients. Another 35 samples from the same period are under process, said Dr Krishna Khairnar, head of the cell. As per civic officials, among the 35 samples, 17 persons are vaccinated and 18 unvaccinated. The environmental virology cell has now performed genome sequencing of 852 samples since October 2020. “Of the 68 samples, 11 were taken from close contacts of the international passenger. All of them were Delta positive. The samples were processed in a week by CSIR-Neeri in collaboration with CCMB Hyderabad. The study shows that Delta is still the dominant variant in Nagpur,” said Dr Khairnar. The scientist cautioned that the threat of Omicron is serious. “If Covid-apt behaviour is not followed, then it is a matter of time that Omicron may replace Delta as the dominant strain,” he said. On whether a sample size of 68 was enough to rule out any other variant, Dr Khairnar said, “We are in the best position to say this. At one time, only 5% of total samples were studied. Now, since positivity is low, we are sequencing samples of all daily Covid patients. Nagpur is the only city which is sequencing all positive samples,” he said. He reiterated that amid the threat of various variants, the best defence against the virus is SMS (sanitising, masks and physical distancing). “It will remain effective during the pandemic,” he said. The cell has been sequencing all daily Covid positive samples from Nagpur since June. However, the cell has been involved in SARS-COV-2 sequencing of Nagpur samples since October 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/omicron-ruled-out-in-one-international-flyer-67-city-samples/articleshow/88364039.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

She approached the office of District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) at the collector office on Thursday. A 21-year-old fourth year engineering student, whose father had died in April during the peak of second wave, also looked anxious. More than 5,000 applications have been filed so far, an official at collector office said. NMC health teams are scrutinizing the applications filed from city while Zilla Parishad health officials are verifying the ones coming from the rural before they are sent to the collector office for final review and disbursement. “My father was a watchman and only earning member of the family. After his death due to Covid, our family is in dire strait,” said the girl who had come to the collector’s office after facing technical snag while filing the complaint. District collector R Vimala on Thursday formed a taluka-level team that will visit door-to-door asking the nearest kin of Covid victims to file application for the Rs50,000 compensation announced by the state government. The teams headed by tehsildar would comprise the talathis, Asha workers, health and other revenue department personnel at the grass roots or village levels. The teams will visit residences of Covid victims as per the official records of the health department. District health officer (DHO) has been made nodal officer. District disaster management officer Ankush Gawande is coordinating the process between different agencies for quick disbursals. Collector has asked the team to extend personal assistance to families of Covid victims who are not being able to file online complaints. Earlier, Vimala had urged managements of Setu outlets in rural and Apple Sarkar centres to help in online applications. Sources from the collector’s office stated that an eight-member team headed by collector will screen the applications. “A grievance redressal cell has been also formed to deal with complaints,” said an official. “The victim’s nearest kin must file an application through the website mahacovid19relief.in attaching death certificate, proof of Covid death, no-objection certificate from the family, bank details and identification proofs among others,” said the official adding the procedures and filing has been kept as simple as possible. Under the supervision of Vimala, DDMA have also released a video made to explain the procedure of filing the applications with details of the website. Many applicants experiencing technical snag while filing the applications are making a beeline at the collector office. An official said the process has been launched recently and still evolving through modifications and improvements. “The applicants must wait for some time to see whether they are receiving any response or else approach the grievance complaint cell,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kin-of-covid-victims-turning-up-at-collector-office-for-rs50k-compensation/articleshow/88364071.cms||Soumitra Bose

Currently under the Act, depending on the offence, a person can either be fined anything between Rs 50-Rs 500 or face imprisonment up to six months. Animal welfare groups and NGOs in the state have been pushing for amendments to the act for a while now. “Offenders harm animals and get away with it. The Act needs to be amended to make people compassionate,” said Rubina Nitin Iyer, member, society for prevention of cruelty to animals. She claims that they have been trying to get elected leaders on board for a while to urge the lawmakers for amendments to the Act during the winter session. Two members of Parliament from the state, Tirath Singh Rawat and Ajay Bhatt, have written letters to the PMO and the ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying, seeking an amended Act. “Animal abuse cannot be seen in isolation and treated as a petty offence anymore, which is why there is a need to increase penalty,” wrote Rawat in his letter. Bhatt’s letter to minister Parshottam Rupala also requested to consider increasing the penalty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/increase-penalty-for-animal-cruelty-mps-write-to-pmo/articleshow/88364079.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi
---||Ahmedabad||Justice Nanavati who probed 1984, 2002 riots passes away||AHMEDABAD: Justice (retd) G T Nanavati, a former Supreme Court judge who probed the 2002 and the 1984 riots, passed away in Ahmedabad on Saturday. He was 86. Justice Nanavati’s relatives said that he died of cardiac failure in the afternoon. He is survived by two sons, Dhaval and Maulik, both lawyers at the Gujarat high court. Nanavati was born in 1935 and enrolled as an advocate at the Bombay high court in February 1958. He was elevated as a judge of the Gujarat high court in 1979. In 1993, he was transferred to the Orissa high court, where he served as its chief justice too. A year later, he was transferred to the Karnataka high court as its chief justice. In 1995, he was promoted to the Supreme Court. He retired in 2000. Immediately after his retirement, the NDA government at the Centre tasked Justice Nanavati with investigating the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, nearly 16 years after the violent eruptions. He tendered his report in two volumes in 2005 and by then the Congress-led UPA government was in power. Following the submission of the report, Jagdish Tytler stepped down from his position of a Union minister. In March 2002, the Narendra Modi government in Gujarat appointed Justice Nanavati as the chairman of a commission which was probing the burning of the S-6 coach of the Sabarmati Express. Before Justice Nanavati joined the commission, it had only a single member: Justice (retd) K G Shah. In the fire, 59 kar sevaks had been charred to death near the Godhra railway station on February 27, 2002. With his appointment as the chairman of the commission, the Gujarat government widened the scope of the inquiry to the post-Godhra riots. Justice Shah passed away some time later and Justice (retd) Akshay Mehta became a member of the commission. The Nanavati-Mehta commission submitted the final report on the riots in 2014 to the Gujarat chief minister at the time, Anandiben Patel. The commission’s observation was that the post-Godhra riots were a reaction to the burning of the coach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/judge-who-probed-2002-riots-no-more/articleshow/88364730.cms||---

Sawant said that though 60 years have passed, Goa has witnessed development in the last 10 years. As we have a double engine government, the Centre has provided funds to the tune of over Rs 20,000 crore for developmental works in Goa, he said. The chief minister said the state has today completed the first phase of Swayampurna Goa. “I will need support from all of you to make Goa swayampurna,” he said. Sawant unfurled the National Flag at the Parade Ground, Campal, and inspected the guard of honour. Forty-five personalities were presented various awards for their achievements in their respective fields, including police and other government employees. In his address, Sawant said after doing economic reforms in four sectors, including one nation one ration card, ease of doing business, urban local body reforms and power reforms, the state borrowing limit has gone up to Rs 4,530 crore from existing Rs 2,677 crore and that is the reason there was no impact on development works during the Covid pandemic. “Because of the reforms we have received over Rs 97 crore from the central government which was used for the construction of the super speciality hospital among others,” he said. He said through implementing the bill discounting system, the state government has been able to clear Rs 650 crore of contractors’ bills without putting additional burden on the state’s exchequer.  Sawant said that Swayampurna Goa is not a slogan, but a thought and officers are going to villages for human development. He said that 12 ‘governance at doorstep’ programmes were organised across the state to reach out to the people with various schemes. He said that to create technocrats, the state introduced a coding and robotic scheme in the state. Sawant said that four private universities have shown interest to establish campuses in the state and more private universities will come to Goa. He said that organic clusters have started in Goa to make Goa self-sufficient in agriculture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-development-in-last-10-years-is-due-to-double-engine-govt-cm/articleshow/88379485.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of the NMC, has written to the firms involved in establishing the eight LMO tanks at the Bytco Hospital and Zakir Hussain Hospital. This is done to ensure there are no technical snags in the functioning of these LMOs. While two such plants are set up at the Bytco Hospital, the remaining six are at Zakir Hussain Hospital. On April 21, an LMO tank, which was set up 20 days ago at Zakir Hussain Hospital, had A leakage disrupting the oxygen supply to the hospital for about an hour. It led to the death of 22 critical Covid patients on oxygen support, who were undergoing treatment at the hospital. Later, the government-appointed probe team held the two contractors responsible for the accident and penalised them of Rs 24 lakh as they did not provide their technical staff during the refilling of the tanks, which led to the leakage. “NMC has asked these firms that periodic maintenance of each of the eight LMO tanks must be done in every three months. Moreover, the firm’s technical experts must inspect the plants at regular intervals in a month to ensure all gadgets of the tanks are in proper condition. Their teams have to be present during the refilling of the tanks,” said Nagargoj. NMC sources said the responsibility would be on these firms if any kind of technical snag develops in the LMO tanks as the civic body does not have the technical expertise to deal with such issues. Nagargoje said the civic body has also directed its fire and electrical departments to conduct fire and electrical audits of the two hospitals and its Covid care centres at the earliest and submit reports to the NMC. “We have also requested the Public Works Department (PWD) to carry out a structural audit of all the Covid treatment facilities, including the two hospitals,” added Nagargoje.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ensure-proper-maintenance-of-lmo-tanks-nmc/articleshow/88363304.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The agency said it was not aware about criminal cases going on against Das. On Friday, chairman of NMC sports consultative committee Pramod Tabhane had announced that the civic body was organizing Mayor Swarratna contest, a singing competition of Hindi and Marathi songs, from December 20 to January 4. NMC is organizing the event in association with Lucky Musical Entertainment and a couple of more agencies. In the press conference, proprietor of Lucky Musical Entertainment Lucky Khan, Das and few more BJP corporators were present. A picture went viral on social media that Tabhane is organizing the event in association with Das who had allegedly honeytrapped many people. Khan in a press release issued on Saturday said, “Das herself expressed interest to contribute in the event. We were not aware of cases going on against her. We have decided not to take any help of Das and removed her from the event to avoid any controversy.” Leader of opposition in NMC Tanaji Wanve condemned the ruling party’s decision to organize the event in association with Das. Das told TOI that she is a victim of conspiracies and fighting out cases in court. “It has nothing to do with this event. I have helped many artists during Covid-19 pandemic. I have special interest in organizing cultural events. Even before this event, I had worked with the agency for Voice of Vidarbha event.

This development has been confirmed by Pune deputy commissioner of police (cyber and economic offences wing) Bhagyashree Navtake. She said, “The raids are a part of the ongoing investigation and are being carried out after the professors' names cropped up in the case.” Sources said the cybercrime police have found an audio call recording in which a suspect can be heard asking another person to leave the OMR answer sheets blank so that the correct answers could be filled after getting them scanned. The team reached professor Sunil Kayande's house, located at Watur Phata, on Saturday. Following the raids, Kayande’s wife has refuted all the allegations against her husband. She said, “My husband is being framed in this case. He has been named by his cousin, with whom he has differences over financial transactions.” Details of the second professor, whose house has also been searched, could not be ascertained till late. A day earlier, Navtake’s team arrested Maharashtra State Council of Examination Tukaram Supe for his alleged role in the malpractice committed in the TET exams. The alleged large-scale malpractices in the TET exams came to the fore when the Pune city’s cybercrime branch started a probe into the question paper leak scam of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) exam that was scheduled for December 12 but was cancelled a few hours ahead of the exams. With the latest development, TET has turned out to be the third major alleged recruitment-related scam in the state, with the first being the health department recruitment examination scam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/tet-paper-leak-pune-cybercrime-branch-raids-properties-of-2-professors-in-jalna/articleshow/88363292.cms||Mohammed Akhef

These were some of the key takeaways of discussions involving senior human resources (HR) leaders in a conclave organized on Saturday. Vaibhav Kulkarni, a director of Ernst & Young, said that the concept of the brick and mortar office is slowly yielding way to the ‘work from anywhere’ culture. “Majority of the companies today are working in the hybrid mode. Technology has facilitated the process by which performance and attendance can be monitored virtually,” Kulkarni said. “Some companies are also demarcating only a day or two for work at office when physical presence is required.” Kulkarni added: “With Omicron scare still around, it’s unlikely that we will see full offices any time soon.” The HR Leadership Conclave was organized by Shalby Hospitals in association with E&Y and PeopleStrong Technologies. It drew the HR heads of several companies of the city. Babu Thomas, the CHRO of Shalby Hospitals, said that companies and employees —especially in the healthcare sector — needed each other more than ever. “Many tweaked rules, many introduced new concepts and incentives as a sign of appreciation for those who gave their all during the pandemic,” Thomas said. He said that employee well-being came into sharp focus. “Many companies started helplines for employees to cope with mental health issues,” said Jitendra Nirwani from PeopleStrong Technologies. “In terms of trends, we saw many companies utilizing their in-house talent for emerging roles.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/many-employees-not-ready-yet-for-full-time-office/articleshow/88364697.cms||---

Speaking to reporters, filmmaker Pa Ranjith and rapper-lyricist Arivu, said that Margazhi Makkalisai gives a chance for native music art forms, which are generally unrecognized, to flourish in front of an audience. “Instead of Chennai always being in the limelight, this time we are starting the festival from Madurai in South Tamil Nadu and on Sunday we will be having the festival in Coimbatore. From December 24 to December 31, we will be having performances for eight days. Hundreds of artists will be taking part and benefit from the festival,” said Pa Ranjith.The film maker further said that for the first time this year, unrecognized senior artists will also be selected to be given awards and that eight awards will be announced at the festival. “The aim of the event is to make music reach the people as it is people’s music. Margazhi season is always associated with music in Tamil community. While classical and traditional music is well known for this season, any other music art forms are also equally valuable. Creating connect with the audience is what is important,” said Pa Ranjith. He also added that the festival provides an opportunity for artists who practice lesser known music art forms like parai and oppari and bring them onto a stage to get acceptance and recognition. It was also highlighted that there are also plans to not just have artists stop with performing but get their songs edited and uploaded on Spotify, a popular online platform for music and give a chance for artists to directly monetize.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/margazhi-makkalisai-is-a-platform-for-artists-to-get-recognition/articleshow/88364691.cms||---

Residents of Deesa town of Banaskantha district are, on the other hand, moaning under the intense cold wave that gets intensified with every gust of chilly wind blowing in from the north side only helps the temperatures dip to 9.6 degrees, the lowest in this winter season. Besides Banaskantha, districts like Mehsana, Sabarkantha, Aravalli and Patan too have been reeling under the bitter cold, forcing people to keep themselves either indoors or warm around bonfires by the roadside. The weather department, however, does not predict any respite in the offing from the cold spell as temperatures are likely to drop even further due to heavy snowfall in upper reaches of north India. Sources said that attendance in schools was sparse even in the alternate day system with the weather getting colder as parents refrained from sending their children out in the cold weather as well as fear of getting infected with cold. But, potato growers are especially happy as the cold weather is conducive for Rabi crops. “The present winter is extremely conducive for Rabi cultivation,” said the deputy director of the agriculture department. He said that even if the mercury levels slump further it will be beneficial for the crop. He said total area for potato sowing, however, has reduced by 5,000 hectares as the farmers are not being able to afford the rising prices of seeds. Potato sowing has been in about 60,000 hectare area, while other Rabi crops too have been sown in 4,95,494 hectares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/mount-abu-chills-at-3c-potato-farmers-happy/articleshow/88363321.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||‘Humans should learn to co-exist with bisons’||Kolhapur: The wildlife experts feel that the bison sighting sin the city and the surrounding areas are likely again, and the citizens must give the animals their space and learn to co-exist. The experts said that creating awareness among people on how to handle the situation if the bison is spotted in the urban areas is the need of the hour. Chasing the animal, bursting the fire-crackers, firing the bike silencer, creating chaos etc will only make the animal aggressive, which is usually known for its shy nature. Suhas Vaingankar, a renowned wildlife expert from Kolhapur, said, “We have to give the animals their space and learn to co-exist. Several villages that are located near the forest areas of Radhanagari, Gagan Bawda, Borbet, Vishalgad, Amba co-exist with the animal. The farmers keep on working in the farms while the bison grazes silently next to them. People should be made aware of how to co-exist and avoid man-animal conflict.” “A bison, also known as the Indian gaur is a shy animal who likes to stay away from humans. Several examples of the southern Indian states can be given where the bisons are seen roaming freely on the roads close to the farmers. Some even enter the market areas, but are not chased the way it happened in the city,” he added. Kolhapur and bison have a special connection. Umakant Chavan, an environment researcher and a wildlife photographer said, “Bison falls in the Schedule I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and is listed as 'vulnerable' in the IUCN Red List. Bison belongs to the family of wild oxen. The males weigh between 1,000 to 1,500kg, while the females weigh between 700 to 1,000kg. If the animal enters the urban areas or villages, people behave as if some enemy has entered their vicinity. The animal has its habitat around Kolhapur for hundreds of years. It is us humans that are carrying on deforestation and constructing farmhouses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/humans-should-learn-to-co-exist-with-bisons/articleshow/88363313.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Patil told TOI that they received the reports of all these 25 contacts on Friday night, and none of them have tested positive. “However, as a precautionary measure, we have advised these persons to be cautious for the next few days,” added Patil. Earlier this month, a woman and her minor child who had returned to Dhule from the UK had tested positive for Covid. The woman’s father and mother, too, tested positive. All four of them are asymptomatic and are under home isolation. “Our health teams are monitoring their health condition daily. The health parameters of all four persons are normal,” added Patil. At present, there are 7 active Covid cases in Dhule. Of these, 6 are under home isolation and one person is undergoing treatment at a private hospital. “We appeal to the people to strictly adhere to Covid appropriate behaviour following the looming threat of the Omicron variant,” said Patil.

---||Nagpur||HI ensuring there is no vacuum of hockey talent: Sandeep Singh||Nagpur: Former Indian hockey team skipper Sandeep Singh expressed satisfaction with the progress national men’s and women’s hockey teams were making. The minister of state for sports in Haryana talked about Hockey India’s (HI) efforts to ensure there is no vacuum of talent ahead of the 2024 Olympics. While Singh talked about the positive initiatives in hockey, the former badminton doubles world number 6 Jwala Gutta said there was still a big vacuum of talent in badminton. The former ace Indian players were speaking ahead of the Khasdar Krida Mohatsav (KKM) at Suresh Bhat Auditorium on Saturday. They launched season 4 of Vidarbha’s largest sporting extravaganza along with Union minister Nitin Gadkari. The former India drag-flicker was pleased with the performance of the Tokyo Olympics bronze-medallist men’s team, which also qualified for the semifinals in the ongoing Asian Champions Trophy. “We are making continuous progress. Considering there are still 2.5 years to go for the Paris Olympics, we have to see which player can serve the nation till then and beyond that. We have to identify seniors who can serve the nation and at the same time pick potential juniors. HI is working well on this,” he said. Indian badminton doubles’ performances have not shown the kind of growth hockey has. In the ongoing world championship, no Indian doubles pair made it to the quarterfinals. “The way the government has been pumping in money since Commonwealth 2010, we should have had more players and a solid team by now. Sindhu and Saina may retire in the next 4-5 years and we still do not have any backing. There is definitely a vacuum in badminton in terms of talent available and no one is talking about it,” Gutta said. The 14-time national champion added, “We need to scout for talented players at the grassroots level and support them. We cannot do it through private academies. It is only possible with the involvement of the government.” Pointing at the influx of players from southern India, where all major academies like the Pullela Gopichand Badminton Academy are located, she said, “It has become a Telugu people’s game. During my time, there were players from all parts of the country. There should not be a monopoly and there should be more accountability, which is not there.” Before Gutta expressed her concerns on the state of Indian badminton, Singh talked about how doing little things can help a player stay mentally tough. “To better oneself everydday, one should fight with oneself and stay positive. You need to consider where you were, where you are and where you want to go, and act accordingly to improve yourself on all the three stages. If anyone’s life inspires a player, the player must bring it to action to experience a sea change,” Singh said. A first-of-its-kind event, KKM will be conducted across 15 days, have 36 sporting disciplines and will be played at around 41 venues. A total of 1,064 teams, around 3,765 officials and over 42,000 participants are expected to take part in its fourth edition. During the concluding ceremony of this unique sports festival on January 16, as many as 560 trophies, 7,830 medals and a prize money of Rs1,03,75,000 will be distributed amongst the podium finishers. The fourth edition comprises football, kho-kho, tennis, basketball, carrom, athletics, swimming, volleyball, badminton, hockey, chess, kabaddi, table tennis, cycling, girls box cricket, wrestling, body Building, ‘matimand divyang’ games, archery, taekwondo, boxing, rifle shooting, fencing, malkhamb, gymnastics, bench press powerlifting, ‘O-Womaniya’, yog kriya, judo, soft ball, sepak takraw, youth races, handball, golf, tug of war and marathon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hi-ensuring-there-is-no-vacuum-of-hockey-talent-sandeep-singh/articleshow/88364715.cms||---

In line with the global practice, the research policy being worked out will also dwell on ways to financially support industries engaged in research. “The government has eased the policy for research in the pharmaceutical sector, and the time taken for giving permission to a company to carry out research has been reduced. But the country should not limit itself to manufacturing generic medicines only, it should also conduct research and sell patented drugs to the world market,” he added. The Centre’s policy to make healthcare accessible to common and poor people has created an opportunity for the pharma sector, he said. “We are making generic medicines available to the world, and we are ourselves consuming branded medicine to increase our treatment cost,” he said, adding that the Centre’s schemes will encourage use of generic medicines in the country. According to him, the share of generic medicines in India has gone up to 8% currently from only 2% seven years ago. Stating that the Gujarat government is setting up a bulk drug park at Bharuch, the state’s health minister Rishikesh Patel said that the government is expecting an investment of Rs 11,000 crore in the project. “In 2018-19, more than two third of our requirement of bulk drug and intermediates were met through imports from other countries. The bulk drug park will help reduce our dependence on imports for pharma raw materials,” Patel added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/centre-working-on-policy-to-promote-pharma-research/articleshow/88364732.cms||---

The complaints were registered at the traffic police station. Neel Parmar, a police inspector who was part of a team participating in the drive against teenage drivers, said that the campaign was undertaken in areas near schools and colleges. Parmar said licences of more than 25 teenagers were checked and cases were lodged against two parents. “The drive was intensely undertaken in Gujarat University area,” said Parmar. The officials involved in the drive said that when the children were caught, they came up with excuses like their parents were busy, so they had to drive down to their schools or colleges. “One of the students claimed that he was driving for the first time and his father is not aware that he had taken his two-wheeler,” the police official said. A common excuse from the students was they were getting late for their institute so there was no option but to take their parents’ vehicles, the cops said. The traffic police had on Friday announced a week-long drive against teenage drivers. The drive was launched after a teenager Rudra Sharma, 15, died in a road accident. Sharma, a resident of Shreenath Apartment in the Nava Vadaj area of the city, was hit from behind by an AMTS bus on Friday afternoon outside the gate of the apartment as he was returning to his home on his father’s two-wheeler.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/traffic-cops-book-parents-of-two-teenage-drivers/articleshow/88364726.cms||---

---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Six special teams search for absconding former minister K T Rajenthra Bhalaji||VIRUDHUNAGAR/MADURAI: The Virudhunagar district police has formed six special teams to nab former milk and dairy development minister K T Rajenthra Bhalaji (AIADMK) who is on the run after the Madras high court on Friday refused to grant him anticipatory bail in the cases pertaining to the job racket that was registered last month. The first case is against Bhalaji and his two accomplices for collecting money from 23 people on the promise of getting them government jobs in Aavin and in government departments. The second case is based on a complaint from K Nallathambi, one of the co-accused in the first case, who claimed that Bhalaji had used him as a tool to collect money from people promising jobs in Aavin. Police said that the former minister has been booked under sections 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 506(i) (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. Bhalaji had led the party’s protest in Virudhunagar district against the DMK government on Friday, shortly before he was denied anticipatory bail. While three special teams were formed on Friday, it was doubled on Saturday. AIADMK cadres thronged the minister’s house to condemn the action by the police. Meanwhile, in a special sitting on Saturday, the Madras high court restrained the Virudhunagar police from summoning any relative of Bhalaji who are not figuring as an accused in the cheating cases registered by the Virudhunagar district crime branch (DCB). Justice G R Swaminathan passed the interim order while hearing the petition filed by Bhalaji’s sister K Lakshmi, who sought a direction to the police not to harass her family members. The judge also directed the police to file a counter and adjourned the case to Monday. Senior counsel for the petitioner submitted that two cases were registered against Bhalaji by the DCB. Since his anticipatory bail pleas were dismissed by the principal seat at Chennai on Friday, steps are taken to file a special leave petition before the Supreme Court. He submitted that Lakshmi’s son Vasanthakumar was taken to the Thiruthangal police station around 9.30pm on Friday. Police made Vasanthakumar call his brother Ramana and driver Rajkumar to the station. The trio was detained there though they were not involved in any offence. He further submitted that the police officials allegedly threatened them to ask the former minister to surrender, failing which they would register cases against them. They were allegedly interrogated by the Virudhunagar district superintendent of police before being detained at the Virudhunagar DCB from around 3.20am on Saturday. The additional public prosecutor submitted that summons were issued to the three people, however, they did not appear. Due to this, they were brought to DCB. After obtaining statements, the three were let off at around 2.35pm on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/6-spl-teams-search-for-absconding-former-minister-rajenthra-bhalaji/articleshow/88364703.cms||---

Both Hindustan Zinc and Cairn India are part of Vedanta Group. Speaking on the sidelines of an interactive session with the business community organised by Ficci-Rajasthan here, Agarwal said the group is also planning to invest $15 billion (approximately Rs 1,500 crore) to set up a manufacturing facility for LCD (liquid crystal display) panels used in cell phones, laptops, televisions and other electronic products. He, however, did not commit if this facility will come up in Rajasthan. “The Centre’s Rs 76,000-crore incentive plan to lure the semiconductor fabricators and display manufacturers is a big decision. Currently, India imports 90% of its electronics items, including cell phones, TVs and laptops. But faster approval of projects will change the scenario completely in three years,” he said. “Personally, I am interested in setting up the LCD unit here. But funding partners and experts will have the final say. They are currently evaluating government policies in Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and other states. They will decide on the location based on state policies,” Agarwal said. AvanStrate, a Japanese company that Agarwal acquired four years ago, already makes glass substrates for small- and medium-sized high-resolution, thin-film transistor LCD panels. On shale gas, Agarwal said India is not producing this gas today. “In whole of India, Rajasthan has the largest potential to produce shale gas. It is the second Texas in the world. We have earmarked investments of Rs 40,000 crore for capacity expansion at Cairn India and Hindustan Zinc, but the priority will be shale exploration and production by Cairn. In nine months’ time, we will produce shale gas in Rajasthan. It could be limited quantity initially, but we will achieve the target,” he said. Agarwal said Rajasthan has the potential to significantly improve the overall economic condition of the country. “It is a state abundant in natural resources and with the production of oil, copper, gold, zinc, lead, etc., the imports of the country can be greatly reduced. Today 70% of the revenues of the country is spent on imports,” Agarwal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cairn-to-produce-shale-gas-in-raj-in-9-months-agarwal/articleshow/88365234.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The shop has five speech and hearing-impaired employees on its rolls. It now plans to hire 10 more such people next month. While the regular employees interact with customers, everything else is taken care of by those with disabilities. The two brothers -- Vishwas (30) and Nikhil Paskanthi (28) -- who manage their father’s business, own another sari shop, and factories in Solapur and are on the lookout for more such people who can be trained and given employment. According to them, employees with disabilities are focused on their jobs, are less distracted, take fewer breaks, are punctual, and never waste time as compared to regular employees. Devendra Nage (22), one of their staffers, completed standard XII in the vocational education stream and studied to be an electrician. Despite trying hard, he failed to find a job due to his speech and hearing impairment. However, since Dussehra, Devendra is employed in the sari shop “Most of them have studied at least till standard XII. They probably have some skills and yet are unemployed. Regular businesses do not want to employ them thinking they will not perform well but nothing can be farther from the truth. These five here are extremely focused. You just need to tell them once how something needs to be done and they will do it the same way. They are always on time and even if they get stuck somewhere, they would video call me or send me a picture of the spot to show where they are. They are the most dedicated, loyal and hard-working employees,” said Vishwas. It was during their SP College days that Nikhil came across people with disabilities and decided to help them in some way. “There is VR Ruia Mook Badhir Vidyalaya inside the SP College and I used to play cricket with the students from there. I would often wonder what happened to them after they left school or college and would think of doing something for them as I found them to be very positive despite the challenges faced by them daily,” said Nikhil, a chartered accountant. When the brothers decided to open a new shop, they immediately put their plan into action. They contacted the Ruia college and the in-charge gave them five names. They trained these five people to work in a sari shop. “Except speaking to customers, they can do everything else. In fact, recently we had a family which was also hearing and speech impaired. They were pleasantly surprised to find salespeople who could communicate in sign language. They were happy to shop here as they were able to tell the salespeople what they want, and we, in turn, were able to show them the saris they were looking for. We want to employ more such people. In the next phase, we also plan to train them in handloom work so that they can work in our factories in Solapur,” added Nikhil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/this-sari-shop-in-the-city-employs-hearing-speech-impaired-people/articleshow/88364706.cms||Ardhra Nair

The incident came to light when the girl’s parents came to know she was four months pregnant. According to police, the victim is studying Class XII at a government school. For the past three days, the girl complained of stomach pain and refused to go to school. When her mother questioned her further, she revealed that she had taken a pregnancy test on her own and was four months pregnant. Police sources said that the accused befriended the girl and spoke to her whenever she travelled in the bus. On September 5, he went to her house and raped her saying he wants to marry her as his wife had left him recently. The accused then repeatedly raped her whenever she was alone at her house. Based on a complaint filed by the girl’s mother, the Vadipatti police registered a case under various sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and arrested the accused on Friday.

Asked about further leads into the crash, the IAF chief said he would not like to pre-empt the findings of the court of enquiry. “It is a thorough process. It is a mandate given to investigate every single angle and look into every single aspect of what could have gone wrong and come out with recommendations and findings,” he said about the investigation. “I would not like to make any comment in haste about what could have been the cause of the mishap or what remedial actions are to be introduced. We have to wait for a few more weeks for the investigation to be completed. Let me assure you, it is a very fair process,” he said. The air chief said they had already got the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder and the investigating team was recording the statements of every possible witness. He, however, said flight protocols would be reviewed, based on the findings of the enquiry. Chaudhari said during the enquiry, if necessary, a cross examination will also be done of the witnesses. “We hope the enquiry finishes at the earliest,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/chopper-crash-probe-will-be-over-soon-iaf-chief/articleshow/88364132.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

S Ravi, IGP Eastern Range Davanagere issued the suspension order on Saturday and Haveri SP Hanumantharaya relieved Chidanand from service. Recently video and audio clips of WhatsApp conversations between Chidanand and the victim had gone viral. In these clips, the inspector is seen misbehaving with the woman and asking her to send her nude videos and seeking sexual favours. He made the video calls to the victim from his bathroom and when he was undressed. The victim objected to the CPI’s offer and she denied following his directions. The woman has filed a POCSO case after her daughter went missing. A probe has been initiated against Chidanand based on the WhatsApp videos and audio clips. Earlier, the IGP sought a detailed report from the Haveri SP and the latter sent details of allegations made by five women against Chidanand. Senior officers have now issued orders to initiate legal action against the cop. According to sources, Chidanand allegedly misbehaved and sexually harassed five women in Haveri district. Interestingly, all women came in contact with him when they had visited the women’s police station to seek justice and these women have alleged denied his sexual advances. Sometimes, the CPI allegedly threatened the women if they did not comply with his demands. “The Haveri SP has recommended disciplinary action against CPI Chidanand along with a detailed preliminary inquiry report, evidence and statements of victims. All these allegations are considerable. Chidanand has forgotten how to discharge his duties despite being a responsible officer. He misbehaved with women who came seeking justice and harassed them sexually by misusing his power. It is clearly a violation of KCSR rules of 1966 while discharging his duties. So, I have suspended him,” IGP S Ravi stated in the suspension order. Will conduct a probe The IGP Eastern Range has suspended CPI Chidanand who allegedly misbehaved with women.

Pandey has said that the existing provisions of the Maharashtra Prevention of Gambling Act, 1887, are lenient and people operating online gambling games are taking advantage of the same. Pandey, in his recent letter to the state DGP, has stressed on harsher steps such as arrests under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) and Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) Act. The CP said that there are currently 15 cases registered under the Maharashtra Prevention of Gambling Act in Nashik, which are largely connected to online gambling. CP Deepak Pandey has stressed that online gambling is addiction forming and there are many internet sites, which attract people to online gambling. Owing to the fact that the websites are created fraudulently and there is no authentic registration of the company, there is no control of the government and there is also no account of the amount of money the operators are making. ‘A large number of people of criminal mindset have entered this business as there is no type of tax that has to be paid to the government. People getting addicted to online games are resorting to thefts, robberies and other serious criminal offences,” CP Pandey has said in his letter. He said that the existing Gambling Act is over 150 years and was enacted keeping in mind the conditions and circumstances then. However, over the decades technology has changed. CP Deepak Pandey said that states like Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have banned online gambling and have made changes in their existing Acts related to gambling to make them more stringent. The CP said that he has requested the state DGP to send a report about the online gambling to the people concerned to make changes in the existing Act. Apart from arresting people into operating online gambling under MCOCA and MPDA, CP Deepak Pandey has sought stringent punishment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-police-commissioner-writes-to-dgp-calls-for-change-in-gambling-act/articleshow/88363348.cms||Santosh Sonawane

This week alone, two bison marked their presence within the main city. Similarly, sive-six bison were also spotted in the farms located in the villages on the outskirts of the the Kolhapur city. A 21-year-old youth from Bhuyewadi was killed in a bison attack and a 45-year-old woman from Sonyachi Shiroli village was injured in another attack on Friday. Samrat Kerkar, the founder of Bison Nature Club in Radhanagari, said, “The bison, also known as the pride of Kolhapur, is now being considered a threat in the urban areas. Depleting grassland and an increase in the number of bison are probably the main reasons behind the bison moving closer to the cities. Bison do not have a predator — except a tiger. With the decreasing number of tigers in the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve, the number of bison has been increasing rapidly.” Clement Ben, the chief conservator of forests (territorial), said, “Sugar cane, corn, fresh leaves are the favourite fodder of these animals and they tend to get attracted towards them. The bison can be spotted in the forest areas of Radhanagari, Dajipur, Borbet, Vishalgad, Amba, Gagan Bawda, Bhudargad, Ajara, etc. As these forests are not continuous, these animals cross the forest limits easily and come to the villages in search of green grass. Therefore, we are now planning to propose cultivating fodder for these animals in the barren land next to the forest areas.” Sunil Limaye, the principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), told TOI, "The issue is not that serious and we have faced a similar situation in Pune twice. In Kolhapur, people chased the animal to shoo it away. This kind of practice will provoke and scare the animals.” The straying of wild animals into the residential areas is an indication of development versus wildlife conservation in that particular area. “In many cities, land and hills, which were animal corridors, now have infrastructure projects. Thus, the travel routes of the animals have closed and they are seen venturing into urban spaces,” said Neha Panchamia, a wildlife expert, who runs the RESQ NGO in Pune. Vidya Atherya, a scientist at the wildlife conservation society, said, “The young adult bison usually wander hundreds of kilometres in search of new habitat. These animals could have come close to the city for the same purpose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/experts-as-bison-count-rises-more-animals-stray-near-cities/articleshow/88363378.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

He has a strong connection with India and especially with Ahmedabad’s Gujarat Vidyapith which was founded by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920. Udayana earned a certificate from the Vidyapith’s Department of Gandhian Thought and Peace Research in 1997. Udayana who was in Ahmedabad last week said he is currently working on ‘Indonesia-India Sangam’ project, through which more than 100 students from India can come to Indonesia to learn about the importance of Gandhiji. An equal number of students from Indonesia can visit India under the programme. Talking about his stay in Ahmedabad and learnings from Gandhiji’s philosophy, Udayana said that simplicity and equality are the key principles. "Gandhiji used the word ‘daridra Narayan’ which means that God exists in the poorest people of society. We have a scholarship programme back home for the poor," Udayana said. "The diamond never forgets how it has risen from dust. It is the same with the poor folks." The Shanti Sena project was taken up recently at Udayana’s Ashram Gandhi Puri in Bali to commemorate the 100 years of the Satyagraha movement of Gandhiji. "We gave scholarships to 45 students every year under this programme. These students do the hand-holding for the next batch," Udayana said. "This goes on as students bond with each other and become ambassadors for spreading the message of peace and non-violence." Udayana has been propagating Gandhian ideologies, particularly those relevant to the prevailing social concerns, by way of seminars, workshops, competitions, camps, interfaith dialogues, and prayers. He has translated Gandhian writings into his local language. Ashram Gandhi Puri was created to enrich the spiritual, cultural, social, and economic life in Bali. It focuses on interfaith dialogues for peace, justice, and healing. Udayana regularly participates in social work in India, Indonesia, and other parts of the world, while promoting Gandhian values and Hinduism. Students from universities across the world come to Ashram Gandhi Puri to enrol in the Gandhi Vichaar Studies programme and interact with Balinese youth championing Gandhian ideals. Apart from the Padma Shri, Udayana has been conferred other awards including the title of ‘Indonesian Gandhi’ in 2010 by IBMF (International Bali Meditator Festival) for his work in Indonesia, particularly for finding a place for Gandhism in Balinese culture. He also received the International Jamnalal Bajaj Award in 2011 for spreading Gandhian values outside India. He was bestowed the Shantidoot award by the World Peace Movement Trust for being an ambassador of peace. Udayana set up the Indra Udayana Institute of Vedanta in September 1997 to help people implement the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Mahatma Gandhi in their daily lives. "Our ashrams are self-sufficient. We have our own land and our own property and are not dependent on the government," Udayana said. "We grow our own vegetables in our own gardens without much use of machinery, relying on our labour." The local people have benefited from the services and teachings of the ashram in the contexts of brotherhood, self-reliance, environment, and peace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gandhijis-principles-on-the-march-in-southeast/articleshow/88364757.cms||Bharat Yagnik

This was the third incident which occurred in the Junnar forest division in the last two months. “The farmers told us that they heard the roar of animals from the sugar cane farms since early on Friday. Accordingly, we sent our staff to the village. We found the body of the female leopard in the sugar cane field around 9am. Preliminary examination of the body revealed that the animal had received serious injuries on the neck and head during the fight. As per the procedure, we have conducted a post-mortem and cremated the body,” said forest officer Sachin Kakde of Otur range. Kakde ruled out foul play and claimed it was a clear case of a territorial fight since all body parts of the animal were intact. “We have found the pugmarks of another animal near the body. The bite marks and hair recovered from the location confirmed the fight with another animal,” he added. The forest officials suspected that the fight might have taken place due to the movement of the animal from one area to another owing to the ongoing sugar cane cutting season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/female-leopard-dies-in-territorial-fight-in-junnar/articleshow/88364746.cms||Sandip Dighe

Additional sessions judge P N Dave acquitted 33-year-old Ramavat from charges of killing Sagar Mewada and Pravin Barad. Ramavat was arrested for killing these persons in their sleep on the footpath. Mewada, a tea seller was stoned to death near Bhaktinagar railway station, while Barad an autorickshaw driver, was attacked near Saurashtra university in May 2016. He later succumbed to his injuries in the hospital. Ramavat, a psychopath, was arrested from Bedeshwar area of Jamnagar from his rented accommodation. He used to steal his victim’s mobile phones. The prosecution had produced documentary evidence that the accused was using the victim’s mobile phones by inserting his SIMcard. He called up the victim’s bank to get a new password for his ATM card. The prosecution had also submitted a voice recording of the bank along with the forensic report. The series of murders committed by stoning three people had created a huge fear psychosis among the people, especially homeless people, and a huge team of policeman comprising around 1,200 cops divided into various teams were assigned duty to nab Ramavat in 2016 by the Rajkot police. The cops had also recovered huge stones from his rented house in Jamnagar where he used to practice stoning people. District government pleader Sanjay Vora said “The court acquitted Ramavat by giving benefit of doubt, but we will come to know more details after studying the judgment. We will appeal this order in the high court.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/court-acquits-rajkot-stone-killer-in-two-murder-cases/articleshow/88363404.cms||---
---||Delhi||Four private hospitals asked to set up Omicron units in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Amid a rising number of Omicron cases in the capital, the Delhi government has asked four private hospitals to establish separate isolation units for patients infected with the new coronavirus variant. After the Omicron scare, the government designated Lok Nayak Hospital, the capital’s largest hospital, for Omicron patients. The separate isolation units for Omicron in private hospitals will create more healthcare facilities for the patients and will address panic among people. The four hospitals are Max Smart Super Speciality Hospital, Saket; Batra Hospital & Research Centre, Tughlaqabad Institutional Area; Fortis Super Specialty Hospital, Vasant Kunj and Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital. “In order to augment the capacity of institutional isolation facility in the private sector for Covid-positive international passengers who have traveled from or transited through at risk countries as per the central government guidelines, the authorities of Batra Hospital & Research Centre, Tughlaqabad Institutional Area; Fortis Super Specialty Hospital, Vasant Kunj and Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital are hereby directed to establish separate (isolation) units for such passengers on a payment basis with immediate effect and to follow the SOPs issued by MotlFW, Gol from time to time,” an order issued by the health department stated. WHO has classified Omicron as variant of concern. Earlier this month, the Delhi government asked authorities of Max Smart Super Specialty Hospital, Saket to establish separate (isolation) unit for Covid-positive international passengers who have travelled from or transited through at risk countries. Altogether, 12 Covid-positive international passengers were admitted in Max Smart Super Specialty Hospital, Saket as on December 15. Now, five hospitals are available for treatment of Omicron patients. Covid cases are slowly rising in the capital.

Notices are also being issued to the hotels, resorts and people organiaing the events, about following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Speaking to TOI, SP Sachin Patil said, “It is important that all measures are taken to ensure that Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB) is strictly followed by everyone given that the new Omicron variant is sperading in different parts of the country.” He said the state government’s new notification on Covid-appropriate behaviour, against the backdrop of Omicron’s emergence, would be strictly followed across the jurisdiction of the Nashik rural police. The police said every year, proper bandboast is maintained to ensure that there is no drink-driving during the New Year Eve. This time around, the police would also check that people at all the events, parties etc. follow Covid-appropriate behaviour as well. Strict action would be taken against those found violating the government norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/advisory-for-tourists-hotels-in-nashik/articleshow/88363388.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Nagpur||Ganga Jamuna, a loveable love story||Nagpur: This diarist was witness to an unscripted love story at the most unlikely place where pleasure is purchased and emotions have little space. Following the order of CP Amitesh Kumar, the red-light area of Ganga Jamuna was shut on August 11 this year permanently for sex work. The area turned into a security fortress with cops keeping a close watch on every movement. This diarist, who was chatting with cops at the bandobast point, could see a youngster in his early 20s anxiously talking to someone over the cellphone while standing on the footpath opposite Dargah galli. He was gesturing to someone in the lane and trying to cross the road to enter the dingy lanes. A constable gestured the youngster to move away. The youngster pleaded for permission to remain there for some more time. But the cop started sauntering towards the youngster swinging his lathi firmly. Even as the youngster sought permission, the constable landed a blow of lathi on his leg. Unfazed, the youngster kept pleading. This time, the cops dragged him by the collar and pushed him inside a police vehicle asking the driver to take him to the police station. But, the youngster returned some time back, much to the disappointment of the constable. The constable started asking the youth his name and background. This diarist could see the cop trying to instil some sense into the youngster and threatened to inform his parents. The youngster broke his silence. “I really love her a lot and can’t live without her. It’s almost been a month-and-a-half since we last met,” he told the cop leaving him almost speechless. The cop asked him why he is not marrying the girl and freeing her from the hell. The young man replied that he was completing graduation and would marry her after getting a job. “I want to first earn and need to pay her a lot of money to her family to rescue her from the flesh trade,” he said. The cop suggested the young man must return only after arranging the cash. “You will get booked and beaten up by cops everyday and spoil your career,” said the cop. “Even she loves me and look how she too has stepped outside to meet me. Permit us to meet else I might end life in Gandhisagar lake,” said the youngster pointing towards a girl standing near the lane on the other side. She too appeared to be almost breaking into tears. At his wits end, the cop decided to allow the couple to meet. Sounding emotional, he said, “Take her away. I am standing here. Let’s see who stops you. Don’t be afraid, if anyone stops tell them that you have my permission.” “Than you sir, thank you so much,” said the youngster before scampering across the road to meet the girl. Soon, they disappeared into the lanes of the red-light area. The cop later walked up to this diarist and said, “Bose Babu, Maine bhi jisko chaha tha woh mujhe mila nahi tha. Aaj woh yaad aa gayee yeh sab laafde se 20-25 saal baad (Bose, even I too did not get the girl whom I loved. This episode reminded me of her after 20-25 years,” he said with tears in his eyes.

---||Nashik||30% drop in registration of vineyards for grape export||Nashik: The district has witnessed a drop of 30% in the registration of vineyards meant for grape export. According to the Grape Exporters’ Association of India (GEAI), many grape farmers have refrained from registering their vineyards for export because of various challenges like the rise in freight charges of containers and packaging materials. While the freight charges of containers have almost doubled, the packaging material charges have increased by 30%. As per the government norms, it is mandatory for the farmers wanting to export grapes to register their vineyards with the state agriculture department. Last year, 37,090 farmers had registered their vineyards involving 22,790 hectare of land. But this year, the registration of vineyards for grape exports have reduced by 30%. Only 25,571 farmers have registered involving 13,248 hectare. The deadline for registration was November 30. But considering the poor response, it has been extended up to December 20. Manik Patil, director of Grape Exporters Association of India (GEAI), said the grape exporters have been facing various challenges. He said there has been a huge rise in freight charges in the last three years. This year, the shipping freight charges have doubled from 4,000 USD a container to 8,000 USD a container this year. Moreover, packaging material prices have also increased by 30%. Earlier, the 5-kg box would cost Rs 46 per box, which has now increased to Rs 60 per box. “Hence, most of the farmers have refrained from registering their vineyards for the export of grapes considering that they will not get the adequate rates from the traders due to rise in freight and other charges,” said Patil. Nashik district had exported 1.29 lakh tonne of grapes during the last grape season. Of 1.29 lakh tonne of grapes exported last grape season 2020-21 (Dec-April), 96,000 tonnes of grapes were exported to European countries like The Netherlands, Germany, United Kingdom etc, while remaining 33,000 tonnes of grapes were exported to non-European countries like Russia, Malaysia, Dubai etc. The district had exported 1.16 lakh tonnes of grapes during the 2019-20 grape season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/30-drop-in-registration-of-vineyards-for-grape-export/articleshow/88363433.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Delhi||Delhi accident: First visit to capital becomes teen’s last||NEW DELHI: At the mortuary of Lok Nayak Hospital on Saturday, relatives of the four people who lost their lives when a container fell on the autorickshaw they were in couldn’t contain their shock and grief at the sudden loss. It was tragic that teenaged Tata Prakash died while on his first ever visit to Delhi. “He had lost his father a few years ago in Punjab. He wanted to see Delhi, so he tagged along with his uncle, Komal Singh, when they left home in UP,” revealed Neeraj, nephew of Komal Singh who also died in the horrendous accident on Saturday. According to Diwan Singh, another relative, Singh was the sole breadwinner in his family. “His wife, Gangashree, and his three daughters and one son, all of them minors, live in Agra. Only a few days ago, he had gone and met them,” Gyan Singh, another relative, added. Singh, having worked as a professional cook, was to have joined the police force soon as a cook. “After reaching Delhi, he was coming to Seelampur to meet us when the accident took place,” revealed Neeraj. Autorickshaw driver Surender Yadav, who also perished in the accident, lived in a rented accommodation with his relative in Shastri Park in northeast Delhi. A native of Bihar, he was the father of four children. “Two months ago, his four-year-old son had a heart operation in Haryana,” disclosed Vishal Yadav, a relative. Another kin, Deepak Yadav, said, “He was working day and night to ensure that his son got good medical treatment and a better life than his own.” He said Surender had taken the autorickshaw on rent and was earning a living as a driver for eight-nine years now. Some people who regularly hired Surender’s three wheeler and his fellow auto drivers were also present at the mortuary. “Usually in the morning, he used to drop a hospital worker from Dilshad Garden to a hospital in Shastri Park. But today, that person didn’t call him so Surender carried on elsewhere,” said Janeshwar Yadav, a pharmacist. Pradeep Nagar, who claimed to be a nursing staffer and a regular customer of Surender, said the auto driver was always helpful and trustworthy. Surender’s nephew, Jai Yadav, the fourth casualty, was the father of two children aged six years and eight months. He too was the sole earner in his family. "He used to make purses at his home to sale. This work was affected by the pandemic,” said Deepak Yadav. Investigators claimed the accident site was a known risk-prone zone. "It's a steep turn and prone to mishaps,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/first-visit-to-capital-becomes-teens-last/articleshow/88365588.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Delhi||E-way toll for travelling to Meerut from Sarai Kale Khan fixed at Rs 140||NEW DELHI: Come December 25, you will have to shell out Rs 140 for one-way travel from Sarai Kale Khan to Meerut, if you are travelling by car on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway. The toll rates for a one-way trip from Indirapuram to Meerut and Dundahera to Meerut will be Rs 95 and Rs 75, respectively. However, majority of the daily commuters will not be impacted by the imposition of these tolls as no user fee will be collected from all those travelling from Delhi to Dasna and back. The road transport and highways ministry on Friday issued the toll notification enabling the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to start collecting user fee from different categories of vehicles. Delhi-Meerut Expressway is the third such highway stretch in the NCR where the NHAI is following the “closed tolling” system, which means the commuters will need to pay the user fee only for the exact kms they travel. The NHAI has installed Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras at all the entry and exit points to calculate the total kms a vehicle travelled on the expressway. The user fee will be automatically deducted from the FASTag wallet of the vehicles. Two-, three-wheelers and all slow moving vehicles are banned on the expressway portion — the barricaded six lanes in the middle. According to the ministry’s notification, if a vehicle completes a return journey on the expressway within 24 hours, the toll will be one-and-half times the charge for the one-way journey. This means you have to pay Rs 210 for travelling the entire stretch on your car for the return journey within 24 hours. Similarly, frequent car travellers can get a discount for 50 trips in a month against a payment of Rs 4,666. To ensure that the commuters are paying the toll, the NHAI has put boom barriers and tag readers on the greenfield stretch of the highway, from Dasna to Meerut, where traffic volumes are much lower. “We need to see how the compliance of paying toll automatically increases considering that the ANPR cameras can only read the vehicles with high-security registration plates (HSRP). Based on that experience, a decision will be made on how to collect tolls from all those using the expressway and exiting between Sarai Kale Khan and Dasna,” said a source. However, for local traffic, the drive on NH-9 section of the 14-lane highway will remain exempt from toll forever.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/e-way-toll-for-travelling-to-meerut-from-sarai-kale-khan-fixed-at-rs-140/articleshow/88365269.cms||Dipak K Dash

The initiative will kickstart on Monday with autistic children. The sprawling Painting and Textile & Decorative Art Gallery will be used for their workshop. Thereafter, the archeological gallery will be thrown open for special children. TimesViewThis is a great initiative, coming as it does after the plan to make the institution more accessible to impaired-visibility people. Other old institutes should come forward with more such plans so that the city becomes more inclusive in the truest sense of the term.“It is an attempt on our part to be more inclusive. These children are very special, extremely sensitive and feel helpless in exposure to crowds and noise. We will try to learn their need to adapt ourselves to fulfil their requirements. Hopefully, we will live up to their expectations,” said Indian Museum director Arijit Dutta Chowdhury. “Artistic and Autistic have only the misplacement of two letters. Autistic children are naturally inclined to artistic expressions. This is why we are opening the museum to these special children to experience the space wholeheartedly and express themselves through their artistic expressions. We will give them everything for drawing. But there is no hard and fast rule, they can go back to their home and draw. Every art piece will be evaluated by art therapists to find a way out for relieving them from stress and mental agony,” said Arnab Basu, the in-charge of the museum’s art section and curator of the initiative. “The world of autistic children is completely different from ours. Art is a channel for expressing their pent-up anguish, despondence and dreams. Their IQ level is very high and they often read the minds of people around them accurately,” said Jyotisubhro Das of the Institute of Tropical Medicines, a mother of an autistic child. It is an extremely encouraging initiative by IM to include these children in its journey, she added. Shampa Sengupta, a trained art therapist for autistic children, said, “Art is the best way to open a door of communication for these children. They are deficient in the art of communication in conventional ways. That is why they understand us, yet we don’t understand them.” Indian Museum is also taking giant leaps by developing 3D representation of every art object so that these children can touch them and feel and experience the amazing collection of the museum. “These children understand everything by touching. If they cannot touch them, their experience remains incomplete. The Braille texts make no sense if they cannot touch the object and elevate himself or herself to its artistic realm,” said Basu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/museum-reserves-mondays-for-children-with-special-needs/articleshow/88364208.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

According to Maharashtra Rajya Draksha Bagayatdar Sangh (MRDBS), an association of grape growers, the grape production of Nashik district was 12 lakh tonne during the last grape season and around 1.29 lakh tonnes were exported to various European and non-European countries. But the recent unseasonal rain has badly hit some of the vineyards in the district and the grape production is expected to reduce by 20%. The grape plantation in the district is estimated to be on around 1.50 lakh acre. However, the grape producers’ association said despite lower production, the cost of the produce will remain what it was last year. Manik Patil, a senior member of the MRDBS, said losses are in two categories. The ready to harvest vineyards have been badly hit. The ready grapes developed cracks in most of the vineyards in the district. Apart from this, some of the vineyards were in flowering stages and those have also been hit. “The grape growers have been facing problems for the past few years due to bad climate conditions and the pandemic,” said Patil. The Covid outbreak has reduced the demand for grapes in the last two years and this year too, the rate will be the same as last year even though the production has declined, added Patil. Of the 1.50 lakh acre, the plantation under wine grape varieties is 6,000 acre, while the remaining all plantations are under table grape varieties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/grape-production-likely-to-drop-by-20-in-nashik/articleshow/88363417.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Dehradun||WII and Doon University sign MoU, to offer PhD courses||Dehradun: The long-pending dilemma over the suspension or closure of PhD and MSc courses at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) because of disengagement plans proposed by the Centre came to an end on Saturday. The WII and Doon University, Uttarakhand signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for a collaborative PhD program. The MoU was signed by the registrar of Wildlife Institute of India, Dr Monali Sen, and the registrar of Doon University, Dr M S Mandrawal. Students of the School of Environment Science, Doon University can pursue PhD under the supervision and overall academic guidance of experts from WII. As a part of the MoU, both organisations shall make provisions to share their respective research and development facilities to promote academic and research interaction in multiple areas of cooperation, within the framework of the rules governing the two institutions. The MoU will encourage interaction between scientists, faculty members, research fellows, and students of both the entities. “Students will appear for their interviews on 20 and 21 December. A WII expert will also be a part of the research advisory committee at Doon University that will interview students. At least two to three students will be provided an opportunity to get a PhD this year. We will increase the number of students from next year onward,” said Surekha Dangwal , vice-chancellor of Doon University and Dr VP Uniyal, scientist at WII. Both were present during the MoU signing. Dangwal added, “We cannot give WII an affiliation according to our statute. However, we can give them our PhD seats. The MoU is about collaborative research work, which will be funded by WII while we will give PhD degrees under the name of Doon University. Students will get six months of course work and they will pursue their doctorate in accordance with the PhD statute and ordinance of our state university." Talks regarding WII’s prestigious MSc programme are still ongoing with the Delhi-based Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (ACSIR). Soon, authorities from ACSIR will visit the WII before giving a final nod. Preliminary talks between both organisations have come to a positive conclusion, according to authorities at WII. WII’s MSc wildlife course is considered as one of the finest master’s courses in the country to study wildlife. “The ASCIR is in 'institute of national importance.' We have met their director. Things are moving in a very positive direction. We will soon be in a position to commence the 2022-23 MSc academic session,” said Dhananjai Mohan, director, WII. Earlier, PhD degrees were provided by the Forest Research Institute (FRI), a deemed University in Dehradun, where currently around 50 students are enrolled. However, students were left anxious after the DoPT said that whistleblower Sanjiv Chaturvedi's degree from FRI was not “from a recognised university or institution.” The alma mater of WII had started an online petition a couple of months ago, addressed to the PMO, against the disengagement plans of the Centre, highlighting how the institution played a vital role in safeguarding the wildlife of the country. Saurashtra University had been providing M.Sc. degrees to WII students since 1988. The WII was set up by the Union government in 1982 and was recognised by the Saurashtra University in Gujarat in 1988. The Centre had been reportedly asking the institute to become independent for funds. A report by the Centre’s finance section had stated after an audit, “Disengagement by the government with a three-year timeline and a gradual reduction of 25% each year is recommended.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/wii-and-doon-university-sign-mou-to-offer-phd-courses/articleshow/88364215.cms||Shivani Azad

Additional Superintendent of Police (rural) Vidya Sagar Mishra said Bhupendra Pandey, who worked at a private clinic, was arrested after his wife's brother called 'Dial 112', a helpline that provides quick response. Mishra added that Pandey's health deteriorated in police custody and he was rushed to the hospital, where he died during treatment. On the cause of his sudden illness, the ASP said, the man had possibly poisoned himself, adding that his death had nothing to do with his arrest. Crying foul, Pandey's kin blocked the Moradabad-Haridwar state highway and demanded action against police officials along with Pandey’s wife and her brother. It was only after police assured the protesters that an FIR would be registered and a fair probe would be conducted that the latter lifted the blockade. Mishra told TOI, “The victim would often beat up his wife and several complaints were lodged against him. When police detained him for questioning, he said that he had consumed poison much before his arrest. We have registered an FIR under the section of murder on the complaint of victim’s father against victim’s wife and brother-in-law. Arrests will be made once the probe is completed."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/detained-for-thrashing-wife-man-dies-in-police-custody-cops-say-poison-cause-of-death/articleshow/88358777.cms||---

SP Dilip Patil-Bhujbal said that district collector had enforced section 144 of Cr PC prohibiting assembly of more than 5 persons in Pusad town. The representatives of various groups had applied on their letterheads for prior permission from the police for the rally. “We have so far identified over 450-500 members whose names figured on the letterheads and offence was registered against all of them,” Bhujbal said. Reportedly over 40,000 people had participated in the the morcha even as cops intercepted vehicles carrying people from various parts of the district. A delegation met the SDO of Pusad and submitted a memorandum of their demands in a case of road rage in which a member of the community was killed. On December 3, one Laxman Rathod and a youth from Kali (Daulat Khan) village were involved in a road rage. A group of youths allegedly stabbed Rathod’s younger brother Shyam with a sword. Shyam died on the spot. An FIR was filed against six persons and police arrested them. All the accused were produced before the court. Cops obtained their PCR twice and now the accused are under magisterial custody. The Gor Banjaras are not happy with the proceeding and are demanding trial in a fast-track court. They have also demanded compensation of Rs25 lakh to the family of the deceased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/collectors-order-defied-cops-book-500-for-taking-out-morcha/articleshow/88364785.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: 17 duped of Rs 38 lakh in ponzi cryptocurrency scheme||RAJKOT: The Rajkot crime branch on Saturday arrested two persons from Surat for allegedly cheating 17 people of Rs 38 lakh by floating a ponzi scheme involving cryptocurrency. Police said that the mastermind of the ponzi scheme were based in Dubai. The arrested accused Brijesh Gadiyali and Kiran Panchasara, both are residents of Surat. While two other accused Dhaval Laheri and Hitesh Gupta are still at large. According to police, the four accused had floated the scheme in September 2020 and lured people into investing in cryptocurrency. They also created a portal ‘cybertron.live’ and made people sign smart contracts. The accused told people to invest in Tron, a cryptocurrency, paid them 2% return per day in their digital wallet. In a way, the investment tripled in 150 days. They asked the investors to find others like them to triple their investment instantly and earn an additional 10% commission. The 17 victims of the scheme had invested Rs 52.20 lakh over the period and they got back Rs 13.90 lakh through various channels viz bank transfers, cash and through angadiya. Rajkot crime branch police inspector V K Gadhvi said, “Early this year, the accused held a mega-show in Udaipur, Rajasthan, and launched their own cryptocurrency Megatron and promised investors that the market value of both Tron and Megatron would remain same. They converted all Tron cryptocurrency into the Megatron and on the very next day, the value of the Megatron fell to Rs 00.001.” At least Rs 38 lakh of investors was washed out overnight. Rajkot police commissioner Manoj Agarwal said, “While we have arrested two, their masterminds are believed to be abroad. The fraud network started from Surat and spread to Rajkot.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/17-duped-of-rs-38l-in-ponzi-cryptocurrency-scheme/articleshow/88363441.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata hosts Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s son’s photo exhibition||KOLKATA: Twenty one-year-old Raihan Rajiv Vadra lost sight in his left eye while playing a game of cricket. But his passion for photography, says the son of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on his solo debut photography exhibition at Swabhumi in Kolkata, only got better after that accident. A student of politics at SOAS University of London, Raihan is now happy observing politics from a distance and pursuing photography professionally. The first thing that catches the eye about his ten backlit photographs inside a dark enclosure is his love for high contrast. Be it photographing ‘solitude’ of a Shimla landscape or the ‘secret’ hidden in the portrait of a girl – Raihan has an eye for a wide range of subjects. Ask him his favourite and he points at a tiger and says, “That’s my crown jewel. This was clicked in Ranthambore in October 2020.” Wanting to pursue a career in photography with the challenges of loss of sight in one eye isn’t easy. Raihan downplays the challenges and says he sees the world in a different way now. “I prefer that perspective as a photographer. Personally, you can overcome anything in life. I have a little trouble driving and crossing the road. But I wouldn’t have got back to photography as much if I hadn’t got injured. My photography has become better since I got injured,” he insists. His tryst with photography began as a childhood hobby, taking photographs of animals in the wild. In terms of wildlife photographs, he looks up to his mother who has a book on Ranthambore. “I am actually self-taught. I had done a two-week course in New York. Mom had initially taught me everything. I whacked all her camera equipment. She got this interest in photography from my grandfather (Rajiv Gandhi). He was an avid photographer too.” At home, Raihan’s favourites are some landscape works of her mother and grandfather. “There is one good photograph of my nani (Sonia Gandhi) that my grandfather had taken.” He insists that his mother is one of his best critics. Praise comes his way if he takes a good shot. “But she doesn’t avoid saying if I have cut off the tiger’s tail!” On his idols, he takes many names including American photographer Steve McCurry who is remembered for his picture of the piercing green-eyed Afghan girl. “However, I don’t do portrait studies. I look everywhere for inspiration. I also have a friend – Sujat Roy – whose work with cameras is really good.” Kolkata’s monuments and taxis have compelled him to go behind the lens. “Delhi has interesting stories in terms of photography. Kolkata has a higher contrast in terms of colours. Contrast is always high. The yellow taxis against the different coloured buses – it is a photographer’s dream,” he says. He doesn’t mind the influx of mobile-friendly photographers at all. In fact, eight of his 10 photos on display at Swabhumi were clicked using mobile camera. “Art and photography are all about people telling their own stories. So, it has to be accessible to everybody,” he points out. Raihan still has two months left at SOAS to complete his course in politics. With a degree in politics, doesn’t he want to join active politics some day? “When I had to choose what to study at SOAS, I was having some mental health issues because of what had happened with my eye. I needed to choose a degree that would leave a lot open for me after I was done. A degree in politics allows that. Unless it is a big event, I don’t follow the news since there is a lot of negativity and I am a positive person. Currently, I want to be happy doing photography and like to observe politics from a distance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-hosts-priyankas-sons-photo-exhibition/articleshow/88364216.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The suspects have been identified as Ravindra Bhosale, Lakhan Chavan and Kultya Bhosale. All of them are residents of Gangapur taluka in Aurangabad district. As per the release by the Ahmednagar police, on the night of December 5, unidentified people broke into the house of a 65-year-old man, Baban Belhekar, in Kangoni village of Newasa taluka. They threatened Belhekar and his mother with sharp weapons and robbed the gold chain, which the elderly woman was wearing and took the cash kept inside a cupboard. Cash and jewellery worth Rs 3.36 lakh were robbed. After a case of armed dacoity was registered with the Shani Shingnapur police, the case was simultaneously investigated by the local crime branch of the Ahmednagar police on the instructions of police superintendent Manoj Patil. During the investigation, police inspector Anil Katke of the local crime branch received the information about Ravindra Bhosale’s involvement in the dacoity. A team of the police then left for Aurangabad and traced him. On grilling him, he gave the names of the other two, who were involved in the dacoity. After the arrest of the trio, the police detected five cases of robbery and dacoity registered against them in Rahuri, Newasa, Pathardi and Shani Shingnapur police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ahmednagar-cops-arrest-three-in-connection-with-dacoity-in-newasa-taluka/articleshow/88363443.cms||---
---||Delhi||Fight for survival: With limited shelters, homeless in Delhi left to face the elements in open||NEW DELHI: After a day’s hard work, it was disappointing for Pawan, who earns Rs 10-50 a day pushing a loaded rickshaw, not to find a bed in the two winter shelters in Kashmere Gate on Friday night. At both the shelters for the homeless, the beds were all taken up by the time he reached there. Pawan had no option but to brave the night under the winter sky. Lying on a tarpaulin sheet and a piece of foam, Pawan covered himself and another labourer, Shankar, with a bedsheet and a thin blanket. “As a labourer, I hardly earn Rs 100 per day, not even enough for basic expenses. My work gets over by 8pm, but the night shelters are fully occupied by then because most people start arriving there around 6pm,” shrugged Pawan, who was among the 15 homeless s found sleeping on a pavement near north Delhi’s Monastery flyover on Friday. Shankar added, “It is freezing cold in the open, but what choice do we have?” With the temperature dipping, the homeless are turning to night shelters to brave the cold. As most of them are fully occupied by 8 pm, many of them are forced to spend the night in the open. Mukul Pal, another labourer, said, “I managed to sleep for two nights at a shelter home. However, I was late on Friday and when I visited the temporary shelter home, all 10 beds were occupied. Left with no option, I joined my friends on the pavement.” According to Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), 277 winter shelters have been set up. Though the original capacity of these was 19,340, social distancing norms due to Covid reduced the beds to 8,706. DUSIB data showed 4,969 inmates stayed at day shelters at the 277 sites, while 6,969 people spent the night there on Friday. DUSIB said 17 rescue teams have shifted 2,594 homeless to the nearest shelter homes since October 30. Ashok Pandey, campaign coordinator of NGO Housing and Land Network Rights, who also visited the shelters on Friday night, said, “This winter, DUSIB is erecting more tent shelters than in previous years. But this is not in proportion to the homeless population.” DUSIB member Bipin Rai said, “We have tents available on standby and we will put them up in the areas from where we receive information about homeless people gathering. When our rescue teams find people sitting on the pavement, they take them to the nearest shelter home, though we don’t coerce people into going with us. We have deployed 16 rescue vans across the city.” Rai added the staff at night shelters request people to wear masks, though during its visit, TOI noticed that most of the inmates weren’t wearing masks. When TOI visited the temporary shelter home Yamuna Bazar in Kashmere Gate on Friday, 11 people were sleeping on 10 beds. Two inmates, Vicky and Mangal, who were sharing a bed said, “Both of us work at the same site as labourers and when we found only one bed vacant, we decided to share it.” At Yamuna Pushta in Kashmere Gate, 12 shelter homes with 350 beds were operational. They were almost fully occupied by 9pm on Friday. Shailendra Sinha, who is in charge of the facility, said, “Around 90% of the inmates arrive when we serve dinner at 7.30pm. Given the high demand, we have informed DUSIB and a temporary shelter with 60 beds will be set up on Saturday.” It was similar in the night shelters in Sarai Kale Khan. At one of the permanent shelter homes for families, Ravi, there with his wife and six kids, said they have been sleeping on the mattress on the floor because no beds were available. Another inmate, Kalu, grumbled the television was not working. However, there still were a few families sleeping on the pavement near Sarai Kale Khan bus stand. Mamta, trying to console her two-year-old son while her other two children slept on a bedsheet on the pavement, said, “I have never been to a night shelter because my husband doesn’t want to go there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fight-for-survival-with-limited-shelters-homeless-left-to-face-the-elements-in-open/articleshow/88365275.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Surat||Rs 1 lakh for college achieving 100% vaccination first||Surat: Pushing the vaccination drive harder, the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has announced awarding Rs 1 lakh as prize to a college that will achieve hundred percent vaccination first. The other two top colleges will get Rs 75,000 and Rs 50,000, respectively in next 15 days. Top SMC officials suspect that majority of the colleges in the city are yet to achieve 100 percent target.“SMC will invite offers from colleges who have achieved 100 percent vaccination of all eligible individuals. The first three achievers will be awarded prize money,” said Banchhanidhi Pani, city municipal commissioner. According to the criteria, all eligible individuals including students, teachers, administrative and other staff of the college will have to be vaccinated. Civic officials will hold a meeting with college principals at Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU). On the other hand, a 55-year-old Kenyan national has been isolated at Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER) after he tested positive of Covid-19 on Friday. The NRI, an accountant, had come to Mumbai for his brother’s treatment and later reached the city by road where he tested positive in a test conducted at a private laboratory. “Though Kenya is not among ‘at-risk countries’, but he has been admitted in isolation as a precautionary measure and safety of the patient. He, however, has shown no symptoms,” said a health official. Among eight fresh cases reported on Saturday, six have travel histories of visiting Ahmedabad, Rajasthan and Kerala. BOX 1.5 lakh take 2nd jab for edible oil gift The one-litre of edible oil for people coming forward to take the second dose of vaccine lured more than 1.5 lakh persons. Total 6.13 lakh were expected to take the second dose before November 26 when the scheme was launched by Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) with support of Yuva Unstoppable. “Soon the vaccination numbers went up and the numbers came down to 4.6 lakh,” said a health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/rs-1-lakh-for-college-achieving-100-vaccination-first/articleshow/88363471.cms||---
---||Nashik||Financial woes of sugar mills to soon end: Shah||Ahmednagar: Union cooperation minister Amit Shah said steps are being taken to ease the financial problems of the cooperative sugar mills involved in ethanol production. “These sugar mills have entered into tripartite agreements with oil marketing companies (OMCs) and escrow accounts are being opened for them. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will soon give its endorsement to such escrow accounts for credit worthiness. These steps will enable the sugar mills to come out of the financial crisis they have been facing for the past four-five years,” said Shah. He was addressing a gathering on Saturday at Pravaranagar near Loni in Ahmednagar district during a state-level conference on cooperatives and farmers. The event was organised by Shirdi BJP MLA Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil. Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and state BJP president Chandrakant Patil were present at the event. Shah said that the Narendra Modi government is going all out to help the cooperative sugar mills in the country. “The Centre has imposed import duty on raw sugar and is also providing subsidies for sugar export. Our government is also working to ensure that the sugar mills produce greater amounts of ethanol and get better prices,” he added. Stating that the cooperative movement in Maharashtra had a glorious past, Shah lamented that rampant corruption has ruined most of these financial institutions. “Our endeavour will be to see that these sugar mills in the state run efficiently and no cooperative mill is privatised in the state,” he added. Shah also took a dig at the state government for its alleged partisan attitude in helping the sugar mills that are managed by its political friends. “The state government must rise above petty politics in financing cooperatives that are politically friendly to it. My ministry will not remain a mute spectator if such step-motherly treatment is given to the cooperatives that are run by the state government’s political opponents,” he said. Stating that his ministry will spell out a new policy for cooperatives in the country, Amit Shah said that it is imperative for the cooperatives to run in a professional manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/financial-woes-of-sugar-mills-to-soon-end-shah/articleshow/88363452.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Kolkata||Another feather in cap: Kolkata gets its third Milestone plaque||KOLKATA: The world’s largest technical professional organization for advancement of technology presented the prestigious IEEE Milestone to CESC on Saturday. The coveted bronze plaque weighing 8.5kg shipped from the US for installation at CESC House acknowledges CESC of “heralding the era of electricity in the Indian subcontinent”. It is the first electric supply company in south Asia to switch on thermal generation on April 17, 1899, in Calcutta. This is the city’s third Milestone plaque after the one at Presidency University for Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose’s pioneering work and the other at the Indian Association for Cultivation of Science for Sir CV Raman’s experiment. “The Milestone programme honours significant technical achievements in electrical, electronic & computer engineering and the associated sciences and recognizes great moments throughout our world’s long history of technical innovation and they are a symbol around the world of how electrical engineering and computing have helped to build the modern world and bring people closer together,” explained IEEE president and CEO Kathy S Land. The plaque was received by CESC managing directors Rabi Chowdhury (generation) and Debasish Banerjee (distribution) from Sushmita Mitra, chairperson of IEEE, Kolkata. “The IEEE Milestone is the most coveted award for any power company in the world, and this token of appreciation will encourage us to continue with further technological innovations which benefit mankind,” said Chowdhury. “The growth of CESC since its distribution service began in 1899 has been steady and fascinating. Currently, CESC distributes power to a licensed area of 567sq km. We feel honoured that the world’s most renowned technical organization has accepted CESC as a milestone in the history of electrical engineering,” Banerjee added. Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is the world’s largest technical organization, comprising 4,00,000 members in 160 countries dedicated to advancing innovation and excellence in all aspects of electrical, electronic, computing fields and related areas of technology. Amongst the scientists associated with the organization were Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/another-feather-in-cap-kolkata-gets-its-third-milestone-plaque/articleshow/88364219.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Delhi||Cough syrup given to kids under scanner||New Delhi: At least 16 children were recently admitted to Kalawati Saran Children’s hospital due to poisoning allegedly caused by a drug. Three of them died. An enquiry conducted by the central government said that the drug was administered to these children at a mohalla clinic run by the state government. The director general of health services (DGHS), the Union health ministry, has asked its counterpart in Delhi government to issue a notice to all dispensaries/mohalla clinics to not prescribe the drug — a cough suppressant — to children who are less than four years of age. The DGHS has also suggested withdrawing the drug in public interest, which was manufactured by a multi-national company. “This drug is a centrally acting cough suppressant. It causes side-effects such as sedation and, therefore, it is not given to children. However, the side effects cannot be so serious in so many children. It is possible that the drugs were contaminated, or there were other issues. It needs detailed investigation and appropriate action,” said a senior paediatrician, who did not want to be quoted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cough-syrup-given-to-kids-under-scanner/articleshow/88365283.cms||---
---||Kolkata||St Lawrence former students to fete Pulin Sir on his 100th birthday||Kolkata: It’s the annual sports day at St Lawrence High School. Spectators are waiting anxiously under the pandal on the edge of the playground. Some students start their show of human pyramid formation that one gets to witness only at a military tattoo. A large iron ring with thick cotton wrapping soaked in kerosene is lit up, the flames lurk in the wind. There is pin-drop silence and tension is palpable. A stoutly built, middle-aged man in white trousers and white T-shirt boldly runs towards the ring of fire and dives effortlessly through it. His students follow him and complete the drill. That is Pulin Sir, the former physical education teacher who turns 100 on December 28. He will be felicitated by his former students on December 26, at the school where he served for 43 years (1944 to 1987). “I am overwhelmed by the invitation from former students who still stay in touch with me,” said Pulin Makhal. The current principal of the school, Fr Jimmy Keepuram, is elated to be a part of the momentous occasion. Given his age and frail health, bringing him to Calcutta from his home in the interiors of Magrahat in South 24 Parganas is a major challenge, acknowledges Justice Soumen Sen, one of his former students (class of 1982). While in service, he would walk to the station 8km from his house at 4am and return late at night. Remembers Debasish Chatterjee, MD and CEO of Mindtree and a Lawrencian from the class of 1981: “I ave fond memories of Pulin Sir standing quietly outside our classroom. That was a signal for us to line up and go to the playground. Those unscheduled breaks were always welcome.” Agrees Satish Pai, another student from the class of 1978 and now MD of Hindalco: “Sir was always firm and made sure we took the PE class properly.” Apart from the sports day, Pulin Sir would come into his own on the annual Rector’s Day, celebrated through a staff versus students’ football match. He would stand like a wall under the goal post and dive fearlessly to fist away volleys from students less than a quarter his age. “I did not realize he is so much older to us,” says Professor Ashok Jhunjhunwala of IIT-Chennai and a Padma Shri recipient (class of 1971). “He used to play with us as equals,” he adds. Neurosurgeon Amitabha Chanda and his student from the class of 1981 couldn’t agree more. “Pulin Sir was our fitness icon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/st-lawrence-former-students-to-fete-pulin-sir-on-his-100th-birthday/articleshow/88364239.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The headmasters will be trained in conflict management, training, motivation, team management and introduce newer ways of learning in these schools. Gradually, more schools will be brought under the ambit of this programme and heads will undergo training by the faculty members of IIM-Calcutta. “We have chosen these 1,300 schools for focussed intervention and we want the heads of these schools to be drivers of growth. The idea is to make learning a pleasant experience for students and introduce newer ways of learning. As this batch completes the programme, we will select more schools for this programme,” said state education minister Bratya Basu. Headmasters will be trained in the classrooms of IIM-Calcutta by the faculty of the business institute. “The headmasters will be trained in various facets of leadership like motivating students and their staff, how to manage conflicts, how to make their staff work as a cohesive team and start thinking out of the box as far as imparting education is concerned,” said a faculty member associated with the projects. “School headmasters educate the students at their impressionable age and higher education institutes like us reap the benefits when they come to study here. It is our privilege to share some knowledge with them because their role in realising the goal of the fundamental ‘Right to Education’ is paramount,” said Uttam Kumar Sarkar, director of IIM-Calcutta. The leadership development programme is scheduled to be organised in small batches in December 2021 and January 2022. “We had a very enriching session. This leadership development programme will change the way we approach lot of issues in our professional lives,” said the headmaster of a Kolkata-based school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-school-heads-get-iim-training-for-new-age-teaching/articleshow/88364228.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Goa||Put Goa first, self-development canwait: Freedom fighters to politicians||Sitting in the balcony of her house at Madicotto, Cuncolim, 85-year-old freedom fighter Sushila Narayan Padiyar pores over the day’s newspaper. Abruptly she stops, her weathered face screwing into a grimace of distaste. “It’s true that circumstances dictate changes,” Padiyar says, trying to make sense of the latest developments. “But the chaos and bedlam that we are currently witnessing in today’s politics is something that makes me sick—these party-hopping antics, these new lows of politics… but I don’t want to talk about that.” Padiyar’s concerns stem from her earnest desire that Goa, the state for which she sacrificed her youth—should remain in “safe hands” and be governed by Goans. “We are capable enough of running our own state, aren’t we? Do we need outsiders for that?” Pun notwithstanding, the octogenarian says she takes keen interest in state’s politics and has her own views about the current political affairs. So, what kind of Goa had she dreamt of when she plunged into the freedom struggle? “There wasn’t any dream for Goa,” she says matter-of-factly. “Achieving freedom from the Portuguese yoke was our sole mission, and we were ready to lay down our lives for it. Arms were trained at me several times by the Portuguese police, but I didn’t cow down before them. I was determined to get freedom for Goa, no matter if I had to pay with my life for it.” Padiyar was hardly 18 when she plunged into the freedom struggle. The anger and frustration she felt for not being able to pursue her further education owing to lack of educational facilities in Portuguese Goa inspired her to fight the Portuguese. Largely echoing Padiyar’s views, Ramdas Prabhugaonkar, another freedom fighter, who now resides in Mumbai, says while the state has witnessed a lot of development, it’s the politics that has plunged new depths which he feels, is a cause for concern. “Politicians now are more concerned about one’s own development rather than thinking about Goa’s welfare first. This is a worrying trend and needs to end. They should put Goa first before anything else, this is my only wish, nothing beyond that.”  Prabhugaonkar, too, was barely 18 and had just answered his matriculation exams when the liberation movement beckoned him.  Post-liberation, Prabhugaonkar engaged himself in social work, and declined an invitation into politics extended to him by Goa’s first chief minister Dayanand Bandodkar himself. “With Goa getting liberated, my mission was over. Goa of Goans should be back into the hands of Goans—that was our mission and we had achieved it,” says Prabhugaonkar.  Dreams about things like development and progress held secondary importance at that time for the freedom fighters. “The Portuguese used to torture the satyagrahis in a most cruel manner, but we weren’t bothered about those beatings. Freedom was our goal and driving away the Portuguese, our only mission. We had no expectations or dreams about post-liberation Goa,” says Prabhugaonkar.  Madhav Prabhudessai, however, is more forthright. “Goa’s politics has lost its compass. It’s unacceptable, the kind of things we are seeing in today’s politics,” he says. “Our expectations (of post-liberation Goa) were quite different. We had participated in the liberation movement with absolutely no expectations. Our only wish was that Goa be liberated so that it is set on the path of development, and to make that happen, we took that plunge in the satyagraha.”  Gopal Chitari, a freedom fighter from Cuncolim, shares Prabhudesai’s not so charitable views about Goa’s politics. “This isn’t the freedom we gave our blood and tears for,” he says in a feeble voice, almost to himself. “I sometimes wonder if we have really achieved freedom in the real sense of the term.”  With defections taking place so very often with no regard to political ideologies, Chitari says, “Democracy has been reduced to a mockery, as it’s difficult to identify who belongs to the ruling dispensation and who is from the opposition side.”  Vaman Prabhugaonkar, another veteran freedom fighter from Margao, attempts to place his finger on the malaise of Goa’s politics. “Politics of principles has disappeared from Goa’s politics. What we are seeing is the politics of convenience and self-centeredness. That should end.”  His solution: “Reduce your greed. Think of Goa’s interest first. Put Goa first. Rest will fall in place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/put-goa-first-self-development-canwait-freedom-fighters-to-politicians/articleshow/88364811.cms||Govind Maad
---||Delhi||Ready for another Covid wave, follow all norms: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who joined Christmas celebrations at the Delhi assembly on Saturday evening, said the Delhi government was well prepared to deal with another Covid-19 wave if it struck. He urged people to continue to follow all Covid protocols. “Delhi government is doing everything in its capacity to keep the Covid situation under control. Ever since the news of the Omicron strain arrived, I have been taking repeated review meetings with all concerned departments so that we are well prepared to deal with the probable threat. It’s also being said that this particular strain is not as dangerous – has mild symptoms but spreads easily. So, there’s no need to stress over it or be afraid,” Kejriwal stated. “We will work together to deal with whatever befalls us as a unit. We were able to tide over the horrors of the second wave and I am sure that we will also be able to control another possible wave with the grace of God,” he added. Delhi’s vaccination coverage is high and elaborate health facilities have been arranged, which will help the capital avoid any wave, the CM stated. “We found out in the sero survey that 96% people were having antibodies for the coronavirus in Delhi, which reduces the chances of catching the virus significantly. Despite this, in case of a spread, we are prepared with all the resources. We have upgraded our health facilities, including beds, oxygen and medicines, after learning our lesson from all that we had lacked during the second wave. Hence, we are well prepared to deal with another wave if it strikes,” he said. The event at Delhi assembly saw Christmas carols spread merry all around with traditional Konkani carols being performed by church choirs along with Hindi and English choirs. Kejriwal wished everyone Merry Christmas. He stated that India is a bouquet of religions and cultures, thus, AAP decided to uphold the country’s unique identity by celebrating festivals of all faiths at the Delhi assembly. Delhi government is preparing to take Christian pilgrims on a government-funded pilgrimage to Velankanni in January 2022 under Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-ready-for-another-wave-follow-all-norms/articleshow/88365607.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Sputnik demand up after Omicron effectiveness news||PUNE: Four out of the five city hospitals administering Sputnik V registered its demand doubling or tripling over the last two weeks, after reports of the Russian vaccine being effective against Omicron. Dr Madhav Chavan, the managing director of Phoenix Hospital, told TOI, “Daily vaccinations with Sputnik V have doubled, after reports of Omicron started circulating. People have been coming from various cities in Maharashtra, such as Navi Mumbai, Kolhapur, Satara and many other places to get a Sputnik shot. The demand has increased for both first and second doses of the vaccine. In comparison to other vaccines like Covishield or Covaxin, the demand for Sputnik has seen a much higher spike, by up to 50-60%.” Dr Anant Kulkarni, deputy medical superintendent, Shatayu Hospital, Hinjewadi, said, “The demand for Sputnik has surged — from three to five people turning up for it per day a few weeks ago to 20-25 daily for both the doses in the last couple of weeks. On Saturday, we had six people from Satara for the pending second dose.” Dr Bhagyashri Pujari, in-charge, administration, New Life Child Care Clinic and Hospital said, “We are seeing an equal demand for the first and the second dose of Sputnik V. The surge in demand has coincided with the period when reports of Omicron began doing the rounds. A few weeks ago, we were using a single vial per day or not even one per day. But nowadays, we are able to use three to four Sputnik V vials per day.” Dr Rajesh Auti, vaccinator, SM Joshi Hospital, Khadki, told TOI, “Sputnik demand has increase two- to three-fold. Earlier, we would have 8-12 people for Sputnik V shots. As soon as the government announced additional curbs in Mumbai after the Omicron detection in the state, the demand for Sputnik surged even in Pune. We’re now inoculating 50-60 people per day with Sputnik V.” Dr Murali Rao of Manipal Hospitals, Pune, differed. The hospital had not seen a significant change in the demand for Sputnik in the last couple of weeks, Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sputnik-demand-up-after-omicron-effectiveness-news/articleshow/88364819.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Delta still dominant circulating strain in India: ICMR||PUNE: The Indian Council of Medical Research on Saturday said the Delta variant of coronavirus continued to be the dominant circulating strain in India and Omicron had not replaced it yet, meaning ongoing prevention measures and vaccines would remain effective. “While Omicron numbers may increase, it may not necessarily cause a heavy burden on the healthcare system. However, states have to be on the guard,” said Dr Samiran Panda, the additional director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Against the backdrop of Omicron cases crossing the 100-mark in the country on Friday, Panda said a majority of them were travel-related. This picture emerged from samples sequenced so far and more details on Omicron was awaited, he said. “So, citizens should continue to practice all Covid protocols as preventive measures and be assured that the current vaccines are effective,” Panda said. The ICMR scientist said the total number of individuals detected in our country with Omicron mutant was too small to draw any inference on community transmission of this variant of SARS-CoV-2 “All that one could say from such a small reported number of individuals infected with Omicron variant in the country is that some of these cases had an indicative history of travel and some had history of contact with confirmed cases, no plausible exposure could be identified for the rest. It is also important to appreciate that the number of infected individuals do not necessarily mean the number of symptomatic cases. The terms ‘infected individuals’ and ‘cases’ or ‘patients of Omicron’ are not synonymous,” he said. The scientist said this was in conformity with the observed transmission dynamics reported from South Africa and other countries. These nations had started reporting an increased number of infected individuals but not higher utilisation of oxygen or ventilators by severely ill individuals or deaths, he said. This indicated asymptomatic cases of Omicron might have the potential to spread the infection to others, many of whom were not facing serious clinical illness, Panda said. Given the smaller number of detected cases, airport-linked and travel history-based testing being practised now in India is, therefore, logical. “Any additional public health actions, such as community-based testing, on top of the existing testing strategy should not be proposed based on panic. They should be critically examined from the perspective of clinical relevance, known natural history of infection transmission of this variant and overall public health benefit,” Panda said. ICMR stated that all the states should ensure that there was no mass gathering, no non-essential travel within the country or abroad and low-key festivities It advised states to ensure scaling up vaccination and masking up. ICMR also directed the states to keep health infrastructure ready..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/icmr-delta-still-dominant-circulating-strain-in-india/articleshow/88364802.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||4 years for PF official who sought Rs 5k for to pay amt||Mumbai: A special CBI court on Friday convicted and sentenced a city-based senior social security assistant of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation to four years rigorous imprisonment after he was caught red handed, taking a bribe of Rs 5,000 from a man to clear his provident fund dues. Finding the accused, Sujit Sinha, guilty under Prevention of Corruption Act, special CBI judge, AS Sayyad, also fined him Rs 10,000. Sinha has been out on bail. Special public prosecutor Sandeep Singh cited the evidence of 11 witness to substantiate the charges against the accused. It was the prosecution’s case that the complainant, Gajanan Athawale, was an employee of Lilly Jewelery Pvt Ltd, Andheri, which sshut down in 2014. While in service, Athawale contributed towards Provident Fund. In 2015, he submitted two requests for withdrawal of his Provident Fund, but both requests were rejected in September, 2015. Athawale then submitted a form to the Provident Fund commissioner, Kandivli, but again his request was rejected. The accused, who was working in the department, informed Athawale on phone that a particular form had to be signed and stamped by the company where he was working. Athawale obtained the required signature. When the form was being verified, the accused asked the complainant to visit the Provident Fund office on October 13, 2015. On that day, Sinha asked Athawale to pay a bribe of Rs 7,000 if he wanted early processing of his application to withdraw the Provident Fund amount. After negotiations, the amount was reduced to Rs 5,000. Athawale did not intend to pay and lodged a complaint with the Central Bureau of Investigation, Anti-Corruption Bureau. On October 16, 2015, a trap was laid and the accused was caught red handed while accepting the bribe amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/4-years-for-pf-official-who-sought-rs-5k-for-to-pay-amt/articleshow/88346260.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Additional Superintendent of Police (rural) Vidya Sagar Mishra said Bhupendra Pandey, who worked at a private clinic, was arrested after his wife's brother called 'Dial 112', a helpline that provides quick response. Mishra added that Pandey's health deteriorated in police custody and he was rushed to the hospital, where he died during treatment. On the cause of his sudden illness, the ASP said, the man had possibly poisoned himself, adding that his death had nothing to do with his arrest. Crying foul, Pandey's kin blocked the Moradabad-Haridwar state highway and demanded action against police officials along with Pandey’s wife and her brother. It was only after police assured the protesters that an FIR would be registered and a fair probe would be conducted that the latter lifted the blockade. Mishra told TOI, “The victim would often beat up his wife and several complaints were lodged against him. When police detained him for questioning, he said that he had consumed poison much before his arrest. We have registered an FIR under the section of murder on the complaint of victim’s father against victim’s wife and brother-in-law. Arrests will be made once the probe is completed."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/detained-for-thrashing-wife-man-dies-in-police-custody-cops-say-poison-cause-of-death/articleshow/88358806.cms||---

---||Goa||Navy sailor, who faced Portuguese bullets, lives a quiet Vasco life||PANAJI: Goans who are old enough to recall the day, remember where they were and what they were doing on December 18, 1961, when the Indian Armed Forces launched a three-pronged attack to liberate Goa. That morning began like any other for most people, but for a young naval recruit, Kansraj Sharma, it was not going too well. Sharma was part of the Indian Navy’s 80-member beach landing party tasked with storming Anjediva island in an attempt to dislodge the Portuguese. “I was just over 18, a raw recruit,” says Sharma, 80. With a defiant Portugal refusing to leave Goa, India had no option but to use force to evict the colonial power. The hostile Portuguese forces under governor general Vassalo e Silva would fire indiscriminately at local fishermen, and even shot at a merchant vessel, Sabarmati, prompting the Indian Navy to commence Operation Chutney. By then, the Indian Navy had already begun preparations for an amphibious assault on Anjediva. As early as November 1961, naval headquarters asked the naval station at INS Vendruthy, Cochin, for volunteers from the gunnery school. The young sailors were told that they were preparing for Navy week celebrations in December. Two young officers, Lieutenant Arun Auditto and Lieutenant (SD-G) Noel Kelman, a senior commissioned gunner, along with fresh recruits, were picked. Sharma was one of them. Auditto was placed in command and Kelman was second-in-command. “The men were put through basic training like crawling while carrying weapon such as rifles, Bren and Sten machine guns, mortars, grenades and demolition equipment. After a brief but intensive training, the beach assault troops embarked on the INS Trishul at Cochin on December 16 and sailed for the island off Karwar,” says Auditto, who retired as a rear admiral, in his writings. INS Trishul arrived just off Karwar, and on December 18, the 80-man ground assault team woke up at 4am, nervous but eager to storm the island. Ironically, the landing spot was known as Ladies’ beach. However, in the early daylight, lookouts noticed that the Portuguese garrison on the island had hoisted a white flag on the hill top in the northern end of the island. The first wave of the landing party quickly got into the boats and made their way to the island without incident. The remaining sailors under the command of Kelman started to make their way to the island 15 minutes later. Sharma was part of the second wave, and this is when the Portuguese opened fire with machine guns from the rampart overlooking the beach. “I don’t remember much of what happened at that moment. I was doing the seaman gunnery course at INS Vendruthy, and the next moment, I was fighting on land on the island,” says Sharma, speaking to TOI. He was felicitated by the Indian Navy on December 14 for his role in the operations. The Portuguese machine gun fire killed five sailors instantly and Kelman received gunshot wounds on both his thighs. “Kelman, with great presence of mind, continued towards the beach, zigzagging the boat to counter the gunfire,” says Commodore Srikant Kesnur as he recounted Kelman’s heroics. Sharma, along with the other sailors, took cover behind anything — a rock, bush or tree — jumping from cover to cover as they made their way to the Portuguese garrison. After a few rounds from INS Trishul’s 4.7 inch Bofors guns, the Portuguese troops realised it was futile and laid down their arms. “My last posting was in Goa and I decided to settle here since my home town in Punjab was restive due to the Khalistani movement,” says Sharma. Auditto, Kelman and others involved in the action were conferred with gallantry awards. A memorial was later erected on Anjediva Island, to commemorate those who had made the supreme sacrifice. A pioneer of the navy’s submarine arm, Rear Admiral Arun Auditto passed away earlier this year in April at the age of 86. Naval war hero and Kirti Chakra awardee Commander Noel Kelman passed away in August 2019 at Porvorim, at the age of 92.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/a-naval-sailor-who-faced-portuguese-bullets-now-lives-a-quiet-life-in-vasco/articleshow/88364829.cms||Newton Sequeira

Genome sequencing of their samples was done by The National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, Rane said. The three, including a couple, were in isolation at the state’s isolation facility at the Cansaulim health centre. “They are discharged from isolation and will continue to be in home isolation,” the health minister said. When the travellers from ‘at risk countries’ test positive for Covid-19 on arrival but test negative for Omicron, they can opt for home isolation and are treated as just another Covid patient in the state. On Friday, four persons who travelled to Goa from the UK, including one via Bengaluru on December 12, tested positive for Covid-19 and have been added to the list of Omicron suspects. These also include a 12-year-old.  Their samples have been sent for genome sequencing to NCCS, Pune and the results are awaited. Rane said if need arises, the health department has made provisions for isolation at the TB Hospital at Margao. At the launch of the USAID Rise project on December 16, Rane had requested help to strengthen the state’s testing facilities and set up a lab for genome sequencing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/three-uk-suspects-test-negative-for-omicron-discharged/articleshow/88364847.cms||---

Locals have been complaining to the authorities concerned regarding the spurt in dog bite cases and on Saturday, the dog was caught from the area by the south corporation staff. “I was just taking out stuff from my car on Friday when the dog came from behind and bit me in my leg. I had to punch the dog 2-3 times in the head, then it left my leg. The wounds were so deep that the bleeding did not stop even till today morning. We dread stepping out, authorities should seriously look into this,” said Suneel Kalra, 62, who was the latest victim of the dog. The senior citizen had to get 15 injections. Amit Gulati, president of the residents' welfare association of B1 Block, Janakpuri, said: “I called up the south corporation’s veterinary department on Friday, but they said they were busy with an enforcement drive and could come only after two days. We are living under fear, there are at least eight to nine dogs in the area. Children and adults do not feel safe on the streets.” However, later in the day, the dog was removed from the area and taken to a centre, which is run by the corporation. "It will be kept under observation for a few days to ascertain its behaviour," said a civic official. “I asked the authorities to remove the dog from the area and they have done it. If there is any other area in my jurisdiction which is having such problems, I will try to solve that too,” claimed Amarjeet Singh, local councillor. “My eight-year-old son was playing in the park outside our house when a dog bit him in the right arm. We rushed him to a nearby doctor, but the injection required was not available there. Then we went to another place where he was administered the injection. Two more rounds of injections are left and he has to suffer,” said Aseem Kalia, a businessman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stray-dog-bites-13-people-in-janakpuri-in-a-month-corpn-finally-catches-it/articleshow/88365299.cms||---

Recently, he won gold medals in several national events. But the sheen of Maheshwari’s glorious run on the medal tally is actually the unputdownable spirit and determination of this leukaemia survivor. Maheshwari, who battled cancer in 2017 and won, is now participating in the National Powerlifting Championship organised by the city police. An undeniable inspiration for all those who lose hope in times of crisis, Maheshwari does powerlifting to create awareness against cancer and drug addiction. An MA, BEd, MEd and MPhil, Maheshwari’s life challenges various other beliefs too. Despite his heavy exercise regime and weight training, the powerlifter eats only one meal in two days. “I eat only salad, fruit and sprouts once every two days. Though I get enough energy and am able to maintain the required fitness,” Maheshwari told TOI. He started PhD research in language and in between he also developed interest in Buddhism and monkhood. He went to stay with the Buddhist lamas in the Himalayas. “I learned many things that can help a person live a healthy life and survive well. These things helped me fight my battle against leukaemia,” said Maheshwari, who carries medical certificates of both when he was first detected with the life challenging disease and also when he got fully cured. “Within 45 days of recovering from leukaemia in 2017, I participated in a national powerlifting championship in Hyderabad and won,” he said, adding that he has been practising yoga and other forms of exercise since he was in college. “Maheshwari is an inspiration for all of us as he recovered from cancer and continued in the sports that require the best fitness and rigorous training,” said Dharmesh Patel, one of the organisers of the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/powerlifter-who-beat-cancer-inspires-others-to-dare/articleshow/88363499.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

A detailed complaint was submitted with the public health department in October, stated representatives of Corona Ekal Mahila Punarvasan Samiti and Jan Arogya Abhiyan, which have been fighting for the redressal of their complaints. All the 462 cases of overcharging are from 24 districts across the state. Two months after assurance by the state government, these women, who are struggling under the dual burden of loss of a family member, and huge covid-related hospital bills leading to massive debts, are still waiting for their complaints to be addressed. National co-convenor of Jan Swasthya Arogya Abhiyan Dr Abhay Shukla told TOI that it has been quite some time that the government had assured that necessary action would be taken against these hospitals and the amount would be reimbursed. “There should be no further delay,” he told TOI. The maximum number of overcharging complaints has been received from the ten districts – Nashik, Pune, Ahmednagar, Solapur, Aurangabad, Parbhani, Nagpur, Kolhapur, Sangli and Buldhana. According to the data, the largest number of overcharging complaints has been received from Nashik (98) and Pune (84). In 122 of the cases, the amounts charged by hospitals are above Rs2lakh (ranging up to Rs11.75lakh); in 97 cases, the per day hospital charges are above Rs15,000 per day, and in 75 cases, the charges are above Rs. 20,000 per day --- much higher than the maximum limit of Rs9,000 per day for ventilator care for serious cases, decided by the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/462-covid-widows-families-wait-for-redressal-of-overcharging-complaints/articleshow/88364831.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The scheme was to benefit the students of degree colleges, universities, class X and XII, and others. Sources say government is now planning to transfer Rs 12,000 into the bank accounts of students. Shortage of funds and unsatisfactory proposals from private companies could be the reasons behind the change of plan. The cost of the project was pegged at Rs 300 crore, which arose many questions and also a swipe by opposition. Also, there were chances of irregularities. Government has been working on the project for almost a year. And, with the elections nearing, it wanted the plan to materialise. Though a committee, which also included senior IAS officers, was formed, government invited tenders last month, which was too late and it became impossible to deliver the tablets to around 2.59 lakh students by year-end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-may-not-give-tablets-to-over-2-5l-students/articleshow/88364261.cms||Mohammad Anab

Some of the major projects Modi will inaugurate are the renovated Fort Aguada jail museum, the super-specialty block at Goa Medical College (GMC), the new South Goa district hospital, the aviation skill development centre at Mopa airport, and the gas-insulated substation at Davorlim-Navelim, Margao. The GMC’s super-specialty block, constructed at a cost of over Rs 380 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana, is the only state-of-the-art super-specialty public hospital in Goa that provides high-end services to the public. It has services like angioplasty, bypass surgery, kidney transplant, dialysis, etc, and will house a 1,000lpm PSA plant. The district hospital, built at a cost of around Rs 220 crore, is equipped with modern medical infrastructure including OPD services in 33 specialities. It will have the latest diagnostic and laboratory facilities and services like physiotherapy and audiometry. The hospital has 500 oxygenated beds, a 5,500-litre LMO tank, and 2 PSA plants of 600lpm. Meanwhile, the re-development of the Aguada Fort jail museum as a heritage tourism destination has been done at a cost of over Rs 28 crore. Before Goa’s Liberation, this fort was used to incarcerate and torture freedom fighters. The museum will highlight the contributions and sacrifices made by prominent freedom fighters who fought for Liberation. The skill development centre at Mopa, built at a cost of Rs 8.5 crore, will provide training in 16 job profiles. And the Davorlim substation, constructed at a cost of Rs 16 crore, will provide power to surrounding villages. Modi will also lay the foundation stone for the India International University of Legal Education and Research of the Bar Council of India trust, aimed at transforming Goa into a hub of higher and technical education. Ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, Modi’s visit is also expected to galvanise BJP workers in the state. State BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade told TOI that Modi is the tallest leader of the party, and his visit will definitely boost the morale of karyakartas. “We launched our poll campaign during the visit of BJP national president J P Nadda. Modi’s visit will further enhance the enthusiasm of karyakartas,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/on-one-day-trip-pm-to-inaugurate-devpt-projects-worth-over-rs-650cr/articleshow/88364837.cms||---

The iPhone recovered from Chandrashekhar, who is currently in a Delhi prison booked under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), is supposed to have crucial clues about the web of intrigue he created to swindle crores out of the rich and influential by preying on their vulnerability. However, the investigating officers could not open the password-protected encrypted phone. Chandrashekhar has stonewalled all efforts of the agency to get him reveal the password. The findings of the forensic lab will be of immense significance, with details emerging that a few influential persons, including those who spent time in Tihar, have not come forward with their accounts of how they fell victim to the master of deception who passed himself off as powerful functionaries to promise his victims a quick escape from their legal troubles. Chandrashekhar would spoof phone numbers to convince his targets that they could buy their way out of the prison and collected crores of rupees that he would splurge on his girlfriend and actresses. Though hackers can break open iPhones, the ED has decided to go to a public forensics laboratory to pre-empt the possibility of Chandrashekhar’s lawyer taking the plea that data retrieved from his phone were contaminated because of the “unauthorised access” and could not be relied upon. Apple has consistently refused to share the password of iPhones of even those who are accused of serious crimes. The company declined repeated pleas of US's Federal Bureau of Investigation which needed to access the details stored on iPhones of Syed Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik who were behind the killing of 14 people in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, in 2015. The national security reasons cited by the federal agency failed to move the smartphone maker to tamper its own security features. Sources said the investigating officers are intrigued by the photos appearing in the media of Chandrashekhar’s intimate shots with actor Jacqueline Fernandes, who too has been questioned multiple times at the ED headquarters in Delhi for having received part of the ‘proceeds of crime’ from the accused. They suspect that the photos could have been leaked by a disgruntled member of his team. An investigation trail revealed Chandrashekhar had been making spoof calls to several industrialists, politicians and Bollywood stars, impersonating an officer of the home ministry, as the law secretary, or a leading real estate developer. Chandrashekhar, according to the probe, carried a software in his phone that was used to spoof calls of several government officials, including those of the ED headquarters. He collected more than Rs 200 crore from behind bars and had many Bollywood actresses among his visitors in the prison cell in Delhi where he was lodged, running an uninterrupted extortion racket allegedly with the help of the police. In a recent chargesheet filed against Chandrashekhar, booked under the PMLA, the ED has listed huge fund transfers to actor Jacqueline Fernandes and to her siblings in US and Australia besides costly gifts presented to her by the conman. A senior ED official said they are surprised to find three pages from its chargesheet leaked in the media and are trying to ascertain the motive behind it as it suspects the role of the conman or his lawyer behind the act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/conman-sukeshs-iphone-sent-to-forensic-experts-for-data-retrieval/articleshow/88365301.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||Ahmedabad||Bapu’s thoughts seen in action overseas||Loga Abel Mbarago from Sudan has set up a centre in his native country to promote Gandhian principles. Several Gujarat Vidyapith alumni like Mbarago are applying the Mahatma’s ideals to initiatives in their countries. Over the past decade, about 70 overseas students have studied here. The university has designed two programmes for international students: International Course on Gandhian Nonviolence: Theory and Practice, and Master’s in Gandhian Thoughts which is offered in the self-study mode. Since 2011, the programmes have attracted students from Germany, South Sudan, Kenya, Nepal, Argentina, Mexico, the US, Brazil, Canada, Australia, and France, according to Prem Anand Mishra of the Faculty of Gandhian Studies. Till now, five batches have graduated, he added. "Many of these students have set up centres of learning in their native countries to further spread Gandhism," he said. The university provides free food, accommodation, and inland transportation to overseas students. Nai Talim Education, which was promoted by Mahatma Gandhi in 1937, is considered by many experts as the starting point of all skill-development efforts after Independence. It was mandatory for Gujarat Vidyapith to run several courses which respect both labour and skill. Some of the value-added courses such as foundation and advanced certificate programmes are offered in 14 Indian languages and six foreign languages. The courses can be completed in German and Japanese. The hub for these overseas students is Bharatiya Bhasha Sanskriti Sansthan. A student from Brazil started a school to impart basic education in his country inspired by Nai Talim, said sources at Gujarat Vidyapith. Kaori Kurihara, a Japanese student, studied Gandhian philosophy at Gujarat Vidyapith in the Gujarati medium more than a decade ago. This political science graduate from Keio University, Tokyo, who spoke fluent Gujarati, had turned completely vegetarian after her Gandhian encounter. Rajendra Khimani, the vice-chancellor of Gujarat Vidyapith, lauded Kaori and said that she is doing some good work on Gandhiji’s ideals back home with special emphasis on mental well-being of people. The MA programme in Gandhian Thoughts has been designed in such a way that an international student can learn in their own mother tongue. The programme is offered in the self-study mode and the modular form. The students are required to take the final examination in English. One student from Japan and three from Mexico have already passed this course. Besides, international students are given admissions in programmes where the medium of instruction is English. International students can pursue MPhil and PhD programmes in physical education, microbiology, Gandhian Studies, and Peace Studies. A Thai-Canadian student chose peace research for the PhD and an Iranian took up physical education for the doctorate. Both successfully finished their theses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bapus-thoughts-seen-in-action-overseas/articleshow/88364858.cms||Bharat Yagnik

The decision was taken after the companies taking part in the bidding for executing the pilot phase of the ropeway project sought more time to complete the necessary documentation. Talking to TOI on Sunday, divisional commissioner and VDA chairman Deepak Agrawal said, “The last date for filing tender for the pilot phase of ropeway was earlier fixed as December 17. But after the participating companies requested for more time as paperwork required for the project was taking time, the date for filing tender was extended till December 23.” The process of examining bid will be done on December 24 after which the contract would be awarded to the company that wins the bid, said VDA vice-chairman Isha Duhan. Many leading global ropeway-and-ski lift manufacturers from Austria, US, France, and Malaysia had taken part in the pre-bidding meet convened by VDA and displayed interest in executing the Rs 410 crore ambitious ropeway project in Kashi. This project will make Kashi the first city in the country to use ropeway for public transportation, said officials adding that the pilot phase of ropeway project will be executed in less than 4 km distance between Varanasi Junction (Cantt railway station) and Girijaghar crossing (Godowlia). This project also got the approval of state cabinet on December 15 following which it was expected that its foundation will be laid by PM Narendra Modi during his visit on December 23. The PM will inaugurate the ready projects of over Rs 850 crore and lay foundation of projects worth over Rs 1,100 crore, including a plant of Amul on December 23. Now, the officials have confirmed that since the process of awarding contract completing tender process could not be completed, the possibility of its foundation laying on December 23 has ended. According to Duhan, representatives of six companies, including ECL Management Sdn Bhd of Malaysia, Doppelmayr Garaventa of Austria and French firm Poma Ropeways participated in the pre-bid meeting and discussed bid details of the ropeway venture, which is going to be launched in public private partnership (PPP) mode. Many other firms had showed interest online, she said. As per the plan of pilot phase, the ropeway would be installed between Godowlia and Cantonment railway station via Rath Yatra. The service will start with 220 cable cars that will be available at escalator-equipped stations. Each cable car will take 15 minutes to complete the end-to-end journey, said officials. The ropeway transit system was adopted as MRTS component following the rejection of Metro Rail plan for Kashi in June 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ropeway-project-tender-filing-delayed-no-foundation-stone-laying-on-dec-23/articleshow/88378403.cms||---

The two parties announced a pre-poll alliance on Saturday at a joint press conference held at Congress’ election office. Congress’ Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao and GFP president Vijai Sardesai were seen holding hands with state party president Girish Chodankar and Margao MLA Digambar Kamat. GFP is a former NDA ally. “I am very happy to announce that Congress and Goa Forward Party have entered into an alliance for the Goa assembly elections. We will be going to the elections together,” said Rao at the press conference. The two parties, which share an acrimonious past, said that they have agreed to bury the hatchet in order to defeat the incumbent BJP as a united front. There have been a series of interactions and meetings between representatives of the two parties to try and forge an alliance. “We have ironed out all the issues. We are looking for a new beginning,” said Rao. He said that discussions on formulating a common manifesto, the campaign strategy, candidate selection and other aspects have been discussed. He also said that the two parties will coordinate regarding the campaign strategy going ahead. Rao claimed that the alliance will ensure stable government formulation. “We have gone on a dictum that bygones be bygones. We don’t want to discuss the past. We want to look at a bright future. We are sure we will achieve it,” said Sardesai. Seat-sharing will be decided based on mutual discussions, said Rao. He said that announcements on candidates will made soon. Congress has already released its first list of candidates for the elections. The party has named eight contenders for the assembly polls with Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Digambar Kamat and Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco being given the go-ahead. Congress has picked Sudhir Kandolkar for Mapusa, former CCP mayor Tony Rodrigues for Taleigao, Rajesh Verenkar for Ponda, Sankalp Amonkar for Mormugao, Yuri Alemao for Cuncolim and Altone D’Costa for Quepem. “We had said in the past that on the eve of Goa’s 60th Liberation Day, we will give you an alliance that will re-liberate Goa from these elected autocracies,” said Sardesai. “We have a government in Goa which is in the politics of acquisitions and takeovers, which is poisoning Goa.” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had met a GFP delegation on November 30 along with Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar. Sardesai had conveyed GFP’s support to Gandhi. Sardesai has already gone ahead and announced that the next chief minister of Goa will be from Congress. Going to great lengths to appease Congress, Sardesai said that any alternative to the “corrupt, communal, balatkari” BJP cannot be done without Congress as the principal alternative party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-gfp-bury-the-hatchet-confirm-alliance-for-2022-polls/articleshow/88364840.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Hindutva follower bathes alone in Ganga, says Rahul Gandhi||LUCKNOW: Returning to his former parliamentary constituency, Amethi, after nearly two-and-a-half years, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said the nation is passing through a state of dilemma with truthful and peace loving Hindu on the one side and violent hate-mongering ‘Hindutvavadis’ on the other. Addressing ‘Mahangai Hatao Yatra’ organised by UP Congress as part of its poll campaign, Rahul spoke about the true meaning of a Hindu as someone who only follows the path of truth and never converts his fear into violence, hate and anger.  Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra with Rahul at the ‘Mahangai Hatao Yatra’“A ‘Hindutvavadi’ bathes alone in the Ganga while a Hindu bathes with crores of people. (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi says he is a Hindu, but when did he protect the truth? The PM said he would create two crore jobs, where did he do so? He asked people to bang thalis to get rid of Covid… Hindu or Hindutvadi,” Rahul asked. Taking a jibe at the PM for his holy dip during the inauguration of Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi, he said: “For the first time, I saw just one person taking bath in the Ganga, (he) removed Yogi (Adityanath), sidelined Rajnath Singh... The entire world saw only one person bathing in the Ganga…,” he said. Speaking about the difference between Mahatma Gandhi and his assassin Nathuram Godse, he said, “Mahatma Gandhi spent his life understanding truth and then there is Godse, a ‘ Hindutvavadi’. Nobody calls him (Godse) a ‘Mahatma’ (a revered soul) because he killed a Hindu who always spoke the truth… Godse was a coward, a weak man. He could not face his fear.” Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also attacked the Centre and UP government by stating that the the PM and the UP CM were weaving a network of lies to establish that the fate of people in the country was changed for the better. “However, every single person in the country knows the reality,” she said. Priyanka called upon the people to do away with the BJP government in UP in 2022 if they want actual development and growth for themselves and for their children. She reiterated the importance of women in politics and said the Congress was the only party to have fulfilled the first promise even before the elections by giving 40% of its tickets to women candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hindutva-follower-bathes-alone-in-ganga-says-rahul/articleshow/88365305.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Delhi||East Delhi Municipal Corporation gets ready to locate vending sites||NEW DELHI: East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Friday issued an order to start preparations for drafting a street vending plan. This includes formation of town vending committees and beginning the process of identifying locations in all wards for stationing vendors who have been issued a certificate of vending in the first phase based on the survey done till December 7 on Delhi government’s direction. “It is hereby directed to constitute committees each for Shahdara south and north zones for preparing a draft plan for street vending under Section 21 of Street Vendors Act, 2014. The zonal deputy commissioner is the head of the committee and has members from the EDMC town planning department, Delhi Police, DDA, SDMs, market traders’ associations and RWAs,” stated the order issued by the central licensing and enforcement cell. EDMC has planned to allow vendors in shifts in busy commercial areas. “A plan has been made to place food vendors in open and vacant plots of DSIIDC or corporations near industrial and commercial areas,” said the EDMC official. An EDMC official said though the draft vending plans would be finalised after the elections of the new vending committee members were completed, the Act allowed the departments to initiate the exercise and identify spots. Each committee has 50% members from different departments, while the rest include elected members/vendors. “The exercise is aimed at saving time as elections will take 4-5 months,” said the official. EDMC has identified 19,653 vendors and issued certificates to around 16,000. “The report of the committee will be approved by the commissioner before submission to the government for notification,” the order stated. South Delhi Municipal Corporation will take a similar decision next week. It has issued vending certificates to around 19,500 vendors. “There are certain sites that are fixed for the vendors, including markets. The responsibility of the new committee will be to ensure that they are placed at a safe distance in appropriate numbers to avoid congestion,” said an SDMC official. The survey by the town vending committees to identify street vendors began in January and concluded on September 30. The date was later extended to December 7. In all, 71,371 vendors were identified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/east-corpn-gets-ready-to-locate-vending-sites/articleshow/88365619.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Goa||Focus is on making state self-reliant in agriculture: Kavlekar||Margao: Deputy chief minister and agriculture minister Chandrakant Kavlekar on Sunday said that with the younger generation and educated youth taking to agriculture and with it bringing an increased area under agricultural cover, the government’s commitment of making the sector a dominant one in the state has grown even more stronger. Speaking at the Liberation Day event organised by the South Goa district administration, Margao, Kavlekar said that with a view to making the state self-reliant in agriculture, the government introduced several schemes and facilities for farmers over the last two years since he took over as the state’s agriculture minister. Stating that Goa was able to make all-round development on account of the vision and foresight of former chief minister Manohar Parrikar, Kavlekar credited chief minister Pramod Sawant with taking forward what Parrikar had envisioned. He said that modification of certain schemes to make subsidies available at source, including for community farming, has served to attract more people to agriculture. While the state government provides handsome subsidies to farmers through various schemes, Kavlekar said farmers had to incur the entire expenditure first and later claim reimbursement of the subsidy portion. This would place a severe financial burden on the farmers and many wouldn’t avail of the schemes. “We noticed that while initially farmers would show interest in community farming, they would back out when it came to contributing for the expenses as the subsidy had to be claimed later. The schemes have now been modified to make the subsidies available at source. This has provided a boost to farmers,” Kavlekar said. He also urged people to sink their political differences and work together for the state’s development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/focus-is-on-making-state-self-reliant-in-agriculture-kavlekar/articleshow/88379539.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Mithali Raj advises cricket enthusiasts to focus on present||Lucknow: Indian women cricket team captain Mithali Raj on Saturday shared with students and cricket enthusiasts how a decision taken by her father to bring discipline in her life made cricket her passion. The occasion was an online interaction with Raj organised by the Lucknow Farmers Market. The leading cricketer spoke on her journey as a cricketer while in conversation with Jyotsana Habibullah and Chirag Warty. She also answered queries of students. During the conversation Raj revealed that she was nine-year-old when her father put her in a cricket academy along with her brother with an aim that sports will bring discipline in their lives. She said that her coach persuaded her father to allow her to pursue a career in sports. Initially, he was reluctant, but relented after witnessing Raj’s dedication. “My parents supported me throughout. I was later selected for the Under-19 team and then for the national team,” she said. Raj has achieved milestones in an international career spanning over two decades. She is the Test and ODI captain of the women's national cricket team. She has bagged maximum runs in the game, and is the only Indian captain (male or female) to have led the team at two 50-over World Cup finals. Talking about handling pressures, Raj said, "One should focus on the present and parents should also encourage children to take their decisions.” When Lamya Shiraz, a cricketer, asked Raj about how to balance between sport and studies, she said, "Education is an important pillar of life. As a kid I used to manage cricket with studies by following a routine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mithali-raj-advises-cricket-enthusiasts-to-focus-on-present/articleshow/88365317.cms||---

The theme of the event is ‘No to Drugs, Yes to Sports’. Over 650 powerlifters from 14 states are participating in the event at Katargam Community Hall. “We have made special arrangements for each player and other related persons.

---||Hyderabad||5 yrs after mishap, justice eludes retd army cap TK Rao’s family||Hyderabad: Five years after a decorated retired Army captain T Kameswara Rao (80) who served India in three wars died in a drunk and drive crash, family members are still livid as justice continues to elude them. On September 16, 2016, Rao went to Shamshabad to pick up his daughter Pallavi and her two kids who arrived from Houston in the US and were returning home at Safilguda. At the same time, Dr Siddhartha Darapuneni, who was inebriated, along with an airhostess was speeding in his Honda City. “Like a missile, his car rammed against the side of my father’s SUV. What upsets me the most is that after the crash, the doctor and the airhostess tried to flee from the accident spot,” Rao’s son T Bhaskar (52) tells STOI. Fortunately, Pallavi and her children were left with minor bruises. She immediately called for an ambulance to shift her father to a nearby hospital. However, Bhaskar and his family’s suffering only just began as Rao suffered a cervical spinal fracture leaving him paralysed from the neck down. He passed away two months later. On the other hand, Dr Siddhartha was let off by receiving a station bail with bailable charges of rash driving registered against him. Bhaskar engaged lawyer S Vani and approached the high court, seeking culpable homicide charges against the doctor which was eventually granted. “The case hasn’t moved an inch since then. Police are yet to frame the charges against the doctor and because of that the court hearing hasn’t even started. Each time, I receive an excuse like there is no time or the current Covid-19 situation. We are bearing all kinds of harassment — whether it is financial or mental — while the doctor is free,” Bhaskar said. Bhaskar, who works as a general manager with Tata Steel, rues that the common man of this country has no chance fighting against the system. The family has far spent over Rs 25 lakh on both medical and legal expenses. Yet, Bhaskar remains resilient. He does not want to give up till justice is served for his father. Rao served in the Army as a former Corps of Signals officer and later through the UPSC, entered the Indian Labour Service. Rao then worked as a regional labour commissioner for various states and eventually retired as a deputy welfare commissioner for government of India, Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/5-yrs-after-mishap-justice-eludes-retd-army-cap-tk-raos-family/articleshow/88364276.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Thiruvananthapuram||More than 60 people held under ‘Operation Trojan’||Thiruvananthapuram: The special drive ‘Operation Trojan’ launched two days ago under the directions of Deputy Inspector General of Thiruvananthapuram range has made the police discharge their crime fighting duties with augmented vigour. In the first two days itself, more than 60 arrests were recorded under the special drive, which was launched to curb the rising criminal activities in the range. The action under special drive had commenced on Wednesday. Most of the actions were taken under Attingal police subdivision. The subdivision had recorded some major crimes in the past few weeks, including the violence that acted as catalyst to the gruesome murder of Sudheesh at Pothencode. In the past two days, as many as 24 arrests were recorded here under the special drive. This includes 10 arrests in recently reported cases and 14 arrests related to long pending warrants. This includes the arrest of a man, who was declared wanted 12 years ago in connection with a robbery case. The man Jahangir had escaped to a Gulf country where he worked for several years. The other notable cases of violence reported under Attingal sub division include two criminals attacking traders and motorists using sharp weapons under Kadinamkulam police station limits during an extortion bid and the attack on a youth by a wanted criminal under Mangalapuram police station limits, which even led to the suspension of the sub inspector of the station for the callousness shown in handling the case. As many as 14 arrests were recorded under Nedumangad subdivision out of which 12 are related to recently reported crimes, including the arrests of two key accused in the Pothencode murder, and two are related to warrants. The number of arrests at other subdivisions is as follows - Varkala (3), Neyyattinkara (12), and Kattakkada (9). The police have also initiated preventive actions against habitual offenders, which involved summoning them to the stations and issuing warnings. Attingal subdivision topped this list too with 61 actions. Nedumangad stands second in this list with 45 actions. Besides the arrests and preventive actions, the police at all local stations have also conducted numerous raids in various spots under their respective limits to check the activities of drug peddling. On the first day six cases were detected, with two cases under Varkala subdivision and one each under Nedumangad, Kattakada and Neyyattinkara subdivisions. One case was detected by the rural narcotic cell. On the second day, only one case was detected, which was at Kattakkada. DIG K Sanjay Kumar Gurudin who launched the special drive said that more arrests can be expected in the coming days as the police do not intend to reduce the vigour till the last day of the drive, which is on December 31. It was the murder at Pothencode which prompted the police to launch the special drive as the police came under strong criticism of the state high court and even minister for food and civil supplies G R Anil, who represents Nedumangad constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/more-than-60-people-held-under-operation-trojan/articleshow/88347898.cms||---
---||Delhi||Rohini court blast: ‘My only option was to kill him or kill myself’||NEW DELHI: In his own words, Bharat Bhushan Kataria, who police arrested for placing a bomb in the Rohini court complex, is a level-E senior scientist, earlier in the Defence Research & Development Organisation’s high-profile Laser Science and Technology Centre (LASTEC). This wing had investigated the “explosive-like substance” found in the Uttar Pradesh assembly building in 2017 and determined within an hour that it was a harmless substance and not the powerful plastic explosive PETN as believed to be. With LASTEC winding up last year, Kataria claimed he moved to the wing working on aerial technologies like drones. So, what drove a scientist with a bright career ahead of him to plant a bomb in a court? Kataria told police he suffered incessantly at the hands of a lawyer. Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana said that Kataria planted the improvised explosive device to eliminate the lawyer, Amit Vashisht. He was frustrated by the protracted legal battles that were impeding his career growth and the prolonged mental harassment and monetary loss spurred this bizarre step. “I had two options. Kill him or kill myself to avoid the harassment. I went for the former,” a source quoted Kataria telling an interrogator. The decade-long dispute between Kataria and Vashisht escalated in early 2018 when an RTI application sought details of Kataria’s record over the past three years at DRDO. Later that year or early in 2019, an official complaint was filed alleging that Kataria showed himself at work while staying at home and conducting property deals. The complainant claimed to have CCTV footage to back his claims. Kataria claims his lawyer neighbour was behind these and wanted to teach him a lesson. The shootout at the Rohini courts in September inspired Kataria. He and his target visited the same court and so was a good place to attack him. An IED blast at a court would also be seen as a terrorist act, he thought. Kataria became more confident when media reports pointed out the lax security on the court premises. He carried out a reconnaissance and found he would have easy passage if he dressed up as a lawyer. After extensive research on the internet, Kataria took all measures to cover up his tracks, believing the cops couldn’t nail him. However, a minute analysis of 1,000 hours of CCTV footage led the cops to the person of interest. Kataria was seen entering the court on the day of the incident at 9.33am, dressed in a black coat and trousers in the manner of a lawyer. “He was carrying a bag in his hand and a laptop bag on the back,” disclosed Rajiv Ranjan Singh, DCP (Special Cell). “He entered and left through various gates to create an evasive movement pattern. He was seen entering the court from Gate No 7 and concealing the bags inside the court premises and then leaving from the same gate 7.” Kataria then re-entered via Gate No. 8 and retrieved the two bags he had concealed. He is seen on various cameras inside the main court building. “He finally left in a hurry at 10.35am from gate no. 8 with the laptop bag on his back but without the bag he was carrying in his hand,” the DCP added. This sequence made him the prime suspect. During investigation, it emerged that Kataria’s co-brother-in-law, Anil, worked as a director in the multinational medical equipment company that had distributed bags to its employees on its anniversary. Anil gave a few bags to Kataria and other relatives too as gifts. This was the bag in which Kataria carried the IED. The search of Kataria’s house led to the recovery of several incriminating items. “Several file covers, identical to those which were present in the IED bag, screws identical to the IED shrapnel, remnants of the black adhesive tape used in fabricating the IED, all were recovered from his house,” revealed DCP Singh. “The garb donned by the accused to enter the court complex was also recovered from his house.” Documents and other electronic devices including laptops and mobile phones have been seized for further investigation. The cops intend to retrace the internet search history, which they suspect Kataria has deleted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/my-only-option-kill-him-or-kill-myselfdecade-long-dispute-between-accused-scientist-and-lawyer-escalated-in-early-2018/articleshow/88365312.cms||Raj Shekhar

Addressing a public meeting at T D College ground in Ballia before flagging off the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Janvishwas Yatra on Sunday afternoon, Shivraj said that seven years of PM Modi and five-year rule of Yogi Adityanath in UP made the construction of temple at Lord Ram’s birthplace in Ayodhya possible just as it ensure rejuvenation of Kashi Vishwanath temple shrine area by creating KVD and showed how a double engine government can fulfil the aspirations of people on all fronts. This double engine ensured waiving of loans of 86 lakh farmers, payment of Rs 1.44 lakh crore dues of sugarcane farmers, put a check on forced conversions and love jehad, construction of highways and expressways, seven international airports, free education for girls and 4.50 lakh government jobs in UP, said Shivraj, adding that each poor will have a pucca house of his own in UP by 2024. UP is emerging as the biggest economy of the country, he added. In Yogi regime, the state has witnessed elimination of dreaded criminals, check on mafia menace and bulldozing of their empires, he said, adding that criminals and even Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav’s ‘chacha’ (Azam Khan) prefer to stay in jails as they feel safe there. “Akhilesh had cheated his close ones and now wants to bring goondaraj back in UP,” he added. Attacking Congress, he said that contributions of Mangal Pandey, Rajguru, Chandrashekhar Azad and Subhas Chandra Bose in the freedom struggle were ignored to promote Pt Jawahar Lal Nehru and Indira Gandhi as heroes, he said adding that the contribution of Veer Savarkar was never given due recognition. Congress never lit a lamp in the name of freedom fighters, but today PM Modi is ensuring that all freedom fighters are remembered for their contributions by celebrating Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsava on the 75th year of Independence. Shivraj also took a jibe on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for wearing ‘tripunda’ and taking dip in river Ganga to prove themselves Hindu while they question Hindutva which considers the entire world as a family.

---||Hyderabad||Dreams to be a movie star ended abruptly||Hyderabad: M Manasa, a resident of Jadcherla, had come to the city on Friday night to meet her new social media friend N Manasa, hoping to get new offers in short films and other movies. However, Manasa’s dream of becoming an actor was cut short by the tragic road accident near the main gate of University of Hyderabad (UoH) on Friday morning. “As Manasa was unable to get offers when she was staying in Ameerpet, she returned to Jadcherla a month ago and started staying with us. Meanwhile, N Manasa befriended my sister on social media and said that she does short films and offered to help my sister,” M Vaishnavi, sister of M Manasa, told TOI at Osmania General Hospital (OGH) mortuary on Saturday. It was this friendship that had made M Manasa go on the ill-fated journey. “At around 8.30 pm, my sister had informed me through a video call that she has reached safely and was in a room. She also introduced her friend during the call. But what happened later we do not know. On Saturday morning, we got a call from Gachibowli police informing us that my sister has died in a road accident,” Vaishnavi said. Similarly, the family of Vijayawada-based Abdul Raheem, who also died in the road accident, was shocked when more information about Abdul Raheem came to light. “Abdul Raheem last called his mother at 8 pm like he always does. We were under the impression that he was residing at a hostel in Ameerpet. But we later came to know from the police that he was residing at one Sai Sidhu’s residence in Kondapur since the last few months. He had a backlog in engineering,”Abdul Raheem’s uncle Sheikh Mohammed told TOI. He added that Abdul Raheem was a teetotaler. Abdul Raheem had gone to his hometown Vijayawada after lockdown and returned to the city in search of livelihood just four months ago. Meanwhile, the family members of N Manasa are yet to arrive from Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dreams-to-be-a-movie-star-ended-abruptly/articleshow/88364293.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Dehradun residents plan protest against road widening that would raze 2,000 trees||DEHRADUN: Residents in the city have planned a ‘massive peaceful protest’ from 11am to 1pm on Sunday in the hope of halting the widening of a 14-km stretch of the Sahastradhara Road in the state capital, for which the Public Works Department (PWD) has already floated tenders. The widening, which the government says will offer swift mobility to tourists visiting Mussoorie from Delhi, will require the chopping of 2,200 trees. The PWD has invited a firm to facilitate road widening from Jogiwala Chowk to Pacific Golf Estate and the department aims to complete all paper works within a month so construction can start. “The tender has been given out to a firm and now we are framing the terms of agreement, which will be ready in 10-12 days. The idea is to convert 7m blacktop to 12m blacktop in the 14-km stretch. Besides, there will be pedestrian paths and a cycle track. As for the trees that need to be razed, they are mostly eucalyptuses which have reached maturity,” said Dhirendera Kumar, executive engineer, PWD, Rishikesh division, under whose jurisdiction the widening will take place. As reported by TOI earlier, the Rs 77-crore project would mean the felling of banyan, mango, peepal, eucalyptus and other tree species. Citizens, meanwhile, see this as an addition to the ongoing onslaught on the hill state’s green cover, especially as the decision came close on the heels of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) giving its nod to chop down 11,000 trees from Ganeshpur to Mohund for the proposed Delhi-Dehradun expressway. “We barely survived the Covid scourge and now have the new threat of Omicron to deal with. At the peak of the pandemic earlier this year, people scrambled to procure oxygen and those who couldn’t, paid with their lives. Yet, the priority of the government is neither greening nor healing,” said Jaya Singh, a member of the NGO Citizens for Green Doon (CFGD). Himanshu Arora, member secretary, CFGD, said, its time the government heeded the voice of voters. “In response to the government’s blatant disregard for citizens’ legitimate demands, we are organising yet another peaceful protest. We want leaders to remember that they need us citizens to come back to power. It’s time to talk about sustainable development.” Notably, this is the second protest on the issue. On September 20 this year, a tweet storm had been organised, which garnered 4,300 tweets in two hours, spearheaded by activists, residents and celebrities, including actor Archana Puran Singh. An online petition against the road widening had collected 11,300 signatures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/residents-plan-protest-against-proposal-to-chop-2500-trees-to-widen-del-mussoorie-rd/articleshow/88364300.cms||Shivani Azad

The food safety department has set up special squads to conduct searches across various establishments in the city as well as across the state to ensure safe and healthy food in the wake of the upcoming Christmas and New Year festival season. The special squads will conduct searches at restaurants, bakeries and cake and wine manufacturing units randomly, and strict action will be taken wherever any deficiencies or illegalities are found, food safety commissioner V R Vinod said. In places where deficiencies are found the department will slap fine and recommend rectification measures, while in places where serious illegalities are found the functioning of the unit itself will be stopped. The food safety commissioner has given special instructions to check the use of chemicals, artificial sweeteners, colours, preservatives etc in the food. Both the use of banned chemicals and colours as well as the excess use of allowed ones will be checked, and strong prosecution measures will also be taken against them, the commissioner said. Any concerns of the public relating to the bakery products, including cakes or any other sweets, can be informed to the food safety office in the toll free number 18004251125 or in the email address foodsafetykerala@gmail.com. Guidance document on food safety management system (FSMS) that has been prepared with the intent to provide implementation guidance to food businesses especially the small and medium businesses involved in manufacturing, packing, storage and transportation of bakery and bakery products, specific instructions and guidelines have been prescribed for each segment in bakery operations. This includes the surroundings where the establishment is functioning, maintenance and sanitation, personal hygiene, product information and consumer awareness, training and management and maintenance of records. Each section will come under the scrutiny of the food safety team in the inspections. The excise department will undertake searches and special enforcement drives till January 3. The department has anticipated that there are high chances of illicit liquor brewing and illegal wine manufacturing in large quantities with more than permitted content of alcohol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/food-safety-excise-dpts-to-conduct-raids/articleshow/88347911.cms||---

KTR said he will showcase the arbitration facility at all international meets. He also referred to the fact that Amazon has got its world’s largest facility in Hyderabad, which is located close to IAMC. IAMC’s life trustee and former SC judge Justice RV Raveendran said the Hyderabad IAMC was built in a manner which could prove to be superior to Singapore arbitration centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/will-be-brand-ambassador-for-iamc-ktr/articleshow/88364305.cms||---
---||Pune||Antibodies against Covid at over 90% even 7 months after second dose: Study||PUNE: High levels of protection (seroprevalence) against Covid-19 have been detected in over 500 healthcare workers even 3-7 months after taking two doses of Covishield, a recent analysis by Pune-based BJ Government Medical College (BJMC) and Sassoon hospital has revealed. With high levels of protection (seroprevalence) in participants at this point, the study concluded that a third booster, while a chunk of population is yet to get their second shots, may not be advisable, Dr Muralidhar Tambe, professor and Head of Community Medicine at BJMC, told TOI. The study also found that in all categories of the 558 healthcare workers (HCWs), who were part of the study, the antibody prevalence was above 90% months after completion of two Covid vaccine doses. Dr Tambe said, “Though we found that the antibody prevalence decreased as the duration of interval increased after two doses of Covid vaccine, immunity levels remained high. Antibody positivity among the study participants was at 96.77% at three months post full vaccination, rising to 100% at four months, and then falling to 91.89% at seven months after the initial two doses.” He said except for five individuals, who had received Covaxin, all other study participants had received Covishield. Dr Tambe said overall, of the 558 HCWs who participated in the study, 94.4% were positive for Covid neutralizing antibodies at the time of the study period. “At the time of the study, some of these HCWs had already completed three months, while some had completed 4-7 months after two doses of Covid vaccination. In the next aspect of the study, we analysed antibody positivity in their serum according to the duration of time period competed after full vaccination. The blood samples were collected two months ago,” he said. Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, head, microbiology department, BJMC, said, “Competitive ELISA kits were used to detect the antibodies present in the serum. As per the method, if patient’s serum Anti-Covid-19 antibodies caused more than 50% signal inhibition, then his/her serum is considered to have effective neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2. We were able to detect a much higher percentage of antibody positivity in the sera of the HCWs several months after full vaccination, which was over 90%.” Dr Karyakarte, who is also the state coordinator for genome sequencing, said, “In addition to the immunity provided by the vaccine, many individuals may have gained hybrid immunity due to sub-clinical infection.” Dr Vinayak Kale, dean at BJMC, said the study would be extended further by three months to find out if a booster dose should be recommended in individuals who have competed nine months or more after the initial two doses. Dr Sanjay Pujari from the ICMR National Task Force on Clinical Research for Covid-19 and the director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases, Pune, however, said, “Semi quantitative antibody tests are currently not recommended for assessing immunity following vaccination as immune correlates of protection are still unclear. Even for neutralising antibody titers the exact cut off beyond which absolute protection is achieved is unclear.” Study findings assume significance especially after the emergence of Omicron, which has been followed by increased pressure on the Union government to recommend booster doses for people who took their Covid vaccine shots six to seven months ago. Dr Kale, Dr Suvarna Joshi and Dr Nandkumar Salunke were other researchers from BJMC involved in the analysis. “Antibodies formed after Covid vaccination are demonstrable in the blood and start waning after a few months of vaccination. It is still not clearly studied up to what duration the antibodies remain at a satisfactory level in the blood. It has been postulated in the past that their levels start falling after three months post-vaccination. It has been also said that after six months, the antibody levels may even go down to less than the protective levels, leaving the individual vulnerable to Covid,” said Dr Vinayak Kale, dean of BJMC||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/antibodies-against-covid-at-over-90-even-7-months-after-second-dose-study/articleshow/88364866.cms||Neha Madaan

Thereafter, for the past 135 days, daily cases had remained below 10. Among the 13 new cases, three are from LDA Colony on Kanpur Road, two each from Rahimnagar, Indiranagar and Mahanagar, and one each from New Hyderabad, Rajajipuram and Krishi Bhawan Road. The three cases from LDA Colony are in the same family. A female member of the family had tested positive on October 12 after she returned from Punjab where she had gone to attend a wedding. Health officials had tested the entire family and as per the report released on Saturday, three more members had contracted the infection. Similarly, a family member of a person, who had tested Covid positive earlier, was found to be infected in New Hyderabad. Among other cases, a man who recently travelled to Jammu, and another who visited Haryana tested positive. Further, five others found infected had got themselves tested because they were planning to visit other states. The two other patients got themselves tested after experiencing mild influenza-like symptoms. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Manoj Agarwal said that all the patients are in home isolation. “Patients are being monitored through Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre (ICCC) and their samples have been sent for genome sequencing to KGMU,” he added. Meanwhile, 24,798 individuals were vaccinated against Covid-19 in Lucknow on Saturday. While 17,324 took their second shot, 7,474 got the first.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-spike-13-new-cases-highest-count-in-135-days/articleshow/88365326.cms||---

Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday ordered an inquiry into the PWD job scam and kept on hold the recruitment process pending report. “We welcome the chief minister’s decision to order an inquiry into the PWD job scam, but it is not enough. It is a big scam and it should be investigated by CBI,” he said. Dhavalikar said that it has come to his notice that around Rs 25 lakh has been taken from candidates, but they have not got jobs nor the money has been returned. He also said that once these jobs would be cancelled, parents of the candidates will take to the streets and reveal how much money they have paid and to whom. “If Sawant wants to unearth the truth in this scam then he should cancel the recruitment process,” Dhavalikar said. Dhavalikar said that he has also learnt that drivers, officers on special duty (OSDs) and office staff of ministers have taken money for jobs. Last week, BJP’s Panaji MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monseratte charged PWD minister Deepak Pauskar of “selling engineer posts”, and said that the recruitment scam in the department was “worth at least Rs 70 crore”. PWD minister Deepak Pauskar had dismissed the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dhavalikar-demands-cbi-probe-into-pwd-job-scam/articleshow/88364925.cms||---

---||Bareilly||Kheri violence: CJM court rejects 2nd bail plea of Union minister's son||BAREILLY: Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish, accused of murdering four farmers and a journalist during a farmers’ protest on October 3, on Friday moved a second bail application in the court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM) of Lakhimpur Kheri, but it was rejected. This bail plea was filed as the new SIT probing the case claimed the attack on the farmers was a “premeditated conspiracy” and added fresh sections, including ‘attempt to murder’ and ‘voluntarily causing hurt’ of IPC and also sections under the Arms Act, in the FIR against Ashish and 12 co-accused. So far, three bail applications of Ashish have been rejected; including one by the district sessions court. The first bail application in CJM court was rejected on October 13. Senior prosecution officer SP Yadav told TOI, “Since the allegations are serious and the sections slapped on him are non-bailable, honourable judge Mona Singh, acting CJM, rejected the bail application. Bail application in the same case can be filed in the same court several times depending on changing circumstances.” Ashish’s counsel Awadesh Singh said a bail application of Ashish was pending in Lucknow bench of high court, but after fresh sections were added in the FIR, a fresh bail application with the updated sections was required to be moved. On December 14, the CJM court dropped the lesser charges in the case such as causing death by negligence, and included sections 307 (attempt to murder), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt using weapon which is likely to cause death), 34 (criminal acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of IPC, along with sections 3/25/30 and section 35 of the Arms Act on a request by SIT. These sections will go along with the initial charges of murder, rioting and criminal conspiracy. Meanwhile, SIT recorded the statement of key witness Tejinder Singh Virk before the court under section 164 of CrPC. Virk, a prominent farm leader from Uttarakhand, was grievously injured by the convoy of the minister’s son. His statement is crucial to the probe. After the incident, videos surfaced showing a Thar jeep trying to run over Virk. In another video, Virk is seen lying on the ground, his face covered with blood. He was rushed to a hospital in Lucknow and later shifted to Delhi where he underwent treatment for over a month. After recording his statement, Virk said, “I was nearly killed by the convoy of the Union minister’s son. The Thar jeep used in the attack belonged to the minister, and this makes him an accused in the case. SIT is yet to summon him for questioning. I have taken legal advice, and SIT can question the minister on the basis of my statement.” The senior prosecuting officer said, “Five farmers from Uttarakhand, including Virk, have recorded their statements before the CJM. Four of them, including Virk, were injured during the October 3 violence. So far, statements of 99 farmers have been recorded. SIT has been requesting witnesses to come forward with their evidence in this case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kheri-violence-cjm-court-rejects-2nd-bail-plea-of-union-ministers-son/articleshow/88358868.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Construction of State Archaeological Museum starts in Pkl||Panchkula: Work on construction of the State Archaeological Museum started in Sector 5, Panchkula on Saturday. The museum will offer a glimpse of the state’s rich cultural heritage and its collection will include sculptures, monuments, coins, arms, armour and attire of the Harappan civilisation. Haryana Assembly speaker and Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta performed the bhoomi pujan for the museum and said that it would be built at a cost of Rs 55 crore. Director, archeology and museums Mahavir Singh was present on the occasion. Gupta said that the State Archeological Museum has been designed by the state architecture department and is being constructed by the public works (building and roads) department. The museum is likely to be completed by August 2023. The seven storey building will have two basements. A museum gallery will be set up on the ground, first, second and third floor of the building, while an e-library is proposed to be set up on the fourth floor. The speaker said the museum would showcase relics of the Harappan civilisation besides chronicling lives of freedom fighters. According to him, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced that there were plans to set up the museum in 2016. However, there were apprehensions of it being shifted to Kurukshetra. Gupta said he informed the CM that Panchkula, which was being developed as the mini-capital of Haryana, was an appropriate place for the museum, particularly as tourists going to Himachal also passed through Panchkula. He added that the establishment of the museum was a major achievement for Panchkula. Gupta directed public works (Building and Roads) department officials to complete construction of the museum in a time-bound manner and warned them against compromising on quality of the materials used. A team of retired chief engineers has been constituted to ensure quality in development works being carried out in the district. Those present on the occasion included deputy director, Archaeology and Museums Dr Banani Bhattacharya, deputy director, archives Manju Yadav, BJP district president Ajay Sharma, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/construction-of-state-archaeological-museum-starts-in-pkl/articleshow/88364313.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Chatterji spoke about various characters of her book that take one to the world of women from the society fringes as well as high echelons — with entitled husbands and regressive labels, with high-power jobs and insecurities, with obsessions and mental issues, with open views on marriage and divorce and with oppressive employers driving them to the hilt. “A woman is much more than the labels that the society puts on her. She has various roles to play. She is the powerhouse of capabilities and patience,” she said. Characters in the book tell a story of a prostitute, a student, a migrant person that give a realistic glimpse intto the lives of women. Later in the evening, a melodious Sufi performance by Radhika Sood Nayak and Neil Mukherjee (guitarist) was premiered during the lit fest. The duo performed devotional music of Sufi saints,inspired by the works of Sufi poets like Rumi, Hafiz, Bulleh Shah, Amir Khusro and Khwaja Ghulam Farid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/women-more-than-labels-put-on-them-by-society/articleshow/88365340.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Dwaipayan KMC poll managers||Kolkata: Party foot soldiers who were relegated to the back during the campaigning will now come to fore on Sunday. Most party workers were huddled in multiple party meetings in the evening for last moment strategy discussion even as the booth polling agents and their relievers went through the last moment drills. Besides ensuring a high turnout, these men will be acting as the eyes and ears of the parties. "Unlike the Lok Sabha or the assembly elections a few months ago, this is a vote where personal connections matter a lot. This is as much about the representative as the party. Hence, visibility on election day is of prime importance so that the voter has no hesitation while voting," said Sayoni Majumdar, a political science professor. "We have set up a mix of educated, young and elderly workers who will coax these voters to come out and vote. We have divided each booth further into parts as available in the master voting list. Workers have been divided in such a manner so that they can ensure maximum turnout for each part. It’s after all winter and it will be easier to vote than stand under the hot sun," said Debajyoti Basu, the chief election agent of ward 83 TMC candidate Probir Kumar Mukhopadhyay. Autos have been kept ready to transport senior citizens. "It is not like April. There cannot be any complacency just because we are winning this year. We have to mobilize locals all through the day in different shifts, a policy which is comparatively new in these parts of Kolkata," said Srikanta Chowdhury, a TMC poll manager at Muraripukur. In central Kolkata, BJP will focus on highrises and buildings which have its core voters but did not vote for fear of Covid in the Assembly elections. "We have chosen our respective residences to complete the pre-voting day preparations. We are confident of a good show if we can get our voters out. We have been repeatedly told not to step out of the booth despite any provocation," said Sunita Kumari, a BJP Mahila Morcha leader who is leading the party's challenge in ward 23. The CPM is banking on its Red Volunteers to ensure a decent turnout. "We have a very spirited unit campaigning this time. We are not going to back down an inch. Most of our comrades workers themselves set up the placards and posters - whether in Baghajatin or Sakuntala Park - till the wee morning hours on Saturday," said CPM leader Kaustav Chatterjee who took to Facebook to reach out to the party workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dwaipayan-kmc-poll-managers/articleshow/88364315.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

They are also declining demands of institutions and offices to carry out fogging drives to avoid inconvenience to people facing respiratory problems in the winter. “Initially, due to increasing pollution levels and now with the changing weather, we have asked the inspectors to minimise or stop fogging. However, our drives to check breeding of mosquitoes through domestic breeding checkers are continuing,” said a South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) official. The vulnerable areas include unauthorised colonies, residential areas/villages close to waterbodies and places from where several cases of vector-borne diseases have been reported, the official added. The number of dengue cases have started coming down with the fall in temperature. In the first week of December, 660 cases were reported in the city, while according to a joint report issued by SDMC on Monday, 285 new cases were reported last week. The corporations are also in touch with several government departments for regular checking. “Rather than in open or public places, we are finding more breeding in residential areas, especially in an around feng shui and other indoor plants due to stagnant water. Breeding is also found on terraces and in basements of houses; so we request residents to be more alert and take precautionary measures,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-of-dengue-cases-down-corpns-focus-on-spraying/articleshow/88365636.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Four more visits in Dec, Modi already criss-crossed UP with inauguration spree||Lucknow: When PM Narendra Modi laid the foundation of the ambitious 594km-long Ganga expressway from Shahjahanpur on Saturday, he had criss-crossed almost all six organisational regions of poll-bound Uttar Pradesh to drum up BJP’s flagship projects. And he completed the cycle even as four more visits are scheduled in the next 10 days. Experts point out Shahjahanpur, from where the PM rolled out the country’s longest expressway project, comes under BJP’s Braj organizational region comprising 36 assembly seats. Likewise, inauguration of Jewar airport in Gautam Buddh Nagar by Modi on November 25 covered the west UP region comprising 71 assembly seats, where BJP felt the heat from farmers’ unrest against the now repealed farm laws. This was immediately followed by Union home minister Amit Shah laying the foundation for Maa Shakumbhari Devi University in Saharanpur’s Behat Assembly constituency on December 2. On November 16, the PM chose to flag off Purvanchal expressway from Sultanpur, which falls in the Gorakhpur organizational region, comprising 62 assembly seats. In fact, Modi specially visited Gorakhpur, the political backyard of CM Yogi Adityanath, to inaugurate AIIMS and a revived fertilizer factory on December 7 in what was BJP’s bid to put Modi on the forefront to escalate the poll blitz in politically crucial east UP. A week later, on December 14, PM Modi inaugurated the first phase of Kashi Vishwanath Dham corridor, igniting BJP’s Hindutva pitch in Kashi organizational region comprising 71 assembly seats. The development also saw the spotlight shifting to Ayodhya — a key Hindutva nerve centre — which was visited by BJP president JP Nadda and CMs of 11 BJP-ruled states to offer prayers at Ramjanmabhoomi. Similarly, Modi’s visit to Balrampur on December 11 to inaugurate the Saryu Canal project marked BJP’s attempt to step up its campaign in Awadh region comprising 82 assembly seats. On November 19, the PM visited Mahoba in Bundelkhand organizational region comprising 19 assembly seats to inaugurate a host of key irrigation projects, including Arjun Sahayak canal. His visit to Bundelkhand coincided with his announcement to annul the three contentious farm laws and then launch an attack on opposition accusing them of pushing farmers in a quandary to cement their foundation. Experts said, PM touching all organizational regions coincides with BJP launching its flagship Jan Vishwas Yatra by senior BJP leaders from six regions on Sunday. BJP leader and party’s secretary, Chandra Mohan, said PM Modi is the leader of the double-engine BJP government. “He was bound to touch every organizational region to set the tone for the party’s election campaign,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/four-more-visits-in-dec-modi-already-criss-crossed-up-with-inauguration-spree/articleshow/88378472.cms||Pankaj Shah

To begin with, 25 buses have already landed in the city and are expected to hit the road by January-February next year. The buses have been registered with the district regional transport office (RTO) and would be operating on two major routes of the city. Authorities would get another set of 25 buses in a few months and they would operate on three additional routes, taking the total routes as five. Prayagraj City Transport Service Limited (PCTSL) authorities have chalked out a detailed route map for operating these buses and a mega charging station has been developed near the old bridge over river Yamuna (Naini side) where 25 electronic buses can be charged at a time. This charging station is being built on around 6,000 square metre.  PCTSL managing director TK Bisen said, “We have already received 25 buses which have been registered with local RTO and would be running on the roads in a few months.” The official clarified that the buses would operate by next month or so and not on the proposed visit of the Prime Minister on December 21. He further informed that in the first phase, the buses would operate on two routes, the first one being Shantipuram (Phaphamau) to Raymond Crossing (Naini) and the second from Trivenipuram (Jhunsi) to Puramufti (Manauri). “When we get the additional 25 buses, they would operate on three routes: Railway Station to Lalgopalganj, Bhairana to Shankargarh and from Civil Lines to Pratappur,” said the MD. The fully-air conditioned buses have several features including announcement of the next stoppage before reaching (like Metro train), an indicator for low battery (before 20 km of total discharge), a music system, a mic with a driver to interact with passengers as and when required, GPS system and a CCTV at driver seat to have a full view of passengers. The bus facility will be available from 6am to 8pm and there would be 28 seats on this bus. Among these, two seats are reserved for differently-abled persons and 22 passengers can stand. For the safety of passengers, the bus will only proceed for its journey after both the gates are fully closed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/25-ac-battery-buses-to-start-operations-on-two-city-routes/articleshow/88378466.cms||---

The FIR was filed based on a report by the zilla parishad CEO on the poor performance of the officer who was not conducting the necessary number of drives nor was he taking steps to complete the first dose of vaccination, Goyal told TOI. The percentage of first dose completion in the district is 73 and the second dose 38. Pimpalghari, where the health centre is situated, has registered less than 70% first dose vaccination as reported by the zilla parishad CEO. Goyal said that the FIR, filed through the tehsildar, has been registered under sections 2,3 and 4 of the Epidemic Act, 1893, and section 56 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. “These sections mainly deal with dereliction of duty,” said the collector. Besides, a departmental inquiry would also be initiated against the health officer. Collectors in the state are strictly monitoring the vaccination programme in their districts. The state currently has 85% partial or first-dose beneficiaries and 50% full-dose beneficiaries. Parbhani district stands 30th in terms of vaccination in the state, According to the complaint, even after following up with the official and urging him to encourage citizens to participate in the drive, no effort was taken by the concerned officer. State government officials have been directing local authorities to speed up vaccination in all districts in the wake of omicron variant and experts stressing on completion of double-dose vaccination. Nearly 22 districts continue to be below the state average in both the doses. Districts such as Parbhani, Gadchiroli, Hingoli, Beed, Nanded and Nandurbar have been directed to boost first dose vaccination. Nanded and Nandurbar have not even completed 70% first-dose vaccination, according to the chart issued on December 10.

Jyothika, 9, daughter of Sreeja Kumari and Biju of Kunnummukal near Venjaramoodu is the deceased. Her mother had died a day before. It is suspected that Sreeja Kumari consumed poison before serving poisoned juice to her three children, aged nine, seven and three on Wednesday afternoon. Venjaramoodu police said that Jyothika died around 10 pm on Thursday at SAT Hospital for Women and Children, where she was under treatment in the critical care unit. Her younger siblings, however, are recuperating and are out of danger. ‘’The doctors have informed us that the younger children are out of danger and have even started taking food on Friday,’’ said Venjaramoodu station house officer inspector V Saiju Nath. The inspector, however, said they were still clueless about the reason that led Sreeja Kumari to commit this act. ‘’We have learned that she had attempted suicide around four months ago too by consuming excess amounts of pills,’’ he said. Sreeja Kumari’s husband, who worked in Pune, arrived here on Friday. The police are yet to record his statement. The couple were separated for a brief period of time when Sreeja Kumari got into a relationship with another man. Her third child was born out of that relationship. Recently, she broke up with him and reconciled with her husband. She worked as a saleswoman at a textile shop at Venjaramoodu. Her parents told the police that she did not come home two days prior to her death, citing that she had night duty. But her employers have told the police that this was false as the shop did not function during nights. The police have confiscated her mobile phone, which is password protected, and sent it to the cyber experts for detailed examination. On Thursday Sreeja Kumari was rushed to a hospital at Attingal by her mother after she vomited and fell unconscious at home in the afternoon. At hospital, she revealed to the doctor that she had consumed poison following which she was referred to Medical College Hospital. The family learned about the children being poisoned after the eldest daughter started vomiting at her tuition centre in the evening.  Soon the other two kids were also taken to the hospital .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/venjaramoodu-suicide-eldest-child-also-dies/articleshow/88347941.cms||---

The incident was caught on camera and the man later booked by traffic police. Circulating on social media, the video shows the cop on the speeding vehicle’s bonnet, struggling to keep his balance. Describing the incident that occurred near Panchsheel Square in Nagpur, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Sarang Awad said, “Traffic constable Sagar Hiwrale was managing traffic at Panchsheel Square. Around 2pm, traffic cops from Morris College Square spotted a car bearing registration number MH31CP9594 jumping the red light signal and moving towards Wardha Road. The cops passed this on through walkie talkie.” Alerted by the call, Hiwrale found the car at the Panchsheel Square red light. He then moved towards the car and motioned it to stop. Before he could stop the vehicle, the traffic signal turned green. Instead of stopping, the driver increased the speed in a bid to escape, Awad said. The cop then sat on the bonnet and the driver carried him for almost 50m from the signal. The driver was later intercepted by other motorists on the Canal Road, the DCP said. The man was taken to Sitabuldi police station where it was learnt that that the driver Harish Bhojare, along with three co-passengers including his wife and sister, was heading to a hospital for some medical emergency. “As he he had an appointment, Bhojare jumped the signal and drove off with the traffic cop on his bonnet. To prove his claim, Bhojare also showed doctor’s prescription for his sister, who is a severe diabetic patient,” said the DCP. Later, Sitabuldi traffic cops booked Bhojare under sections 179, 239, 184 and 186 of the Motor Vehicle Act. He was then allowed to visit the hospital. Bhojare also submitted a written apology.

Order 593/2017 was shared with the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) last week. The compensation can scale up to a maximum of Rs 10 crore for megacities like Ahmedabad, the order claims. “By this standard, the AMC has been issued 16 notices for not meeting discharge norms over the past two years,” says a senior GPCB official. The compensation amount was arrived at through a formula that calculates the capital cost for treating 1 million litres of sewage a day (MLD) at the STP. This ranges between Rs 63 lakh to Rs 3 crore while the operation and maintenance charges is calculated around Rs 30,000 per month. “The BIS and NGT suggested to assume the capital cost for STPs as Rs. 1.75 crore per MLD. Further, expected cost for conveyance system is assumed as Rs. 5.55 per MLD. Meanwhile, annual operation and maintenance cost is 10% of the combined capital cost,” claims the NGT order .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-liable-to-pay-fine-for-polluting-river/articleshow/88364904.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

NMMC officials added that if any family members of students have recently returned from abroad, then these students will have to again undergo Covid-related tests. NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar said this particular school and junior college will remain shut for the next eight days till all the students and the staff are tested for Covid. “There are basically three building blocks in this Ghansoli campus, and hence we will be checking all students and staff. I have also instructed that masks and use of hand sanitisers is compulsory,” said Bangar. While 16 of the students had tested positive on Friday, two more were found Covid positive on Saturday. Contact tracing is also being done by checking the family members of the affected students. Talking to the Times of India, deputy municipal commissioner (education) Jaydeep Pawar said: “So far, we have tested over 80% of the students of the institute in Ghansoli after 16 students (mainly from the 11th standard, while others are from the lower classes) were found to be positive. Initially, one student tested positive. This particular student’s father had recently returned to India from a foreign country, but he has tested negative. Later, the other students were tested.” Pawar added: “We have instructed all the city schools to ensure that the hand sanitisers provided by the NMMC are regularly used. Soaps have also been provided in all school toilets, while social distancing has to be maintained at all times. Whenever necessary, the RT-PCR and antigen testing shall be conducted on students as well as the staff of the school.” On Saturday, nearly 600 students of the institute located in Sector 18 in Ghansoli, the Shetkari Shikshan Sanstha, underwent tests related to Covid-19 as an added precaution.

In their complaint to the superintendent of police, Rohtak, the complainant stated that they had got a habitual offender from dominant caste, who had barged into one of their member’s house on December 7 night at 10pm with wrongful intention. Accused Kuldeep alias Bholu was booked under POCSO and SC/ST Act and was sent to judicial custody. The complainant stated that members of the dominant caste started creating pressure on them to withdraw the complaint or be ready to face consequences. Later, some members from dominant caste ganged up and declared social boycott — they were not permitted to enter fields or maintain any relations with dominant caste members. The accused also announced a fine of Rs 11,000 on anyone getting in touch with lower caste members. The complainant also claimed that young members from the dominant caste also tease the girls from their community and when they complain, they are told to settle them without going to police or court. Meanwhile, the accused told media that they have not boycotted from public spaces, but have barred them from entering their agriculture fields fearing that they may be framed under false SC/ST Act. Following the outcry on social boycott, Rohtak deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Mahesh Kumar called both the victim and the accused to the police station immediately. On being contacted, DSP Kumar said there was no social boycott. “Both the parties were called today and it was found that the boycott issue was a result of a misunderstanding between both the communities and it has been resolved now.

They are facing loss because of the pandemic situation and other factors. The city corporation and state government should come forward to help them clock more business by facilitating customer movement,” he said.

The officer said headmasters have started sending pictures of school buildings as a documentary evidence of their condition. According to Geetha, All the government and aided schools will be inspected in the next few days to identify weak buildings that are not suitable for use. Senior school education department officials said they had identified 550 weak classroom and toilet buildings in the government and aided schools in September this year. The official said the annual allocation of funds made by the state government for restoration/construction of new buildings and toilets in the schools was not enough.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/officials-to-now-check-for-weak-school-buildings/articleshow/88364894.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Sariska tiger tranquilised again for treatment of back wound||JAIPUR: Tiger ST-6, which is caged inside an enclosure at the Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) for the past one-and-a-half years, was tranquilized again on Saturday for treatment. The 16-year-old tiger has a deep maggot-infested on its back. Senior veterinary doctor Arvind Mathur said, “There was a wound on the dorsal surface of the animal. The tiger probably got hurt while sitting under the bushes or scratching itself against a tree. After the treatment it was kept under observation in a cage.” The oldest tiger of STR, which was famous for its ceaseless walks, is living its last days in an enclosure due to alleged mismanagement of the forest officials. Bureaucratic indecisiveness is impending the release of the tiger to a bigger area in the wild. The big cat is caged in an enclosure measuring approximately 2 hectare in the core area of STR for medical treatment. Sunayan Sharma, a retired IFS officer said, “The forest officers have forgotten the difference between zoo and a tiger reserve. To protect an old animal, one cannot keep it in an enclosure for so long. The officials are defying the law of nature.” ST-6 was a famous dominant tiger. After launching one of the worst attacks on the then RTR ranger Daulat Shingh Shaktawat, it had gone for a long walk to Uttar Pradesh before returning to Bharatpur. It was brought to Sariska during the translocation programme in 2008. A source said, “ST-6 has been tranquilized highest number of times in the history. In wild human intervention of this level is not required. The tiger is unethically kept inside the enclosure. It is as it is getting injured and hurt.” The Rajasthan forest department has kept three tigers in three separate reserves Ranthambore, Mukundra and Sariska in captivity for over past one-and-a-half years inside a core area. Wildlife activist Ajay Dubey said, “The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) should take suo motu cognisance on this matter. The NTCA itself has admitted that wild animals should not kept in captivity as it loses it traits. Sundari, which had spent 28 months in captivity in Satkosia Tiger Reserve, is a case study.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sariska-tiger-tranquilised-again-for-treatment-of-back-wound/articleshow/88364903.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Booster shots can increase antibodies, say doctors||JAIPUR: With the state reporting 17 cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, the health experts have suggested that the government should come up with a policy to make booster doses available for people who got vaccinated against the virus a few months ago. They also claimed that six months after vaccination, antibodies reduce and booster shots can increase immunity significantly. The Centre had flagged off the Covid-19 vaccination drive on January 16 targetting high-risk groups first, including frontline workers, healthcare workers, elderly (above 60), and people with comorbidities (45 to 59 years). TimesViewA lot of people who had been vaccinated for Covid a long time ago suspect that with the passage of time, antibody titers might have gone down. They fear if the third wave - powered by the Omicron variant - hits, they will not have the defence mechanism to beat the virus. The state government must press the Centre to immediately approve a booster shot, which has already been approved in several countries.By March-end, 7 lakh beneficiaries (at high risk) were completely vaccinated with both doses and by May-end, the figure of fully vaccinated people rose to 32.4 lakh. Since June 1, more than 32 lakh fully vaccinated people have not received any Covid-19 shot. "As the number of Covid-19 patients is rising in the world, many western countries have started administering booster vaccination to its population. We should also consider giving booster doses to the healthcare workers and the high-risk population," said Dr Ashish Jain, director of critical care at a private hospital. The health experts said the government should review its vaccination policy and ensure that people have enough antibodies to fight Covid-19. "Booster doses should be given, but tests should be conducted to check that people have enough antibodies. Only if they lack immunity, they should get the booster dose. Also, vaccination for children should be started while focusing on those who are still left out from the inoculation drive," said Dr Lokendra Shamra, senior professor of pharmachology at SMS medical college. Health officials and the government have been trying hard to vaccinate the 18 + population, but with the emergence of the Omicron variant, the health department has stepped up efforts to inoculate the eligible people with at least the first dose by the end of December. "A high-level committee will decide whether the booster dose should be given for now or not. A booster dose, in my opinion, is needed since the immunity generated by the vaccines isn’t permanent, after six months the antibody titers go down dramatically and a single dose of booster brings it up," said, Dr Pankaj Anand, senior consultant, critical care and emergency at a private hospital. He added that the decision should come out by the end of this month. "The booster dose increases the chances of protection against the new Omicron variant," he said. "I believe the government will come out with guidelines about booster doses soon. The government will set up the protocols whether the booster should be the same as the initial two doses of Covid-19 vaccine or if they could be mixed," said Dr Praveen Kanojia, senior consultant, internal medicine, at a private hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/booster-shots-can-increase-antibodies-docs/articleshow/88364896.cms||Syed Intishab Ali
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP following Congress by misusing central agencies, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Lashing out at the ruling BJP for the income tax department’s raids on the premises of SP leaders, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said the BJP is following in the footsteps of the Congress by using central agencies to threaten political adversaries. Akhilesh said the income tax department has jumped into the poll fray and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will follow suit. “BJP Congress ke hi raaste par chal rahi hai. Congress ka purana itihaas utha kar ke aap dekhenge to jab kabhi bhi darana hota tha … inhi sansthaon se unhein daraya jaata tha. Aaj usi raaste par Bharatiya Janata Party chal rahi hai … BJP ke paas koi naya raasta nahi hai (BJP is following in the Congress’ footsteps. Congress has the history of using central law enforcement agencies to intimidate others… Today, BJP has taken the same route),” the former UP CM said. He was replying to a media query on I-T raids during a press conference in Congress bastion, Rae Bareli, hours after I-T sleuths swooped down on half a dozen premises of SP supporters in Lucknow, Mainpuri and Mau districts. Akhilesh’s attack on the Congress is being seen in reference to the disproportionate assets case that the CBI recommended following a preliminary enquiry (PE) against SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav and his wife Dimple Yadav in 2007. In 2013, the CBI closed the case stating that the charges could not be substantiated. Allegations are that the then Congress-led UPA government at the Centre used the CBI probe to armtwist the SP to wriggle out of the vote of no-confidence over the Indo-US nuclear deal. “I have always said as the elections will draw closer, ‘seniormost leaders’ of BJP will visit UP. The income tax department has jumped into the fray. Now, the ED, CBI and all other central agencies will follow. Allegations will be heaped,” Akhilesh said. “Income tax department searches have confirmed that even the BJP leadership has realized that their party will be wiped out in polls. They have done this in the West Bengal and Maharashtra elections and see what happened there,” he added. He said such tactics would not stop SP and its bicycle (election symbol) from surging ahead. Questioning the timing of the searches, the SP chief said the same action could have been initiated a month ago but it came right before the elections which raises suspicion on what prompted such an exercise. “This is being done to engage us in talking only about the searches and forget about BJP’s failure to give jobs to youths, double the income of farmers, and provide safety to women and children. We will not forget these issues and will talk about them. Lawyers will respond to I-T department’s queries,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-following-congress-by-misusing-central-agencies/articleshow/88365354.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

They are demanding the arrest of all the accused in the case, and have been on a dharna outside the general hospital. Advocate Rajat Kalsan, president of the National Alliance For Dalit Human Rights, said that the relatives are not satisfied with the action taken by the police in this matter. “The police has so far arrested only four accused. While they are claiming that some more have been arrested, but there is no clarity in the case. Tomorrow, we will lead a protest march from Krantiman Park to the mini secretariat,” he said. Some villagers had allegedly beaten Vinod to death over the alleged theft of an electric battery and inverter from a field at Mirkan village of Hisar district on Tuesday, while his cousins Sandeep and Bhal Singh were injured and have been hospitalized. The victims’ family and relatives have been on dharna at the general hospital in Hisar, demanding that the case investigating officer be changed and all the five accused in the case be arrested.

---||Mumbai||8 more Omicron cases in Maharashtra, count stands at 48||MUMBAI: Eight more cases of the highly transmissible Omicron variant have been found in positive Covid-19 samples in the state, taking the count of cases linked to the variant to 48 in Maharashtra. Four of the new cases were detected from passengers arriving at Mumbai airport, three are residents of Satara and one is from Pune city. All have international travel history and most adults are either partially or fully vaccinated, as per authorities. State officials said all four cases in Mumbai were detected through screening at the airport. A 32-year-old Kerala resident and a 31-year-old resident of Jalgaon, who had returned from South Africa on December 6, were among the positive cases. Another infected individual is a 48-year-old Chhattisgarh resident who arrived from Tanzania to Mumbai on December 11. The fourth person found with the variant is a 49-year-old UK resident who landed in Mumbai from London on December 12 and was found positive for Covid during screening at the airport. They were put under institutional quarantine and their samples sent for genome sequencing. The National Institute of Virology confirmed the Omicron diagnosis on Saturday. Importantly, said state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate, two of them, the Jalgaon and the UK residents, were fully vaccinated. The Chhattisgarh man was unvaccinated while the Kerala man had taken a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC's executive health officer, said all were asymptomatic and were hospitalised as a precaution. The three Satara patients are all members of the same family, state officials said. Two are adults and one is an eight-year-old girl. Both adults are fully vaccinated. Officials said they had a travel history to east Africa. However, none of them have any symptoms. The sole Pune patient is a 17-year-old contact of an international traveller. She too has no symptoms, the officials said. Dr Awate said that of the 48 infected till now, seven are children. None of the children had any major symptoms although they are all unvaccinated, he said. One of the physicians at Jijatama Hospital in Pimpri-Chinchwad, where two children were hospitalised first, said only one of them had a minor cough. “The cough was resolved with basic medication. The symptoms have been mild or non-existent in the cases we have seen so far,” he said. A senior state official, however, said it would be premature to call Omicron a mild variant based on a handful of cases. Incidentally, a study by Imperial College London (ICL), released on Friday, said there was no evidence to say Omicron was milder than Delta. In fact, the researchers said, the risk of reinfection with Omicron could be more than five times higher than Delta. Dr Awate said the silver lining is that 28 of the 48 patients have been discharged. Also, the state has carried out RT-PCR tests of 20,546 international travellers, of whom just 61 (0.3%) were found positive for Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-8-more-omicron-cases-in-state-count-stands-at-48/articleshow/88364936.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The most crucial of the elections for the formation of the new senate body, that of the registered graduates’ category, is scheduled for Sunday. Of the 14 seats of the registered graduates’ category, each representing individual faculties of the university, elections will be held for nine seats as five candidates have won the polls unopposed. For these nine seats, 27 candidates are in fray. The university campus has turned into a virtual political battleground ahead of Sunday’s elections. Not just the university campus, battle lines have been drawn even outside the campus with the city unit of BJP jumping into an election which otherwise remains a university affair. The polls have turned into a tug of war BJP city unit president Vijay Shah, who has lined up candidates backed by the party, and Jigar Inamdar led “Team MSU”, referred to the saffron camp that currently enjoys majority in the senate and syndicate bodies of the university. Members of the ‘sankalan samiti’ — Inamdar’s rival saffron faction — have the backing of BJP. Also, Shah is taking personal interest in two candidates contesting from Faculty of Commerce and Faculty of Technology and Engineering, sources said. Presence of Congress-backed candidates and independents has added colour to the political drama. Such keen is the poll battle that corporators and BJP workers have been entrusted the task of bringing in voters to the university campus. On Saturday, both the camps and the candidates, were busy reaching out to voters, arranging logistics for them, to ensure that each voter turns up for elections scheduled from 12 noon to 5 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/msu-all-set-for-high-pitched-battle/articleshow/88363602.cms||---
---||Kolkata||kolkata page||Kolkata: Leading social scientist, Jayanta K Ray, who studied and taught history, international relations, political science, South and South East Asia, Indian foreign policy and much more, breathed his last in Kolkata on Saturday morning. He was 88. Ray’s family came from Bangladesh and settled in Birbhum. He attended school in Suri, graduated from Presidency College and completed his Masters degree from Calcutta University. Ray began his teaching career in International Relations at Jadavpur University. Later, he served at the Indian Institute of Public Administration, New Delhi, and the Centenary Professor of IR at the history department of Calcutta University. He was the founder-director of the Centre for South and South East Asian Studies. Ray also served as the chairman of the Maulana Azad Institute of Asian Studies which, under his leadership, became the nodal centre for Asian Studies. Ray’s forte remained Indian foreign policy but he made significant contributions towards the understanding and dissemination of knowledge of India’s public administration. Ray will be remembered for starting research on contemporary Indonesia and Thailand, said scholars and students. His students remember him as one who could teach keeping a macro point of view that encompassed the evolution of Indian society and polity. In recognition of Ray’s scholarship in social sciences, the government of India appointed him as National Professor. “Unfortunately, he could not finish his last project, that of writing a history of Bengal from the 19th century to contemporary times,” rued long-time colleague and vice-chancellor of JU, Suranjan Das. “Ray carried out a pioneering study on East Pakistan which analysed the deep East-West divide in Pakistan and in 1971 when Bangladesh emerged, his work could stake a claim to a successful prediction,” said student and noted broadcaster, Pankaj Saha.

In the next three years, the hospital aspires to provide wheelchairs to 600 children and adults with disabilities. The initiative will ensure that people get the right wheelchair in the right way, the hospital claimed. “In the next three years, we will focus on building the capacity and capability of the government rehabilitation professionals and create a sustainable system. Eventually, we want to create a model clinic for mobility-impaired to provide long-term solutions in Rajasthan and beyond,” said Dr Ashok Gupta, superintendent at Jaipuria Hospital. Experts said according to 2011 Census, the state has approximately15,63,694 persons with disabilities, out of which 2,41,049 are persons with mobility disabilities. Urban Jaipur has 6,968 people with mobility disabilities, while Jaipur rural has 10,957. At least 3,600 people (20% of the mobility disability population) require a wheelchair in Jaipur. Without the right wheelchair, persons with mobility disabilities are left isolated socially and economically with little or no access to healthcare, education, and employment. The Covid-19 pandemic has further isolated this population as they are more vulnerable due to lower immunity caused by their disability. The project, JCF- Viraj, has been launched at the Jaipuria Hospital in collaboration with Jaipur Citizen Forum (JCF) and Motivation India. In most developing countries, including India, wheelchairs are usually mass distributed without any proper assessment of the user’s needs and living conditions. As a consequence, most of the wheelchairs are inappropriate and unusable. "Directorate of Specially-Abled Person of the state will extend all co-operation towards this project," said, Gajanand Sharma, commissioner and special secretary, Directorate of Specially-Abled Person. JCF chairperson Rajiv Arora said, "The unique initiative will not only benefit the citizens of Jaipur, but will be an example for other states." "Our primary aim is to establish a wheelchair service network in India that is in line with the WHO guidelines on wheelchair services," said Biju Mathew Motivation India regional director.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/city-gets-its-first-wheelchair-clinic-at-govt-run-jaipuria-hospital/articleshow/88364905.cms||---

After coming to power, the Congress government had announced to make many junctions signal-free in phase-wise manner for smooth flow of traffic. On Saturday, the CM laid the foundation stone for a signal-free traffic project, which will be constructed at B2 bypass and Laxmi Mandir crossroads on Tonk Road. He also inaugurated the Bassi flyover project. An official said currently there is a lot of traffic load at the B2 Bypass intersection on Tonk Road. In view of this, an underpass will be constructed for the traffic going from EP Road towards Mansarovar. On the other hand, a clover leaf will be built on Tonk Road in front of the petrol pump near Taaron Ki Koot and on Ramdas Agarwal Tirahe, the road leading to Hotel Marriott. “The entire project will cost Rs 155.06 crore. A target of 18 months has been set to complete this work. After the completion of this project, those going from EP Road towards Durgapura and from B2 Bypass towards Sanganer will have to use the clover leaf,” said the official. Similarly, two-lane underpass and two pedestrian subways will be built on Tonk Road from Sabzi Mandi road near Laxmi Mandir crossroad, having a length of about 400 metres. The cost of this entire project will be around Rs 81.25 crore. An 18 months deadline has been set for the completion of this project. The CM has also inaugurated the Bassi railway over bridge project constructed over the bust Jaipur-Delhi railway line in Bassi. The foundation stone of beautification work at Jawahar Circle and the inauguration of Desert Park at Kishanbagh near Vidyadhar Nagar was also done online by the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-inaugurates-bassi-flyover-as-part-of-infra-push/articleshow/88364927.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi University entrance to bring parity for students, feel teachers||NEW DELHI: Following Delhi University’s decision to conduct a common entrance for admissions to undergraduate programmes from the next academic year, principals of private and government schools agreed the move could help bridge the gap between school and college education. In DU’s Executive Council meeting on Friday, the university decided to replace the education board marks-based admission with entrance exams. DU officials said the board results of Class XII would be considered only as a qualifying factor. School principals, however, contended that the relevance of board examinations would continue. Jyoti Arora, principal, Mount Abu Public School, said, “The board examination will definitely continue being an important assessment. It bridges the gap between school and college education. An entrance exam is definitely a good decision. Why should a child be deprived if for some reason the board result is not good enough? The National Education Policy, 2020, too talks about a holistic approach to education and this change will be in that direction.” For A K Jha, principal of SV Co-ed Vidyalaya, Rohini, the common entrance examination will be preparatory for aspirants in other competitive exams. “Apart from the fact that the entrance exam can help students sitting for other competitive exams, another important aspect will be that marks from across the different education boards will get equalised through this mode. The students will still have to take the Class XII boards seriously because other universities might want to consider those results for admission.” Many also argued that school education wouldn’t be negated because such an entrance exam demanded a good knowledge base. “How one gets through an entrance examination is based on what a school has taught that student,” pointed out Tania Joshi, principal, The Indian School. “No one will neglect school education. See how science students, despite facing IIT JEE and NEET, strive to perform well in the board exams.” Many educationists added that doing away with the system of cutoff marks for admission to DU was a good move and that the university should chalk out a proper plan to implement the same because the number of colleges and courses involved was huge. R Govinda, former vice-chancellor, National University of Educational Planning, said, “Entrance examinations are already being conducted for many different streams, so if DU is really able to implement an all-India testing system, then it will be a very good move. The ridiculous approach of the need for a 100% score to get admissions will also be done away with. The number of students involved in DU is huge with many of them from different states. But there are numerous courses, so the university has to plan the admission tests really well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-entrance-to-bring-parity-for-students-feel-teachers/articleshow/88365660.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Hyderabad||Intermediate first year results in Telangana leave psychologists’ phones ringing||HYDERABAD: Ever since the Intermediate first-year results were released on Thursday, psychologists — roped in by the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education (TSBIE) — have been flooded with hundreds of calls from students and parents. In a shift in trend, psychologists say most calls are from parents seeking help for their depressed children and questioning their style of parenting. Previously, parents would blame children rather than introspect. “This is the first time I have been receiving calls from parents asking if there is any fault in their parenting style which resulted in their child not passing the exam,” said Dr Tenali Rajini, one of the seven clinical psychologists offering services through the Inter Board. “Some of them are asking if pampering their child too much has spoiled them. Others, are calling to know if being a strict parent is stopping their child from sharing his or her troubles with them,” she added. Psychologists have been receiving hundreds of calls from students and parents since Thursday night. “I received 282 calls yesterday. Most of these calls are from parents, especially fathers. They are worried about their child’s future,” said P Jawaharlal Nehru, a psychologist, adding that few of the calls received are from lecturers, who are also parents, complaining that their child could not pass because of lack of faculty. He said that in the current situation parents should not lose their cool. “A parent called me complaining his child secured very few marks. If a child secured 35% marks and cleared the exam, it is normal. Expecting everyone to score 100% or 90% marks is abnormal,” he added. Many parents are anxious and want to know if papers will be re-evaluated, whether or not supplementary examination will be conducted. Psychologist S Sreelatha said that she received about 200 calls, mostly from parents asking if opting for revaluation will change their child’s result. The psychologists also received calls from anxious students, who failed in the exam, informing them of their desperate thoughts as they felt they had brought a “bad name” to their family by failing in the exam. Many also said they don’t want to go home as they were scared of their parents, worried about their reputation, among other issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/inter-first-year-results-leave-psychologists-phones-ringing/articleshow/88364344.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The survey report, which was released last month, states that 36% of all rural women aged between 20 and 24 years were married off before they turned 18. Likewise, around 19% of the women in the 20-24 age group were married before they attained 18 years. However, the underage marriage rate has dropped in the last five years. “We welcome the central government’s decision to raise the marriage age for women and will work in accordance to implement the provision. Implementation will be done at any cost. The main challenge here will be to make people aware about the issue, specially in the rural belts. The people here have their own taboos and customs. People believe that after a certain age, there will be difficulties in ‘kanyadan’. However to avoid such instances, task forces as well as the district administrations deal with them to prevent such cases. If the administration has decided to eradicate such cases, then nothing is impossible. But at the same time it also expected that the public will report such cases if they come to know about them,” said Anil Kumar, nodal officer, National Health Mission, family planning. Lack of awareness among the rural populace was cited as a major reason for the underage marriages. Social worker Sunita Yadav said, “The state has merely created awareness in the rural areas. Neither the government nor the NGOs have raised their voice against this practice. It is sad to see girls being married off at such an early age. This social evil can be removed only when the government and the people join hands.” Recently, state youth affairs minister Hafizul Hassan had stirred up a controversy by demanding the legal marriage age for women be reduced to 16 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/nfhs-survey-says-32-women-in-state-get-married-before-18/articleshow/88364328.cms||---

Titled as Luggu-Pahar Pumped Storage, the project will be set up on the Bokaro river near Luggu Pahar. On Saturday, a team of DVC officials, along with sub-divisional officer (SDO) of Bermo Anant Kumar, held a gram sabha in the area regarding land acquisition process to take locals into confidence. The proposed project is situated in Pindra and Tuti Jharia of Tulbul panchayat, about 15km from Gomia block and 70km from the district headquarters. The dam will be built at about 500 meters from Luggu Baba temple, the holy shrine of Santhal tribals in the state. DVC officials have also promised to develop the holy place of the santhals, apart from initiating other developmental activities under corporate social responsibility. The SDO said, "We have visited the proposed site of with DVC officials to hold meetings with local residents. The blueprint of the project has been described to the residents. The project will bring development in the area. The DVC will begin feasibility survey of the project from Monday." The estimated cost of the project is Rs 5,200 crore. A DVC officer said, “The project will be a close loop type pumped storage scheme and comprise two reservoirs — one at the lower elevation and the other at the upper elevation. The water conductor system will connect the two reservoirs through an underground power house. During the peak hours power will be generated by releasing the upper reservoir’s water through water conductor, turbines and generator, installed at the power house to the lower reservoir.” The DVC has already two thermal power units producing more than 1,000 MW electricity in the district. On Thursday, new and renewable energy and power minister R K Singh in the Lok Sabha spoke about the project, which will have 1,500 MW capacity. The minister said, "The project envisages construction of the upper dam across Kairo Jharna nala with an underground power house on the downstream of the upper dam and lower dam across the Bokaro river.” He added that many important steps, including declaration of trajectory for renewable purchase obligation up to 2022,have been taken to promote solar energy generation in the country and allow foreign direct investment (FDI) up to 100 per cent under the automatic route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dvc-work-for-1500mw-hydel-plant-begins/articleshow/88364358.cms||Divy Khare

Both the leaders were re-elected at the party’s 12th general convention, which was held at Sohrai Bhawan banquet hall in Harmu here. Addressing the gathering, septuagenarian Shibu, referred to by his party colleagues and followers as “Guruji”, urged JMM workers and office-bearers to remain united and work towards eradicating social vices in the tribal community like liquor consumption, gambling and illiteracy of the girl child. In his speech, Hemant urged the party workers to remain united. With the outfit plagued by internal bickering in the recent months along with growing voices of dissent, he said the party leadership will keep its doors open to any worker who flags problems. Making a veiled attack on his sister-in-law Sita (Soren) Murmu, Hemant said: “Social media, channels and newspapers are not the place to voice dissent. If any of you has a problem, we are ready to listen to it and resolve it.” The widow of Shibu’s deceased son Durga, Sita, who is the incumbent Jama MLA and party general secretary, had in recent months criticised the JMM leadership and claimed that the party has been hijacked by touts. In a bid to reduce flab and plug internal bickering, the JMM pruned the size of its central and executive committees. The 350 member-strong central committee was reduced to 300 while the 65-member executive will now have only 50 members. The party will now have nine general secretaries in place of 12. JMM sources also said this will centralise the party’s functions with the working president. The party also hiked the annual voluntary contribution by the office bearers and lawmakers. Earlier, an incumbent MLA or a minister had to donate Rs 10,000 to the party fund. Now, they will have to pay Rs 50,000. In another resolution, JMM proposes to set up a commission to conduct surveys of the families who lost their homes and land due to industrial and government projects and help in their rehabilitation, education and livelihood. The tribal party also passed a resolution demanding 50% reservation for women, 28% reservation for OBC and 27% reservation for ST in government and private jobs. It also demanded that unused government land in village and block areas be given on short-term leases to rural people to take up agriculture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/shibu-hemant-re-elected-as-jmm-prez-working-prez/articleshow/88364291.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Haveri first had a problem with unscientifically built speed breakers or humps on its roads. The NH-48 in Haveri, Ranebennur and other cities, the Sirsi-Monakalmur state highway, Haveri-Gadag state highway, all maintained by the PWD, had speed breakers built so high that these roads were a motorist’s nightmare. Such road structures have to be laid 20 mm in height and 200 mm in width to curb speed and avoid accidents. But the speed breakers in Haveri were 10 inches in height and at least one-foot-wide on most roads. After a Supreme Court order on a case on road laying in Gujarat, the PWD department decided to remove the humps. After the removal, the roads became misshapen because nothing was done to make the roads motorable again. Srinivaspur MLA K R Rameshkumar raised the question of unscientific road humps on the floor of the assembly earlier. Many other members joined him in criticising the condition of the roads. PWD minister C Patil assured the assembly that the roads would be improved. The PWD has decided to show a progress report on the roads in the ongoing Belagavi winter session. According to sources, the PWD removed the road humps using JCB machines. But they did not rework to smoothen the road where the speed breakers were originally laid. “Earlier, a road construction agency had laid the unscientific humps. After directions from the top court, they were supposed to remove these. But the authorities have not removed them properly and have not repaired the spots. Now, these spots are hell for two and four-wheeler riders. However, we have appealed to the authority to remove the road humps properly and do the patchwork at the spot,” said BJP leader Basavaraj Masur. “We will file a complaint with the Lokayukta if they don’t meet our demand,” he warned. PWD executive engineer Satish Jahagiradar clarified that work was slow because of the heavy rain in November. “We will remove the road humps and patchwork will start soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/haveri-motorists-face-speed-breaker-woes/articleshow/88364059.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

In order to ensure this, the state transport department is drafting a policy which is going to incentivise the purchase of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and eyeing a 10% share of registration by 2026. A highly placed source in the transport department confirmed the development and said that the policy is being brought to take carbon credits and to ensure a smooth transition of public transport vehicles to clean energy. The policy is also on the lines of the state electric vehicles policy which has been drafted by the state industries department and was discussed with top automobile companies by chief minister Hemant Soren during his investors meet in the national capital earlier this year. As per the draft of the policy, public transport vehicles, including three and four wheelers running on petrol and diesel, will be completely phased out from nine cities of the state and they will be migrated to cleaner options like Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or on batteries by March, 2026. In order to realise the feat, the policy is going to have several incentives for three-wheeler owners as well as those operating taxis that run on diesel and petrol. “Auto-rickshaw and four-wheeler owners will be exempted from registration, permit and fitness fees under the new policy if they switch to CNG or EV/ battery operated vehicles,” the source said. Strengthening the infrastructure is also an important part of the policy and the state transport department has identified selected routes which will be equipped with adequate CNG stations as well as charging points for the clean mobility vehicles. Around half a dozen inter-city routes as well as a stretch in Ranchi have been finalised which will be equipped with an adequate number of CNG and charging stations. “In Jharkhand, we will not only be setting up charging stations but a battery swapping facility will also be there at the charging stations so that a person using an EV can travel to longer distances from one city to another in a hassle-free manner,” said an official in the know-how of policy. Upon contact, the joint transport commissioner, Ravishankar Vidyarthi, said that the department is working on a policy for cleaner mobility but didn’t divulge any details. He, however, added that they have already stopped registration and issuance of permits to diesel-run auto rickshaws in Ranchi since February last year. “Apart from that, the number of battery-operated vehicles has increased to 10,000 in the last few years across the state. So we are trying our best to ensure that we move to a cleaner mobility in years to come,” he said. As per state transport department, over 5 lakh vehicles are registered every year and once the policy is rolled out, the department is eyeing to register around 50,000 vehicles which are EV/CNG or battery-operated. “By March 2024, we will complete the setting up of charging and refuelling stations on selected routes and by March 2026, 10% of total registered vehicles will be EV/CNG based,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/jharkhand-to-have-e-vehicle-policy-by-26/articleshow/88371701.cms||Gaurav Pandey

---||India||CJI launches India's first international arbitration centre, quotes from ex-PM Rao's speech||HYDERABAD/NEW DELHI: India's first International Arbitration and Mediation Centre (IAMC), inaugurated jointly by Chief Justice of India N V Ramana and Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday in Hyderabad, hit the jackpot on day one itself. KCR told the gathering that the Telangana government would incorporate a clause in all big project tenders and contracts stating that all disputes, if they arise during the course of implementation, would have to be adjudicated at the IAMC. The ongoing property dispute between former IPL chairman Lalit Modi and his mother, Bina Modi, has already been referred to IAMC. Justice Ramana said, "Arbitration and mediation have a long history in India. Recently, they have acquired prominence across the world as methods of dispute resolution. ADR (alternative dispute resolution) methods are beneficial to the parties due to various reasons - low cost, speed, more control over timelines and process, autonomy of parties, a more comfortable environment, and a non-adversarial nature." Justice Ramana quoted former PM P V Narasimha Rao's speech during the inauguration of the international centre for ADR at New Delhi more than 26 years ago - "Any democracy worth the name must provide for adequate and effective means of dispute resolution at a reasonable cost; otherwise, the rule of law becomes a platitude and people may take the law into their own hands, disrupting peace, order and good government." The Hyderabad centre would enhance the ADR landscape in India, he said, but lamented that though arbitration centres have already been set up in India, most prominently in Delhi and Mumbai, "domestic and international parties still appear to prefer the foreign arbitration centres". KCR assured the CJI that he would bring the required amendments to the procedures and manuals to refer all matters where the government is a party to the IAMC. KCR added that he would send chief secretary Somesh Kumar to IAMC life trustees Justice R V Raveendran, Justice L Nageswara Rao, and other experts to note down the areas and details that require amendments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cji-launches-indias-first-international-arbitration-centre-quotes-from-ex-pm-raos-speech/articleshow/88366133.cms||---

Naqvi's attack came in the backdrop of remarks made by opponents from Samajwadi Party and Owaisi and other critics of the decision. In his address at a 'Minorities Day' programme organised by the National Commission for Minorities in Delhi, Naqvi said, "Those who opposed making the social evil of Triple Talaq a crime or raised question on removal of restriction on Muslim women to perform Haj with Mehram only and now creating commotion on the constitutional equality regarding age of marriage of women are 'professional protesters' of the essence of the Indian Constitution." Allaying fears of the minorities, Naqvi said, "The constitutional and social commitment of the Indians has ensured that rights of the minorities are absolutely safe and secure in the country."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/marriage-age-debate-naqvi-slams-talibani-mentality/articleshow/88366151.cms||---
---||India||Hospitals set to get 'breastfeeding friendly' tags now||NEW DELHI: Concerned public health experts and the largest association of private hospitals have launched an initiative to certify hospitals as "breastfeeding friendly". The move comes in the wake of the latest national family health survey (NFHS) showing further increase in caesarean deliveries. Caesarean section delivery is associated with 46% lower prevalence of early initiation of breastfeeding. The Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India (BPNI), a 30-year old organisation for protection, promotion and support of breastfeeding in India, and the Association of Healthcare Providers of India (AHPI) comprising 12,000 private hospitals, including maternity centres, have partnered to launch the National Accreditation Centre (NAC) for Breastfeeding Friendly Hospitals. The accreditation is for hospitals offering maternity services and is based on WHO's 10 steps to successful breastfeeding. The objective is to assess the hospitals on policy, programmes and practices. More than 20 hospitals have applied so far, and Bloom Healthcare in Chennai is the first to be accredited as "Breastfeeding Friendly". "According to the latest NFHS (2019-21) only 41.8% mothers were enabled to breastfeed within an hour of birth and provide skin-to-skin contact to their babies immediately after birth. It means that 58% are not enabled. Going by approximately 24.5 million births annually, 14.2 million are deprived of the mother's milk and its benefits to the newborn and moms, violating the human rights of mother and child," BPNI said in a statement . "If we improve the breastfeeding rates in hospitals it reduces neonatal mortality and will impact our infant mortality rate (IMR)," said AHPI director general Dr Girdhar Gyani .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hospitals-set-to-get-breastfeeding-friendly-tags-now/articleshow/88366152.cms||---

The PMO's attention was drawn to the case by Lt-Gen Hooda's elder sister, Sushma Singh (68), when she tweeted about the need for the drug called Sacituzumab Govitecan (Trodelvy), which has been approved in the United States and Europe this year, for herself and many other women battling breast cancer in India. Lt-Gen Hooda amplified the tweet with his own tweet to state his sister was "a cancer patient of several years with dwindling hope". He said, "Approval of the new drug may give a fighting chance of survival to many like her." Lt-Gen Hooda, the former Northern Army commander, got a call from Modi within two hours. "I was honestly surprised and humbled. I told the PM that I have tears in my eyes. The PM said we will try and help her and do whatever we can," he told TOI. Soon after, an official also contacted his sister and asked her for the doctor's prescription and other documents to take the case forward. Singh said she is undergoing treatment for "triple negative metastatic breast cancer, which has limited treatment options". Requesting the PM to expedite the approval and purchase of the new drug for the Indian market, Singh said this would "grant a lease of life to me and others who have exhausted all other options of treatment".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-assures-veteran-of-help-in-getting-cancer-medicine-for-sister/articleshow/88366153.cms||---
---||India||Rajnath: Weapon systems for India have to be made here||NEW DELHI: India has very clearly conveyed to friendly nations like the US, Russia and France that weapon systems and platforms required by the Indian armed forces will have to be manufactured here, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday. Voicing the government's aim to make India a global defence production hub and self-reliant in its military requirements, Singh said it was agreed during talks with French defence minister Florence Parly on Friday that a major French company will produce "an engine" in India by joining hands with an Indian company under the strategic partnership model. Though the minister did not elaborate, the engine is likely to be for military helicopters to be produced by defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd in the years ahead. Addressing the annual general meeting of Ficci, Singh said the worth of India's defence and aerospace manufacturing market would increase to Rs 1 lakh crore by next year from the present Rs 85,000 crore. "When I talk about 'India Beyond 75', I see this figure to be Rs 5 lakh crore by 2047," he said. Noting that India's defence exports have grown by 325% in the last five years, he said the country will not only achieve its export target of Rs 35,000 crore by 2024-25 but will also become a net exporter of defence equipment. The minister also said the figure of the 209 items placed under an arms embargo under the two 'positive indigenization' lists so far will cross the 1,000-mark in this decade. India cannot depend on other countries for defence technologies due to its stature, its geographical location and the myriad security challenges it faces. "For the security of India and its people, it is necessary that we develop our defence capacity and capability so that even the most powerful country in the world has to think a thousand times before planning anything that endangers our interests," Singh said. "We have told every friendly country that we want to produce the military platforms, weapons and ammunition in India itself keeping in mind the security of the country...," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rajnath-weapon-systems-for-india-have-to-be-made-here/articleshow/88366172.cms||---
---||Delhi||Season's 1st 'cold day' in Delhi as icy winds sweep region||NEW DELHI: Icy northwesterly winds chilled the capital to the bone on Saturday, ushering in peak winter conditions days ahead of Christmas. The biting cold and gusty winds sent the maximum temperature plummeting to 17.8 degrees Celsius as Delhi recorded its first "cold day" of the season. The met department said similar conditions are likely over the next two days, with "cold day" conditions at a few places on Sunday and "cold waves" at isolated places on Sunday and Monday. The department declares "cold day" conditions when the maximum temperature falls below 20 degrees Celsius and is 4.5 degrees or more below normal. A "cold wave" takes place when the minimum temperature is either less than 4 degrees Celsius or is lower than normal by at least 4 degrees C. While the maximum temperature at Safdarjung was 5 below normal, the minimum too dropped to 6 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal. Elsewhere in the city, the night temperature touched 5 degrees Celsius at Ayanagar and Ridge, and 5.7 degrees at Lodhi Road. The lowest maximum on Saturday was 16.2 degrees recorded at SPS Mayur Vihar, followed by Palam at 16.4 degrees Celsius. Winds strong, AQI to stay 'poor' for now Strong and chilly westerly winds from north Rajasthan, which was been witnessing cold wave conditions for the past 48 hours, led to 'cold day' in the city," said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department. He said very strong and dry northwesterlies prevailed on Saturday in Delhi and NCR and, with winds blowing at 10-20 kmph during the first half of the day, which increased to 25 kmph, and gusting to 40 kmph, during the afternoon. "Such strong winds are likely on Sunday afternoon as well but may weaken on December 20. Normal winds are expected on December 21 afternoon," said Jenamani. The met department said shallow to moderate fog was observed during 2am to 8.30am at IGI Airport with lowest visibility touched the range of 200-400m during the same period. The city saw shallow fog as the visibility remained between 600-800m till 10 am. "The afternoon visibility in the city reached 1800-2000m with less smog due to the strong and dry winds in the afternoon. Stronger winds and low moisture over Delhi do not favour dense fog formation," said Jenamani. Meanwhile, the winds helped improve Delhi's air quality index (AQI). The overall AQI was 291 on Saturday in 'poor' category as against 329 in 'very poor' category on Friday. The air quality is likely to remain in the 'poor' category on Sunday and Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/seasons-1st-cold-day-in-delhi-as-icy-winds-sweep-region/articleshow/88366174.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The company officials announed the decision during a meeting with office bearers of the recognized union, L&T Cement Kamgar Sangh, on Saturday morning. President of the union and former MP Naresh Puglia has dashed a letter to chief minister seeking his intervention to stall the lockout at the largest cement factory in Chandrapur. VKKKS, headed by guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar’s daughter Shivani, has reportedly stalled production at Ultratech and is not allowing any kind of transportation or work at the plant for the last eight days to press their demands. Puglia alleged that VKKKS has backing of the guardian minister and the administration is supporting his union to create pressure on the company. “A minister from your cabinet has terrorized the industry with the help of district administration, police department and MPCB officials. While no new industry was brought to Chandrapur in the last two years, existing industries are being pressurized to procure 15,000 electric bikes at Rs15,000 each in the name of curbing pollution,” Puglia has alleged in the letter to the CM. He claimed that cement industries are paying wages of around Rs17,000 per month to contract workers, “but they are being deceived through promises of Rs6,000 hike through state government even as the matter falls under labour department of Union government”. The former MP alleged that VKKKS is not allowing any worker or officer to enter the plant. “Even after the company obtained orders from the district court stating that none of the workers or officers should be stopped from entering the plant, the police is reluctant to implement it,” Puglia alleged. VKKKS president Shivani Wadettiwar stated that their agitation will continue until the company officials agree to fulfil their demands. She claimed that talks were held with Utltratech officials in presence of district collector. “Officials are insisting that the demands will be fulfilled only after the union calls of the strike and allows resumption of production at the plant,” she said. She claimed that the company officials had made false promises in the past. “We don’t believe their oral assurances. We will give up our agitation only if they give us in writing that they are ready to fulfil the demands,” she said. Company officials could not be reached for their comments. District president of the unrecognized union, Vijay Thakre, said that their demands include providing at least 20 to 26 days work, canteen facility, uniform etc to contract workers. He warned that the union will not bow to pressure and the agitation will continue even if the company goes into lockout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/union-backed-by-state-minister-stalls-work-ultratech-chanda-plans-lockout/articleshow/88364709.cms||---

The student is asymptomatic and had got herself tested as a precautionary measure ahead of plans for travelling outside the city. On Friday, a CBSE school on Kamptee Road was closed for a week after a student there tested positive. As per sources in the school in Dabha, the student attended physical classes only once this week but to comply with health department’s norms, the management will shut down physical classroom teaching with immediate effect. An employee working in the school’s administrative wing said, “We received a call today from Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) that a student has tested positive and they need to speak with the principal. So, we got the civic authorities in touch with the principal.” A senior teacher in the school said that the student was asymptomatic even on that single day when she attended school. “We check body temperature and ask about symptoms to all students, and she had none. It’s easier for us to manage because right now only Std IX has reopened for physical teaching,” said the teacher. Since Christmas vacations are just round the corner, the school has decided to synchronize their mandatory shutdown along with it. The senior teacher said, “We only had three working days left before the school closed for vacation, so we are doing it early. Now, reopening will be on January 3.” All students and teachers who came in contact with the student have been asked to undergo RT-PCR tests. Teachers who undergo the test will have to share their report with the school management before they are allowed to resume duty in January. However, online classes will continue as per schedule, thus ensuring that students do not suffer academic loss.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/another-cbse-school-closes-after-student-tests-positive/articleshow/88364752.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The accident took place near Indira Gandhi Stadium in central Delhi on Saturday morning. Police have arrested the truck driver and his helper. The deceased have been identified as Surender Yadav, 40, the auto driver, his nephew Jay Yadav, 32, residents of Shastri Park in northeast Delhi, and passengers Komal Singh, 35, and Tata Prakash, 13. The auto was on its way to Seelampur and had reached the flyover loop adjacent to Gate No 16 of IG Stadium at 6.50am when it encountered the truck carrying the container. Driver & helper of truck carrying rice sacks caughtA police officer said, "There is a dangerous curve on the road at that point. Since the truck was being driven at high speed, it careened there and lost its balance. The almost 10ft-high container snapped its fixings on the flatbed truck and fell on the autorickshaw." The officer disclosed that an emergency response vehicle patrolling the area saw the accident and informed the cops about the accident in front of gate No. 16 (IGI stadium). He said it took at least two hours for the fire department and police teams to retrieve the bodies from the flattened three-wheeler. "They had to cut though the mangled remains of the auto using gas cutters to get to the bodies. We also had to use a hydra crane," the officer said. Police arrested Pratish Chaudhary, 29, and his helper, Nitish, 24, later in the day. "We are probing all aspects of the case, including whether the driver was driving under the influence of alcohol," the officer said. Shweta Chauhan, DCP (Central), said that preliminary investigations showed that the truck, which was loaded with rice, was going from Sonipat in Haryana to the Tughlaqabad depot in south Delhi. According to relatives, the deceased, Singh and Prakash, disembarked from a bus from UP near Sarai Kale Khan bus terminus and hired the autorickshaw to go to Seelampur there. The boy and his uncle had come to Delhi for the first time. "Komal was a cook by profession and Prakash, his nephew, was a student," said Diwan Singh, a kin. In the afternoon, when TOI visited the spot, it found glass pieces littering the road. The container was lying on its side while the truck was parked nearby. Ironically, a sticker pasted on the truck read, 'Obey traffic rules'.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/13-year-old-among-four-killed-as-container-crushes-auto-in-delhi/articleshow/88366233.cms||Abhay Singh

He questioned the Delhi chief minister on why he had "privatised liquor distribution" in the national capital, "giving the vends to some big players". Kejriwal had promised eight lakh jobs before coming to power but gave just 440, Sidhu alleged. "He is a liar. In Punjab, he says he would raise revenue from sand not just Rs 2,000 crore but Rs 20,000 crore. The earlier government was earning just Rs 40 crore and our government raised it to Rs 200 to 300 crore. But from where you would get Rs 20,000 crore from sand. Show any other state which gets Rs 20,000 crore from sand," he added. "This much income would not come from sand but from liquor...," Sidhu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/liar-political-tourist-sidhu-slams-kejriwal-over-liquor-biz/articleshow/88366254.cms||IP Singh

More than 125 income-tax personnel fanned out into Mau, Lucknow, Mainpuri, Agra and Bengaluru to search half a dozen premises belonging to SP spokesperson Rajiv Rai who runs a chain of educational institutes in Karnataka, RCL Group promoter Manoj Yadav, Akhilesh's former OSD Jainendra Yadav alias Neetu, and aides Rahul Bhasin and Jagat Singh. The official word was that the raids, which continued until well past midnight, were based on "tip-offs about tax evasion". "...I work for people's welfare so the government has launched a crackdown...," said Rai who had unsuccessfully contested the Mau Lok Sabha seat on an SP ticket in 2014 and reported immovable assets of Rs 13.85 crore in his election affidavit. Sources said the operation would continue on Sunday. Akhilesh said the BJP was "following in the footsteps of Congress by using central agencies to threaten political adversaries as it has no other way" of doing so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-ed-to-follow-akhilesh-slams-i-t-raids-on-sp-netas/articleshow/88366257.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Chennai||PM Modi to open 11 medical colleges in Tamil Nadu in January||CHENNAI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister M K Stalin will share the stage in Virudhunagar on January 12 for the opening of 11 new medical colleges in the state. Union health and family welfare minister Mansukh Mandaviya will also take part in the event, sources said. This is the PM's first visit to Tamil Nadu after the Stalin-led DMK government assumed office. "The state government is ready to open the colleges as approval has been obtained for admission of 1,450 seats in these colleges. The PM (is keen on) attending the event," said a source. The erstwhile AIADMK government managed to get the colleges allotted for Tamil Nadu under the Modi government's scheme to establish medical colleges attached to existing district and referral hospitals. The Union and state governments shared the cost of 325 crore in a 60:40 ratio to set up each medical college. Ariyalur, Dindigul, Nagapattinam, Krishnagiri, Virudhunagar, Kallakurichi and Ooty colleges have been sanctioned 150 seats each, while Namakkal, Tiruvallur, Tiruppur and Ramanathapuram colleges have been allotted 100 seats each. The AIADMK had proposed colleges in Cuddalore and Kancheepuram too but owing to the presence of Annamalai University in Chidambaram and a private medical college in Kancheepuram, the state government could not get central approval. Former health minister C Vijayabaskar said the health department took up the implementation of the scheme on a war-footing and completed land acquisition and got approvals from government agencies quickly. "It was historic that TN got sanction for 11 medical colleges at one stroke. Even the newly created Kallakurichi district was included," Vijayabaskar said, recalling how appointment of doctors was a big challenge earlier in Nagapattinam, Ooty and aspirational districts like Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-pm-modi-to-open-11-medical-colleges-in-january/articleshow/88366282.cms||Julie Mariappan

He wanted to know from where the fund was allocated a month and a half before former state finance minister Amit Mitra allotted it Rs 100 crore in his budget speech on February 5, 2021, announcing that the scheme will be introduced from April 2021. Trinamool Congress senior and MP Saugata Roy held that the chief minister was accountable to the Bengal assembly over fund allocation for a particular scheme. “The CM is only answerable to the assembly. She will respond in the assembly. The governor is engaging in irrelevant talk,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/guv-tmc-spar-on-scheme-funds/articleshow/88364689.cms||---

Sengupta held that the announcement was a step towards decontrol of nationalised banks. In a Facebook post, the BJP leader and columnist wrote: “We, the common people, have put in all of our savings into banks. The savings could be Rs 5 lakh or Rs 25 lakh. That is what will secure our future. The government has come up with a guaranteed time-bound deposit insurance payment of Rs 5 lakh. What good can it do to the common man who may lose his life-long savings if a bank fails? We can’t praise the government for this.” A votary of bank nationalisation by Indira Gandhi, Sengupta saw the Modi government’s move as a step towards privatising the banking sector. “We know what amount of harm privatisation of the banking sector can do. We have seen people committing suicide after banks failed,” he said. BJP’s national vice-president Dilip Ghosh said Sengupta had put forward his personal opinion. “He may have his own opinion, but that is not a collective sentiment. Nobody in the past had ever thought of protecting the interest of depositors. Their savings had no security. Modiji tried to bring some guarantee to their savings and provide them with an even more secured future,” Ghosh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-bjp-leader-questions-pms-bank-deposit-guarantee/articleshow/88364694.cms||---

The protest was marred by chaos later in the evening as another group of workers did not vacate the highway resulting in them being removed forcibly by police. The Oragadam police detained about 70 protesters for causing nuisance and blockade even after the main protest was withdrawn. Chennai-Bengaluru highway blocked for 16-hours due to protest by women workersPolice said trouble started last Wednesday after more than 100 inmates who ate at their hostel canteen complained of nausea and stomach upset. Most women had to be admitted for two days. Unavailability ofhealth status of at least eight women workers sparked the protest near Oragadam inlate on Friday. The women demanded the district administration to bring back the hospitalised women and take action against those incharge of the hostel and dormitory for supplying spoiled food. As the protest, which started at 9pm on Friday, began stalling traffic on the highway, the Sriperumbudur police tried to pacify them. They then diverted the vehicles that had piled up by 5km through alternative routes. As the agitators stayed put on Saturday as well, Kancheepuram district collector Arthi ordered registration of a case against the hostel warden for providing spoiled food to the workers at 1pm. The collector also made a video call from her mobile phone and asked the eight ‘missing girls’ to speak to their colleagues. Following this, the women workers wound up their protest and dispersed. Based on a tip off police fanned across the state to stop and detain activists who were headed to join the protest. Chennai police detained activist and journalist Valarmathi and Kaleeshwari on their way to cover the event. Sources said at least 35 activists were detained and questioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/foxconn-protest-on-chennai-bengaluru-national-highway-ends-but-after-much-struggle/articleshow/88366353.cms||---

---||Amritsar||Amritsar: Youth 'beaten to death' for sacrilege at Golden Temple||AMRITSAR: In the second incident of a person being killed for sacrilege, a youth was allegedly beaten to death by the enraged sangat and sewadars at Golden Temple after he jumped in front of the Guru Granth Sahib in the sanctum sanctorum of the Golden Temple during the recital of rehras sahib (evening prayers) on Saturday evening. He scaled the railing as the devotees watched in horror, stepped on the 'rumala sahib' (cloth around the holy book) and picked up the sword placed in front of it, disrupting religious services. In October, Nihangs brutally hacked a man to death and put his body on display at Singhu border over sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib - the holy book Sikhs. Deputy Commissioner Police (DCP) Parminder Singh Bhandal confirmed that the youth was beaten to death. He told media persons that the youth, aged between 20 and 25, was wearing a yellow patka. "He was standing calmly with the sangat in the sanctum sanctorum, but when his turn came, he bowed and jumped inside the railing and picked up the sword," he said The youth was immediately overpowered and brought outside, and beaten by the angry sangat on the way, following which he died. The DCP said his body was sent to the morgue and an autopsy would be conducted on Sunday. He also said the police didn't find any identification card or document on the dead man, but they would check the CCTV footage to see if he was alone or not. Failure of govt, agencies that they could not catch culprits: SGPCIn October, a group of Nihangs had brutally hacked a man to death and put his body on display at Singhu border over sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib - the holy book of the Sikhs. An eyewitness who identified himself as Fateh Singh said a youth jumped over the railing with intention of sacrilege and tried to touch the saroop of Sri Guru Granth Sahib with his feet, but he was immediately caught and taken to room number 50. Another eyewitness who did not want to identify himself said the person in question was waiting for 'darshan' among the devotees, but suddenly scaled the safety railing and tried to take the golden sword kept in front of the saroop (copy) of Sri Guru Granth Sahib. A third eyewitness reported that the man had tried to pick the flower petals placed nearby. One Baljinder Singh claimed that he had broken two fingers of the youth. "When we asked him about his identity, he said he didn't know about himself, then the sangat began hitting him with iron bangles on his head and he died," he added. Meanwhile, activists of many Sikh religious organisations gathered outside the Golden Temple and staged a dharna, demanding to see the corpse. Reacting to the sacrilege, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Harjinder Singh Dhami said, "There is a conspiracy behind this and some forces are trying to vitiate the peaceful atmosphere of Punjab. The incident needs to be investigated." When asked who would gain by such a plot, he said, "I don't want to say who will be benefited. The incident had severely hurt the Sikh religious sentiments, but thankfully the Singh sahib didn't let the recital be disrupted." He said he had asked both the SGPC employees as well as police to check the CCTV footage and thoroughly investigate the incident. When asked about the killing of the person allegedly responsible for the blasphemy, he said, "People take action in self-defence also. In this case, Sikhs' religious sentiments were hurt and they had to react." Wondering why such incidents kept happening, Dhami said that in the recent past SGPC sewadars had nabbed a person who had thrown the holy gutka into the sarovar of Golden Temple. The SGPC president, in a release issued late Saturday evening said, "During the recitation of Sodar Rehras Sahib today, a man jumped over the safety grill and entered the sanctum sanctorum and picked up the sword kept in front of Sri Guru Granth Sahib, but he was apprehended by the sewadars on duty, and died due to beating by the sangat." He alleged that it was unfortunate that instead of exposing the forces working behind the culprits who had been arrested in the past, they were released after being declared as mentally ill. "It is the failure of the governments and agencies who could not reach the people working behind such culprits," he added Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said it and it cuuld be a deliberate act during the election times, and the government or the culprit would be responsible if the sangat kills the culprits of sacrilege. "It is a very unfortunate incident, even a few days back someone had thrown the pages of gutka sahib in the sarovar of Golden Temple and again an insane person tried the sacrilege," he said President of SAD(D) Paramjit Singh Sarna said, "I appreciate the promptness with which the youth was nabbed and the continuation of recital of paath by the granthi, and at the same time I justify the killing of the person responsible for blasphemous act." Former president of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) Manjit Singh GK said. "This person deserved capital punishment, but the legal way." He also sought a detailed inquiry to get to the bottom of the conspiracy, if any. Former acting president of DSGMC turned BJP leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa said, "The incident has sent shock waves throughout the world as never in the history of Darbar Sahib has such an attempt been made." He alleged that the failure of the Congress government to solve sacrilege cases has resulted in repeat of such incidents. He said that it should also be probed why such incidents occur at the time when elections are round the corner and should be condemned in strongest possible words.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/amritsar-youth-beaten-to-death-for-sacrilege-at-golden-temple/articleshow/88366400.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Officials said that squads would be deployed at every ward to take action against violators. BMC said that in closed spaces, people up to 50% capacity of the place will be allowed. In open spaces, up to 25% of the capacity of the space will be allowed. If a gathering with over 1,000 people is planned, prior permission of the disaster management authority is mandatory. Only those fully vaccinated will be allowed at public places, including in public transport. All hotels, restaurants, cinema halls, malls and other government and private establishments have been asked to strictly abide by rules. “Full vaccination of all employees functioning at public places/ establishments and all attendees at events/ ceremonies is a must. Action will be taken against the establishment if the rule is found to be violated,” the BMC said, adding that proper use of masks, hand hygiene, maintaining safe distance, regular cleaning and disinfection of all premises / rooms / toilets are a must. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal appealed to citizens to avoid Christmas and New Year parties and said that Omicron is spreading rapidly around the world, putting a strain on the health system. “Despite repeated appeals, it has been observed that guidelines are not being followed properly in most places, especially at wedding ceremonies and other ceremonies,” said BMC in a statement, adding that eminent personalities, celebrities who have an influence on society also need to be aware of the issues and act accordingly. Last week, actors Kareena Kapoor, Amrita Arora and actor Sohail Khan’s wife Seema Khan tested positive for Covid-19 following a gathering at filmmaker Karan Johar’s home. Later, actor Sanjay Kapoor’s wife Maheep and her daughter Shanaya also tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-squads-to-keep-eye-on-festive-dos-in-omicron-time/articleshow/88363270.cms||Richa Pinto

Leading virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang, professor at the Christian Medical College (CMC), said the institution was nearing the end of its study on heterologous doses. "After the effectiveness of heterologous vaccine doses is known, particularly if boosters with heterologous platforms broaden the immune response and the ability to neutralise a broader range of variants, it will help understand its effect on new variants, too," she told TOI on Saturday. In heterologous doses' trial, a participant receives Covaxin followed by Covishield or vice versa. Covaxin is an inactivated vaccine and Covishield is a nonreplicating viral vector vaccine. The Drug Controller General of India had approved the trial of heterologous vaccine doses at CMC in July. The trial commenced in August to evaluate this combination as opposed to the current policy of both doses being the same vaccine. Lead scientist and researcher Dr Winsley Rose told TOI that the objective of the trial was to study the safety and immunogenicity (antibodies produced and its effectiveness) of heterologous vaccines against the same two-dose vaccine.

Top Indian hospitality companies say the Omicron fear has led to many rich Indians cancelling their plans to usher in the New Year in foreign locales. They are now scouring for whatever good property is available at any given rate in destinations like Goa, Rajasthan and the popular hill resorts — sea, sand and snow. Tariffs are back to, if not higher than, pre-Covid 2019 levels in leisure destinations. Even city hotels are seeing healthy occupancies thanks to weddings and the new desi trend of a staycation or local people checking into a hotel for a few days, say hoteliers. Travel portal MakeMyTrip (MMT) says its latest booking data shows “nearly 35% growth in the premium and luxury hotels segment” compared to pre-pandemic levels. “Leisure holiday bookings for Christmas and year-end travel are picking up again after a knee-jerk reaction following the first few days of Omicron news. People are back to actively planning and booking road trips to drivable destinations…. the advance booking window has become shorter with people booking closer to the date of travel,” MMT spokesperson said. Puneet Dhawan, French hospitality major Accor’s senior VP (operations) India and South Asia, told TOI: “The ongoing holiday season has seen hotels in India return to pre-Covid 2019 levels, both in terms of occupancy and tariffs. The impact of Omicron has been in terms of some MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions) travel being deferred. But individual holidayers are travelling as per planned and all hotels in leisure destinations are almost sold out till the first week of January.” A leading hotelier in Udaipur said the current average five-star tariff is about Rs 19-21,000, up from Rs 11-12,000 before the peak season kicked in. “In pre-Covid times, peak season rates would go upup tos 15-16,000 daily in five stars but now the city of lakes is seeing upup tos 21,000 due to the demand,” the hotelier said. Such is the demand for leisure destinations, says Travel Agent Federation of India joint secretary Anil Kalsi, that at this point the brave may find it cheaper to go Sri Lanka than Goa even after factoring in Covid test charges. Working the math for someone planning a trip around the New Year, say December 29, for four nights/five days, Kalsi said: “Delhi-Goa return airfare would be about Rs 25,000 and return Colombo return is Rs 48,000. Yet hotel stays for four nights in a 5 star in Goa costs Rs 2 lakh, while Colombo comes for 80-90,000 only.” Before the news of Omicron came in last week of November, luxury hotels in leisure destinations had started seeing a few foreign tourists trickle in but that has not stopped due to stricter testing and quarantine rules globally. “We used to mainly see senior citizen foreign tourists. In the second half of November (when India allowed foreign tourists on non-charters) we saw some relatively young foreigners in the age group of 35-45,” said the GM of a leading luxury property in Rajasthan. Due to Omicron's concern the preference, like last year, is to drive to nearby destinations. The “preference for drivable destinations (has) increased significantly during this period. We (have) noticed a 30%-40% jump in bookings from 2019,” the MMT spokesperson said. The travel industry, like the overall economy, is keeping fingers firmly crossed that the revival continues and that Covid soon enters its endemic stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/foreign-trips-nixed-hotels-in-india-see-best-ever-season/articleshow/88366438.cms||Saurabh Sinha

This will be more than three times the number of public grievances that the central government agencies disposed of during October when the government carried out a similar drive on mission mode, a senior official said. Junior personnel minister Jitendra Singh, who will launch the campaign on Monday, said all the 760 districts will be listed on one portal. The campaign will go up to tehsil level. Singh said while only 2 lakh complaints were logged in the Centralised Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System, an online platform available to citizens 24x7 to lodge their grievances during 2014, the number has increased to 25 lakh now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-1-week-govt-aims-to-resolve-10-lakh-public-grievance-cases/articleshow/88366440.cms||---

Soon after miscreants resorted to stone-pelting, police arrested 23 Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) workers for instigating violence and attempting to set ablaze a police vehicle. The arrested include prominent MES member Shubham Shelke. Four separate cases have been registered against them in three police stations. Police also imposed Section 144 from 6am on Saturday till 6am on Monday in the city and taluk areas. Meanwhile, shops and hotels owned by Kannada-speaking people in Maharashtra's Kolhapur were shut on Saturday, while vehicles with Karnataka registration plates faced the wrath of people protesting over the alleged desecration. According to police, around 11:30pm on Friday, over 100 MES members gathered at Sambhaji Circle at Ramalingakinda Galli, demanding arrest of miscreants who had allegedly smeared ink on Shivaji's statue in Bengaluru. The MES activists, led by Shelke, began shouting anti-Kannada slogans, while initially targeting lodges owned by Kannadigas, even as a team of police landed at the spot. DCP (law and order) Vikram Amte tried to broker peace with the protesters, but the mob started pelting stones and tried to torch a police vehicle. Police had to resort to baton-charge to disperse the violent mob. The decades old border dispute over Belagavi between Maharashtra and Karnataka is seen as the undercurrent that connected the untoward incidents. Condemning the incidents as unruly, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai directed home minister Araga Jnanendra to take strict action against those trying to disturb peace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/desecration-of-statues-sparks-spat-between-karnataka-maharashtra/articleshow/88366441.cms||---
